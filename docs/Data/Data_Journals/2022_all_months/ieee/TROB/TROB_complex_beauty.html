We tackle the problem using geometrically consistent variable-stiffness impedance control for safe wrench regulation using the concept of energy tanks, where both the modeling and the control are carried out in the port Hamiltonian framework. We exploit previous well-known results in the literature of ground manipulators and extend them to be applied for novel and challenging aerial physical interaction with a focus on quasi-static applications. The energy-awareness of the presented control method guarantees the stability of the aerial robot in both free-flight and in-contact scenarios together with a level of safety in the case of contact-loss with the unknown environment. Furthermore, by utilizing bond graphs we demonstrate how the closed-loop passivity can be graphically conducted. The validity of our proposed approach is shown via several experiments. We also provide several insights on how the proposed framework could be extended to a generic dynamic aerial physical interaction.},

Nevertheless, it is important to correctly translate high-level decision into low-level control inputs in order to avoid an unstable behavior due to a naive implementation of the autonomy. In this article, we propose an energy-based architecture for shared autonomy that allows to reproduce as closely as possible the desired behavior, while ensuring a robust stability of the robotic system.

Unfortunately, this gives rise to certain control actions that lead to the loss of the safety-critical passivity feature. To deal with this problem, we employ the concept of virtual energy tanks that keep track of the passivity violating energy in the system, ensuring that it remains bounded. This restores the passivity in the system, which guarantees the stable interaction with any passive environment. Furthermore, we augment our controller with an additional safety layer, which ensures that the energy injected through the tank into the system remains below a safe limit, defined based on the maximum kinetic energy allowed in the system. Finally, our approach is validated in terms of performance during task execution and safety both in simulations and on real-robot hardware.},

This defines a framework in which we ablate the choice of the components, which are the selection of the cost function, the optimization of policies using dropout, and an improved data efficiency through the use of structured kernels in the GP models. The combination of the aforementioned aspects affects dramatically the performance of MC-PILCO. Numerical comparisons in a simulated cart–pole environment show that MC-PILCO exhibits better data efficiency and control performance w.r.t. state-of-the-art GP-based MBRL algorithms. Finally, we apply MC-PILCO to real systems, considering, in particular, systems with partially measurable states.

  abstract     = {The fish-like robot is one of the typical underwater robots, which has the advantage of high maneuverability with low noise due to its bioinspired structure and biomimetic locomotion. However, it is challenging to efficiently design motion controllers for such robots to achieve satisfactory performance on specific control tasks in the real underwater environment, since the complex fluid-structure interaction exists during their swimming and exact dynamic models are absent. In this article, we propose a learning framework, incorporating a simulation system and a training methodology, to autonomously and fast train in simulation to create control policies that are capable of directly applying to a type of physical fish-like robots to perform motion control tasks. First, we construct a simulation system combining a data-driven environment and a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based environment, thus well balancing the simulation accuracy and the calculation speed. Second, we design a training methodology to train deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based policies for the robot in our constructed simulation system to perform a specific control task. Then, we use two typical motion control tasks to verify our proposed framework. One is the path-following control task, which is a one-objective problem with dense rewards, while the other is the pose control task which is a two-objective problem with sparse rewards. For each task, the DRL-based control policy trained by our learning framework is directly deployed on the physical fish-like robot to perform the task in the real world. Experimental results show that the policies trained in simulation still work well in the real world, and perform even better in terms of control accuracy and stability compared with the traditional control methods, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of our learning framework.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic tasks such as table tennis are relatively easy to learn for humans, but pose significant challenges to robots. Such tasks require accurate control of fast movements and precise timing in the presence of imprecise state estimation of the flying ball and the robot. Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in learning complex control tasks from data. However, applying step-based RL to dynamic tasks on real systems is safety-critical as RL requires exploring and failing safely for millions of time steps in high-speed and high-acceleration regimes. This article demonstrates that using robot arms driven by pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) enables safe end-to-end learning of table tennis using model-free RL. In particular, we learn from scratch for thousands of trials while a stochastic policy acts on the low-level controls of the real system. The robot returns and smashes real balls with $5 $ ms −1 and $12 $ ms −1 on average, respectively, to a desired landing point. Additionally, we present hybrid sim and real training (HYSR), a practical procedure that avoids training with real balls by virtually replaying recorded ball trajectories and applying actions to the real robot. To the best of authors’ knowledge, this work pioneers (i) failsafe learning of a safety-critical dynamic task using anthropomorphic robot arms, (ii) learning a precision-demanding problem with a PAM-driven system that is inherently hard to control as well as (iii) train a robot to play table tennis without real balls.},

To address this problem, we propose a novel rigid and soft coupling variable stiffness module that employs a folded plate mechanism (FPM) to provide rigid multidirectional loading and combines it with particle jamming to achieve local variable stiffness with the characteristics of a finger grasping structure. Hence, a variable stiffness multidirectional soft grasping robot is developed to realize soft grasping and multidirectional rigid loading. The bending and stiffness control of the variable stiffness soft gripper is realized by a double-layer pneumatic driving structure with the advantages of simple control and corresponding speed. Moreover, good self-recovery is achieved with the soft outer layer since the particles can quickly return to the initial state due to partitioning of the FPM. Finally, prototype experiments verify its strong adaptability and stable multidirectional grasping ability, and experimental results show that the maximum grasping weight in each direction can be increased by more than three times with the variable stiffness.},

Robots that work in water need to minimize the number of drive components to improve reliability and reduce communication pressure, our unique design enables the robot to rely on a kind of propulsion device named propeller-leg to have the ability to run rapidly in the seaside and seabed, and swim with multi-degrees-of-freedom in the water (such a propulsion system contains only four driving elements), and it can make the robot complete more work content and improve its adaptability to the environment. Running is more stable than swimming and will not disturb the animals in the water, but when the robot encounters a high obstacle with a large area coverage, switching the motion mode to the swimming mode can pass directly over obstacles instead of detouring or giving up work, this can improve work efficiency. We analyzed and optimized propeller-leg by simulation combined with the open water test, the propeller-leg&#39;s thrust in the water before and after optimization differs by 400\% according to the test results. We optimized the minimum difference between the forward and reverse thrust of the propeller-leg to improve the stability of the robot movement process and optimized the difference from 25\% to 3\%. This article provides sufficient technical details and completeness, and through a series of performance evaluation experiments validated that the SHOALBOT has excellent movement ability in the amphibious environment compared with other published amphibious robots of the same size.},

In this article, we present a general framework on the design, kinematic modeling, model-based characterization, and control for a class of soft parallel robots. The designed soft parallel robot consists of three fiber-reinforced soft pneumatic actuators, a base stage, and an output stage. With the introduction of the mathematical toolkit of the absolute nodal coordinate formulation, we develop a continuum-based model to describe and parameterize both the global complex configuration and the local large deformation of the soft parallel robot. In this sense, the mappings among the defined kinematic spaces of the robot can be characterized through force analysis. Based on the developed model, we next analyze the robot’s workspace and stiffness with different design parameters, which are also verified by a set of experiments. Finally, we establish a model-based trajectory tracking controller for the soft parallel robot. The experimental results demonstrate that with the feedforward controller, the end effector of the soft parallel robot can well follow the desired trajectories under different output velocities, where the average positioning error is about 2.6–3.9\% of the maximum length of the workspace.},

However, at present, compared to LiDAR point clouds, in common application scenes of mobile robots, mmWave radar point clouds have shortcomings such as sparsity and containing many “ghost” targets. Therefore, in this article, we analyze the reasons that cause these problems and propose a new method for point cloud generation as well as a new evaluation metric. After building a new dataset and carrying out experiments in real-world scenes, our method shows better performance on the quality of radar point clouds compared to other methods.

  abstract     = {Accurate and reliable sensor calibration is essential to fuse LiDAR and inertial measurements, which are usually available in robotic applications. In this article, we propose a novel LiDAR-IMU calibration method within the continuous-time batch-optimization framework, where the intrinsics of both sensors and the spatial-temporal extrinsics between sensors are calibrated without using calibration infrastructure, such as fiducial tags. Compared to discrete-time approaches, the continuous-time formulation has natural advantages for fusing high-rate measurements from LiDAR and IMU sensors. To improve efficiency and address degenerate motions, the following two observability-aware modules are leveraged: first, The information-theoretic data selection policy selects only the most informative segments for calibration during data collection, which significantly improves the calibration efficiency by processing only the selected informative segments. Second, the observability-aware state update mechanism in nonlinear least-squares optimization updates only the identifiable directions in the state space with truncated singular value decomposition, which enables accurate calibration results even under degenerate cases where informative data segments are not available. The proposed LiDAR-IMU calibration approach has been validated extensively in both simulated and real-world experiments with different robot platforms, demonstrating its high accuracy and repeatability in commonly-seen human-made environments.},

  abstract     = {Directional sensors, such as video cameras, have become ubiquitous to many autonomous robots applications, such as monitoring and surveillance. The performance of these sensors and processing algorithms, however, may be hindered by the presence of objects that block visibility. This article presents a novel approach for planning the path of a mobile directional sensor deployed to observe multiple targets distributed in an environment populated with multiple obstacles and occlusions. Unlike existing art gallery or watchman’s route methods, the visibility theory and motion planners developed in this article account for both line-of-sight visibility and bounded field-of-view constraints, and can provide obstacle avoidance based on robot geometry and kinodynamic constraints. The computational complexity analysis and experiments on a camera-equipped drone demonstrate that, despite the challenging geometric characteristics of directional C-targets, the approach scales to real-world problems. Furthermore, when compared to algorithms inspired by traveling salesman and target coverage approaches, the directional visibility planners presented in this article are significantly more effective both at guaranteeing complete target visibility and at minimizing distance traveled.},

We propose a fundamentally different approach for occupancy mapping, in which the boundary between occupied and free space is viewed as the decision boundary of a machine learning classifier. This work generalizes a kernel perceptron model which maintains a very sparse set of support vectors to represent the environment boundaries efficiently. We develop a probabilistic formulation based on relevance vector machines, handling measurement noise, and probabilistic occupancy classification, supporting autonomous navigation. We provide an online training algorithm, updating the sparse Bayesian map incrementally from streaming range data, and an efficient collision-checking method for general curves, representing potential robot trajectories.

In this work, we present an approach based on control barrier functions (CBFs) to enforce both energy sufficiency (ensuring that no robot runs out of battery) and coordination constraints (guaranteeing mutual exclusive use of an available charging station) in a mission agnostic fashion. Moreover, we investigate the system capacity in terms of the relation between individual robot properties and the limit on temporal separation requirements within charging cycles.

  abstract     = {As a parametric polynomial curve family, Bézier curves are widely used in safe and smooth motion design of intelligent robotic systems from flying drones to autonomous vehicles to robotic manipulators. In such motion planning settings, the critical features of high-order Bézier curves such as curve length, distance-to-collision, maximum curvature/velocity/acceleration are either numerically computed at a high computational cost or inexactly approximated by discrete samples. To address these issues, in this article we present a novel computationally efficient approach for adaptive approximation of high-order Bézier curves by multiple low-order Bézier segments at any desired level of accuracy that is specified in terms of a Bézier metric. Accordingly, we introduce a new Bézier degree reduction method, called parameterwise matching reduction , which approximates Bézier curves more accurately compared to the standard least squares and Taylor reduction methods. We also propose a new Bézier metric, called the maximum control-point distance , that can be computed analytically, has a strong equivalence relation with other existing Bézier metrics, and defines a geometric relative bound between Bézier curves. We provide extensive numerical evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Bézier approximation approach. As a rule of thumb, based on the degree-one matching reduction error, we conclude that an $ n^{\rm{th}} $ -order Bézier curve can be accurately approximated by $3(n-1)$ quadratic and $6(n-1)$ linear Bézier segments, which is fundamental for Bézier discretization.},

  abstract     = {Bidirectional path and motion planning approaches decrease planning time, on average, compared to their unidirectional counterparts. In single-query feasible motion planning, using bidirectional search to find a continuous motion plan requires an edge connection between the forward search tree and the reverse search tree. Such a tree–tree connection requires solving a two-point boundary value problem (BVP). However, obtaining a closed-form two-point BVP solution can be difficult or impossible for many systems. While numerical methods can provide a reasonable solution in many cases, they are often computationally expensive, numerically unstable, or sensitive (to an initial guess) for the purposes of single-query sampling-based motion planning. To overcome this challenge, we present a novel bidirectional search strategy that does not require solving the two-point BVP. Instead of connecting the forward and reverse trees directly, the reverse tree’s cost information is used as a guiding heuristic for forward search. This enables the forward search to quickly grow down the reverse tree—converging to a fully feasible solution without a direct tree–tree connection and without the solution to a two-point BVP. In this article, we propose two algorithms that use this strategy for single-query feasible motion planning for various dynamical systems, performing experiments in both simulation and hardware testbeds. We find that these algorithms perform better than or comparable to the existing state-of-the-art methods with respect to quickly finding an initial feasible solution.},

In this context, we propose Implicit Control, an approach that leverages numerical analysis theory to find suitable herding inputs even when the nonlinearities in the evaders’ dynamics yield implicit equations . The intuition behind this methodology consists in driving the input, rather than computing it, toward the unknown value that achieves the desired dynamic behavior of the herd. The same idea is exploited to develop an adaptation law, with stability guarantees, that copes with uncertainties in the herd’s models. Moreover, our solution is completed with a novel caging technique based on uncertainty models and control barrier functions, together with a distributed estimator to overcome the need of complete perfect measurements. Different simulations and experiments validate the generality and flexibility of the proposal.},

Specifically, motivated by “lazy collision checking” methods in robotics, we first prune and relax the NBA by removing all negative atomic propositions, which simplifies the planning problem by checking constraint satisfaction only when needed. Then, we extract sequences of subtasks from the relaxed NBA along with their temporal orders and formulate a mixed integer linear program to allocate these subtasks to robots. Finally, we define generalized multirobot path planning problems to obtain low-level paths that satisfy both the high-level task allocation and the constraints captured by the negative atomic propositions in the original NBA. We show that our method is complete for a subclass of LTL that covers a broad range of tasks and present numerical simulations demonstrating that it can generate paths with lower cost, considerably faster than existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Applications of large-scale mobile multirobot systems can be beneficial over monolithic robots because of higher potential for robustness and scalability. Developing controllers for multirobot systems is challenging because the multitude of interactions is hard to anticipate and difficult to model. Automatic design using machine learning or evolutionary robotics seem to be options to avoid that challenge, but bring the challenge of designing reward or fitness functions. Generic reward and fitness functions seem unlikely to exist and task-specific rewards often have undesired side effects. Approaches of so-called innate motivation try to avoid the specific formulation of rewards and work instead with different drivers, such as curiosity. Our approach to innate motivation is to minimize surprise, which we implement by maximizing the accuracy of the swarm robot’s sensor predictions using neuroevolution. A unique advantage of the swarm robot case is that swarm members populate the robot’s environment and can trigger more active behaviors in a self-referential loop. In this article, we summarize our previous simulation-based results concerning behavioral diversity, robustness, scalability, and engineered self-organization, and put them into context. In several new studies, we analyze the influence of the optimizer’s hyperparameters, the scalability of evolved behaviors, and the impact of realistic robot simulations. Finally, we present results using real robots that show how the reality gap can be bridged.},

We present a tether-based strategy that achieves closed-loop swarm-motion control by using a secondary team of mobile sensors. These sensors form a wireless tether that allows the swarm to indirectly sense a home base or a landmark, and to compensate for the accumulated motion errors via a closed-loop control strategy. The proposed strategy is the first to use a tether of mobile sensors that can dynamically reshape and reconnect to various points in the environment to achieve closed-loop motion control. The novelty of the strategy is in its ability to adapt to any swarm motion considered, and to be applied to swarms with limited sensing capabilities and knowledge of their environment. The performance of the proposed strategy was validated through extensive experiments.},

Byzantine agents can send arbitrary estimates to their neighbors, which may disrupt the convergence of normal agents to the optimum state. We show that if every normal agent combines its neighbors’ estimates (states) such that the aggregated state is in the convex hull of its normal neighbors’ states, then the resilient convergence is guaranteed. To assure this sufficient condition, we propose a resilient aggregation rule based on the notion of centerpoint , which is a generalization of the median in the higher-dimensional Euclidean space. We evaluate our results using examples of target pursuit and pattern recognition in multirobot systems. The evaluation results demonstrate that distributed learning with average, coordinate-wise median, and geometric median-based aggregation rules fail to converge to the optimum state, whereas the centerpoint-based aggregation rule is resilient in the same scenario.},

The system is large-scale and underactuated, making the control strategy at the microscopic particle level infeasible. We consider the Kolmogorov forward equation associated to the stochastic process of the single particle to encode the macroscopic behavior of the particles swarm. The control inputs shape the velocity field of the density dynamics according to the physical model of the actuators. We find the optimal actuation considering an optimal control problem whose state dynamics is governed by a linear parabolic advection–diffusion equation where the control induces a transport field. From a theoretical standpoint, we show the existence of a solution to the resulting nonlinear optimal control problem. From a numerical standpoint, we employ the discrete adjoint method to accurately compute the reduced gradient and we show how it commutes with the optimize-then-discretize approach.

The kinematics, statics, and performances of the adaptive thumb mechanism and the spherical mechanism are analyzed. Experimental validation is performed to test the workspace, self-alignment, interaction forces, admittance controller, and grasping assistance performance of the exoskeleton. The workspace and self-aligning experiments prove that the proposed exoskeleton can achieve a large workspace of the thumb joints and realize self-alignment. The interaction force experimental results show that the exoskeleton can reduce the tangential interaction forces by 76.8\% and improve comfort. Finally, the control and delicate grasping assistance experiments validate the exoskeleton’s ability to realize the delicate grasping of the thumb.

  abstract     = {Robotic exploration under uncertain environments is challenging when optical information is not available. In this article, we propose an autonomous solution of exploring an unknown task space based on tactile sensing alone. We first designed a whisker sensor based on MEMS barometer devices. This sensor can acquire contact information by interacting with the environment nonintrusively. This sensor is accompanied by a planning technique to generate exploration trajectories by using mere tactile perception. This technique relies on a hybrid policy for tactile exploration, which includes a proactive informative path planner for object searching, and a reactive Hopf oscillator for contour tracing. Results indicate that the hybrid exploration policy can increase the efficiency of object discovery. Last, scene understanding was facilitated by segmenting objects and classification. A classifier was developed to recognize the object categories based on the geometric features collected by the whisker sensor. Such an approach demonstrates the whisker sensor, together with the tactile intelligence, can provide sufficiently discriminative features to distinguish objects.},

  abstract     = {Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) is an inferential imaging technique that has been utilized to develop large-scale robotic skin due to its scalable and practical properties. The performance of ERT-based sensors has been improved by optimizing the electrode arrangement, but it has relied on a heuristic design due to an absence of quantitative studies on the effects of the electrode arrangement. This article introduces a novel design method to optimize an electrode arrangement for ERT-based robotic skins. The method is based on a neural-gas network, and it finds an optimal design that maximizes the minimum electric current density. The optimal design was comprehensively evaluated using the ERT forward model, and the result revealed that the optimal design achieved the best intrinsic properties in terms of ill-posedness, sensitivity, and spatial discriminability. For validation, we conducted an indentation experiment on ERT-based robotic skin with the optimal design. Although only 30 electrodes were used to cover the 700 cm 2 sensing area, physical contacts could be localized with an error of 6.6 ± 3.5 mm, and the two-point resolution was adequate for daily tasks. Finally, the developed robotic skin was integrated with a commercial robot arm, and its use in physical human–robot interaction was demonstrated.},

At present, haptic gloves are mainly driven by conventional motors, and for them, being lightweight, low cost, low in power consumption, and intrinsically safe to operators are challenging. Here, we designed a haptic glove (So-EAGlove) integrating a flexible electrostatic adhesive brake to resist human fingers with a tunable braking force and render a softness sensation. This glove weighs only 51 g, but is capable of simulating objects in a large range of Young&#39;s modulus from 540 Pa to 5.4 MPa. The electrostatic adhesive brake costs only approximately 2.43 mW during operation, i.e., more than three days powered by a small button battery. We built a feedforward control model and evaluated its performance. Experimental results show that this glove can generate an accurate force to follow the force-displacement profile of the corresponding real objects. The error is less than 7\%, barely noticeable by the subjects. The subjective tests also demonstrate that little statistical difference exists between the real objects and the virtual objects for the subjects.},

To solve the issues of observability, complicated initialization, insufficient accuracy, and lack of global consistency, we introduce an omnidirectional perception front end in Omni-swarm. It consists of stereo wide-field-of-view cameras and UWB sensors, visual–inertial odometry, multidrone map-based localization, and visual drone tracking algorithms. The measurements from the front end are fused with graph-based optimization in the back end. The proposed method achieves centimeter-level relative state estimation accuracy while guaranteeing global consistency in the aerial swarm, as evidenced by the experimental results. Moreover, supported by Omni-swarm, interdrone collision avoidance can be accomplished without any external devices, demonstrating the potential of Omni-swarm as the foundation of autonomous aerial swarms.},

The comparisons are performed in both simulation and real-world environments to systematically evaluate both methods from the aspect of tracking accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. We show the superiority of the NMPC in tracking dynamically infeasible trajectories, at the cost of higher computation time and risk of numerical convergence issues. For both methods, we also quantitatively study the effect of adding an inner loop controller using the incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion method, and the effect of adding an aerodynamic drag model. Our real-world experiments, performed in one of the world’s largest motion capture systems, demonstrate more than 78\% tracking error reduction of both NMPC and DFBC, indicating the necessity of using an inner loop controller and aerodynamic drag model for agile trajectory tracking.},

State-of-the-art solutions split the problem into a planning task—where a global time-optimal trajectory is generated—and a control task—where this trajectory is accurately tracked. However, at the current state, generating a time-optimal trajectory that considers the full quadrotor model requires solving a difficult time allocation problem via optimization, which is computationally demanding (in the order of minutes or even hours). This is detrimental for replanning in the presence of disturbances. We overcome this issue by solving the time allocation problem and the control problem concurrently via Model Predictive Contouring Control (MPCC). Our MPCC optimally selects the future states of the platform at runtime, while maximizing the progress along the reference path and minimizing the distance to it. We show that, even when tracking simplified trajectories, the proposed MPCC results in a path that approaches the true time-optimal one, and which can be generated in real time. We validate our approach in the real world, where we show that our method outperforms both the current state of the art and a world-class human pilot in terms of lap time achieving speeds of up to 60 km/h.},

To solve the nonconvex QPEPs, a Gröbner-basis method is investigated to derive their globally optimal and robust solutions. Furthermore, we develop the rules for characterizing the solvability and observability of these solutions. In addition, the uncertainty description, i.e., covariance matrix, as an important piece of information in robotic state estimation frameworks, is analyzed in detail. Theoretical results show that the covariance can be estimated via online optimization, in an efficient and unbiased manner. In this way, both the solution and covariance are guaranteed to be globally optimal. Through simulations and experiments, we show that the proposed QPEP-based solver is not only accurate, robust, and efficient but outperforms the representatives for covariance estimation. The designed algorithms are also assembled as a C++/MATLAB/Octave/ROS library, while these developed interfaces are built for main stream platforms and simultaneous localization and mapping schemes.},

This article focuses on the cover skeleton and addresses the challenging problems of node design, system modeling, motor positioning, and control design of the morphing system. The cover modeling focuses on kinematics, and a systematic approach for defining the system kinematic constraints is presented. Then, we apply genetic algorithms to find the motor locations so that the morphing cover is fully actuated. Finally, we present control algorithms that allow the cover to morph into a time-varying shape. The entire approach is validated by performing kinematic simulations with four different covers of square dimensions and having $3\times 3$ , $4\times 8$ , $8\times 8$ , and $20\times 20$ nodes, respectively. For each cover, we apply the genetic algorithms to choose the motor locations and perform simulations for tracking a desired shape.

  abstract     = {Isolated mechanical systems—e.g., those floating in space, in free-fall, or on a frictionless surface—are able to achieve net rotation by cyclically changing their shape, even if they have no net angular momentum. Similarly, swimmers immersed in “perfect fluids” are able to use cyclic shape changes to both translate and rotate even if the swimmer-fluid system has no net linear or angular momentum. Finally, systems fully constrained by direct nonholonomic constraints (e.g., passive wheels) can push against these constraints to move through the world. Previous work has demonstrated that the displacement induced by these shape changes corresponds to the amount of constraint curvature that the gaits enclose. Properly assessing or optimizing the utility of a gait also requires considering the time or resources required to execute it: A gait that produces a small displacement per cycle, but that can be executed in a short time, may produce a faster average velocity than a gait that produces more displacement, but takes longer to complete a cycle at the same instantaneous effort. In this paper, we consider gaits under two instantaneous measures of effort. For each of these costs, we demonstrate that fixing the average instantaneous cost to a unit value allows us to transform the effort costs into time-to-execute costs for any given gait cycle. We then illustrate how the interaction between the constraint curvature and these costs leads to characteristic geometries for optimal cycles, in which the gait trajectories resemble elastic hoops distended from within by internal pressures.},

The basis of the framework is a novel trajectory representation built upon our novel optimality conditions for unconstrained control effort minimization. We design linear-complexity operations on this representation to conduct spatial–temporal deformation under various planning requirements. Smooth maps are utilized to exactly eliminate geometrical constraints in a lightweight fashion. A variety of state-input constraints are supported by the decoupling of dense constraint evaluation from sparse parameterization and the backward differentiation of flatness map. As a result, this framework transforms a generally constrained multicopter planning problem into an unconstrained optimization that can be solved reliably and efficiently. Our framework bridges the gaps among solution quality, planning efficiency, and constraint fidelity for a multicopter with limited resources and maneuvering capability. Its generality and robustness are both demonstrated by applications to different flight tasks. Extensive simulations and benchmarks are also conducted to show its capability of generating high-quality solutions while retaining the computation speed against other specialized methods by orders of magnitude.},

  abstract     = {Planetary rovers may traverse terrains with complex geometries and variable physical properties, but their mobility behaviors are complicated and difficult to simulate precisely. This article focuses on high-fidelity dynamic modeling and simulation for a type of rovers that incorporate single-input-multi-output joints to enhance terrain adaptability, which has been used on China&#39;s Tianwen-1 Mars rover. A novel multibody dynamic model and its solutions are derived first with consideration of single-input-multi-output joints. Then, a unified terramechanics model is proposed, considering variable terrain surfaces and covering rover&#39;s motion states of skidding, slipping, and steering, solved the problem of simulation instability caused by model switching between soft and hard terrains. As the contact areas of wheels with various terrains and resultant sinkage are dominant factors to ensure fidelity but difficult to determine, a new terrain modeling method for calculating contact area and wheel sinkage is developed using digital elevation map with physical properties. A simulation system is developed, integrating all the above models, and verified with physical experiments and commercial software. The relative simulation errors that have been achieved are less than 5.9\% for bogie angles, 6.1\% for drawbar pull, and 3.4\% for slip ratios, demonstrating high fidelity simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Camera–inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor fusion has been extensively studied in recent decades. Numerous observability analysis and fusion schemes for motion estimation with self-calibration have been presented. However, it has been uncertain whether the intrinsic parameters of both the camera and the IMU are observable under general motion. To answer this question, by using the Lie derivatives, we first prove that for a rolling shutter (RS) camera–IMU system, all the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, camera time offset, and readout time of the RS camera are observable with an unknown landmark. To our knowledge, we are the first to present such a proof. Next, to validate this analysis and to solve the drift issue of a structureless filter during standstills, we develop a keyframe-based sliding window filter (KSWF) for odometry and self-calibration, which works with a monocular RS camera or stereo RS cameras. Though the keyframe concept is widely used in vision-based sensor fusion, to our knowledge, the KSWF is the first of its kind to support self-calibration. Our simulation and real data tests have validated that it is possible to fully calibrate the camera–IMU system using the observations of opportunistic landmarks under diverse motion. Real data tests confirmed previous allusions that keeping landmarks in the state vector can remedy the drift in standstill and showed that the keyframe-based scheme is an alternative solution.},

While the LiDAR–camera calibration problem has been actively studied during the past few years, LiDAR–camera synchronization has been less studied and mainly addressed by employing a conventional pipeline consisting of clock synchronization and temporal synchronization. The conventional pipeline has certain potential limitations, which have not been sufficiently addressed and could be a bottleneck for the potential wide adoption of low-cost LiDAR–camera platforms. Different from the conventional pipeline, in this article, we propose the LiCaS3, the first deep-learning-based framework, for the LiDAR–camera synchronization task via self-supervised learning. The proposed LiCaS3 does not require hardware synchronization or extra annotations and can be deployed both online and offline.

Aerodynamic effects, including drag, lift, and Magnus forces, are modeled to describe the object’s flight. Observables are derived from combining dynamics with a camera projection model assuming two-view geometry, via the use of multiple quaternions. The state of the composed system can then be estimated via constrained Kalman filtering, to which a solution is presented for the case of multiple quadratic constraints. To keep track of appearing and disappearing visual features during flight, the estimation algorithm employs a graph matching-based technique to maintain a set of evolving hypotheses through evaluation, pruning, and addition. Experiments conducted over various objects have either provided validation against motions independently estimated using multiple accelerometers, or formed verification by matching flight images against projections based on the state estimates.},

The core of our framework is a monocular depth estimation module with a strong generalization capability for diverse scenes. It consists of two separate working modes to assist the localization and mapping. With a single monocular image input, the depth estimation module predicts a relative depth to help the localization module on improving the accuracy. With a sparse depth map and an RGB image input, the depth estimation module can generate accurate scale-consistent depth for dense mapping. Compared with current learning-based VO methods, our method demonstrates a stronger generalization ability to diverse scenes. More significantly, our framework is able to boost the performances of existing geometry-based VO methods by a large margin.},

We propose a pipeline for fast instance segmentation learning designed for robotic applications where data come in stream.

We also propose a training protocol that allows to shorten the training time by performing feature extraction during the data acquisition.

The generated maps contain full continuous distributional information about the geometric surfaces and semantic labels (e.g., chair, table, and wall). Our approach is based on online Gaussian process (GP) training and inference and avoids the complexity of GP classification by regressing a truncated signed distance function (TSDF) of the regions occupied by different semantic classes. Online regression is enabled through a sparse pseudo-point approximation of the GP posterior. To scale to large environments, we further consider spatial domain partitioning via a hierarchical tree structure with overlapping leaves. An extension to a multirobot setting is developed by having each robot execute its own online measurement update and then combine its posterior parameters via local weighted geometric averaging with those of its neighbors. This yields a distributed information processing architecture, in which the GP map estimates of all the robots converge to a common map of the environment while relying only on local one-hop communication. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the probabilistic metric-semantic mapping technique in 2-D and 3-D environments in both the single- and multirobot settings and in comparison to a deep TSDF neural network approach.},

We further create smooth motion fields around obstacles with edges (e.g., tables). Both obstacles and enclosures may be time-varying, i.e., moving, expanding, and shrinking. The technique enables a robot to navigate within enclosed corridors while avoiding static and moving obstacles. It was applied on an autonomous robot (QOLO) in a static complex indoor environment and tested in simulations with dense crowds. The final proof of concept was performed in an outdoor environment in Lausanne.

We focus on applications requiring the robots to jointly select actions, e.g., which trajectory to follow, among a set of available actions. Such applications are central in large-scale robotic applications, such as multirobot motion planning for target tracking. But the current attack-robust algorithms are centralized. In this article, we propose a general-purpose distributed algorithm toward robust optimization at scale, with local communications only. We name it distributed robust maximization ( DRM ). DRM proposes a divide-and-conquer approach that distributively partitions the problem among cliques of robots. Then, the cliques optimize in parallel, independently of each other. We prove DRM achieves a close-to-optimal performance. We demonstrate DRM ’s performance in Gazebo and MATLAB simulations, in scenarios of active target tracking with swarms of robots . In the simulations, DRM achieves computational speed-ups, being 1 to 2 orders faster than the centralized algorithms. Yet , it nearly matches the tracking performance of the centralized counterparts. Since, DRM overestimates the number of attacks in each clique, in this article, we also introduce an improved distributed robust maximization ( IDRM ) algorithm. IDRM infers the number of attacks in each clique less conservatively than DRM by leveraging three-hop neighboring communications. We verify IDRM improves DRM ’s performance in simulations.},

  abstract     = {This article provides a new decentralized approach to solve a perimeter defense problem (PDP). In a typical PDP, many intruders try to enter a territory, and a group of defenders operating both inside and on the perimeter protects the territory by capturing the intruders on the perimeter. The objective of the defenders is to detect and capture the intruders before they enter the territory. Defenders sense the intruders independently and compute their trajectories to capture all the intruders in a cooperative way. Each intruder is estimated to reach a specific location on the perimeter at a specific time, and this is considered as a spatiotemporal task to be handled by a defender. At any given time, the PDP is converted to a decentralized multirobot spatiotemporal multitask assignment (DMRST-MTA) problem. The cost of executing a task for a defender is defined by a composite cost function that includes both the spatial and temporal cost components. In this article, a modified decentralized consensus-based bundle algorithm is presented to solve the above spatiotemporal multitask assignment problem. The performance evaluation of the proposed approach is presented based on Monte Carlo studies, and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach under different scenarios. The robustness studies also show that the proposed approach is robust against uncertainties in the heading angles of the intruders. The performance comparison with the decentralized adaptive partitioning approach for the various arrival distributions of intruders clearly shows that DMRST-MTA is efficient.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of incorporating risk while making combinatorial decisions under uncertainty. We formulate a discrete submodular maximization problem for selecting a set using conditional value at risk (CVaR), a risk metric commonly used in financial analysis. While the CVaR has recently been used in the optimization of linear cost functions in robotics, we take the first step toward extending this to discrete submodular optimization and provide several positive results. Specifically, we propose the sequential greedy algorithm that provides an approximation guarantee on finding the maxima of the CVaR cost function under a matroid constraint. The approximation guarantee shows that the solution produced by our algorithm is within a constant factor of the optimal and an additive term that depends on the optimal. Our analysis uses the curvature of the submodular set function and proves that the algorithm runs in polynomial time. This formulates a number of combinatorial optimization problems that appear in robotics. We use two such problems, i.e., vehicle assignment under uncertainty for mobility on demand and sensor selection with failures for environmental monitoring, as case studies to demonstrate the efficacy of our formulation. We also study the problem of adaptive risk-aware submodular maximization. We design a heuristic solution that triggers the replanning only when certain conditions are satisfied, to eliminate unnecessary planning. In particular, for the online mobility-on-demand study, we propose an adaptive triggering assignment algorithm that triggers a new assignment only when it can potentially reduce the waiting time at demand locations. We verify the performance of the proposed algorithms through simulations.},

  abstract     = {Locomotion through rolling is attractive compared to other forms of locomotion thanks to uniform designs, high degree of mobility, dynamic stability, and self-recovery from collision. Despite previous efforts to design rolling soft systems, pneumatic and other soft actuators are often limited in terms of high-speed dynamics, system integration, and/or functionalities. Furthermore, mathematical description of the rolling dynamics for this type of robot and how the models can be used for speed control are often not mentioned. This article introduces a cylindrical-shaped shell-bulging rolling soft wheel that employs an array of 16 folded-HASEL actuators as a mean for improved rolling performance. The actuators represent the soft components with discrete forces that propel the wheel, whereas the wheel&#39;s frame is rigid but allows for smooth, continuous change in position and speed. We discuss the interplay between the electrical and mechanical design choices, the modeling of the wheel&#39;s hybrid (continuous and discrete) dynamic behavior, and the implementation of a model predictive controller (MPC) for the robot&#39;s speed. With the balance of several design factors, we show the wheel&#39;s ability to carry integrated hardware with a maximum rolling speed at 0.7 m/s (or 2.2 body lengths per second), despite its total weight of 979 g, allowing the wheel to outperform the existing rolling soft wheels with comparable weights and sizes. We also show that the MPC enables the wheel to accelerate and leverage its inherent braking capability to reach desired speeds—a critical function that did not exist in previous rolling soft systems.},

One solution for enhancing their environmental adaptability is to design a small-sized biomimetic robot capable of performing multiple motions. By capturing a decent representation of an actual rat ( rattus norvegicus ), we developed a small-sized quadruped robotic rat (SQuRo), which includes four limbs and one flexible spine. On the basis of the extracted key movement joints, SQuRo was subtly designed with a relatively elongated slim body (aspect ratio: 3.42) and smaller weight (220 g) compared with quadruped robots of the same scale. Accordingly, we propose a control framework for multimodal motion planning, and the appropriate control parameters were tuned through optimization with consideration to the stability and actuation limits. The results obtained through a series of experimental tests reveal that SQuRo achieves a superior motion performance compared with existing state-of-the-art small-sized quadruped robots. Remarkably, SQuRo has an extremely small turning radius (0.48 BL) and strong payload capacity (200 g), and it can recover from falls.},

  abstract     = {Legged robots have excellent terrestrial mobility for traversing diverse environments and, thus, have the potential to be deployed in a wide variety of scenarios. However, they are susceptible to falling and leg malfunction during locomotion. Although the use of a large number of legs can overcome these problems, it makes the body long and leads to many legs being constrained to contact with the ground to support the long body, which impedes maneuverability. To improve the locomotion maneuverability of such robots, this study focuses on dynamic instability, which induces rapid and large movement changes, and uses a 12-legged robot with a flexible body axis. Our previous work found that the straight walk of the robot becomes unstable through a Hopf bifurcation when the body-axis flexibility is changed, which induces body undulations. Furthermore, we developed a simple controller based on the Hopf bifurcation and showed that the instability facilitates the turning of the robot. In this study, we newly found that the straight walk becomes unstable through a pitchfork bifurcation when the body-axis flexibility is changed in a way different from that in our previous work. In addition, the pitchfork bifurcation induces a transition into a curved walk, whose curvature can be controlled by the body-axis flexibility. We developed a simple controller based on the pitchfork bifurcation characteristics and demonstrated that the robot can perform a turning maneuver superior to that with the previous controller. This study provides a novel design principle for maneuverable locomotion of many-legged robots using intrinsic dynamic properties.},

Here, we propose Exo-Abs, a wearable robotic system that can universally assist wide-ranging respiratory functions by applying compensatory force to a user&#39;s abdomen in synchronization with their air usage. Inspired by how human abdominal muscles transmit pressure to the lungs via abdominal cavity compression, a biomechanically interactive platform was developed to optimally utilize the abdominal compression while aligning the assistance with a user&#39;s spontaneous respiratory effort. In addition to the compact form factor, thorough analytic procedures are described as initial steps toward taking the human respiratory system into the scope of robotics technology. We demonstrate the validity of the overall human–system interaction with the assistance performance under three essential respiratory functions: breathing, coughing, and speaking. Our results show that the system can significantly improve the performance of all these functions by granting on-demand and self-reliant assistance to its users.},

  abstract     = {Many previous works of soft wearable exoskeletons (exosuit) target at improving the human locomotion assistance, without considering the impedance adaption to interact with the unpredictable dynamics and external environment, preferably outside the laboratory environments. This article proposes a novel hierarchical human-in-the-loop paradigm that aims to produce suitable assistance powers for cable-driven lower limb exosuits to aid the ankle joint in pushing off the ground. It includes two primary loop layers: impedance learning in the external loop and human-in-the-loop adaptive management in the inner loop. Considering unknown terrains, its impedance model can be transferred to a quadratic programming problem with specified constraints, which a designed primal-dual optimization prototype then solves. Then, the presented impedance learning strategy is introduced to regulate the impedance model with the adaptive assistant powers for humans on different terrains. An adaptive controller is designed in the inner loop to balance the nonlinearities and compliance existing in the human-exosuit coexistence, while the robust mechanism compensates for disturbances to facilitate trajectory management without employing the general regressor. The advantage of the proposed technique over conventional solutions with fixed impedance parameters is that it can improve human walking performance over different terrains. Experiments demonstrate the significance of the approach.},

Wearable haptic devices, such as vibrotactile sleeves or armbands, can provide haptic feedback in a smaller and more lightweight form factor than haptic gloves that can be bulky and cumbersome to the wearer. In this article, we present tactile and squeeze bracelet interface (Tasbi), a multimodal haptic wristband that can provide radial squeeze forces around the wrist along with vibrotactile feedback at six discrete locations around the band. Tasbi implements a squeezing mechanism that minimizes tangential forces between the band’s points of contact with the skin, instead of focusing the motor actuation to predominantly normal forces. Force sensing capacitors enable closed-loop control of the squeeze force, while vibration is achieved with linear resonant actuators. A detailed description of the design and experimental results demonstrating closed-loop control of squeeze cues provided by Tasbi is presented. Additionally, we present the results of psychophysical experiments that quantify user perception of the vibration and squeeze cues, including vibrotactile identification accuracy in the presence of varying squeeze forces, discrimination thresholds for the squeeze force, and an analysis of user preferences for squeeze actuation magnitudes.},

The new paradigm is anchored on an architecture that combines local autonomy with a high-level exchange strategy of reference input. This represents a departure from the conventional reliance on direct exchange of low-level control signals in a global feedback control system. The new approach establishes two local autonomous controllers acting on the robot and the haptic device, interfaced at a higher level via a dual-proxy model. The dual proxy is a passive bridge between the local autonomous controllers. It generates appropriate motion and force reference inputs that are consistent with the task physical interactions and the levels of autonomy. Its model is adjusted online with respect to exchanged position, contact, and environment geometry information. A key component in this methodology is the perception algorithm on the robot side, the force-space particle filter, designed to reliably estimate in real time the environment contact geometry. The series of simulations and physical experimental validations of the approach demonstrate the transparency and high fidelity in haptic-robot interaction and its inherent robustness to communication delays.},

  abstract     = {Bilateral telerobotic systems have attracted a great deal of interest during the last two decades. The major challenges in this field are the transparency and stability of remote force rendering, which are affected by network delays causing asynchrony between the actions and the corresponding reactions. In addition, the overactivation of stabilizers further degrades the fidelity of the rendered force field. In this article, a real-time frequency-based delay compensation approach is proposed to maximize transparency while reducing the activation of the stabilization layer. The algorithm uses a regulated bound-limited multiple Fourier linear combiner to extract the dominant frequency of force waves. The estimated weights are used in conjunction with the relatively phase-lead harmonic kernels to reconstruct the signal and generate a compensated wave to reduce the effect of the delay. The reconstructed force will then pass through a modulated time-domain passivity controller to guarantee the stability of the system. We will show that the proposed technique will reduce the force-tracking error by 40\% and the activation of the stabilizer by 79\%. It is shown, for the first time, that through the utilization of online adaptive frequency-based prediction, the asynchrony between transmitted waves through delayednetworks can be significantly mitigated while stability can be guaranteed with less activation of the stabilization layer.},

In this article, we propose a practical and theoretically justified approach to maintain safety in the presence of dynamics uncertainty. Our approach leverages Bayesian meta-learning with last-layer adaptation. The expressiveness of neural-network features trained offline, paired with efficient last-layer online adaptation, enables the derivation of tight confidence sets, which contract around the true dynamics as the model adapts online. We exploit these confidence sets to plan trajectories that guarantee the safety of the system. Our approach handles problems with high dynamics uncertainty, where reaching the goal safely is potentially initially infeasible, by first exploring to gather data and reduce uncertainty, before autonomously exploiting the acquired information to safely perform the task. Under reasonable assumptions, we prove that our framework guarantees the high-probability satisfaction of all constraints at all times jointly, i.e., over the total task duration. This theoretical analysis also motivates two regularizers of last-layer meta-learning models that improve online adaptation capabilities as well as performance by reducing the size of the confidence sets.

However, independent control of multiple magnetic small-scale robots is a great challenge, because the robots receive identical control inputs from the same external magnetic field. In this article, we propose a novel strategy of completely decoupled independent control of magnetically actuated flexible swimming millirobots. A flexible millirobot shows a crawling motion on a flat plane within an oscillating magnetic field. Millirobots with different magnetization directions have the same velocity response curve to the oscillating magnetic field but with a difference of phase. We designed and fabricated a group of up to four heterogeneous millirobots with identical geometries and different magnetization directions. According to their velocity response curves, an optimal direction of oscillating magnetic field is calculated to induce a desired velocity vector for the millirobot group, one of which is nonzero and the others are approximately zero. The strategy is verified by experiments of independent position control of up to four millirobots and independent path following control of up to three millirobots with small errors. We further expect that with this independent control strategy, the millirobots will be able to cooperate to finish complicated tasks.},

Serial-link manipulators can be used as macro robots on which microsurgical robotic instruments are mounted to increase the number of degrees of freedom of the system and ensure safe task and RCM motion execution. However, the surgical instrument needs to be placed in an appropriate configuration when completing the motion tasks. The contribution of this article is to present a novel framework that preoperatively identifies the best base configuration, in terms of Roll, Pitch, and Yaw angles, of the microsurgical instrument with respect to the macro serial-link manipulator’s end effector in order to achieve the maximum accuracy and dexterity in performing specified tasks. The framework relies on hierarchical quadratic programming for the control, genetic algorithm for the optimization, and on a resilience to error strategy to make sure deviations from the optimum do not affect the system’s performance. Simulation results show that the mounting configuration of the surgical instrument significantly impacts the performance of the whole macro–micro manipulator in executing the desired motion tasks, and both the simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed optimization method improves the overall performance.},

Two persons with transradial amputations had bipolar electrodes implanted into regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces (RPNIs) and residual innervated muscles. The implanted electrodes recorded local electromyography with large signal amplitudes. In a series of single-day experiments, participants used a high-speed movement classifier to control a virtual prosthetic hand in real time. Both participants transitioned between ten pseudorandomly cued individual finger and wrist postures with an average success rate of 94.7\% and trial latency of 255 ms. When the set was reduced to five grasp postures, metrics improved to 100\% success and 135 ms trial latency. Performance remained stable across untrained static arm positions while supporting the weight of the prosthesis. Participants also used the high-speed classifier to switch between robotic prosthetic grips and complete a functional performance assessment. These results demonstrate that pattern-recognition systems can use intramuscular electrodes and RPNIs for fast and accurate prosthetic grasp control.},

In this article, we propose an end-to-end design and production workflow for patient-specific surgical manipulators, assessing dexterity using orientability constrained by task space obstacles. In our work, parametric evolutionary optimization maximizes dexterity in patient-specific task spaces for challenging knee arthroscopy operations. We implement our framework in the design of SnakeRaven—a 3-D printed tool to be attached to the RAVEN II surgical robot in a phantom study for knee arthroscopy. The solution achieved more than three times the dexterity of a state-of-the-art rigid instrument and more than twice the dexterity of a volume-based approach for the same task. We further assemble and validate this design by teleoperating the robot to reach the desired clinical targets in a phantom. We also investigate the changes in the design morphology to changes in the task objectives and found an advantage in task specialization. We also observe guidelines for achieving a dexterous design produced by our algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneous magnetic actuation and localization is a promising technology to realize active wireless capsule endoscopy. In this article, an adaptive approach is proposed to efficiently propel and precisely locate a magnetically actuated capsule in unknown complex tubular environments. In order to track the capsule in real time in a large workspace, we improve upon our previous external sensor-based magnetic localization strategies by proposing an adaptive method to automatically activate an optimal subset of sensors during the capsule movement and developing a simplified multiple objects tracking algorithm to estimate the six-dimensional pose of the capsule in real time. Moreover, based on a study of capsule locomotion in tubular environments with different shapes, we propose to dynamically adjust the pose of the actuator to achieve efficient and robust propulsion of the capsule in an unknown tubular environment. The effectiveness of our proposed system is validated in extensive experiments on phantoms and ex vivo animal organs. Compared with the state-of-the-art, our method can realize the closed-loop control of a magnetic capsule without requiring sensing modules to be placed inside the capsule, which can reduce the space constraints and energy consumption of the capsule. Moreover, the system and algorithms for adaptive actuation and localization can provide an improved propulsion speed, workspace range, and localization update frequency as well as a comparable localization accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The robotic manipulation of deformable linear objects is a classic and challenging topic. Apart from synthetic objects, such as wires and cables, linear objects are also commonly found in biological cells and organisms. Biomanipulation of such objects is hampered by difficulties, such as limited degrees of freedom of micromanipulators and varied mechanical properties of the biological entities to manipulate. This article presents a robotic manipulation of human sperm, which are deformable cells with a linear shape. The shape and movement of the cell are recapitulated by our developed geometric and kinematic models. Under unfixed constraints between the end-effector and the cell, path planning is designed to update the manipulation point to control cell deformation. A state transition function is formulated in path planning to handle the stiffness variations of sperm without force sensing. A model-predictive controller is designed to minimize the orientation error and manipulation path length. To detect sperm tail for visual feedback, an accuracy of 98\% was achieved via deep neural networks. The robotic manipulation of human sperm was performed using a standard clinical setup of a glass micropipette to rotate a sperm to the target orientation. Experimental results showed that robotic sperm rotation achieved an orientation error of 0.8 $^{\circ }$ , a tail curvedness of 0.14 $\mu$ m $^{-1}$ , and an operation time of 5.6 s, all significantly less than those of the manual approach. The less orientation error and tail curvedness after robotic rotation led to a significantly lower speed of sperm entering the micropipette during sperm aspiration, resulting in a higher success rate of 97\% (versus 76\% after manual rotation) for aspiration control.},

  abstract     = {Cardiac electrophysiology is an effective treatment for atrial fibrillation, in which a long, steerable catheter is inserted into the heart chamber to conduct radio frequency ablation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide enhanced intraoperative monitoring of the ablation progress as well as the localization of catheter position. However, accurate and real-time tracking of the catheter shape and its efficient manipulation under MRI remains challenging. In this article, we designed a shape tracking system that integrates a multicore fiber Bragg grating (FBG) fiber and tracking coils with a standard cardiac catheter. Both the shape and positional tracking of the bendable section could be achieved. A learning-based modeling method is developed for cardiac catheters, which uses FBG-reconstructed three-dimensional curvatures for model initialization. The proposed modeling method was implemented on an MRI-guided robotic platform to achieve feedback control of a cardiac catheter. The shape tracking performance was experimentally verified, demonstrating 2.33° average error for each sensing segment and 1.53 mm positional accuracy at the catheter tip. The feedback control performance was tested by autonomous targeting and path following (average deviation of 0.62 mm) tasks. The overall performance of the integrated robotic system was validated by a pulmonary vein isolation simulator with ex-vivo tissue ablation, which employed a left atrial phantom with pulsatile liquid flow. Catheter tracking and feedback control tests were conducted in an MRI scanner, demonstrating the capability of the proposed system under MRI.},

The QuIK method is a third-order algorithm that uses both the first- and second-order derivative information to iteratively converge to a solution. Numerical inverse kinematics methods are readily implemented on any serial robot and do not rely on joint alignment. However, they typically are slower and less robust. The second-order derivative term allows the QuIK algorithm to converge more rapidly and more robustly than existing algorithms. A damped extension to the QuIK method is also proposed to increase reliability near singularities. The QuIK methods are tested in terms of evaluation speed, reliability, and singularity robustness against the Newton–Raphson method and several other modern algorithms. The proposed QuIK methods outperform all other tested algorithms in terms of speed and robustness, and have strong performance near singularities. The QuIK algorithms are proposed as faster and more robust “drop-in” replacements to the Newton–Raphson methods in inverse kinematics. C++ and MATLAB codebases are made available.},

We propose an algorithm that shapes task impedance as a function of the robot’s time-varying inertial properties. These properties involve virtually constrained masses and virtually constrained inertias that counteract a task in order to comply with a given constraint. In this work, we not only detect task conflicts, but also show how to handle them. Our method is able to control kinematically redundant robots. We developed a damping-design method that does not interfere with our desired Cartesian task-space behavior. The control approach was verified in experiments on a real robot. We compared our impedance shaping method with two alternative control approaches: simple impedance superposition and nullspace projection. Our method preserved the passivity while improving the Cartesian task performance of an impedance controller. The method has computational advantages, beneficial to control robots with many degrees of freedom.},

We showed how a real robot can learn to manipulate a deformable, thin-shell object via feedback from deformable, multimodal tactile sensors. We addressed the learning of a page flipping task using a two-stage approach. For the first stage, we learned nominal page flipping trajectories for two page sizes by constructing a reward function that quantifies functional task performance from the perspective of tactile sensing. For the second stage, we learned adapted trajectories using tactile-driven perceptual coupling, with an intuitive assumption that, while the page flipping trajectories for different task contexts (page sizes) might differ, similar tactile feedback should be expected from functional trajectories for each context. We also investigated the quality of information encoded by two different representations of tactile sensing data: one based on the artificial apical tuft of bio-inspired tactile sensors, and another based on principal component analysis eigenvalues. The results and effectiveness of our learning framework were demonstrated on a real seven-degree of freedom robot arm and gripper outfitted with tactile sensors.},

  abstract     = {Soft actuators are compliant structures that are generally made of elastomers and generates large deformation. The behavior of these structures cannot be estimated accurately using infinitesimal strain theories. The objective of soft robotics applications is the controlled large deformation of these structures. In this article, we propose an analytical model for a pneu-net soft actuator. The model is based on the Euler–Bernoulli finite strain hyperelastic thin cantilever beam theory. The deformation of the air chambers is modeled using finite strain membrane theory. The analytical model is developed for two different states of the actuator: 1) free space; and 2) when the actuator was subjected to tip contact. The proposed theoretical model predicts the deformation and force characteristics of the actuator for the grasping state. The theoretical formulation of the developed model is different from previously developed infinitesimal strain models for the actuator, as it considers the axial stretch and forces applied to the actuator. In addition, it can be theoretically implemented on similar structured actuators for various applications. The theoretically calculated deformation and force characteristics of different actuators are compared with the finite element (FE) model and experimental characteristics. The results suggest that the proposed model can predict the actuator deformation and force characteristics as accurately as the FE model, but the computation time of the proposed model is less than 1\% that of the FE model. The proposed model is further implemented on a three-finger gripper to predict the air pressure required for a stable grasp of different objects and is validated experimentally.},

We experimentally verified the performance of our algorithm at different noise levels, stopping criteria, and task difficulties on datasets containing several types of objects. By applying combinations of only nine known pushes, our simple algorithm performed successfully in real-world experiments with challenging objects, including partially deformable objects that are difficult to model analytically; it achieved the precise stopping criterion (7.5 mm, 5 $^\circ$ ) in various rearrangement tasks.},

In problems with high-dimensional configuration spaces (C-spaces), narrow passages in free space (C-free) can be hard to find and navigate and, sometimes, even counterintuitive. In this article, we present an algorithm to construct cones of available instantaneous velocities (“free velocity cones” or, briefly, “free cones”) on the boundary of C-free to facilitate finding and navigating narrow passages. This is accomplished by first developing free cones and associated measures of local C-space narrowness for a single rigid link. These results are then extended to kinematic chains (open and closed) of arbitrary degrees of freedom. It turns out that the degeneracy of the free cones dictates the existence of C-space narrow passages, and the locations and orientations of the links in the workspace relate intimately to the corresponding connected component of C-free. This observation leads us to a modified probabilistic roadmap (M-PRM) algorithm and a modified rapidly exploring random vine (M-RRV) algorithm of combining the enumeration of topological components and random sampling of the free cones. Experimental results from applying our algorithms to several challenging examples show that our new algorithms are more efficient than some variants of the PRM algorithms, and several variants of the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithms, such as RRT-CONNECT and RRV.},

The collision detector should be computationally efficient and, ideally, analytically differentiable to facilitate stable and rapid gradient descent during optimization. However, methods today lack an elegant approach to detect collision differentiably, relying rather on numerical gradients that can be unstable. We present DiffCo, the first, fully autodifferentiable, nonparametric model for collision detection. Its nonparametric behavior allows one to compute collision boundaries on the fly and update them, requiring no pretraining and allowing it to update continuously in dynamic environments. It provides robust gradients for trajectory optimization via backpropagation and is often 10–100 times faster to compute than its geometric counterparts.

As a means to solve this dimensional-inhomogeneity problem, the concept of characteristic length has been put forward in the area of kinematics. The idea consists of scaling translations according to this characteristic length and then approximating the corresponding displacement defining the object pose in ${\mathbb {R}}^3$ by a rotation in ${\mathbb {R}}^4$ , for which a norm exists. This article sheds new light on this kind of approximations which permits simplifying optimization problem whose cost functions involve translations and rotations simultaneously. A good example of this kind of problems is the pointcloud registration problem in which the optimal rotation and translation between two sets of corresponding 3-D point data, so that they are aligned/registered, have to be found. As a result, a simple closed-form formula for solving this problem is presented which is shown to be an attractive alternative to the previous approaches.},

Unlike the metric based on fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering in our previous work, the GK-based metric includes orientation properties of the point clouds, thereby providing more information for registration. We then develop the registration quality assessment of the GK-based metric, which is more sensitive to small misalignments than that of the FCM-based metric. Next, by effectively combining the two metrics, we design two FuzzyPSReg strategies with global optimization. 1) FuzzyPSReg-SS , which extends our previous work and aligns two similar-sized point clouds with greatly improved efficiency. 2) FuzzyPSReg-O2S , which aligns two point clouds with a relatively large difference in size and can be used to estimate the pose of an object in a scene. In the experiment, we use different point clouds to test and compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art registration approaches.

While conventional handcrafted methods for VPR fail under extreme environmental appearance changes, those based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance but result in heavy runtime processes and model sizes that demand a large amount of memory. Hence, CNN-based approaches are unsuitable for resource-constrained platforms, such as small robots and drones. In this article, we take a multistep approach of decreasing the precision of model parameters, combining it with network depth reduction and fewer neurons in the classifier stage to propose a new class of highly compact models that drastically reduces the memory requirements and computational effort while maintaining state-of-the-art VPR performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to propose binary neural networks for solving the VPR problem effectively under changing conditions and with significantly reduced resource requirements. Our best-performing binary neural network, dubbed FloppyNet, achieves comparable VPR performance when considered against its full-precision and deeper counterparts while consuming 99\% less memory and increasing the inference speed by seven times.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) strategy for the position tracking of cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs). The NMPC formulation handles explicitly the cable tensions and their limits. Accordingly, the cable tension distribution is performed as an integral part of the NMPC feedback control strategy, which notably allows the CDPR to operate on the wrench-feasible workspace boundaries without failure. In order to integrate the cable tension minimization within the NMPC formulation, the concept of wrench equivalent optimality (WEO) is introduced. The WEO is a nonnegative measure able to evaluate if the wrench generated by a given cable tension vector can be generated by an alternative tension vector with smaller 2-norm. The redundancy resolution performed by means of the minimization of the WEO enables the stability of the closed-loop system to be proved. More precisely, sufficient conditions for the uniform asymptotic stability are deduced using results from the analysis of NMPC schemes without terminal constraints and costs. Furthermore, the proposed NMPC strategy is validated experimentally on a fully constrained 6 degree-of-freedom CDPR.},

  abstract     = {The control of cable-driven robots is challenging due to the system’s nonlinearity, actuation redundancy, and the unilaterally bounded actuation constraints. To solve this problem, a workspace-based model predictive control (W-MPC) scheme is proposed, which combines the online model predictive control with offline workspace analysis. Using the workspace, a set of convex constraints can be generated for a given reference trajectory. This can then be used to formulate a convex optimization problem for the online W-MPC. Meanwhile, strict recursive feasibility and stability are obtained by taking advantage of the predictive feature of MPC. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed W-MPC, simulation was performed on a 2-link planar cable-driven robot and a spatial cable-driven parallel robot for both nominal and non-nominal scenarios. Hardware experiment was also carried out using a 3 degree-of-freedom planar cable robot. The results show that the controller is efficient and effective to perform motion tracking with the cable force constraints satisfied despite the existence of various model uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the concurrency issues affecting behavior trees (BTs), a popular tool to model the behaviors of autonomous agents in the video game and the robotics industry. BT designers can easily build complex behaviors composing simpler ones, which represents a key advantage of BTs. The parallel composition of BTs expresses a way to combine concurrent behaviors that has high potential, since composing pre-existing BTs in parallel results easier than composing in parallel classical control architectures, as finite state machines or teleo-reactive programs. However, BT designers rarely use such composition due to the underlying concurrency problems similar to the ones faced in concurrent programming. As a result, the parallel composition, despite its potential, finds application only in the composition of simple behaviors or where the designer can guarantee the absence of conflicts by design. In this article, we define two new BT nodes to tackle the concurrency problems in BTs and we show how to exploit them to create predictable behaviors. In addition, we introduce measures to assess execution performance and show how different design choices affect them. We validate our approach in both simulations and the real world. Simulated experiments provide statistically significant data, whereas real-world experiments show the applicability of our method on real robots. We provided an open-source implementation of the novel BT formulation and published all the source code to reproduce the numerical examples and experiments.},

This modeling approach gives rise to an uncertain semantic map generated by semantic simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms. Our goal is to design control policies for robots equipped with noisy perception systems so that they can accomplish collaborative tasks captured by global temporal logic specifications. To specify missions that account for environmental and perceptual uncertainty, we employ a fragment of linear temporal logic (LTL), called co-safe LTL, defined over perception-based atomic predicates modeling probabilistic satisfaction requirements. The perception-based LTL planning problem gives rise to an optimal control problem, solved by a novel sampling-based algorithm, that generates open-loop control policies that are updated online to adapt to a continuously learned semantic map.

  abstract     = {Successful plan generation for autonomous systems is necessary but not sufficient to guarantee reaching a goal state by an execution of a plan. Various discrepancies between an expected state and the observed state may occur during the plan execution (e.g., due to unexpected exogenous events, changes in the goals, or failure of robot parts) and these discrepancies may lead to plan failures. For that reason, autonomous systems should be equipped with execution monitoring algorithms so that they can autonomously recover from such discrepancies. We introduce a plan execution monitoring algorithm that operates under partial observability. This algorithm relies on novel formal methods for hybrid prediction, diagnosis and explanation generation, and planning. The prediction module generates an expected state after the execution of a part of the plan from an incomplete state to check for discrepancies. The diagnostic reasoning module generates meaningful hypotheses to explain failures of robot parts. Unlike the existing diagnosis methods, the previous hypotheses can be revised, based on new partial observations, increasing the accuracy of explanations as further information becomes available. The replanning module considers these explanations while computing a new plan that would avoid such failures. All these reasoning modules are hybrid in that they combine high-level logical reasoning with low-level feasibility checks based on probabilistic methods. We experimentally show that these hybrid formal reasoning modules improve the performance of plan execution monitoring.},

In this method, a group of data-driven type-2 fuzzy models are used to describe the input–output relationships of demonstrations. Based on the fuzzy models, T2FMP can efficiently reproduce the trajectory without high computational costs or cumbersome parameter settings. Besides, it can well handle the variation of the demonstrations and is robust to noise. In addition, we develop extensions that endow T2FMP with trajectory modulation and superposition to achieve real-time trajectory adaptation to various scenarios. Going beyond existing imitation learning methods, we further extend T2FMP to regulate the trajectory to avoid collisions in the environment that is unstructured, nonconvex, and detected with noisy outliers. Several experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract     = {As human-robot collaboration increases and robots are applied to everyday life, interest in safety issues is increasing. To be safely used in real life, in addition to collision prevention algorithms, robots need to quickly detect unexpected collisions and take appropriate actions. Recently, deep learning-based collision detection algorithms have been proposed to overcome the limitations of model-based collision detection methods, but there are also limitations on deep learning methods, especially in data collection. The collected data are often insufficient because collecting collision data is laborious and intrinsically imbalanced, meaning that the collision data are much smaller than the free-motion data. Moreover, since collecting collision data is risky and might cause potential damage to the robot, applying the deep learning method to a new target robot on mass production is highly restricted. Therefore, in this article, an inductive bias is imposed on network structure and input variable to be sample-efficiently trained, which is suitable for insufficient imbalanced data. The proposed modularized neural network removes the connection between other joints at the front part of the network, reducing the search space of the learnable parameter. Moreover, the input variable is selected to take both dynamics features and error-related features into account. Consequently, the proposed method is versatile, showing successful generalization performance to random motion, random collision location, and various loads at the end-effector. Furthermore, to circumvent the limitations of applying deep learning methods to mass production, transfer learning is proposed, which does not require any collision data from the target robot. The proposed data-mixture method and collision ratio adjustment method for fine-tuning are validated with two source robots and one target robot. The transferred network is effective to be applied on mass production without losing performance compared to a specific-robot-trained network(a network trained with specific robot data and applied to the same robot).},

The approximation facilities a H-LIP based stepping controller to provide desired step sizes to stabilize the robotic walking. By realizing the desired step sizes, the robot achieves dynamic and stable walking.

However, when closing the loop, the performance and feasibility of the finite horizon optimal control problem (OCP) solved at each control cycle are not guaranteed anymore. This is due to model discrepancies, the effect of low-level controllers, uncertainties, and sensor noise. To address these issues, we propose a modified version of a standard MPC approach used in legged locomotion with viability (weak forward invariance) guarantees. In this approach, instead of adding a (conservative) terminal constraint to the problem, we propose to use the measured state projected to the viability kernel in the OCP solved at each control cycle. Moreover, we use past experimental data to find the best cost weights, which measure a combination of performance, constraint satisfaction robustness, or stability (invariance). These interpretable costs measure the tradeoff between robustness and performance. For this purpose, we use Bayesian optimization to systematically design experiments that help efficiently collect data to learn a cost function leading to robust performance. Our simulation results with different realistic disturbances (i.e., external pushes, unmodeled actuator dynamics, and computational delay) show the effectiveness of our approach to create robust controllers for humanoid robots.},

  abstract     = {This study presents the method of robotic rock-and-walk manipulation for dynamic, nonprehensile object locomotion. The object, which is in contact with an environmental surface, is basically manipulated to rock from side to side about the contact point periodically by the robot system. In the meantime, the passive dynamics due to gravity enables the object to roll along a zigzag path that leads to a forward walk. Rock-and-walk is a special-purpose method that enables the transport of a certain class of objects, which are too large, heavy to apply other primary methods such as grasping- or pushing-based operations. Our work is motivated by an interesting question in archaeology, how the giant statues of Easter Island (known as “moai”) were transported several hundred years ago, and a recent demonstration performed by archaeologists that it is possible to walk the statue by periodic rocking. We present a detailed study of the dynamics, kinematics, and mechanics of the object-robot-environment system, and devise a feedback control strategy for rock-and-walk gaiting through the effective regulation of the object’s energy and posture. An extensive set of experiments demonstrate the viability and practicality of our approach in diverse settings: Caging-based single-robot manipulation and cable-driven dual-robot manipulation using manipulator arms and aerial robots.},

  abstract     = {Robotic manipulation of deformable linear objects (DLOs) is important in many applications such as the assembly of deformable wire harnesses and cables in manufacturing. Despite some relevant work in modeling, few studies have studied the comprehensive dynamic modeling and precise automatic control of DLOs using robots due to their high degrees of freedom and high flexibility. To fill this gap, the precise single-arm and dual-arm robot manipulation control of DLOs is studied in this article. First, a more comprehensive dynamic model of DLOs is established based on a discrete elastic rod model, which takes into account the twisting deformation of DLOs. The collisions, contacts, and frictions between the DLOs and the plane, as well as the kinematic constraints of both ends of the DLOs, are also considered in the model. Second, practical dynamic control schemes of robots are proposed to realize the precise control of DLOs for both the single-arm control and dual-arm control. For validations, we built an experimental platform using an ABB Yumi robot to implement and validate the proposed approaches in addition to simulations. Finally, various DLO manipulation tasks are conducted and the results for both single-arm and dual-arm manipulations validate the proposed modeling and control approaches.},

  abstract     = {How to use few actuators to endow a multifingered robotic hand with the human grasping and manipulation abilities is a challenging problem. This article develops a design principle of a five-fingered robotic hand with only two actuators, which guarantees the designed hand can replicate a large portion of the grasping and a limited portion of the manipulation abilities of the human hand: simultaneously move all joints before contacting objects like the natural reach-to-grasp process of the human hand; self-adaptively pinch/envelop objects with arbitrary shapes; and carry out dexterous manipulation, such as in-hand manipulation of a ball and screwing bottle cap. The core design ideas involve two levels. The higher level idea is to construct a robotic design theory ensuring thumb and fingers driven independently and four fingers driven synergistically so that the opposable thumb with manual abduction/adduction function can move coordinately with four fingers to ensure abundant anthropomorphic grasps and in-hand manipulations. The lower level idea is to establish a mechanism design method that embeds human two primary eigengrasps into a novel single-actuated differential palm mechanism consisting of gears, drag axes, and slider elements, so that the mechanism can always replicate the grasping behaviors of human hand, no matter how the differential processes it would perform during grasping. Finally, we design a mini X-hand to verify our proposed design principle and reproduce 29 types out of 33 grasping types and some manipulations that are commonly used by human hands in daily life.},

Specialized devices or subsidiary sensors are required during the traditional calibration process which bring in external measurement errors. In this article, an in situ calibration method is proposed to calibrate the force–torque sensor with a single standard mass to generate expected wrenches of the sensor during some arbitrary robot poses. Since the tilt of the mounting base of the robot can affect the direction of the gravity expressed with respect to the sensor frame, we first derive a model to express the relationship between the raw measurements and the expected wrenches under the influence of the tilted base, and then introduce subspaces and take advantage of projection and Rayleigh quotient to obtain the calibration matrix and angles of tilting simultaneously. The proposed algorithm is validated on simulation and the industrial automation (ATI) force–torque sensor. The results show that the proposed method is more cost-effective and reliable than existing technologies.},

  abstract     = {Robot end-effector tracking of a specific spatial path to fulfill certain requirements is a topic of great interest. First, considering both dynamic constraints and kinematic constraints, the planned velocity has characteristics of bounded high-order derivatives to ensure smooth motion. Second, to meet high-efficiency requirements, the feedrate of the end-effector should be planned within the best possible time. Although some studies have shown that they obtained the time-optimal solution by considering the second-order constraints, this is still an open problem for third-order constraints. Therefore, this article proposes an approximate time-optimal feedrate (ATOF) planning algorithm that considers third-order constraints. This algorithm is primarily based on the bidirectional scanning method, which includes two steps. First, we calculate the second-order time-optimal velocity (TOV2) curve under the third-order maximum velocity curve. Then, considering TOV2, we propose an ATOF algorithm that includes single-direction speed planning and speed curve smoothing. It is more practical for not only considering the Coulomb viscous friction and torque rate but also avoiding difficult calculations at the singular point and solves discontinuous joint-acceleration under second-order constraints. Finally, we design two sets of experiments to verify the higher calculation efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed ATOF algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Placing robotsoutside controlled conditions requires versatile movement representations that allow robots to learn new tasks and adapt them to environmental changes. The introduction of obstacles or the placement of additional robots in the workspace and the modification of the joint range due to faults or range-of-motion constraints are typical cases, where the adaptation capabilities play a key role for safely performing the robot’s task. Probabilistic movement primitives (ProMPs) have been proposed for representing adaptable movement skills, which are modeled as Gaussian distributions over trajectories. These are analytically tractable and can be learned from a small number of demonstrations. However, both the original ProMP formulation and the subsequent approaches only provide solutions to specific movement adaptation problems, e.g., obstacle avoidance, and a generic, unifying, probabilistic approach to adaptation is missing. In this article, we develop a generic probabilistic framework for adapting ProMPs. We unify previous adaptation techniques, for example, various types of obstacle avoidance, via-points, and mutual avoidance, in one single framework and combine them to solve complex robotic problems. Additionally, we derive novel adaptation techniques such as temporally unbound via-points and mutual avoidance. We formulate adaptation as a constrained optimization problem, where we minimize the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the adapted distribution and the distribution of the original primitive,while we constrain the probability mass associated with undesired trajectories to be low. We demonstrate our approach on several adaptation problems on simulated planar robot arms and seven-degree-of-freedom Franka Emika robots in a dual-robot-arm setting.},

  abstract     = {Steerable needles are a promising technology to provide safe deployment of tools through complex anatomy in minimally invasive surgery, including tumor-related diagnoses and therapies. For the 3-D localization of these instruments in soft tissue, fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) based reconstruction methods have gained in popularity because of the inherent advantages of optical fibers in a clinical setting, such as flexibility, immunity to electromagnetic interference, nontoxicity, and the absence of line-of-sight issues. However, methods proposed thus far focus on shape reconstruction of the steerable needle itself, where accuracy is susceptible to errors in interpolation and curve fitting methods used to estimate the curvature vectors along the needle. In this study, we propose reconstructing the shape of the path created by the steerable needle tip based on the follow-the-leader nature of many of its variants. By assuming that the path made by the tip is equivalent to the shape of the needle, this novel approach paves the way for shape reconstruction through a single set of FBGs at the needle tip, which provides curvature information about every section of the path during navigation. We propose a Kalman-filter-based sensor fusion method to update the curvature information about the sections as they are continually estimated during the insertion process. The proposed method is validated through simulation, in vitro and ex vivo experiments employing a programmable bevel-tip steerable needle (PBN). The results show clinically acceptable accuracy, with 2.87-mm mean PBN tip position error, and a standard deviation of 1.63 mm for a 120-mm 3-D insertion.},

In experiments, a standard angled micropipette was used as the end-effector to verify the validity of the proposed methods. The performance was evaluated experimentally where the micropipette was robotically rotated to an arbitrarily desired orientation with an average orientation error less than $2^\circ$ . In the experiments of sperm manipulation, the in situ micropipette orientation control capability improved the success rate of sperm immobilization and achieved dexterous robotic sperm orientation for facile aspiration.},

However, blood vessels will suffer from the damage caused by collision with medical instruments to some extent even though the surgeries are very successful. Moreover, when surgeons perform unsafe operations, the unsafe operations will not only seriously affect surgical safety (or even cause serious complications) but also restrict the continuity of operation. In this article, a multilevel concept for operating force is first introduced into surgical procedures as a reference for the choice and design of operation strategies. Based on this concept, a novel multilevel operation strategy is first proposed to reduce blood vessel damage, ensure surgical safety, and allow for continuous operation. This strategy can remind surgeons about the operative conditions in real-time, reduce collision to blood vessels, and eliminate unsafe operations online. A prototype was fabricated and calibrated through calibration experiments and the performance of the multilevel operation strategy was validated through in vitro and ex vivo experiments. Experimental results demonstrate the engineering effectiveness of the proposed method and motivate the need for further in vivo studies to evaluate improvement on surgical safety.},

  abstract     = {The authors have developed magnetic resonance imaging-guided breast biopsy robot (MRSON), which is an automated magnetic resonance (MR) guided breast needle biopsy robot that works in an intragantry space with (3+1) degrees of freedom. This robot utilizes a bendable superelastic Nitinol biopsy needle. The MRSON’s needle path is normally parallel to the X -axis of the Cartesian coordinates. However, in some cases, parallel biopsy needle paths are not feasible based on obstacles that are present in front of the target tumor (i.e., compressor grid walls, visible blood vessels, or nontarget tumors). Therefore, a deflected needle path planning method for MRSON was developed in this article to avoid obstacles and accurately perform biopsies. The novelty of the proposed method lies in using a grid with 20×12 holes, through which the robot introduces the biopsy needle and actively deflects the needle against the grid to generate a deflected needle path leading to the target lesion without requiring additional actuators. To calculate the deflection amount and needle insertion depth, the deflected needle is modeled by an $\epsilon$ -second-order polynomial, and feasible needle paths are determined through geometry-based analysis. A path-ranking algorithm is then applied to select the best path among all feasible needle paths. Furthermore, to handle with any target lesion movement and coordinate misalignment between the robot and MR image coordinates, a Jacobian-based needle path adjustment method is proposed and verified through numerical simulations. The proposed deflected needle path planning method was verified through 28 in vitro accuracy test and four in vitro validation tests with a linear obstacle, which revealed a root-mean-square targeting error of 2.3 mm.},

  abstract     = {Jumping is beneficial for microrobots because they have to face obstacles larger than their height frequently. However, compacting a jumping mechanism into the small body of a microrobot is exceptionally challenging. Instead of assembling a bio-inspired microrobot, the insect itself can be transformed into a jumping robot. Herein, we demonstrated the first-ever biohybrid jumping robot that retained the natural jumping ability of a locust. The fast kicking of the locust&#39;s hindleg was mainly induced by two muscles, flexor muscle, and extensor muscle. The elaborate structure and accurate collaboration of the muscles are critical for leg kicking, contributing to the co-contraction process. In this article, we investigated the sequences of muscular activities and demonstrated the co-contraction control exogenously. The kicking control of the hindleg relies on the accurately overlapped stimulation and the independently modulated waveform. With the help of a tiny wireless stimulator, the cyborg locust was remotely controlled to jump an average of 10.4 cm high and 42.6 cm far. Moreover, the cyborg locust retained its internal body righting mechanism, which means the robot can quickly recover its posture for consecutive jumping. This work is a foundational step towards a fully controllable biohybrid jumping robot.},

However, exoskeleton-assisted hand exercises with high degrees-of-freedom are considered as challenging tasks because the digit space, especially the thumb, cannot accommodate enough actuators. In this article, we report a tendon-driven soft hand exoskeleton with a hybrid configuration for thumb actuation. The soft hand exoskeleton system uses the least number of actuators to realize full degrees-of-freedom actuation for all digits. It is tested on a stroke patient with hemiplegia and a healthy subject. The experimental results show that the hand exoskeleton could assist the stroke patient to accomplish various training tasks, such as thumb encircling, grasping, pinching, releasing, and writing. It was found that digit trajectories and joint angle changes of the stroke patient were close to those of the healthy subject. Especially, the range of motion of the stroke patient shows significant improvement with the hand exoskeleton assistance compared to that without the hand exoskeleton assistance. The research in this article paves the way to develop fully actuated soft hand exoskeleton that can be eventually integrated with an electroencephalogram or electromyography for self-training rehabilitation or daily living assistance.},

  abstract     = {The ability to grasp a wider range of objects in size and shape directly relates to the performance of robotic grippers. Adapting to complex geometries of objects requires large degrees of freedom to allow complex configurations. However, complexity in controlling many individual joints leads to introduction of underactuated mechanisms, in which traditional finger designs composed of revolute joints allow only flexion/extension motions. In this article, we propose a length-adjustable linkage mechanism in the underactuated finger controlled by an antagonistic tendon pair. The resulting gripper can elongate the fingers for an increased task space or shorten them for a finer spatial resolution. For tactile sensing, hyperelastic soft sensors are used to stretch with finger elongation. Contact pressures measured by the soft sensors are used in force-feedback control for which either the joint angles or the link lengths are adjusted. Lastly, a multimodal control scheme that combines elongation and flexion modes is demonstrated with tasks of dexterous manipulation.},

  abstract     = {Soft and continuously controllable grippers can be assembled from fluidic prestressed composite (FPC) actuators. Due to their highly deformable features, it is difficult to model such actuators for large deflections. This article proposes a new method for modeling large deflections of FPC actuators called the chained composite model (CCM) to characterize the quasi-static response to an applied fluid pressure and load. The CCM divides an FPC actuator into discrete elements and models each element by a small rotation model. The strain energy of each element and the work done by pressure and loads are computed using third-order displacement polynomials with unknown coefficients; then, the total energy is minimized to calculate stable shapes using the Rayleigh–Ritz method. This study provides a set of systematic design rules to help the robotics community create FPC actuators by understanding how their responses vary as a function of input forces and pressures for a number of modeling and design parameters. Composite actuators are fabricated and a soft gripper is developed to demonstrate the grasping ability of the FPC actuators. Pneumatic pressure and end loads are applied to the composite actuators, and their responses are measured. The modeled responses of the actuators are shown to be in agreement with the measured responses.},

Simultaneously, biologically inspired robotics rely on simplifying agents and increasing their number to obtain more efficient solutions to such problems, drawing similarities with natural processes. In this work, we focus on the problem of a biologically inspired multiagent system solving collaborative foraging. We show how mean field techniques can be used to re-formulate such a stochastic multiagent problem into a deterministic autonomous system. This de-couples agent dynamics, enabling the computation of limit behaviors and the analysis of optimality guarantees. Furthermore, we analyse how having finite number of agents affects the performance when compared to the mean field limit and we discuss the implications of such limit approximations in this multiagent system, which have impact on more general collaborative stochastic problems.},

In this context, we first propose a general coordinated motion framework for multirobot systems with triangular FOV capable of guaranteeing stability under asymmetric (directed) interactions. In deriving this framework, we illustrate that asymmetry in multirobot interactions can lead to degenerate configurations for which a fully decentralized controller may be insufficient to achieve coordination. Thus, we introduce a switching control mechanism that achieves adaptive decentralization , enabling collaborative behaviors that seek support of a centralized planner for situations that are inherently unstable (degenerate). To demonstrate the generality of our framework we provide a case study involving varying team objectives, such as topology control, that the robots can achieve with limited FOV, while remaining stable. Experimental and numerical validations based on the previously discussed case study are provided to corroborate the theoretical findings},

An open research question is how to leverage and combine the advantages of both approaches. In this article, we provide an answer by using policy search for automatically choosing high-level decision variables for MPC, which leads to a novel policy-search-for-model-predictive-control framework . Specifically, we formulate the MPC as a parameterized controller, where the hard-to-optimize decision variables are represented as high-level policies. Such a formulation allows optimizing policies in a self-supervised fashion. We validate this framework by focusing on a challenging problem in agile drone flight: flying a quadrotor through fast-moving gates.

Monte Carlo simulation studies show that the proposed adaptive localization framework outperforms standard filtering techniques by significant margins, for a wide range of parameter values. The differential entropies of fused target likelihoods are studied for various multiagent Lissajous pattern configurations, leading to the derivation of optimal Lissajous parameters for cooperative SAL.

Over the years, several deep learning approaches have been proposed to address this task; however, their performance has been subpar compared to handcrafted techniques, especially while dealing with reverse loops. In this article, we introduce the novel loop closure detection network (LCDNet) that effectively detects loop closures in light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds by simultaneously identifying previously visited places and estimating the six degrees of freedom relative transformation between the current scan and the map. LCDNet is composed of a shared encoder, a place recognition head that extracts global descriptors, and a relative pose head that estimates the transformation between two point clouds. We introduce a novel relative pose head based on the unbalanced optimal transport theory that we implement in a differentiable manner to allow for end-to-end training. Extensive evaluations of LCDNet on multiple real-world autonomous driving datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art loop closure detection and point cloud registration techniques by a large margin, especially while dealing with reverse loops. Moreover, we integrate our proposed loop closure detection approach into a LiDAR SLAM library to provide a complete mapping system and demonstrate the generalization ability using different sensor setup in an unseen city.},

  abstract     = {This article presents FAST-LIO2: a fast, robust, and versatile LiDAR-inertial odometry framework. Building on a highly efficient tightly coupled iterated Kalman filter, FAST-LIO2 has two key novelties that allow fast, robust, and accurate LiDAR navigation (and mapping). The first one is directly registering raw points to the map (and subsequently update the map, i.e., mapping) without extracting features. This enables the exploitation of subtle features in the environment and, hence, increases the accuracy. The elimination of a hand-engineered feature extraction module also makes it naturally adaptable to emerging LiDARs of different scanning patterns; the second main novelty is maintaining a map by an incremental k-dimensional (k-d) tree data structure, incremental k-d tree ( ikd-Tree ), that enables incremental updates (i.e., point insertion and delete) and dynamic rebalancing. Compared with existing dynamic data structures (octree, R $^\ast$ -tree, and nanoflann k-d tree), ikd-Tree achieves superior overall performance while naturally supports downsampling on the tree. We conduct an exhaustive benchmark comparison in 19 sequences from a variety of open LiDAR datasets. FAST-LIO2 achieves consistently higher accuracy at a much lower computation load than other state-of-the-art LiDAR-inertial navigation systems. Various real-world experiments on solid-state LiDARs with small field of view are also conducted. Overall, FAST-LIO2 is computationally efficient (e.g., up to 100 Hz odometry and mapping in large outdoor environments), robust (e.g., reliable pose estimation in cluttered indoor environments with rotation up to 1000 deg/s), versatile (i.e., applicable to both multiline spinning and solid-state LiDARs, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and handheld platforms, and Intel- and ARM-based processors), while still achieving a higher accuracy than existing methods. Our implementation of the system FAST-LIO2 and the data structure ikd-Tree are both open-sourced on Github.},

Ensembles sampled from the state uncertainty contribute to the proposed gradient and yield a correct update direction even in a bad initialization point. We present two sets of experiments to demonstrate the strengths of our framework. First, a thorough Monte Carlo simulation in a virtual trajectory is designed to reveal robustness to large initial uncertainty.

Real-world applications demand multi-robot SLAM systems to be robust to perceptual aliasing and to operate under limited communication bandwidth; moreover, it is desirable for these systems to capture semantic information to enable high-level decision-making and spatial artificial intelligence. This article presents $ \mathsf{{Kimera-Multi}} $ , a multi-robot system that: 1) is robust and capable of identifying and rejecting incorrect inter- and intrarobot loop closures resulting from perceptual aliasing; 2) is fully distributed and only relies on local (peer-to-peer) communication to achieve distributed localization and mapping; and 3) builds a globally consistent metric-semantic 3-D mesh model of the environment in real time, where faces of the mesh are annotated with semantic labels. $ \mathsf{{Kimera-Multi}} $ is implemented by a team of robots equipped with visual-inertial sensors. Each robot builds a local trajectory estimate and a local mesh using $ \mathsf{{Kimera}} $ . When communication is available, robots initiate a distributed place recognition and robust pose graph optimization protocol based on a distributed graduated nonconvexity algorithm. The proposed protocol allows the robots to improve their local trajectory estimates by leveraging inter-robot loop closures while being robust to outliers. Finally, each robot uses its improved trajectory estimate to correct the local mesh using mesh deformation techniques. We demonstrate $ \mathsf{{Kimera-Multi}} $ in photo-realistic simulations, SLAM benchmarking datasets, and challenging outdoor datasets collected using ground robots. Both real and simulated experiments involve long trajectories (e.g., up to 800 m per robot). The experiments show that $ \mathsf{{Kimera-Multi}} $ : 1) outperforms the state of the art in terms of robustness and accuracy; 2) achieves estimation errors comparable to a centralized SLAM system while being fully distributed; 3) is parsimonious in terms of communication bandwidth; 4) produces accurate metric-semantic 3-D meshes; and 5) is modular and can also be used for standard 3-D reconstruction (i.e., without semantic labels) or for trajectory estimation (i.e., without reconstructing a 3-D mesh).},

In this article, we present GVINS, a nonlinear optimization-based system that tightly fuses global navigation satellite system (GNSS) raw measurements with visual and inertial information for real-time and drift-free stateestimation. Our system aims to provide accurate global six-degree-of-freedom estimation under complex indoor–outdoor environments, where GNSS signals may be intermittent or even inaccessible. To establish the connection between global measurements and local states, a coarse-to-fine initialization procedure is proposed to efficiently calibrate the transformation online and initialize GNSS states from only a short window of measurements. The GNSS code pseudorange and Doppler shift measurements, along with visual and inertial information, are then modeled and used to constrain the system states in a factor graph framework. For complex and GNSS-unfriendly areas, the degenerate cases are discussed and carefully handled to ensure robustness. Thanks to the tightly coupled multisensor approach and system design, our system fully exploits the merits of three types of sensors and is able to seamlessly cope with the transition between indoor and outdoor environments, where satellites are lost and reacquired. We extensively evaluate the proposed system by both simulation and real-world experiments, and the results demonstrate that our system substantially suppresses the drift of the VIO and preserves the local accuracy in spite of noisy GNSS measurements. The versatility and robustness of the system are verified on large-scale data collected in challenging environments. In addition, experiments show that our system can still benefit from the presence of only one satellite, whereas at least four satellites are required for its conventional GNSS counterparts.},

We prove finite-time convergence of the algorithm to an optimal solution of the problem.

  abstract     = {This article discusses a compliance optimization approach that satisfies positive definiteness. Physical human–robot interactions are an important topic in robotics, for which force or compliance control is a key technology. Operational space control (OSC) is one of the most common approaches for robot force control with redundant degrees of freedom. By linearizing OSC, we can derive joint stiffness and viscosity matrices equivalent to the OSC. For an appropriate control, it is important that these matrices are positive definite. However, the stiffness matrix equivalent to the OSC is not always positive definite. In this case, a high kinetic energy is required, which is a problem in terms of the control performance. Therefore, the control performance can be improved by explicitly considering the positive definiteness of the stiffness or compliance. In this article, the authors derive a dynamically consistent compliance formulation and propose a compliance optimization that satisfies positive definiteness. The space of the symmetric positive definite matrix is a Riemannian manifold. We show that minimizing the Riemaniann geodesic distance results in a better performance compared with using OSC. The proposed method is validated via forward dynamics simulations and experiments using a hydrostatically driven humanoid Hydra.},

In this article, we exploit the benefits of this technology by developing a magnetically actuated flexible catheter capable of the controlled ejection and retrieval of an untethered magnetic capsule. The catheter is actuated by the advanced robotics for magnetic manipulation system. The scanning ultrasound is used for 3-D shape reconstruction of the catheter, with a mean error of 0.37 mm. We use a closed-loop position controller to steer the catheter, reporting a mean error of 0.82 mm. We develop a dynamic model of the capsule and use it to predict the trajectory of the projectile. We demonstrate the targeting of the capsule utilizing the null-space of the catheter actuation (mean residual tip displacement of 0.8 mm). Finally, we perform a delivery of a capsule to and retrieval from a target inaccessible for the catheter tip, demonstrating the capability of our instrument to reach challenging locations.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we introduce a new sensor-based control method that regulates (by means of robot motion) the temperature of objects that are subject to a radiative heat source. This valuable sensorimotor capability is needed in many industrial, dermatology, and field robot applications, and it is an essential component for creating machines with advanced thermomotor intelligence. To this end, we derive a geometric-thermal-motor model, which describes the relation between the robot’s active configuration and the produced dynamic thermal response. We then use the model to guide the design of two new thermal servoing controllers (one model-based and one adaptive), and analyze their stability with Lyapunov theory. To validate our method, we report a detailed experimental study with a robotic manipulator conducting autonomous thermal servoing tasks. We show that the temperature of multiple objects with unknown thermophysical properties attached to the same end-effector can be effectively regulated by controlled robot motion. Although thermal sensing is a mature technology in many industrial thermal engineering applications, its use as a feedback signal for robot control has not been sufficiently studied in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that temperature regulation is formulated as a motion control problem for robots.},

Our approach can estimate different propagation paths, including the reflection and diffraction paths of sound waves based on a backward ray tracing technique. To estimate diffraction propagation paths, we combine a ray tracing algorithm with a uniform theory of diffraction model by exploiting the diffraction properties as propagation paths bend around the wedges of obstacles. We reconstruct the 3-D environments and wedges of obstacles in the precomputation phase and utilize these outcomes to generate primary, reflection, and diffraction acoustic rays in the runtime phase. We localize multiple sources when identifying the convergence regions of these acoustic rays based on Monte Carlo localization (MCL). Our approach supports not only stationary but also moving sources of human speech and clapping sounds. Our approach can also handle nonline-of-sight (NLOS) sources and distinguish between active and inactive source states. We evaluated and analyzed our algorithm in multiple scenarios containing obstacles and NLOS sources. Our approach can localize moving sources with the average of distance errors of 0.65 and 0.74 m in single and multiple source cases, respectively, in rooms, 7 m by 7 m in size with a height of 3 m; errors are measured according to the L2 distance between the estimated and actual source positions.

After mapping the parameters (matrices) into the joint space, we analyze the vibratory dynamics of the robot and identify the proper way of suppressing of the vibration modes by specific elements in the Cartesian damping matrix without need of trial and error.

In this article, we present the novel top–down efficient LiDAR panoptic segmentation (EfficientLPS) architecture that addresses multiple challenges in segmenting LiDAR point clouds, including distance-dependent sparsity, severe occlusions, large scale-variations, and reprojection errors. EfficientLPS comprises of a novel shared backbone that encodes with strengthened geometric transformation modeling capacity and aggregates semantically rich range-aware multiscale features. It incorporates new scale-invariant semantic and instance segmentation heads along with the panoptic fusion module which is supervised by our proposed panoptic periphery loss function. Additionally, we formulate a regularized pseudolabeling framework to further improve the performance of EfficientLPS by training on unlabeled data. We benchmark our proposed model on two large-scale LiDAR datasets: nuScenes, for which we also provide ground truth annotations, and SemanticKITTI. Notably, EfficientLPS sets the new state-of-the-art on both these datasets.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system typically employs vision-based sensors to observe the surrounding environment. However, the performance of such systems highly depends on the ambient illumination conditions. In scenarios with adverse visibility or in the presence of airborne particulates (e.g., smoke, dust, etc.), alternative modalities such as those based on thermal imaging and inertial sensors are more promising. In this article, we propose the first complete thermal–inertial SLAM system that combines neural abstraction in the SLAM front end with robust pose-graph optimization in the SLAM back end. We model the sensor abstraction in the front end by employing probabilistic deep learning parameterized by mixture density networks (MDNs). Our key strategies to successfully model this encoding from thermal imagery are the usage of normalized 14-b radiometric data, the incorporation of hallucinated visual (RGB) features, and the inclusion of feature selection to estimate the MDN parameters. To enable a full SLAM system, we also design an efficient global image descriptor that is able to detect loop closures from thermal embedding vectors. We performed extensive experiments and analysis using three datasets, namely self-collected ground robot and hand-held data taken in indoor environment, and one public dataset (SubT-tunnel) collected in underground tunnel. Finally, we demonstrate that an accurate thermal–inertial SLAM system can be realized in conditions of both benign and adverse visibility.},

We introduce two subdescriptors and enable topological place retrieval followed by the 1-degree of freedom semimetric localization, thereby bridging the gap between topological place retrieval and metric localization.

  abstract     = {Drawing inspiration from the locomotion modalities of animals, legged robots demonstrated the potential to traverse irregular and unstructured environments. Successful approaches exploited single-leg templates, like the spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP), as a reference for the control of multilegged machines. Nevertheless, the anchoring between the low-order model and the actual multilegged structure is still an open challenge. This article proposes a novel strategy to derive actuation inputs for a multilegged robot by expressing the control requirements in terms of jump height and forward speed (derived from the limit cycle). We found that these requirements could be associated with a specific maximum force, successively split on an arbitrary number of legs and their relative actuation sets. The proposed approach has been validated in multibody simulation and real-world experiments by employing the underwater hexapod robot SILVER2. Results show that locomotion performances of the low-order model are reflected by the simulated and actual robot, showing that the articulated-USLIP (a-USLIP) model can faithfully explain the multilegged behavior under the imposed control inputs once hydrodynamic parameters have been tuned. More importantly, the proposed controller can be translated to the terrestrial case with minimal modifications and extended with additional layers to obtain more complex behaviors.},

Existing models for describing the complex kinematics involved in general actuation of continuum robots rely on simulation or well-behaved stress–strain relationships, but the nonlinear behavior of the thin-walled inflated-beams used in growing robots makes these techniques difficult to apply. Here, we derive kinematic models of single, generally routed tendon paths on a soft pneumatic backbone of inextensible but flexible material from geometric relationships alone. This allows for forward modeling of the resulting shapes with only knowledge of the geometry of the system. We show that this model can accurately predict the shape of the whole robot body and how the model changes with actuation type. We also demonstrate the use of this kinematic model for inverse design, where actuator designs are found based on desired final robot shapes. We deploy these designed actuators on soft pneumatic growing robots to show the benefits of simultaneous growth and shape change.},

In this work, we present a class of inchworm-inspired multimodal soft crawling-climbing robots (SCCRs) that can achieve crawling, climbing, and transitioning between horizontal and vertical planes. Inspired by the inchworm’s multimodal locomotion, which depends on the “ $\Omega$ ” deformation of the body and controllable friction force of feet, we develop the SCCR by 1) three pneumatic artificial muscles based body designed to produce “ $\Omega$ ” deformation; 2) two negative pressure suckers adopted to generate controllable friction forces. Then a simplified kinematic model is developed to characterize the kinematic features of the SCCRs. Lastly, a control strategy is proposed to synchronously control the “ $\Omega$ ” deformation and sucker friction forces for multimodal locomotion. The experimental results demonstrate that the SCCR can move at a maximum speed of 21 mm/s (0.11 body length/s) on horizontal planes and 15 mm/s (0.079 body length/s) on vertical walls. Furthermore, the SCCR can work in confined spaces, carry a payload of 500 g (about 15 times the self-weight) on horizontal planes or 20 g on vertical walls, and move in aquatic environments.},

It maps the 2-D strokes onto the 3-D surface and generates a robot motion to draw the mapped strokes using visual recognition, grasp pose reasoning, and motion planning. The system is flexible compared to conventional robotic drawing systems as we do not fix drawing tools to the end of a robot arm. Instead, a robot recognizes and picks up pens online and holds the pens to draw 3-D strokes. Meanwhile, the system has high robustness thanks to the following crafts: First, a high-quality mapping method is developed to minimize deformation in the strokes. Second, visual detection is used to reestimate the drawing tool’s pose before executing each drawing motion. Third, force control is employed to compensate for noisy visual detection and calibration and ensure a firm touch between the pen tip and the surface. Fourth, error detection and recovery are implemented to deal with slippage and other anomalies. The planning and executions are performed in a closed-loop manner until the strokes are successfully drawn. We evaluate the system and analyze the necessity of the various crafts using different real-world tasks. The results show that the proposed system is flexible and robust to generate robotic motion that picks up the pens and successfully draws 3-D strokes on given surfaces.},

  abstract     = {We propose a control framework, which can utilize tactile information by exploiting the complementarity structure of contact dynamics. Since many robotic tasks, like manipulation and locomotion, are fundamentally based in making and breaking contact with the environment, state-of-the-art control policies struggle to deal with the hybrid nature of multicontact motion. Such controllers often rely heavily upon heuristics or, due to the combinatorial structure in the dynamics, are unsuitable for real-time control. Principled deployment of tactile sensors offers a promising mechanism for stable and robust control, but modern approaches often use this data in an ad hoc manner, for instance to guide guarded moves. This framework can close the loop on tactile sensors and it is noncombinatorial, enabling optimization algorithms to automatically synthesize provably stable control policies. We demonstrate this approach on multiple numerical examples, including quasi-static friction problems and a high dimensional problem with 10 contacts. We also validate our results on an experimental setup and show the effectiveness of the proposed method on an underactuated multicontact system.},

  abstract     = {Complex manipulation tasks can contain various execution branches of primitive skills in sequence or in parallel under different scenarios. Manual specifications of such branching conditions and associated skill parameters are not only error-prone due to corner cases, but also quickly untraceable given a large number of objects and skills. On the other hand, learning from demonstration has increasingly shown to be an intuitive and effective way to program such skills for industrial robots. Parameterized skill representations allow generalization over new scenarios, which however makes the planning process much slower thus unsuitable for online applications. In this article, we propose a hierarchical and compositional planning framework that learns a geometric task network (GTN) from exhaustive planners, without any manual inputs. A GTN is a goal-dependent task graph that encapsulates both the transition relations among skill representations and the geometric constraints underlying these transitions. This framework has shown to improve dramatically the offline learning efficiency, the online performance, and the transparency of decision process, by leveraging the task-parameterized models. We demonstrate the approach on a 7-DoF robot arm both in simulation and on hardware solving various manipulation tasks.},

  abstract     = {Solving the inverse kinematics problem is a fundamental challenge in motion planning, control, and calibration for articulated robots. Kinematic models for these robots are typically parameterized by joint angles, generating a complicated mapping between the robot configuration and the end-effector pose. Alternatively, the kinematic model and task constraints can be represented using invariant distances between points attached to the robot. In this article, we formalize the equivalence of distance-based inverse kinematics and the distance geometry problem for a large class of articulated robots and task constraints. Unlike previous approaches, we use the connection between distance geometry and low-rank matrix completion to find inverse kinematics solutions by completing a partial Euclidean distance matrix through local optimization. Furthermore, we parameterize the space of Euclidean distance matrices with the Riemannian manifold of fixed-rank Gram matrices, allowing us to leverage a variety of mature Riemannian optimization methods. Finally, we show that bound smoothing can be used to generate informed initializations without significant computational overhead, improving convergence. We demonstrate that our inverse kinematics solver achieves higher success rates than traditional techniques and substantially outperforms them on problems that involve many workspace constraints.},

Motivated by the fact that modeling processes often introduce errors which interfere with the implementation of control strategies, here the abstraction process proceeds in reverse: the methodology does not abstract models; rather it models abstractions. Specifically, it first formalizes a template for a family of stochastic abstractions, and then fits the parameters of that template to match the dynamics of the underlying process and ground the abstraction. The article also shows how the parameter-fitting approach can be implemented based on a probabilistic model validation approach which draws from randomized algorithms, and results in a discrete abstract model which is approximately simulated by the actual process physics, at a desired confidence level. In this way, the models afford the implementation of symbolic control plans with probabilistic guarantees at a desired level of fidelity.},

To operate effectively under these changing conditions, algorithms developed for long-term autonomy applications require a stronger focus on robustness. Consequently, this work considers the ability to satisfy the operation-critical constraints of a disturbed system in a modular fashion, which means compatibility with different system objectives and disturbance representations. Toward this end, this article introduces a controller-synthesis approach to constraint satisfaction for disturbed control-affine dynamical systems by utilizing control barrier functions (CBFs). The aforementioned framework is constructed by modeling the disturbance as a union of convex hulls and leveraging previous work on CBFs for differential inclusions. This method of disturbance modeling grants compatibility with different disturbance-estimation methods. For example, this work demonstrates how a disturbance learned via a Gaussian process may be utilized in the proposed framework. These estimated disturbances are incorporated into the proposed controller-synthesis framework which is then tested on a fleet of robots in different scenarios.},

However, in the case where cameras can only capture a portion of the robot manipulator in order to better perceive the environment being interacted with, there is greater sensitivity to errors in calibration of the base-to-camera transform. A secondary source of uncertainty during robotic control are inaccuracies in joint angle measurements which can be caused by biases in positioning and complex transmission effects such as backlash and cable stretch. In this work, we bring together these two sets of unknown parameters into a unified problem formulation when the kinematic chain is partially visible in the camera view. We prove that these parameters are nonidentifiable implying that explicit estimation of them is infeasible. To overcome this, we derive a smaller set of parameters we call lumped error since it lumps together the errors of calibration and joint angle measurements. A particle filter method is presented and tested in simulation and on two real world robots to estimate the lumped error and show the efficiency of this parameter reduction.},

In this article, we formalize the problem of minimizing the total expected cost to perform multiple start-to-goal navigation tasks on a roadmap by introducing the learned reactive planning problem. We propose a method that captures information from past executions to learn a motion policy to handle obstacles that the robot has seen before. We propose the LAMP framework, which integrates the generated motion policy with an existing navigation stack. Finally, an extensive set of experiments in simulated and real-world environments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by 10\% to 40\% in terms of expected time to travel from start to goal.

Parts of this type (such as aircraft skin parts, wind turbine blades, etc.) are easily deformed due to their large scale and low stiffness. Therefore, these parts cannot be directly machined according to the designed model. A feasible method is to plan a robotic machining path by using the point clouds of parts after clamping from onsite measurement which contains inherent defects of measurement such as noise points and abrupt points. In this article, a novel method is proposed to plan and optimize a robotic machining path that meets the requirements of smoothness, dexterity, and stiffness based on the point cloud from onsite measurement. The dual nonuniform rational B-spline curves of the machining path points and tool axis points are generated at first. Next, an objective function of smoothness optimization is established to filter out the local mutation of the path by considering the constraints of both the deformation energy and the deviation. Then, the objective function of robot postures optimization is established to optimize dexterity and Cartesian stiffness of a robot during the machining process. To show the feasibility of the proposed method, simulation and experiments are carried out. It is proved that the proposed method can generate a smooth machining trajectory. The stability of joint rotation and the rigidity and dexterity of the robot are improved during the machining process.},

Two movable orthogonal microscopic cameras scan the microenvironment on the top view and side view to build a stereo occupancy map automatically. The initial position of microrobot can be located on the basis of the similarity curves generated by the scanning sequences. In accordance with the distribution characteristic of electromagnetic fields in workspace, an enhanced rapidly exploring random tree algorithm is proposed to avoid obstacles in the complex environment. To ensure continuous visual servo in wide range, a field-of-view tracking method is developed using a specific image definition evaluation algorithm. A prescribed performance controller with disturbance observer is designed, which guarantees that the microrobot can remain in the view of microscopic cameras, and the transient and steady-state performance of the system can satisfy the expected requirements. A set of experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed automatic 3D navigation strategy. Experimental results show that the microrobot can navigate automatically in a $\boldsymbol{12}\,\times 10\,\times \text{10-mm}$ microenvironment containing obstacles, and achieve reliable field-of-view tracking and path following at high speed.},

The safe operation of biomedical MRs requires fine control capabilities, which strongly depend on precise and robust feedback about their position over time. Ultrasound acoustic phase analysis (US-APA) may allow for a reliable feedback strategy for MR imaging and tracking in tissue. In this article, we combine task-specific magnetic actuation and related US-APA motion tracking to achieve closed-loop navigation of a magnetic MR, rolling on the boundary of a lumen in a tissue-mimicking phantom. A C-arm system attached to a robotic platform is used to precisely position the magnetic actuation source and US-APA detection unit within the workspace, thus enabling MR visual-servoing. In the first place, the proposed approach allows to perform supervised localization of the MR without any a-priori knowledge of its position. After localization, a robust real-time tracking enables closed-loop MR teleoperation in the phantom lumina over a travel distance of 80 mm (145 body lengths), both in static and counter flow, thus achieving an average position tracking error of 368 micron (0.67 body lengths). For the first time, our results validate US-APA as a reliable feedback strategy for visual-servoing control of MRs in simulated in-body environment.},

  abstract     = {The small size and wireless actuation of microrobots make them potential candidates for minimally invasive medicine. To advance microrobots to future clinical application, microrobotics researchers have investigated a number of key issues, in which swarm control is a primary challenge and is attracting increasing attention. As a single microrobot has limited volume and surface area, clinically relevant tasks, including in-vivo tracking, usually require simultaneous control of a large swarm of microrobots. Unlike macroscale robots, implementing on-board actuators and sensors for microrobots is challenging, which differentiates swarm microrobotics from other swarm robotics approaches. This article systematically summarizes the state of the art for this emerging field, including actuation systems with different power sources, swarm behaviors modeling and simulation, swarm control strategies, and targeted biomedical applications. Actuation principles of microrobot swarms are categorized in detail, and critical comparisons are made to provide guidance and insight for future swarm microrobotics researchers. Considering the unique features of swarm microrobotics compared to traditional swarm robotics, this article also emphasizes the modeling, simulation, and control of microrobot swarms. Furthermore, recent biomedical applications of microrobot swarms are summarized to illustrate specific application scenarios.

  abstract     = {This article provides a general framework for the use of low-impedance displacement sensors mounted on the links of a serial robot to provide an intuitive physical human–robot interaction. A general formulation is developed to handle the motion guidance problem, i.e., the mapping of the measured motion of the sensors into the required robot joint motions to provide intuitive responsiveness. The formulation is general and can be applied to any architecture of serial robot with any number of displacement sensors each having an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom. Then, the design of a novel three-degree-of-freedom low-impedance displacement sensor is presented as a particularly effective instantiation of the general concept. Partial force balancing is used to reduce the required elastic return action, thereby ensuring the low impedance of the interaction. A prototype of a three-degree-of-freedom displacement sensor is then introduced. Two such sensors are mounted on the links of a custom-built five-degree-of-freedom robot in order to demonstrate the proposed approach. Experimental results are provided and comparisons with other collaborative robots are given. It is shown that the proposed sensors and motion guidance approach yield very intuitive low-impedance interaction involving very low interaction forces.},

  abstract     = {For a lower limb exoskeleton, accurate and continuous estimation of the gait phase in real time is a fundamental requirement to provide a well-tailored assistive action at the proper time in the gait cycle (GC). This article presents a new gait phase estimator for a portable hip exoskeleton based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and adaptive oscillators. The algorithm is capable of continuously tracking the gait phase and identifying the relevant biomechanical gait events online, i.e., heel strike (HS) and toe-off (TO). The proposed method exploits only the hip joint angle signals measured by hip encoders, avoiding the need to use additional sensors to those already built in the exoskeleton. The novel phase estimator has been benchmarked against a state-of-the-art method, based on the maximum flexion angle (MFA), with pressure-sensitive insoles used as the reference ground truth for the event detection. To validate the method, two experimental activities were carried out. Experiments conducted with eight healthy subjects walking on a treadmill at different speeds, with and without hip assistance, demonstrated that the DWT-based method outperformed the MFA method in all operative conditions, reducing the rms of the phase reset error by 64.0\% in assistive mode, and identifying the HS and TO events with low delay (0.4\% and 1.1\% GC, respectively, for HS and TO). Experiments carried out with three transfemoral amputees showed similar performance, paving the way for clinical applications of the method.},

  abstract     = {Lumbar spine injuries caused by repetitive lifting rank as the most prevalent workplace injury in the United States. While these injuries are caused by both symmetric and asymmetric lifting, asymmetric is often more damaging. Many back devices do not address asymmetry, so we present a new system called the Asymmetric Back Exosuit (ABX). The ABX addresses this important gap through unique design geometry and active cable-driven actuation. The suit allows the user to move in a wide range of lumbar trajectories while the “X” pattern cable routing allows variable assistance application for these trajectories. We also conducted a biomechanical analysis in OpenSim to map assistive cable force to effective lumbar torque assistance for a given trajectory, allowing for intuitive controller design in the lumbar joint space over the complex kinematic chain for varying lifting techniques. Human subject experiments illustrated that the ABX reduced lumbar erector spinae muscle activation during symmetric and asymmetric lifting by an average of 37.8\% and 16.0\%, respectively, compared to lifting without the exosuit. This result indicates the potential for our device to reduce lumbar injury risk.},

The availability of tools for autonomously performing physiotherapy exercises increases their efficiency, provides supplementary information about results and progress, reduces physiotherapists’ efforts and the need of their physical presence during exercise sessions, and encourages autonomy and independence in people with disabilities. Nevertheless, supportive technologies developed without the inputs and feedback of the end-user throughout the design process are less likely to be adopted for their intended purpose and use case. In this article, we propose a modular hand/wrist exoskeleton that actuates the wrist flexion/extension and adduction/abduction motions and hand fingers flexion/extension motions.

  abstract     = {Shoulder-sideWINDER is an exoskeleton to assist the shoulder movement of workers performing manual tasks. It aims to minimize discomfort caused by a joint misalignment between the shoulder and an exoskeleton, which is a common problem with many closely coupled systems. Based on the shoulder’s musculoskeletal structure, we propose two novel misalignment correction mechanisms: center-of-rotation tracking mechanism and force-guiding mechanism. The center-of-rotation tracking mechanism compensates for the vertical misalignment that arises from the scapulohumeral rhythm. The force-guiding mechanism compensates for the horizontal misalignment due to changes in the plane of the arm elevation. The kinematic performance of reducing joint misalignment was evaluated using the angle ratio as the indicator under two conditions: with and without the center-of-rotation tracking mechanism. The muscle load caused by the kinematic disturbance was evaluated under three conditions: wearing the exoskeleton with and without the center-of-rotation tracking mechanism and not wearing the exoskeleton. The analysis used muscle load data measured by surface electromyography on five shoulder muscles. Five subjects executed 12 arm motions each, in 4 planes of elevation. Since the system was optimized for a pilot user, subjects with similar morphology presented positive results showing that the proposed mechanism reduced the misalignment in the dominant range of working motion. Apart from the anterior deltoid, the loads on muscles responsible for the dominant range of working motion also showed a significant reduction compared to the case without the mechanism. In conclusion, we verified that the Shoulder-sideWINDER provides comfortable support by reducing joint misalignment, and identified directions for design improvements that will further enhance usability.},

  abstract     = {State-of-the-art exoskeletons are typically limited by the low control bandwidth and small-range stiffness of actuators, which are based on high gear ratios and elastic components (e.g., series elastic actuators). Furthermore, most exoskeletons are based on discrete gait phase detection and/or discrete stiffness control, resulting in discontinuous torque profiles. To fill these two gaps, we developed a portable, lightweight knee exoskeleton using quasi-direct-drive (QDD) actuation that provides 14 N·m torque (36.8\% biological joint moment for overground walking). This article presents 1) stiffness modeling of torque-controlled QDD exoskeletons and 2) stiffness-based continuous torque controller that estimates knee joint moment in real-time. Experimental tests found that the exoskeleton had a high bandwidth of stiffness control (16 Hz under 100 N·m/rad) and high torque tracking accuracy with 0.34 N·m root mean square error (6.22\%) across 0–350 N·m/rad large-range stiffness. The continuous controller was able to estimate knee moments accurately and smoothly for three walking speeds and their transitions. Experimental results with eight able-bodied subjects demonstrated that our exoskeleton was able to reduce the muscle activities of all eight measured knee and ankle muscles by 8.60\%–15.22\% relative to the unpowered condition and two knee flexors and one ankle plantar flexor by 1.92\%–10.24\% relative to the baseline (no exoskeleton) condition.},

To accomplish this task, available stair ascent controllers impose a predefined joint impedance behavior or follow a preprogramed position trajectory. These control approaches have proved successful in the laboratory. However, they are not robust to changes in stair height or cadence, which is essential for real-world ambulation. Here, we present an adaptive stair ascent controller that enables individuals with above-knee amputations to climb stairs of varying stair heights at their preferred cadence and with their preferred gait patterns. We found that modulating the prosthesis knee and ankle position as a function of the user&#39;s thigh in swing provides toe clearance for varying stair heights. In stance, modulating the torque–angle relationship as a function of the prosthesis knee position at foot contact provides sufficient torque assistance for climbing stairs of different heights. Furthermore, the proposed controller enables individuals to climb stairs at their preferred cadence and gait patterns, such as step-by-step, step-over-step, and two-step. The proposed adaptive stair controller may improve the robustness of powered prostheses to environmental and human variance, enabling powered prostheses to more easily move from the lab to the real world.},

  abstract     = {Many assistive robotic devices have been developed to augment or assist human locomotion. Despite advancements in design and control algorithms, this task remains challenging. Human walking strategies are unique and complex, and assistance strategies based on the dynamics of unassisted locomotion typically offer only modest reductions to the metabolic cost of walking. Recently, human-in-the-loop (HIL) methodologies have been used to identify subject-specific assistive strategies, which offer significant improvements to energy savings. However, current implementations suffer from long measurement times, necessitating the use of low-dimensional control parameterizations, and possibly requiring multiday collection protocols to avoid subject fatigue. We present a HIL methodology, which optimizes the assistive torques provided by a powered hip exoskeleton. Using musculoskeletal modeling, we are able to evaluate simulated metabolic rate online. We applied our methodology to identify assistive torque profiles for seven subjects walking on a treadmill, and found greater reductions to metabolic cost when compared to generic or off-the-shelf controllers. In a secondary investigation, we directly compare simulated and measured metabolic rate for three subjects experiencing a range of assistance levels. The time investment required to identify assistance strategies via our protocol is significantly lower when compared to existing protocols relying on calorimetry. In the future, frameworks such as these could be used to enable shorter HIL protocols or exploit more complex control parameterizations for greater energy savings.},

  abstract     = {Powered exoskeletons for people with complete paraplegia have been controlled based on predefined joint-reference trajectories. As the target users of such robots may not realize any voluntary movement, the human body is fully constrained and follows the movement of the powered exoskeleton joints. The predefined gait pattern, however, may or may not be adequate for every user because the gait pattern is resulting from complex interactions between the body segments and environment, as well as dynamic characteristics of the body segments. As all the persons and their body segments have different dynamic characteristics, therefore, a bespoke tuning of gait parameters is necessary in order to realize the natural gait motion, which is optimal for each user. In this article, an adaptive gait pattern adjustment method is proposed. The proposed method observes the ground contact timing, which is directly related to the adequacy of the gait pattern for the user wearing a robot. Based on the ground contact timing, the joint-reference trajectories are adjusted, which are parameterized by the trunk inclination angle. The proposed method iteratively calculates an appropriate trunk inclination angle from the information of ground contact timing. In this article, the derivation of the proposed method and its experimental verification with WalkON Suit, a powered exoskeleton, are introduced. The proposed algorithm successfully worked for two practical users with complete paraplegia, and the adapted gait patterns showed excessive performance in walking speed, oxygen consumption, palm force on crutches, etc. The results were also verified by winning both gold and bronze medals in the global competition, Cybathlon 2020, while accomplishing the best records among all the teams.},

We propose a new human-machine interface to simultaneously drive bilateral ankle exoskeletons during a range of “unseen” walking conditions and transitions that were not used for establishing the control interface. The proposed approach used person-specific neuromechanical models to estimate biological ankle joint torques in real-time from measured electromyograms (EMGS) and joint angles. We call this “neuromechanical model-based control” (NMBC). NMBC enabled six individuals to voluntarily control a bilateral ankle exoskeleton across six walking conditions, including all intermediate transitions, i.e., two walking speeds, each performed at three ground elevations. A single subject case-study was carried out on a dexterous locomotion tasks involving moonwalking. NMBC always enabled reducing biological ankle torques, as well as eight ankle muscle EMGs both within (22\% torque;12\% EMG) and between walking conditions (24\% torque; 14\% EMG) when compared to non-assisted conditions. Torque and EMG reductions in novel walking conditions indicated that the exoskeleton operated symbiotically, as an exomuscle controlled by the operator.s neuromuscular system. This opens new avenues for the systematic adoption of wearable robots as part of out-of-the-lab medical and occupational settings.},

  abstract     = {The intention-detection strategy used to drive an exosuit is fundamental to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of the device. Yet, current literature on wearable soft robotics lacks evidence on the comparative performance of different control approaches for online intention-detection. In the present work, we compare two different and complementary controllers on a wearable robotic suit, previously formulated and tested by our group; a model-based myoelectric control ( myoprocessor ), which estimates the joint torque from the activation of target muscles, and a force control that estimates human torques using an inverse dynamics model ( dynamic arm ). We test them on a cohort of healthy participants performing tasks replicating functional activities of daily living involving a wide range of dynamic movements. Our results suggest that both controllers are robust and effective in detecting human–motor interaction, and show comparable performance for augmenting muscular activity. In particular, the biceps brachii activity was reduced by up to 74\% under the assistance of the dynamic arm and up to 47\% under the myoprocessor , compared to a no-suit condition. However, the myoprocessor outperformed the dynamic arm in promptness and assistance during movements that involve high dynamics. The exosuit work normalized with respect to the overall work was $68.84 \pm 3.81\%$ when it was ran by the myoprocessor , compared to $45.29 \pm 7.71\%$ during the dynamic arm condition. The reliability and accuracy of motor intention detection strategies in wearable device is paramount for both the efficacy and acceptability of this technology. In this article, we offer a detailed analysis of the two most widely used control approaches, trying to highlight their intrinsic structural differences and to discuss their different and complementary performance.},

The proposed framework fundamentally generalizes the conventional passivity-based approaches to the coupled stability problem. In particular, it allows for stabilization of not necessarily passive robot-environment interaction where both the manipulator and the environment are dissipative systems with quadratic supply rates. In contrast with existing results, the proposed framework can be used in combination with an arbitrary robot’s tracking control algorithm, and its stabilizing action when in contact with environment does not affect the robot’s trajectory tracking performance in free space. The framework is based on the recently developed nonplanar conic systems formalism and generalized scattering-based stabilization methods.

However, mobile robots can only observe a fraction of the environment at a time, while the activity patterns of people may also change at different times. This article introduces a new methodology for mobile robot exploration to maximize the knowledge of human activity patterns by deciding where and when to collect observations. We introduce an exploration policy driven by the entropy levels in a spatio-temporal map of pedestrian flows, and compare multiple spatio-temporal exploration strategies including both informed and uninformed approaches. The evaluation is performed by simulating mobile robot exploration using real sensory data from three long-term pedestrian datasets. The results show that for certain scenarios the models built with proposed exploration system can better predict the flow patterns than uninformed strategies, allowing the robot to move in a more socially compliant way, and that the exploration ratio is a key factor when it comes to the model prediction accuracy.},

This article investigates the attitude holding task of a robotic fish swimming in reality. Such a typical sensing-based control task requires the fish to keep a desired angle of attack in an unknown and even varied incoming flow. To this end, we propose a learning-based approach by using a deep neural network directly maps the raw data of sensors equipped on the robot to the continuous control signals in an end-to-end manner. First, based on experimental data of the physical robot, we construct a data-driven simulation environment including three modules of dynamic, sensor, and control. The dynamic and sensor modules are established to model the dynamics of the fish and to generate its sensors’ data, based on which a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm in the control module is trained to get a control policy. Then, we directly deploy the trained policy to a physical robotic fish for attitude holding task. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the DRL policy and, thus, verify the success of our approach to achieving sim-to-real transfer.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) holds vast potential for transportation systems through improved safety, efficiency, and access to mobility. However, the progression of these impacts, as AVs are adopted, is not well understood. Numerous technical challenges arise from the goal of analyzing the partial adoption of autonomy: partial control and observation, multivehicle interactions, and the sheer variety of scenarios represented by real-world networks. To shed light into near-term AV impacts, this article studies the suitability of deep reinforcement learning (RL) for overcoming these challenges in a low AV-adoption regime. A modular learning framework is presented, which leverages deep RL to address complex traffic dynamics. Modules are composed to capture common traffic phenomena (stop-and-go traffic jams, lane changing, intersections). Learned control laws are found to improve upon human driving performance, in terms of system-level velocity, by up to 57\% with only 4–7\% adoption of AVs. Furthermore, in single-lane traffic, a small neural network control law with only local observation is found to eliminate stop-and-go traffic—surpassing all known model-based controllers to achieve near-optimal performance—and generalize to out-of-distribution traffic densities.},

Several robotic platforms have been developed to provide these therapies in a quantifiable manner to complement healthcare personnel in resource-strapped long-term care settings. However, these platforms are primarily limited to one-to-one human–robot interaction (HRI) and thus do not enhance social interaction. In this article, we present a novel HRI framework and a realized platform called socially assistive robotic ( SAR)-Connect to foster robot-mediated social interaction among older adults through carefully designed tasks that also incorporate physical and cognitive stimuli. SAR-Connect seamlessly integrates a humanoid robot with a virtual reality-based activity platform and a multimodal data acquisition module including game interaction, audio, visual, and electroencephalography responses of the participants. Results from a laboratory-based user study with older adults indicates the potential of SAR-Connect that showed this system could 1) involve one or multiple older adults to perform multidomain activities and provide dynamic guidance, 2) engage them in the robot-mediated task and foster human–human interaction, and 3) quantify their social and activity engagement from multiple sensory modalities.},

In this article, a novel impedance modulation strategy of a lower-limb exoskeleton is proposed to provide appropriate power and balance assistance during STS movements while preserving the wearer’s control priority. The impedance modulation control strategy ensures adaptation of the mechanical impedance of the human–exoskeleton system toward a desired one requiring less wearer’s effect while reinforcing the wearer’s balance control ability during STS movements. A human joint torque observer is designed to estimate the joint torques developed by the wearer using joint position kinematics instead of electromyography or force sensors; a time-varying desired impedance model is proposed according to the wearer’s lower-limb motion ability. A virtual environmental force is designed for balance reinforcement control. Stability and robustness of the proposed method are theoretically analyzed. Simulations are implemented to illustrate the characteristics and performance of the proposed approach. Experiments with four healthy subjects are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show satisfactory results in terms of appropriate power assist and balance reinforcement.},

The CM is equipped with flexible debriding instruments and fiber Bragg grating sensors. The surgeon plans on the patient’s preoperative computed tomography and the robotic system performs the task autonomously under the surgeon’s supervision. An optimization-based controller generates control commands on the fly to execute the task while satisfying physical and safety constraints. The system design and controller are discussed and extensive simulation, phantom and human cadaver experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance, workspace, and dexterity in confined spaces. Mean and standard deviation of target placement are 0.5 and 0.18 mm, and the robotic system covers 91\% of the workspace behind an acetabular implant in treatment of hip osteolysis, compared to the 54\% that is achieved by conventional rigid tools.},

  abstract     = {In robots, nonprehensile manipulation operations such as pushing are a useful way of moving large, heavy, or unwieldy objects, moving multiple objects at once, or reducing uncertainty in the location or pose of objects. In this study, we propose a reactive and adaptive method for robotic pushing that uses rich feedback from a high-resolution optical tactile sensor to control push movements instead of relying on analytical or data-driven models of push interactions. Specifically, we use goal-driven tactile exploration to actively search for stable pushing configurations that cause the object to maintain its pose relative to the pusher while incrementally moving the pusher and object toward the target. We evaluate our method by pushing objects across planar and curved surfaces. For planar surfaces, we show that the method is accurate and robust to variations in initial contact position/angle, object shape, and start position; for curved surfaces, the performance is degraded slightly. An immediate consequence of our work is that it shows that explicit models of push interactions might be sufficient but are not necessary for this type of task. It also raises the interesting question of which aspects of the system should be modeled to achieve the best performance and generalization across a wide range of scenarios. Finally, it highlights the importance of testing on nonplanar surfaces and in other more complex environments when developing new methods for robotic pushing.},

Custom, variable-curvature shapes are possible by varying the notch parameters along the tubes. In this article, we present a planar, variable-curvature mechanics model for the actuated segment shape and a method for designing the notch pattern to achieve a desired planar, variable-curvature shape with maximal stiffness within specified strain limits.

In order to synthetically impose both motion accuracy and active compliance for dedicated wrist manipulations, a robust hybrid control method is proposed that can switch between motion control (at free motion) and impedance control (at interactions with the environment). A sliding manifold is formulated so that when the control law drives the sliding manifold to zero, the motion/impedance errors will automatically converge to bounded regions despite system uncertainties/inaccuracies. Due to the direct-drive configuration of the proposed spherical wrist, the contact torque can be precisely estimated with an observer, providing an intuitive criterion of contact based on which the control modes can switch autonomously without external force/torque sensors and predefined geometric boundaries that are usually required in conventional hybrid force/position control. The concept is validated on a spherical wrist test-bed in the context of a throat swabbing process. The performance of the hybrid motion-impedance control evaluated against conventional impedance and admittance control methods demonstrate that the proposed spherical wrist enables a robotic system with both fine manipulations and smooth compliant interactions in wrist space.},

This article presents a formulation of the robotic packing problem that ensures stability of the object pile during packing and the feasibility of the robot motion while maximizing packing density. A constructive packing algorithm is proposed to address this problem by searching over the space of item positions and orientations. Moreover, a new heightmap minimization heuristic is shown to outperform existing heuristics in the literature in the presence of nonconvex objects. Two strategies for improving the robustness of executed packing plans are also proposed: 1) conservative planning ensures plan feasibility under uncertainty in model parameters; and 2) closed-loop packing uses vision sensors to measure placement errors and replans to correct for them. The proposed planner and error mitigation strategies are evaluated in simulation and on a state-of-the-art physical packing testbed. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed planner generates high-quality packing plans, and the error mitigation strategies improve success rates beyond an open-loop baseline from 83\% to 100\% on five-item orders.},

  abstract     = {This article develops a mechanical screwing tool and its manipulation policies for two-finger parallel robotic grippers. The tool is based on a combined scissor-like element (SLE) and double-ratchet mechanism that converts the gripping motion of two-finger parallel grippers into a continuous rotation to realize tasks like fastening screws. The tool is entirely mechanical. There is no need for external cable connections. The manuscript includes two parts. For one thing, it shows the details of the tool design, optimizes the tool’s dimensions and effective stroke lengths, and studies the contacts and forces to achieve stable grasping and screwing. For another, it presents the related manipulation and control policies, including recognizing the tool, changing tool poses, and completing screw fastening tasks. The designed tool, together with the related manipulation and control policies, are analyzed and verified in several real-world applications. The results show that the tool has satisfying mechanical properties. Robots with parallel grippers can robustly and flexibly use the tool to fasten screws. The tool can also be used collaboratively with other tools to finish difficult tasks. In the future, similar tools are expected to replace special-purpose end-effectors or tool changers for more flexible robot integration.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present an efficient planning system for automated vehicles in highly interactive environments (EPSILON). EPSILON is an efficient interaction-aware planning system for automated driving, and is extensively validated in both simulation and real-world dense city traffic. It follows a hierarchical structure with an interactive behavior planning layer and an optimization-based motion planning layer. The behavior planning is formulated from a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), but is much more efficient than naively applying a POMDP to the decision-making problem. The key to efficiency is guided branching in both the action space and observation space, which decomposes the original problem into a limited number of closed-loop policy evaluations. Moreover, we introduce a new driver model with a safety mechanism to overcome the risk induced by the potential imperfectness of prior knowledge. For motion planning, we employ a spatio-temporal semantic corridor (SSC) to model the constraints posed by complex driving environments in a unified way. Based on the SSC, a safe and smooth trajectory is optimized, complying with the decision provided by the behavior planner. We validate our planning system in both simulations and real-world dense traffic, and the experimental results show that our EPSILON achieves human-like driving behaviors in highly interactive traffic flow smoothly and safely without being overconservative compared to the existing planning methods.},

  abstract     = {Interest in multirobot systems is rising rapidly both in academia and in industry. The use of multiple robots working in a coordinated way, rather than a single robot, has several advantages in a diverse range of applications. However, few studies have focused on operations in which robots can behave maliciously and alter the outcome of the collective mission. In this article, we present a set of Byzantine Follow The Leader (BFTL) problems, in which a subset of robots in the system shows unintended or inconsistent behavior (i.e., Byzantine robots). In the BFTL problems, leaders discover routes from their starting positions to specific destinations and guide the followers , while Byzantine robots try to hinder the leaders and mislead the followers. In this research, blockchain technology is used as a communication tool within multirobot systems, for leaders to broadcast directions to the whole group. We propose algorithms to tackle the BFTL problems, prove their correctness, and validate them in simulated experiments of realistic scenarios. Results show that the proposed algorithms mitigate the impact of Byzantine robots in multirobot systems conducting a BFTL mission. Our analysis provides minimum and maximum boundary calculations for important metrics including number of robots reaching their destination, number of steps taken, and weight requirements of the chain used during the mission. Our results provide a path toward the deployment of byzantine-resistant real-world multirobot systems.},

We propose procedures for designing cooperative sweeping processes that ensure successful completion of the task, thereby deriving conditions on the sweeping velocity of the agents and their paths. Successful completion of the task means that evaders with a known limit on their velocity cannot escape detection by the sweeping agents. A simpler task for the sweeping swarm is the confinement of the evaders to their initial domain. The feasibility of completing these tasks depends on geometric and dynamic constraints that impose a lower bound on the velocity the sweeping agent must have. This critical velocity is derived to ensure the achievement of the confinement task. Increasing the velocity above the lower bound enables the agents to complete the search task as well. We present results on the total search time for two types of novel pincer-movement search processes, circular and spiral, for any even number of sweeping agents. The proposed spiral process allows detection of all evaders while sweeping at velocities that approach the theoretical lower bound.},

Such operation for drones is challenging due to complex aerodynamic interaction forces, such as downwash generated by nearby drones and ground effect. Conventional planning and control methods neglect capturing these interaction forces, resulting in sparse swarm configuration during flight. Our approach combines a physics-based nominal dynamics model with learned deep neural networks with strong Lipschitz properties. We make use of two techniques to accurately predict the aerodynamic interactions between heterogeneous multirotors: 1) Spectral normalization for stability and generalization guarantees of unseen data and 2) heterogeneous deep sets for supporting any number of heterogeneous neighbors in a permutation-invariant manner without reducing expressiveness. The learned residual dynamics benefit both the proposed interaction-aware multirobot motion planning and the nonlinear tracking control design because the learned interaction forces reduce the modelling errors. Experimental results demonstrate that Neural-Swarm2 is able to generalize to larger swarms beyond training cases and significantly outperforms a baseline nonlinear tracking controller with up to three times reduction in worst-case tracking errors.},

Based on the realistic assumptions that each robot is subject to both state and input constraints and can have only local view and local information, a fully distributed multirobot motion coordination strategy is proposed. For each robot, the motion coordination strategy consists of three layers. An offline layer precomputes the braking area for each region in the workspace, the controlled transition system, and a so-called potential function. An initialization layer outputs an initially safely satisfying trajectory. An online coordination layer resolves conflicts when one occurs. The online coordination layer is further decomposed into three steps. First, a conflict detection algorithm is implemented, which detects conflicts with neighboring robots. Whenever conflicts are detected, a rule is designed to assign dynamically a planning order to each pair of neighboring robots. Finally, a sampling-based algorithm is designed to generate local collision-free trajectories for the robot, which at the same time guarantees the feasibility of the specification. Safety is proven to be guaranteed for all robots at any time. The effectiveness and the computational tractability of the resulting solution is verified numerically by two case studies.},

We present a novel samara-inspired autorotating craft that is capable of two flight modes (autorotating mode and diving mode) with an average glide angle of 28.9 $^{\circ }$ (1.81 m lateral distance per 1 m loss of altitude) in the former mode. The bidirectional transition between the two modes and directional control is achieved by using only a single actuator. Also, in order to minimize its glide angle, a design optimization methodology is presented for our prototype, diving samara autorotating wing, along with a new cyclic control strategy for directional control of autorotating descent. The dynamic model, simulated in a six degrees-of-freedom environment using the blade element theory, is integrated with genetic algorithm to derive parameters for the wing geometry, flap angle for autorotation, and the proposed cyclic control. The physical prototype autorotates at a descent velocity of 1.43 m/s and rotation speed 4.17 Hz, and is able to transit to diving mode in an average duration of 272 ms to increase its descent velocity by at least 17.6 times. At any point during the dive, it is able to transit back into autorotation in an average duration of 327 ms. Semioutdoor experiments were used to investigate the bidirectional transitions and verify the glide angle (28.9 $^{\circ }$ ), which is much improved from the previous prototype (SAW+, 58.4 $^{\circ }$ ). Lastly, as a demonstration of a real-life deployment scenario and environmental conditions, the prototypes were dropped from a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle at a suburban test site.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a method for cave surveying in total darkness using an autonomous aerial vehicle equipped with a depth camera for mapping, downward-facing camera for state estimation, and forward and downward lights. Traditional methods of cave surveying are labor-intensive and dangerous due to the risk of injury when operating in darkness, and the potential structural instability of the subterranean environment. Although these dangers can be mitigated by deploying robots to map dangerous passages and voids, real-time feedback is often needed to operate robots safely and efficiently. Few state-of-the-art, high-resolution perceptual modeling techniques attempt to reduce their high bandwidth requirements to work well with low bandwidth communication channels. To bridge this gap in the state-of- the-art, this work compactly represents sensor observations as Gaussian mixture models and maintains a local occupancy grid map for a motion planner that greedily maximizes an information-theoretic objective function. The approach accommodates both limited field of view (FoV) depth cameras and larger FoV LiDAR sensors and is extensively evaluated in long duration simulations on an embedded PC. An aerial system is leveraged to demonstrate the repeatability of the approach in a flight arena as well as the effects of communication dropouts. Finally, the system is deployed in Laurel Caverns, a commercially owned and operated cave in southwestern Pennsylvania, USA, and a wild cave in West Virginia, USA.

Our approach is particularly suited to describe how uncertainty propagates when the extended pose represents the state of an inertial measurement unit (IMU). In particular, it allows revisiting the theory of IMU preintegration on manifold and reaching a further theoretic level in this field. Exact preintegration formulas that account for rotating earth, that is, centrifugal force and Coriolis force, are derived as a byproduct, and the factors are shown to be more accurate. The approach is validated through extensive simulations and applied to sensor fusion where a loosely coupled fixed-lag smoother fuses IMU and LiDAR on 1-h-long experiments using our experimental car. It shows how handling rotating earth may be beneficial for long-term navigation within incremental smoothing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, onboard self-localization (OSL) methods based on cameras or lidar have achieved many significant progresses. However, some issues such as estimation drift and robustness in low-texture environment still remain inherent challenges for OSL methods. On the other hand, infrastructure-based methods can generally overcome these issues, but at the expense of some installation cost. This poses an interesting problem of how to effectively combine these methods, so as to achieve localization with long-term consistency as well as flexibility compared to any single method. To this end, we propose a comprehensive optimization-based estimator for the 15-D state of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), fusing data from an extensive set of sensors: inertial measurement unit (IMU), ultrawideband (UWB) ranging sensors, and multiple onboard visual-inertial and lidar odometry subsystems. In essence, a sliding window is used to formulate a sequence of robot poses, where relative rotational and translational constraints between these poses are observed in the IMU preintegration and OSL observations, while orientation and position are coupled in the body-offset UWB range observations. An optimization-based approach is developed to estimate the trajectory of the robot in this sliding window. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme in multiple scenarios, including experiments on public datasets, high-fidelity graphical-physical simulation, and field-collected data from UAV flight tests. The result demonstrates that our integrated localization method can effectively resolve the drift issue, while incurring minimal installation requirements.},

We propose a novel model-predictive control (MPC) method for limiting the risk of unsafety even when the true distribution of the obstacles’ movements deviates, within an ambiguity set , from the empirical distribution obtained using a limited amount of sample data. By choosing the ambiguity set as a statistical ball with its radius measured by the Wasserstein metric , we achieve a probabilistic guarantee of the out-of-sample risk , evaluated using new sample data generated independently of the training data. To resolve the infinite-dimensionality issue inherent in the distributionally robust MPC problem, we reformulate it as a finite-dimensional nonlinear program using modern distributionally robust optimization techniques based on the Kantorovich duality principle. To find a globally optimal solution in the case of affine dynamics and output equations, a spatial branch-and-bound algorithm is designed using McCormick relaxation. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated and analyzed through simulation studies using nonlinear dynamic and kinematic vehicle models and a linearized quadrotor model. The simulation results indicate that, even when the sample size is small, the proposed method can successfully avoid randomly moving obstacles with a guarantee of out-of-sample risk, while its sample average approximation counterpart fails to do so.},

  abstract     = {Planning high-speed trajectories for UAVs in unknown environments requires algorithmic techniques that enable fast reaction times to guarantee safety as more information about the environment becomes available. The standard approaches that ensure safety by enforcing a “stop” condition in the free-known space can severely limit the speed of the vehicle, especially in situations where much of the world is unknown. Moreover, the ad-hoc time and interval allocation scheme usually imposed on the trajectory also leads to conservative and slower trajectories. This work proposes FASTER (Fast and Safe Trajectory Planner) to ensure safety without sacrificing speed. FASTER obtains high-speed trajectories by enabling the local planner to optimize in both the free-known and unknown spaces. Safety is ensured by always having a safe back-up trajectory in the free-known space. The MIQP formulation proposed also allows the solver to choose the trajectory interval allocation. FASTER is tested extensively in simulation and in real hardware, showing flights in unknown cluttered environments with velocities up to 7.8 m/s, and experiments at the maximum speed of a skid-steer ground robot (2 m/s).},

  abstract     = {In robotics, ergodic control extends the tracking principle by specifying a probability distribution over an area to cover instead of a trajectory to track. The original problem is formulated as a spectral multiscale coverage problem, typically requiring the spatial distribution to be decomposed as Fourier series. This approach does not scale well to control problems requiring exploration in search space of more than two dimensions. To address this issue, we propose the use of tensor trains, a recent low-rank tensor decomposition technique from the field of multilinear algebra. The proposed solution is efficient, both computationally and storagewise, hence making it suitable for its online implementation in robotic systems. The approach is applied to a peg-in-hole insertion task requiring full 6-D end-effector poses, implemented with a seven-axis Franka Emika Panda robot. In this experiment, ergodic exploration allows the task to be achieved without requiring the use of force/torque sensors.},

Formal results are presented concerning length optimal trajectories under a nonholonomic metric, more specifically, an analysis about necessary or sufficient conditions for the local planners is provided. The analysis makes use of the case of finding time-optimal trajectories for differential drive robots. Later, relevant concepts for complex robotic systems such as detachability and time dominance are introduced. Detachability is a property over the cost functional such that, if respected, it allows the reusability of previously designed local planners for simpler systems into more complex ones. The introduced concepts are further illustrated through a robotic system comprised of a mobile manipulator robot equipped with a camera in the arm’s end-effector, whose task is to move between states maintaining a desired object within its field of view. Experiments in a physical mobile manipulator robot are shown, which validate the proposed theoretical modeling.},

These planning problems come up surprisingly frequently, such as in robot manipulation for performing daily life assistive tasks. However, few solutions to constrained motion planning are available, and those that exist struggle with high computational time complexity in finding a path solution on the manifolds. To address this challenge, we present Constrained Motion Planning Networks X (CoMPNetX). It is a neural planning approach, comprising a conditional deep neural generator and discriminator with neural gradients-based fast projection operator. We also introduce neural task and scene representations conditioned on which the CoMPNetX generates implicit manifold configurations to turbo-charge any underlying classical planner such as sampling-based motion planning methods for quickly solving complex constrained planning tasks. We show that our method finds path solutions with high success rates and lower computation times than state-of-the-art traditional path-finding tools on various challenging scenarios.},

This fact allows the normalization of the time-varying vector field such that it has a constant norm without any negative effect for convergence. We present convergence proofs for the proposed normalized time-varying vector field and demonstrate the existence of ultimate bounds in the case bounded disturbances are present.

Since, from a practical point of view, forward parallel parking is usually not advisable, it is not addressed in this work. By moving the effort from motion planning to control, the parking tasks can be completely defined solely from the detected empty parking spots. Additionally, the classical compromise between completeness and computational efficiency when compared to exploration-based path planning techniques is eliminated. The results of a few individual cases are presented and compared against a state-of-the-art path planning approach to illustrate the behavior and performance of the proposed framework as well as results from exhaustive simulations to assess its convergence. As shown in the convergence analyses, the presented approach allows us to park from virtually any sensible initial pose.

One promising direction is to pose safety requirements as planning constraints in nonlinear, nonconvex optimization problems of motion synthesis. However, many implementations of this approach are limited by uncertain convergence and local optimality of the solutions achieved, affecting overall robustness. To improve upon these issues, we propose a novel two-stage optimization framework: In the first stage, we find a solution to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation of the motion synthesis problem, the output of which initializes a second nonlinear programming (NLP) stage. The MILP stage enforces hard constraints of safety and road rule compliance generating a solution in the right subspace, while the NLP stage refines the solution within the safety bounds for feasibility and smoothness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework via simulated experiments of complex urban driving scenarios, outperforming a state-of-the-art baseline in metrics of convergence, comfort, and progress.},

To better facilitate the applications, it is critical to establish general and precise models for different types of TCAs (e.g., self-coiled, free-stroke, conical, etc.). Although several modeling methods have been proposed recently, existing models either fail to capture the nonlinearity during large deformations or cannot model TCAs with nonuniform geometries. In this work, we establish a general framework for modeling TCAs using Cosserat rod theory that can capture the nonlinearity of large deformations and simulate TCAs with nonuniform geometries. Furthermore, we show existing methods are special cases of our general model. Comprehensive statics and dynamics experiments are conducted to verify the proposed model, and the results demonstrate that the model is more accurate than existing ones, especially when a TCA is subject to large deformations.

Our method constructs implicitly defined manifolds of feasible periodic gaits within a state-time-control space that parameterizes the biped’s hybrid trajectories. Since equilibrium configurations of the biped often belong to such manifolds, we use equilibria as “templates” from which to grow the gait families. Equilibria are reliable seeds for the construction of gait families, eliminating the need for random, intuited, or bio-inspired initial guesses at feasible trajectories in an optimization framework. We demonstrate the approach on several 2-D and 3-D biped walkers.},

  abstract     = {Reactivity to unforeseen disturbances is one of the most crucial characteristics for biped robots to walk robustly in the real world. Nevertheless, conventional walking methods generally have limited capability for generating rapid reactions to disturbances, because in these methods it is necessary to wait until the end of the preplanned time period to proceed to the next phase. In this study, to improve reactivity, we develop an event-based finite-state machine (E-FSM) for walking pattern generation. Reactivity is enhanced by determining the state transition conditions of the E-FSM only with time-independent events based on the present robot state. Moreover, in the E-FSM, the robot can walk robustly even when the center of mass and the swing foot motion are disturbed, by employing the capture point concept combined with a new swing foot position constraint. Finally, we propose to control the walking robot by incorporating the E-FSM with an inverse dynamics-based motion/force controller to achieve compliant behavior. This can provide safe responses to external disturbances. The developed method is verified by experiments on a 12-degrees-of-freedom torque-controlled biped robot while it locomotes under irregular external disturbances applied to the upper body or swing leg.},

  abstract     = {Locomotion in animals provides a model for adaptive behavior as it is able to deal with various kinds of perturbations. Work in insects suggests that this evolved flexibility results from a modular architecture, which can be characterized by a recurrent neural network allowing for various emerging attractor states. Whereas a lower control-level coordinates joint movements on a short timescale, a higher-level handles action selection on longer timescales. Implementation of such a control system on a walking hexapod robot was able to deal with various walking patterns including disturbances such as uneven terrain or loss of a leg. Here, we propose a cognitive expansion to the adaptive control system that allows dealing with novel challenging situations. This approach makes use of an internal simulation-based planner that is triggered when the model-free controller fails to recover from an unstable pose. Using a grounded internal body model, the planner then tries, in internal simulation, different solutions out of context, and thus, proposes a new plan to be executed on the real robot. We demonstrate the feasibility of this control approach for walking over terrain with uncertain footholds in three scenarios.},

The proposed approach first develops a method to calculate the probability of task failure for an arbitrary trajectory based on its failure scenarios, which are efficiently computed by identifying the ranges of task point self-motion manifolds. Then, a novel trajectory planning algorithm is proposed to find the optimal trajectory with maximum probability of task completion. The planning algorithm exploits the overlap of self-motion manifold bounding boxes, as opposed to always using the shortest distance, to determine an optimal trajectory. The proposed trajectory planning algorithm is demonstrated on planar positioning 3R, spatial positioning 4R, and spatial positioning/orienting 7R redundant robots, resulting in average improvement of 17\%, 22\%, and 30\%, respectively, compared to the best shortest distance trajectory.},

Humans have many more degrees of freedom than are required to accomplish their tasks, but given neuromechanical limitations, it seems unlikely that biology relies on precise models or complex computation. An alternative biologically inspired approach leverages the compositionality of mechanical impedance. In theory, nullspace projection eliminates any conflict between two tasks. In contrast, superposition of task-space impedance and a full-rank joint-space impedance may impose a task conflict. This work compared nullspace projection with impedance superposition during unconstrained motion and forceful physical interaction. In practice, despite their theoretical differences, we did not observe a substantial influence of the nullspace projector weighting matrix. We found that nullspace projection and impedance superposition both resulted in measurable task conflict. Remarkably, when the dimensionality of the nullspace was increased, impedance superposition was comparable to nullspace projection.},

However, according to our theoretical analysis, the torque control methods of series elastic actuators (SEAs) are often limited by the fact that the acceleration signals are amplified by the control gains. Since the acceleration signals are often affected by differentiation noise, the analysis may become invalid in practice. To alleviate this limitation, we propose the use of the so-called series viscoelastic actuator (SvEA), which significantly reduces the acceleration amplification. Consequently, in contrast to the SEA case, the theoretical analysis of an SvEA-based FJR is valid in real implementations. We would like to highlight the fact that the theoretical analysis (more specifically, passivity analysis) is performed for nonlinear robot dynamics without linearization. As a result, the passive impedance controller can be realized more robustly with enhanced inner-loop torque control.},

Differently from many existing studies about remotely operated robots with firm grasping capabilities, we consider the case in which, in principle, the object can break its contact with the robot end-effector. The proposed shared-control approach automatically regulates the remote robot motion commanded by the user and the end-effector orientation to prevent the object from sliding over the tray. Furthermore, the human operator is provided with haptic cues informing about the discrepancy between the commanded and executed robot motion, which assist the operator throughout the task execution. We carried out trajectory tracking experiments employing an autonomous 7-degree-of-freedom (DoF) manipulator and compared the results obtained using the proposed approach with two different control schemes (i.e., constant tray orientation and no motion adjustment). We also carried out a human-subjects study involving 18 participants in which a 3-DoF haptic device was used to teleoperate the robot linear motion and display haptic cues to the operator. In all experiments, the results clearly show that our control approach outperforms the other solutions in terms of sliding prevention, robustness, commands tracking, and user’s preference.},

We demonstrate that the evolving Gaussian process (E-GP) method applied to measurements from the agents can predict the evolution of the field within the realistic simulation environment, Weed World. This method also provides physical insight into the seed bank distribution of the field. In this work, we extend the E-GP model in two important ways. First, we have developed a model that has a bias term, and we show how it is connected to the seed bank distribution. Second, we show that one may decouple the component of the model representing weed growth from the component, which varies with the seed bank distribution, and adapt the latter online. We compare this predictive approach with one that relies on known properties of the weed growth model and show that the E-GP method can drive down the total weed biomass for fields with high seed bank densities using less agents, without assuming this model information. We use an improved planning index, the Whittle index, which allows a balanced tradeoff between exploiting a row or allowing it to accrue reward and conforms to what we show is the theoretical limit for the fewest number of agents, which can be used in this domain.},

In this article, we define the singularity conditions for continuum parallel robots. We provide a straightforward interpretation of the phenomena occurring in singularities. Especially, we prove that some singularities appear when the robot potential energy has a local isovalue. Because of this property, we show that these singularities separate the stable configurations from the unstable ones in the workspace.

A kinematic model using Cosserat rod theory is derived, which is based on modeling the system as a set of eccentrically aligned precurved tubes constrained along their length by an elastic backbone. The specific case of a two-arm sheath is considered in detail. Simulation and experiments are used to investigate and validate the concept and model.},

  abstract     = {This article presents MADER, a 3-D decentralized and asynchronous trajectory planner for UAVs that generates collision-free trajectories in environments with static obstacles, dynamic obstacles, and other planning agents. Real-time collision avoidance with other dynamic obstacles or agents is done by performing outer polyhedral representations of every interval of the trajectories and then including the plane that separates each pair of polyhedra as a decision variable in the optimization problem. MADER uses our recently developed MINVO basis to obtain outer polyhedral representations with volumes 2.36 and 254.9 times, respectively, smaller than the Bernstein or B-Spline bases used extensively in the planning literature. Our decentralized and asynchronous algorithm guarantees safety with respect to other agents by including their committed trajectories as constraints in the optimization and then executing a collision check-recheck scheme. Finally, extensive simulations in challenging cluttered environments show up to a 33.9\% reduction in the flight time, and a 88.8\% reduction in the number of stops compared to the Bernstein and B-Spline bases, shorter flight distances than centralized approaches, and shorter total times on average than synchronous decentralized approaches.},

Aisle graphs model, among others, vineyards or warehouses. Each aisle-graph vertex is associated with a reward that a robot obtains when it visits the vertex itself. As the energy of the robot is limited, only a subset of vertices can be visited with a fully charged battery. The objective is to maximize the total reward collected by the robot with a battery charge. We first propose an optimal algorithm that solves the OASP in $\mathcal {O}(m^2n^2)$ time for aisle graphs with a single access consisting of $m$ rows, each with $n$ vertices. With the goal of designing faster solutions, we propose four greedy suboptimal algorithms that run in at most $\mathcal {O}(mn\ (m + n))$ time. For two of them, we guarantee an approximation ratio of $\frac{1}{2}(1 - \frac{1}{e})$ , where $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm, on the total reward by exploiting the well-known submodularity property. Experimentally, we show that these algorithms collect more than 80\% of the optimal reward.},

The simplified car-robot model forms a unicycle with coupled bounds on the control inputs, while the full car-robot model has independent control inputs. The problem is analyzed as an optimal control problem by the minimum principle and by singular control theory. While the simplified car-robot model gives six time optimal path primitives, the optimality conditions for the full car-robot model yield twelve path primitives that form the time optimal paths. Three primitives involve singular controls of the steering front wheels that asymptotically align the robot along a straight line motion. All path primitives are analytically characterized and representative examples are studied in order to demonstrate how the path primitives combine to form the time optimal paths.},

While the initial feasibility of automating the process of knee prosthesis control parameter tuning has been demonstrated in a principled way, the next critical issue is to improve tuning efficiency and speed it up for the human user, in clinic settings, while maintaining human safety. We, therefore, propose a policy iteration with constraint embedded (PICE) method as an innovative solution to the problem under the framework of reinforcement learning. Central to PICE is the use of a projected Bellman equation with a constraint of assuring positive semidefiniteness of performance values during policy evaluation. Additionally, we developed both online and offline PICE implementations that provide additional flexibility for the designer to fully utilize measurement data, either from on-policy or off-policy, to further improve PICE tuning efficiency. Our human subject testing showed that the PICE provided effective policies with significantly reduced tuning time. For the first time, we also experimentally evaluated and demonstrated the robustness of the deployed policies by applying them to different tasks and users. Putting it together, our new way of problem solving has been effective as PICE has demonstrated its potential toward truly automating the process of control parameter tuning for robotic knee prosthesis users.},

In this article, we present solutions for SfM using lines, namely, incremental SfM. These approaches consist of designing state observers for a camera’s dynamical visual system looking at a 3-D line. We start by presenting a model that uses spherical coordinates for representing the line’s moment vector. We show that this parameterization has singularities, and, therefore, we introduce a more suitable model that considers the line’s moment and shortest viewing ray. Concerning the observers, we present two different methodologies. The first uses a memory-less state-of-the-art framework for dynamic visual systems. Since the previous states of the robotic agent are accessible—while performing the 3-D mapping of the environment—the second approach aims at exploiting the use of memory to improve the estimation accuracy and convergence speed. The two models and the two observers are evaluated in simulation and real data, where mobile and manipulator robots are used.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses a view-path-planning problem during 3-D scanning of a large-scale structure based on multiview stereo (MVS) for unmanned aerial platforms. Recently, most studies have adopted an explore-then-exploit strategy for 3-D scanning. The strategy first generates a coarse model from a simple overhead scanning and then plans an inspection path to cover the entire surface of the coarse model. However, even though the inspection path may be optimal, it is difficult to guarantee a complete and accurate reconstruction result due to defective factors of MVS such as occlusions, textureless surfaces, and insufficient parallaxes. Furthermore, the entire procedure of this strategy is inefficiently slow because of path redundancies and long MVS processing time. Therefore, we propose a novel view-path-planning method for 3-D scanning based on an online MVS reconstruction algorithm. The suggested method incrementally reconstructs the target model online and iteratively plans view paths by analyzing the current partial reconstructions. The method continuously analyzes the quality of the model and detects inaccurately reconstructed surfaces. It then plans an inspection path that provides a complete coverage of the detected surfaces while maximizing the performance of MVS. This method can construct a complete 3-D model in a single scanning trial without the need for rescanning. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods, especially in terms of the model completeness of complex structures.},

This article proposes a system to achieve robust and simultaneous extrinsic calibration, odometry, and mapping for multiple LiDARs. Our approach starts with measurement preprocessing to extract edge and planar features from raw measurements. After a motion and extrinsic initialization procedure, a sliding window-based multi-LiDAR odometry runs onboard to estimate poses with an online calibration refinement and convergence identification. We further develop a mapping algorithm to construct a global map and optimize poses with sufficient features together with a method to capture and reduce data uncertainty. We validate our approach’s performance with extensive experiments on 10 sequences (4.60-km total length) for the calibration and SLAM and compare it against the state of the art. We demonstrate that the proposed work is a complete, robust, and extensible system for various multi-LiDAR setups.

The main contribution is an efficient algorithm for selecting a fixed number of anchors from a set of potential poses that minimizes estimated error in the SLAM solution. Based on a graph-topological connection between the D-optimality design metric and the tree-connectivity of the pose-graph, the anchor selection problem can be formulated approximately as a submatrix selection problem for reduced weighted Laplacian matrix, leading to a cardinality-constrained submodular maximization problem. Two greedy methods are presented to solve this submodular optimization problem with a performance guarantee. These methods are complemented by Cholesky decomposition, approximate minimum degree permutation, order reuse, and rank-1 update that exploit the sparseness of the weighted Laplacian matrix.

The core idea behind our adaptive foot design is first introduced and validated through a simplified mathematical formulation of the problem. Subsequently, we present the chosen mechanical implementation to attempt overcoming current limitations. The realized prototype of adaptive foot is integrated and tested on the compliantly actuated quadrupedal robot ANYmal together with an ROS-based real-time foot pose reconstruction software.

  abstract     = {Nonlinear estimation in robotics and vision is typically plagued with outliers due to wrong data association or incorrect detections from signal processing and machine learning methods. This article introduces two unifying formulations for outlier-robust estimation, generalized maximum consensus ( $\text{G}$ - $\text{MC}$ ) and generalized truncated least squares ( $\text{G-TLS}$ ), and investigates fundamental limits, practical algorithms, and applications. Our first contribution is a proof that outlier-robust estimation is inapproximable: In the worst case, it is impossible to (even approximately) find the set of outliers, even with slower-than-polynomial-time algorithms (particularly, algorithms running in quasi-polynomial time). As a second contribution, we review and extend two general-purpose algorithms. The first, adaptive trimming ( $\text{ADAPT}$ ), is combinatorial and is suitable for $\text{G}$ - $\text{MC}$ ; the second, graduated nonconvexity ( $\text{GNC}$ ), is based on homotopy methods and is suitable for $\text{G-TLS}$ . We extend $\text{ADAPT}$ and $\text{GNC}$ to the case where the user does not have prior knowledge of the inlier-noise statistics (or the statistics may vary over time) and is unable to guess a reasonable threshold to separate inliers from outliers (as the one commonly used in RANdom SAmple Consensus $(\text{RANSAC})$ . We propose the first minimally tuned algorithms for outlier rejection, which dynamically decide how to separate inliers from outliers. Our third contribution is an evaluation of the proposed algorithms on robot perception problems: mesh registration, image-based object detection ( shape alignment ), and pose graph optimization. $\text{ADAPT}$ and $\text{GNC}$ execute in real time, are deterministic, outperform $\text{RANSAC}$ , and are robust up to 80–90\% outliers. Their minimally tuned versions also compare favorably with the state of the art, even though they do not rely on a noise bound for the inliers.},

  abstract     = {Multirobot systems must be able to maintain performance when robots get delayed during execution. For mobile robots, one source of delays is congestion . Congestion occurs when robots deployed in shared physical spaces interact, as robots present in the same area simultaneously must maneuver to avoid each other. Congestion can adversely affect navigation performance and increase the duration of navigation actions. In this article, we present a multirobot planning framework that utilizes learnt probabilistic models of how congestion affects navigation duration. Central to our framework is a probabilistic reservation table , which summarizes robot plans, capturing the effects of congestion.

  abstract     = {Emerging applications of collaborative autonomy, such as multitarget tracking , unknown map exploration , and persistent surveillance , require robots plan paths to navigate an environment while maximizing the information collected via on-board sensors. In this article, we consider such information acquisition tasks but in adversarial environments, where attacks may temporarily disable the robots’ sensors. We propose the first receding horizon algorithm, aiming for robust and adaptive multirobot planning against any number of attacks, which we call Resilient Active Information acquisitioN ( RAIN ). RAIN calls, in an online fashion, a robust trajectory planning ( RTP ) subroutine that plans attack-robust control inputs over a look-ahead planning horizon. We quantify RTP ’s performance by bounding its suboptimality. We base our theoretical analysis on notions of curvature introduced in combinatorial optimization. We evaluate RAIN in three information acquisition scenarios: multitarget tracking , occupancy grid mapping , and persistent surveillance . The scenarios are simulated in C++ and a unity-based simulator. In all simulations, RAIN runs in real time, and exhibits superior performance against a state-of-the-art baseline information acquisition algorithm, even in the presence of a high number of attacks. We also demonstrate RAIN ’s robustness and effectiveness against varying models of attacks (worst case and random), as well as varying replanning rates.},

The long distances between the users’ local robots and the RMRS can inject time-varying delays in their communications. This article enables such multiuser teleoperation of an RMRS through a control strategy that robustly synchronizes an RMRS with tree topology and proximity-limited one-hop communications among its robots, enables multiple users to tele-guide the RMRS and to feel the actions of the other users over time-delayed communications between the users’ local robots and the RMRS, and contains the RMRS to the stationary convex hull spanned by the local robots of all users in the steady state. A control design constrained by the connectivity of the RMRS and by the passivity of the teleoperator guarantees effective coordination, safe teleoperation, and steady-state containment. The design is a dynamic feedforward–feedback passivation strategy facilitated by a suitable decomposition of the teleoperator into interconnected subsystems. The analysis of the storage functions, and thus of the input–output relations, of all subsystems and their interconnections proves the properties of the design. Comparative experiments in a teleoperation testbed with four local and ten remote robots validate its practical efficacy.},

To enhance the resilience of multirobot cooperative localization algorithms in a distributed system, we use covariance intersection to formalize a localization algorithm with an explicit communication update and ensure estimation consistency at the same time. We investigate the covariance boundedness criterion of our algorithm with respect to communication and observation graphs, demonstrating provable localization performance under even sparse communications topologies. We substantiate the resilience of our algorithm as well as the boundedness analysis through experiments on simulated and benchmark physical data against varying communications connectivity and failure metrics. Especially when interrobot communication is entirely blocked or partially unavailable, we demonstrate that our method is less affected and maintains desired performance compared to existing cooperative localization algorithms.},

Multirobot operations can benefit from this flexibility by actively managing system redundancies depending on current tasks and having more options to respond to failure events. To support this active exploitation of redundancies in robotic systems, this article details an organization model as basis for planning with reconfigurable multirobot systems. The model allows us to exploit redundancies when optimizing a multirobot system’s probability of survival with respect to a desired mission. The resulting planning approach trades safety against efficiency in robotic operations and thereby offers a new perspective and tool to design and improve multirobot missions. We use a simulated multirobot planetary exploration mission to evaluate this approach and highlight an exemplary performance landscape.

Toward this end, the task prioritization and execution—through which the allocation of tasks to robots is effectively realized—are encoded as constraints within an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the energy consumed by the robots at each point in time. In this context, an allocation is interpreted as a prioritization of a task over all others by each of the robots. Furthermore, we present a novel framework to represent the heterogeneous capabilities of the robots, by distinguishing between the features available on the robots and the capabilities enabled by these features. By embedding these descriptions within the optimization problem, we make the framework resilient to situations, where environmental conditions make certain features unsuitable to support a capability and when component failures on the robots occur.

Coordinating robots in a composite team is a challenging problem due to the heterogeneity in the robots’ characteristics and their tasks. Here, we propose a coordination framework for composite robot teams. The proposed framework consists of two hierarchical modules: First, A multiagent state-action-reward-time-state-action algorithm in multiagent partially observable semi-Markov decision process as the high-level decision-making module to enable perception agents to learn to surveil in an environment with an unknown number of dynamic targets and second, a low-level coordinated control and planning module that ensures probabilistically guaranteed support for action agents.

  abstract     = {We propose a framework for resilience in a networked heterogeneous multirobot team subject to resource failures. Each robot in the team is equipped with resources that it shares with its neighbors, which are identified based on the team’s communication graph. Additionally, each robot in the team executes a task, whose performance depends on the resources to which it has access. When a resource on a particular robot becomes unavailable ( e.g., a camera ceases to function), the team optimally reconfigures its communication network so that the robots affected by the failure can continue their tasks. We focus on a monitoring task, where robots individually estimate the state of an exogenous process. We encode the end-to-end effect of a robot’s resource loss on the monitoring performance of the team by defining a new stronger notion of observability— one-hop observability . By abstracting the impact that low-level individual resources have on the task performance through the notion of one-hop observability, our framework leads to the principled reconfiguration of information flow in the team to effectively replace the lost resource on one robot with information from another, as long as certain conditions are met. Network reconfiguration is converted to the problem of selecting edges to be modified in the system’s communication graph after a resource failure has occurred. A controller based on finite-time convergence control barrier functions drives each robot to a spatial location that enables the communication links of the modified graph. We validate the effectiveness of our framework by deploying it on a team of differential-drive robots estimating the position of a group of quadrotors.},

Specifically, the technique that we propose—named Cumulative Sign detector—monitors and compares changes in signed values of residual with their expected occurrences to detect inconsistencies and trigger alarms when an attack is discovered.

We consider as adversarial all those robots that intentionally or accidentally try to disrupt the objective of the MRS, e.g., robots that are being hijacked by a cyber–physical attack or have experienced a fault. Under specific topological conditions defined by the notion of (r,s) -robustness, our control strategy is proven to be successful in driving the followers toward the target region, namely a hypercube, in finite time. It is also proven that the followers cannot escape the moving containment area despite the persistent influence of anonymous adversarial robots.

We model the problem over an edge as a zero-sum multistage game played between the defender and the attacker with a stopping state, termed as the edge game. We analyze this game under full information , in which each player has complete knowledge of the past actions taken by the opponent at every stage. We also analyze the game under a partial information structure , wherein the defender obtains complete knowledge of the attacker’s actions only when the defender uses the countermeasure. We characterize the Nash equilibria of the edge game in both information structures with two actions per player and analyze its sensitivity to the game parameters. We then construct a meta-game using the edge game solutions to determine an attack-resilient path and compare it with an efficient novel heuristic with a constraint on the number of edges attacked. We illustrate our methodology through simulations in a Robot Operating System/Gazebo environment and with experiments on a ground robot.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we characterize the advantage of using a robot’s neighborhood to find and eliminate adversarial robots in the presence of a Sybil attack. We show that by leveraging the opinions of their neighbors on the trustworthiness of transmitted data, robots can detect adversaries with high probability. We characterize the number of communication rounds required to be a function of the communication quality and of the proportion of legitimate to malicious robots. This result enables increased resiliency of many multirobot algorithms. Because our results are finite time and not asymptotic, they are particularly well-suited for problems of a time critical nature. We develop two algorithms, FindSpoofedRobots that determines trusted neighbors with high probability, and FindResilientAdjacencyMatrix that enables distributed computation of graph properties in an adversarial setting. We apply our methods to a flocking problem where a team of robots must track a moving target in the presence of adversarial robots. We show that by using our algorithms, the team of robots are able to maintain tracking ability of the dynamic target.},

  abstract     = {The 17 papers in this special section focus on resilience in networked robotic systems. This collection of articles aims to provide a deeper understanding of resilience as it pertains to multirobot systems, and to disseminate the current advances in designing and operating networked robotic systems. We understand resilience to be a characteristic that enables amultirobot system to withstand or overcome unexpected adverse conditions or shocks, and unknown, unmodeled disturbances. It refers to the contingent nature of the robots’ behaviors that is aimed at preserving their functionality or minimizing the time periods during which their functionality is compromised. The papers explore new algorithmic and mathematical foundations toward resilience.},
