The procedure is partly based on computing bottlenecks of the variety. Using geometric information such as the bottlenecks and the local reach we also provide bounds on the density of the sample needed in order to guarantee that the homology of the variety can be recovered from the sample. An implementation of the algorithm is provided together with numerical experiments and a computational comparison to the algorithm by Dufresne et al.

The goal is to compute the Tamagawa number such a torus explicitly via Ono’s formula that expresses it as a ratio of cohomological invariants. A fairly complete and detailed description of the cohomology of the character lattice of such a torus is given when $K/k$ is Galois. Partial results including the numerator of Ono’s formula are given when the extension is not Galois, or more generally when the torus is defined by an étale algebra. We also present tools developed in SageMath for this purpose, allowing us to build and compute the cohomology and explore the local-global principles for such an algebraic torus. Particular attention is given to the case when $[K:K^+]=2$ and $K$ is a CM-field. This case corresponds to maximal tori in $\mathrm {GSp}_{2n}$, and most examples will be in that setting. This is motivated by the application to abelian varieties over finite fields and the Hasse principle for bilinear forms.},

Our main result is the construction of a Hecke character $\chi$ satisfying that the Frey elliptic curve representation twisted by $\chi$ extends to $Gal_\mathbb {Q}$, therefore (by Serre’s conjectures) corresponds to a newform in $S_2(\Gamma _0(n),\varepsilon )$ for explicit values of $n$ and $\varepsilon$. Following some well known results and elimination techniques (together with some improvements) our result provides a systematic procedure to study solutions of the above equations and allows us to prove non-existence of non-trivial primitive solutions for large values of $p$ of both equations for new values of $d$.},

Recent work by Kritzer, Kuo, Nuyens and Ullrich [J. Approx. Theory 240 (2019), pp. 96–113] shows that rank-1 lattice rules with a randomly chosen number of points and good generating vector achieve almost the optimal order of the randomized error in weighted Korobov spaces, and moreover, that the error is bounded independently of the dimension if the weight parameters, $\gamma _j$, satisfy the summability condition $\sum _{j=1}^{\infty }\gamma _j^{1/\alpha }&lt;\infty$, where $\alpha$ is a smoothness parameter. The argument is based on the existence result that at least half of the possible generating vectors yield almost the optimal order of the worst-case error in the same function spaces. In this paper we provide a component-by-component construction algorithm of such randomized rank-1 lattice rules, without any need to check whether the constructed generating vectors satisfy a desired worst-case error bound. Similarly to the above-mentioned work, we prove that our algorithm achieves almost the optimal order of the randomized error and that the error bound is independent of the dimension if the same condition $\sum _{j=1}^{\infty }\gamma _j^{1/\alpha }&lt;\infty$ holds. We also provide analogous results for tent-transformed lattice rules for weighted half-period cosine spaces and for polynomial lattice rules in weighted Walsh spaces, respectively.},

We consider here parametrized systems of polynomial equations that are linear in enough parameters, and provide a Kac-Rice formula for the expected number of solutions of the system when the parameters follow continuous distributions. Combined with Monte Carlo integration, we apply the formula to partition the parameter region according to the number of solutions or find a region in parameter space where the system has the maximal number of solutions. The motivation stems from the study of steady states of chemical reaction networks and gives new tools for the open problem of identifying the parameter region where the network has at least two positive steady states. We illustrate with numerous examples that our approach successfully handles a larger number of parameters than exact methods.},

For semi-discrete parabolic problems, for instance, stabilized Runge–Kutta methods overcome the stringent stability condition of standard methods without sacrificing explicitness. However, when stiffness is only induced by a few components, as in the presence of spatially local mesh refinement, their efficiency deteriorates. To remove the crippling effect of a few severely stiff components on the entire system of differential equations, we derive a modified equation, whose stiffness solely depends on the remaining mildly stiff components. By applying stabilized Runge–Kutta methods to this modified equation, we then devise an explicit multirate Runge–Kutta–Chebyshev (mRKC) method whose stability conditions are independent of a few severely stiff components. Stability of the mRKC method is proved for a model problem, whereas its efficiency and usefulness are demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with error estimates of the fully discrete generalized finite element method (GFEM) with optimal local approximation spaces for solving elliptic problems with heterogeneous coefficients. The local approximation spaces are constructed using eigenvectors of local eigenvalue problems solved by the finite element method on some sufficiently fine mesh with mesh size $h$. The error bound of the discrete GFEM approximation is proved to converge as $h\rightarrow 0$ towards that of the continuous GFEM approximation, which was shown to decay nearly exponentially in previous works. Moreover, even for fixed mesh size $h$, a nearly exponential rate of convergence of the local approximation errors with respect to the dimension of the local spaces is established. An efficient and accurate method for solving the discrete eigenvalue problems is proposed by incorporating the discrete $A$-harmonic constraint directly into the eigensolver. Numerical experiments are carried out to confirm the theoretical results and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.},

  abstract     = {The transmission eigenvalue problem arises from the inverse scattering theory for inhomogeneous media. It plays a key role in the unique determination of inhomogeneous media. Furthermore, transmission eigenvalues can be reconstructed from the scattering data and used to estimate the material properties of the unknown object. The problem is posted as a system of two second order partial differential equations and is nonlinear and non-selfadjoint. It is challenging to develop effective numerical methods. In this paper, we formulate the transmission eigenvalue problem as the eigenvalue problem of a holomorphic operator function. The Lagrange finite elements are used for the discretization and the convergence is proved using the abstract approximation theory for holomorphic Fredholm operator functions. The spectral indicator method is employed to compute the eigenvalues. Numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed method.},

We employ a prototypical class of first order in time semi-implicit methods with implicit treatment of the linear dissipation term and explicit extrapolation of the nonlinear term. When the dissipation coefficient is held small, a conventional wisdom is to add a judiciously chosen stabilization term in order to afford relatively large time stepping and speed up the simulation. In practical numerical implementations it has been long observed that the resulting system exhibits remarkable stability properties in the regime where the stabilization parameter is $\mathcal O(1)$, the dissipation coefficient is vanishingly small and the size of the time step is moderately large. In this work we develop a new stability theory to address this perplexing phenomenon.},

The result of Thue from 1906 implies that there is an infinite square-free word if all the $\ell _i$ are identical. On the other hand, Grytczuk, Przybyło and Zhu showed in 2011 that it also holds if the $\ell _i$ are of size $4$ instead of $3$. In this article, we first show that if the lists are of size $4$, the number of square-free words is at least $2.45^n$ (the previous similar bound was $2^n$). We then show our main result: we can construct such a square-free word if the lists are subsets of size $3$ of the same alphabet of size $4$. Our proof also implies that there are at least $1.25^n$ square-free words of length $n$ for any such list assignment. This proof relies on the existence of a set of coefficients verified with a computer. We suspect that the full conjecture could be resolved by this method with a much more powerful computer (but we might need to wait a few decades for such a computer to be available).},

  abstract     = {For a finite group, we present three algorithms to compute a generating set of invariants simultaneously to generating sets of basic equivariants, i.e., equivariants for the irreducible representations of the group. The main novelty resides in the exploitation of the orthogonal complement of the ideal generated by invariants. Its symmetry adapted basis delivers the fundamental equivariants. Fundamental equivariants allow to assemble symmetry adapted bases of polynomial spaces of higher degrees, and these are essential ingredients in exploiting and preserving symmetry in computations. They appear within algebraic computation and beyond, in physics, chemistry and engineering. Our first construction applies solely to reflection groups and consists in applying symmetry preserving interpolation, as developed by the same authors, along an orbit in general position. The fundamental invariants can be read off the H-basis of the ideal of the orbit while the fundamental equivariants are obtained from a symmetry adapted basis of an invariant direct complement to this ideal in the polynomial ring. The second algorithm takes as input primary invariants and the output provides not only the secondary invariants but also free bases for the modules of basic equivariants. These are constructed as the components of a symmetry adapted basis of the orthogonal complement, in the polynomial ring, to the ideal generated by primary invariants. The third and main algorithm proceeds degree by degree, determining the fundamental invariants as forming a H-basis of the Hilbert ideal, i.e., the polynomial ideal generated by the invariants of positive degree. The fundamental equivariants are simultaneously computed degree by degree as the components of a symmetry adapted basis of the orthogonal complement of the Hilbert ideal.},

In 1969, over a global field $k$, Voskresenskiǐ proved that there exists an exact sequence $0\to A(T)\to H^1(k,\operatorname {Pic}\overline {X})^\vee \to \Sha (T)\to 0$ where $A(T)$ is the kernel of the weak approximation of $T$, $\Sha (T)$ is the Shafarevich-Tate group of $T$, $X$ is a smooth $k$-compactification of $T$, $\overline {X}=X\times _k\overline {k}$, $\operatorname {Pic}\overline {X}$ is the Picard group of $\overline {X}$ and $\vee$ stands for the Pontryagin dual. On the other hand, in 1963, Ono proved that for the norm one torus $T=R^{(1)}_{K/k}(\mathbb {G}_m)$ of $K/k$, $\Sha (T)=0$ if and only if the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. First, we determine $H^1(k,\operatorname {Pic} \overline {X})$ for algebraic $k$-tori $T$ up to dimension $5$. Second, we determine $H^1(k,\operatorname {Pic} \overline {X})$ for norm one tori $T=R^{(1)}_{K/k}(\mathbb {G}_m)$ with $[K:k]=n\leq 15$ and $n\neq 12$. We also show that $H^1(k,\operatorname {Pic} \overline {X})=0$ for $T=R^{(1)}_{K/k}(\mathbb {G}_m)$ when the Galois group of the Galois closure of $K/k$ is the Mathieu group $M_n\leq S_n$ with $n=11,12,22,23,24$. Third, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the Hasse norm principle for $K/k$ with $[K:k]=n\leq 15$ and $n\neq 12$. As applications of the results, we get the group $T(k)/R$ of $R$-equivalence classes over a local field $k$ via Colliot-Thélène and Sansuc’s formula and the Tamagawa number $\tau (T)$ over a number field $k$ via Ono’s formula $\tau (T)=|H^1(k,\widehat {T})|/|\Sha (T)|$.},

We discuss stability and convergence of the method under a Tikhonov regularization and use an implementation to showcase comparisons with analytically known solutions as well as discrete particle simulations.

The polynomial elasticity complex and Koszul elasticity complex are created to derive the decomposition. The trace of the $\operatorname {inc}$ operator is induced from a Green’s identity.

The corresponding forward map sends $A$ to a projected version of a local Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator, allowing for the use of partial boundary data and finitely many measurements. It is first shown that the forward map is analytic, and subsequently reversions of its Taylor series up to specified orders lead to a family of numerical methods for solving the inverse problem with increasing accuracy. The convergence of these methods is shown under conditions that ensure the invertibility of the Fréchet derivative of the forward map. The introduced numerical methods are of the same computational complexity as solving the linearised inverse problem. The analogous results are also presented for the smoothened complete electrode model.},

We show that there are constants $c &gt; 0$ and $C$ such that for all $d$ and all $m \ge d$ the expected non-normalized star discrepancy of a jittered sampling point set satisfies \[ c \,dm^{\frac {d-1}{2}} \sqrt {1 + \log (\tfrac md)} \le {\mathbb E} D^*(P) \le C\, dm^{\frac {d-1}{2}} \sqrt {1 + \log (\tfrac md)}.\] This discrepancy is thus smaller by a factor of $\Theta \big (\big (\frac {1+\log (m/d)}{m/d}\big )^{1/2}\big )$ than the one of a uniformly distributed random point set (Monte Carlo point set) of cardinality $m^d$. This result improves both the upper and the lower bound for the discrepancy of jittered sampling given by Pausinger and Steinerberger [J. Complexity 33 (2016), pp. 199–216].

  abstract     = {We prove that a variant of the classical Sobolev space of first-order dominating mixed smoothness is equivalent (under a certain condition) to the unanchored ANOVA space on $\mathbb {R}^d$, for $d \geq 1$. Both spaces are Hilbert spaces involving weight functions , which determine the behaviour as different variables tend to $\pm \infty$, and weight parameters , which represent the influence of different subsets of variables. The unanchored ANOVA space on $\mathbb {R}^d$ was initially introduced by Nichols and Kuo in 2014 to analyse the error of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) approximations for integrals on unbounded domains; whereas the classical Sobolev space of dominating mixed smoothness was used as the setting in a series of papers by Griebel, Kuo and Sloan on the smoothing effect of integration, in an effort to develop a rigorous theory on why QMC methods work so well for certain non-smooth integrands with kinks or jumps coming from option pricing problems. In this same setting, Griewank, Kuo, Leövey and Sloan in 2018 subsequently extended these ideas by developing a practical smoothing by preintegration technique to approximate integrals of such functions with kinks or jumps. We first prove the equivalence in one dimension (itself a non-trivial task), before following a similar, but more complicated, strategy to prove the equivalence for general dimensions. As a consequence of this equivalence, we analyse applying QMC combined with a preintegration step to approximate the fair price of an Asian option, and prove that the error of such an approximation using $N$ points converges at a rate close to $1/N$.},

The likelihood function is approximated by a ridge function, i.e., a map which depends nontrivially only on a few linear combinations of the parameters. We build this ridge approximation by minimizing an upper bound on the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the posterior distribution and its approximation. This bound, obtained via logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, allows one to certify the error of the posterior approximation. Computing the bound requires computing the second moment matrix of the gradient of the log-likelihood function. In practice, a sample-based approximation of the upper bound is then required. We provide an analysis that enables control of the posterior approximation error due to this sampling. Numerical and theoretical comparisons with existing methods illustrate the benefits of the proposed methodology.},

These bounds take into account the discretization levels, the decay of the step-size, which is more flexible than in existing results, and the underlying smoothness in terms of general source conditions. This allows to apply SGD to severely ill-posed problems. The obtained error bounds exhibit three stages of the performance of SGD. In particular, the pre-asymptotic behavior can be well seen.

  abstract     = {In this paper we consider a sub-diffusion problem where the fractional time derivative is approximated either by the L1 scheme or by Convolution Quadrature. We propose new interpretations of the numerical schemes which lead to a posteriori error estimates. Our approach is based on appropriate pointwise representations of the numerical schemes as perturbed evolution equations and on stability estimates for the evolution equation. A posteriori error estimates in $L^2(H)$ and $L^\infty (H)$ norms of optimal order are derived. Extensive numerical experiments indicate the reliability and the optimality of the estimators for the schemes considered, as well as their efficiency as error indicators driving adaptive mesh selection locating singularities of the problem.},

  abstract     = {In this article we prove full discretization error bounds for semilinear second-order evolution equations. We consider exponential integrators in time applied to an abstract nonconforming semidiscretization in space. Since the fully discrete schemes involve the spatially discretized semigroup, a crucial point in the error analysis is to eliminate the continuous semigroup in the representation of the exact solution. Hence, we derive a modified variation-of-constants formula driven by the spatially discretized semigroup which holds up to a discretization error. Our main results provide bounds for the full discretization errors for exponential Adams and explicit exponential Runge–Kutta methods. We show convergence with the stiff order of the corresponding exponential integrator in time, and errors stemming from the spatial discretization. As an application of the abstract theory, we consider an acoustic wave equation with kinetic boundary conditions, for which we also present some numerical experiments to illustrate our results.},

We consider two known classes of finite element methods, namely one based on a vector analogon of the Dziuk-Elliott surface finite element method and one based on the so-called trace finite element technique. A key ingredient in both classes of methods is a penalization method that is used to enforce tangentiality of the vector field in a weak sense. This penalization and the perturbations that arise from numerical approximation of the surface lead to essential nonconformities in the discretization of the variational formulation of the vector-Laplace eigenproblem. We present a general abstract framework applicable to such nonconforming discretizations of eigenproblems. Error bounds both for eigenvalue and eigenvector approximations are derived that depend on certain consistency and approximability parameters. Sharpness of these bounds is discussed. Results of a numerical experiment illustrate certain convergence properties of such finite element discretizations of the surface vector-Laplace eigenproblem.},

  abstract     = {Algorithms working with linear algebraic groups often represent them via defining polynomial equations. One can always choose defining equations for an algebraic group to be of degree at most the degree of the group as an algebraic variety. However, the degree of a linear algebraic group $G \subset \operatorname {GL}_n(C)$ can be arbitrarily large even for $n = 1$. One of the key ingredients of Hrushovski’s algorithm for computing the Galois group of a linear differential equation was an idea to “approximate” every algebraic subgroup of $\operatorname {GL}_n(C)$ by a “similar” group so that the degree of the latter is bounded uniformly in $n$. Making this uniform bound computationally feasible is crucial for making the algorithm practical. In this paper, we derive a single-exponential degree bound for such an approximation (we call it a toric envelope ), which is qualitatively optimal. As an application, we improve the quintuply exponential bound due to Feng for the first step of Hrushovski’s algorithm to a single-exponential bound. For the cases $n = 2, 3$ often arising in practice, we further refine our general bound.},

Motivated by this remark, Horton constructed a counterexample on $96$ vertices. In a sequence of articles by different authors several smaller counterexamples were presented. The smallest of these graphs is a graph on 50 vertices which was discovered independently by Georges and Kelmans. In this article we show that there is no smaller counterexample. As all non-hamiltonian 3-connected bipartite cubic graphs in the literature have cyclic 4-cuts—even if they have girth 6—it is natural to ask whether this is a necessary prerequisite. In this article we answer this question in the negative and give a construction of an infinite family of non-hamiltonian cyclically 5-connected bipartite cubic graphs. In 1969 Barnette gave a weaker version of the conjecture stating that 3-connected planar bipartite cubic graphs are hamiltonian. We show that Barnette’s conjecture is true up to at least 90 vertices. We also report that a search of small non-hamiltonian 3-connected bipartite cubic graphs did not find any with genus less than 4.},

Motivated by Barbulescu et al. [ANTS X–proceedings of the tenth algorithmic number theory symposium, Berkeley, CA, 2013], we say an elliptic curve is ECM-friendly if it does not have complex multiplication and if its Galois image is exceptional for some level. Building upon two recent works which treated the case of congruence subgroups of prime-power level which occur for infinitely many $j$-invariants, we prove that there are exactly 1525 families of rational elliptic curves with distinct Galois images which are cartesian products of subgroups of prime-power level. This makes a complete list of rational families of ECM-friendly elliptic curves with cartesian Galois images, out of which less than 23 were known in the literature. We furthermore refine a heuristic of Montgomery to compare these families and conclude that the best 4 families which can be put in $a=-1$ twisted Edwards’ form are new.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the approximation of a function $u$ in a given subspace $V_m$ of dimension $m$ from evaluations of the function at $n$ suitably chosen points. The aim is to construct an approximation of $u$ in $V_m$ which yields an error close to the best approximation error in $V_m$ and using as few evaluations as possible. Classical least-squares regression, which defines a projection in $V_m$ from $n$ random points, usually requires a large $n$ to guarantee a stable approximation and an error close to the best approximation error. This is a major drawback for applications where $u$ is expensive to evaluate. One remedy is to use a weighted least-squares projection using $n$ samples drawn from a properly selected distribution. In this paper, we introduce a boosted weighted least-squares method which allows to ensure almost surely the stability of the weighted least-squares projection with a sample size close to the interpolation regime $n=m$. It consists in sampling according to a measure associated with the optimization of a stability criterion over a collection of independent $n$-samples, and resampling according to this measure until a stability condition is satisfied. A greedy method is then proposed to remove points from the obtained sample. Quasi-optimality properties in expectation are obtained for the weighted least-squares projection, with or without the greedy procedure. The proposed method is validated on numerical examples and compared to state-of-the-art interpolation and weighted least-squares methods.},

  abstract     = {Many data-science problems can be formulated as an inverse problem, where the parameters are estimated by minimizing a proper loss function. When complicated black-box models are involved, derivative-free optimization tools are often needed. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a particle-based derivative-free Bayesian algorithm originally designed for data assimilation. Recently, it has been applied to inverse problems for computational efficiency. The resulting algorithm, known as ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI), involves running an ensemble of particles with EnKF update rules so they can converge to a minimizer. In this article, we investigate EKI convergence in general nonlinear settings. To improve convergence speed and stability, we consider applying EKI with non-constant step-sizes and covariance inflation. We prove that EKI can hit critical points with finite steps in non-convex settings. We further prove that EKI converges to the global minimizer polynomially fast if the loss function is strongly convex. We verify the analysis presented with numerical experiments on two inverse problems.},

The scheme is explicit and can be implemented using the fast Fourier transform. By a rigorous analysis, we prove that the new scheme provides the first-order accuracy in $H^\gamma$ for any initial data belonging to $H^\gamma$, for any $\gamma &gt;\frac 32$. That is, up to some fixed time $T$, there exists some constant $C=C(\|u\|_{L^\infty ([0,T]; H^{\gamma })})&gt;0$, such that \begin{equation*} \|u^n-u(t_n)\|_{H^\gamma (\mathbb {T})}\le C \tau , \end{equation*} where $u^n$ denotes the numerical solution at $t_n=n\tau$. Moreover, the mass of the numerical solution $M(u^n)$ verifies \begin{equation*} \left |M(u^n)-M(u_0)\right |\le C\tau ^5. \end{equation*} In particular, our scheme does not cost any additional derivative for the first-order convergence and the numerical solution obeys the almost mass conservation law. Furthermore, if $u_0\in H^1(\mathbb {T})$, we rigorously prove that \begin{equation*} \|u^n-u(t_n)\|_{H^1(\mathbb {T})}\le C\tau ^{\frac 12-}, \end{equation*} where $C= C(\|u_0\|_{H^1(\mathbb {T})})&gt;0$.},

  abstract     = {In this article we are interested in the stability of finite difference schemes approximation for hyperbolic boundary value problems defined on the interval $\left [0,1 \right ]$. The seminal work of Gustafsson, Kreiss, and Sundström [Math. Comp. 26 (1972), pp. 649-686], mainly devoted to the half-line, gives a necessary and sufficient invertibility condition ensuring the stability of the scheme, the so-called discrete uniform Kreiss-Lopatinskii condition. An interesting point is that this condition is a discretized version of the one imposed in the continuous setting to ensure the strong well-posedness of the hyperbolic boundary value problem. However as pointed by Gustafsson, Kreiss, and Sundström [Math. Comp. 26 (1972), pp. 649-686] and as soon as several boundary conditions are concerned the solution to the scheme may develop an exponential growth with respect to the discrete time variable. The question addressed here is to characterize the schemes having this growth or not. This is made under a new invertibility condition which is a discretized version of the ones preventing the exponential growth in time of the solution to continuous hyperbolic boundary value problems in the strip studied by Benoit [Indiana Univ. Math. J. 69 (2020), pp. 2267-2323]. In some sense it shows that this continuous to discrete extension of the characterization occurs in the interval like in the half-line.},

Guided by this result, we design a novel nonconforming discretization, which employs Crouzeix-Raviart and discontinuous elements.

First, the $\operatorname {div}\operatorname {div}$ Hilbert complex and its corresponding polynomial complexes are presented. Several decompositions of polynomial vector and tensor spaces are derived from the polynomial complexes. Second, traces for the $\operatorname {div}\operatorname {div}$ operator are characterized through a Green’s identity. Besides the normal-normal component, another trace involving combination of first order derivatives of the tensor is continuous across the face. Due to the smoothness of polynomials, the symmetric tensor element is also continuous at vertices, and on the plane orthogonal to each edge. Besides, a finite element for $symcurl$-conforming trace-free tensors is constructed following the same approach. Putting all together, a finite element $\operatorname {div}\operatorname {div}$ complex, as well as the bubble functions complex, in three dimensions is established.},

We prove consistency of these discretizations.

Moreover, we show desirable long time behavior of these symplectic schemes, and demonstrate their performance on several numerical examples.

We show how the analysis of the Hilbert-Burch matrix of the set of points representing the decomposition can solve this problem in the case of ternary forms. Moreover, when the decomposition is not unique, we show how the procedure of liaison can provide alternative, maybe shorter, decompositions. We give an explicit algorithm that tests our criterion of minimality for the case of ternary forms of degree $9$. This is the first numerical case in which a new phenomenon appears: the span of $18$ general powers of linear forms contains points of (subgeneric) rank $18$, but it also contains points whose rank is $17$, due to the existence of a second shorter decomposition which is completely different from the given one.},

We prove that, for all but a density zero subset of primes, the zeta function $Z(C_p,T)$ is uniquely determined by the Cartier–Manin matrix $A_p$ of $C$ modulo $p$ and the splitting behavior modulo $p$ of $f$ and $\psi _f$; we also show that for primes $\equiv 1 \pmod {3}$ the matrix $A_p$ suffices and that for primes $\equiv 2 \pmod {3}$ the genericity assumption on $C$ is unnecessary. An element of the proof, which may be of independent interest, is the determination of the density of the set of primes of ordinary reduction for a generic Picard curve. By combining this with recent work of Sutherland, we obtain a practical deterministic algorithm that computes $Z(C_p,T)$ for almost all primes $p \le N$ using $N\log (N)^{3+o(1)}$ bit operations.

  abstract     = {Stirling numbers of the first kind are common in number theory and combinatorics; through Ewen’s sampling formula, these numbers enter into the calculation of several population genetics statistics, such as Fu’s $F_s$. In previous papers we have considered an asymptotic estimator for a finite sum of Stirling numbers, which enables rapid and accurate calculation of Fu’s $F_s$. These sums can also be viewed as cumulative distribution functions, leading directly to the possibility of an inversion function, where, given a value for Fu’s $F_s$, the goal is to solve for one of the input parameters. We solve this inversion using Newton iteration for small parameters. For large parameters, we have to extend our earlier obtained asymptotic results to solve the inversion problem asymptotically. Numerical experiments are given to show the efficiency of both solving the inversion problem and the expanded asymptotic estimator for sums of Stirling numbers.},

Such models appear for instance in population dynamics or propagation phenomena. We develop a multi-scale approach by splitting the equations into a micro part and a macro part, from which the original stiffness has been removed. We then show that both parts can be simulated numerically with uniform order of accuracy using standard explicit numerical schemes. As a result, solving the problem in its micro-macro formulation can be done with a cost and an accuracy independent of the stiffness . This work is also a preliminary step towards the application of such methods to hyperbolic partial differential equations and we will indeed demonstrate that our approach can be successfully applied to two discretized hyperbolic systems (with and without non-linearities), though with some ad-hoc regularization.},

In fact, when $0 &lt; \varepsilon \ll 1$, the problem is equivalent to the long-time dynamics of NKGE with small initial data and $O(1)$ nonlinearity strength, while the amplitude of the initial data (and the solution) is at $O(\varepsilon )$. By reformulating the NKGE into a relativistic nonlinear Schrödinger equation, we adapt the TSFP method to discretize it numerically. By using the method of mathematical induction to bound the numerical solution, we prove uniform error bounds at $O(h^{m}+\varepsilon ^{p-\beta }\tau ^2)$ of the TSFP method with $h$ mesh size, $\tau$ time step and $m\ge 2$ depending on the regularity of the solution. The error bounds are uniformly accurate for the long-time simulation up to the time at $O(\varepsilon ^{-\beta })$ and uniformly valid for $\varepsilon \in (0,1]$. Especially, the error bounds are uniformly at the second-order rate for the large time step $\tau = O(\varepsilon ^{-(p-\beta )/2})$ in the parameter regime $0\le \beta &lt;p$. Numerical results are reported to confirm our error bounds in the long-time regime. Finally, the TSFP method and its error bounds are extended to a highly oscillatory complex NKGE which propagates waves with wavelength at $O(1)$ in space and $O(\varepsilon ^{\beta })$ in time and wave velocity at $O(\varepsilon ^{-\beta })$.},

Due to the lack of maximum principle and stiffness caused by the effect of small dissipation coefficient, most existing theoretical analysis relies on adding additional stabilization terms, mollifying the nonlinearity or introducing auxiliary variables which implicitly either changes the structure of the problem or trades accuracy for stability in a subtle way. In this work, we introduce a robust theoretical framework to analyze directly the stability and accuracy of the standard implicit-explicit approach without stabilization or any other modification. We take the Cahn-Hilliard equation as a model case and provide a rigorous stability and convergence analysis for the original semi-discrete scheme under certain time step constraints. These settle several questions which have been open since the work of Chen and Shen [Comput. Phys. Comm. 108 (1998), pp. 147–158].},

After that, with the aid of discrete nonlocal Green’s first identity, we derive Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN)-type ABCs from DtD-type ABCs.

To address this issue, we propose a strictly convex entropy function by adding an extra term to the thermodynamic entropy. Thanks to the strict convexity of the proposed entropy, the Roe-type dissipation operator in terms of the entropy variables can be formulated. Furthermore, we construct two sets of second-order entropy preserving (EP) numerical fluxes for the reactive Euler equations. Based on the EP fluxes and the Roe-type dissipation operators, high-order EP/ES fluxes are derived. Numerical experiments validate the designed accuracy and good performance of our schemes for smooth and discontinuous initial value problems. The entropy decrease of ES schemes is verified as well.},

In this work, we highlight the role of the approximation of the normal and tangent vector. In particular, we show that using the normal and tangent vectors with respect to the discretized domain $\Omega _h$, denoted $\mathbf {n}_h$ and $\boldsymbol {\tau }_h$, is suboptimal. Taking instead a projection of the normal and tangent vectors with respect to $\Omega$, denoted $\mathbf {n}_\pi$ and $\boldsymbol {\tau }_\pi$, gives the best convergence rate that can be expected for a polygonal approximation of a curved boundary. Finally we also prove that, if you use instead the exact slip with $\mathbf {n}_h$ and $\boldsymbol {\tau }_h$, the approximation converges to the wrong solution. This is known as the Babuška-Sapondzhyan Paradox. Thus Nitsche’s method relaxes the slip condition and avoids the lack of convergence.},

Unlike previous approaches to this and related problems our starting point is a regularized least squares formulation in a continuous infinite-dimensional setting that is based on stable variational time-space formulations of the parabolic partial differential equation. This allows us to derive a priori as well as a posteriori error bounds for the recovered states with respect to a certain reference solution. In these bounds the regularization parameter is disentangled from the underlying discretization. An important ingredient for the derivation of a posteriori bounds is the construction of suitable Fortin operators which allow us to control oscillation errors stemming from the discretization of dual norms. Moreover, the variational framework allows us to contrive preconditioners for the discrete problems whose application can be performed in linear time, and for which the condition numbers of the preconditioned systems are uniformly proportional to that of the regularized continuous problem. In particular, we provide suitable stopping criteria for the iterative solvers based on the a posteriori error bounds. The presented numerical experiments quantify the theoretical findings and demonstrate the performance of the numerical scheme in relation with the underlying discretization and regularization.},

This accuracy is preserved due to the conservation properties of the time stepping method. Furthermore, we prove that the resulting scheme approximates the exact solution in the $L^{\infty }(L^2)$-norm with order $\mathcal {O}(\tau ^2 + H^4)$, where $\tau$ denotes the step size.

  abstract     = {Let $E$ be an ordinary elliptic curve over a finite field and $g$ be a positive integer. Under some technical assumptions, we give an algorithm to span the isomorphism classes of principally polarized abelian varieties in the isogeny class of $E^g$. The varieties are first described as hermitian lattices over (not necessarily maximal) quadratic orders and then geometrically in terms of their algebraic theta null point. We also show how to algebraically compute Siegel modular forms of even weight given as polynomials in the theta constants by a careful choice of an affine lift of the theta null point. We then use these results to give an algebraic computation of Serre’s obstruction for principally polarized abelian threefolds isogenous to $E^3$ and of the Igusa modular form in dimension $4$. We illustrate our algorithms with examples of curves with many rational points over finite fields.},

We constructed canonical generators $x_N$ and $y_N$ for the associated function field (see Jorgenson, L. Smajlović, and H. Then [Exp. Math. 25 (2016), pp. 295–319]). In this article we study the Schwarzian derivative of $x_N$, which we express as a polynomial in $y_N$ with coefficients that are rational functions in $x_N$. As a corollary, we prove that for any point $e$ in the upper half-plane which is fixed by an element of $\Gamma _0(N)^+$, one can explicitly evaluate $x_N(e)$ and $y_N(e)$. As it turns out, each value $x_N(e)$ and $y_N(e)$ is an algebraic integer which we are able to understand in the context of explicit class field theory. When combined with our previous article (see Jorgenson, L. Smajlović, and H. Then [Exp. Math. 29 (2020), pp. 1–27]), we now have a complete investigation of $x_N(\tau )$ and $y_N(\tau )$ at any CM point $\tau$, including elliptic points, for any genus one group $\Gamma _0(N)^+$. Furthermore, the present article when combined with the two aforementioned papers leads to a procedure which we expect to yield generators of class fields, and certain subfields, using the Schwarzian derivative and which does not use either modular polynomials or Shimura reciprocity.},

The overposed measured data is a time trace taken on a subset of the domain or its boundary.

We present first order and second order necessary optimality conditions for local minimizers of the optimization problem. We also derive two lower bounds for the nonzero groups of stationary points, which are used to prove that the infinite-dimensional optimization problem can be reduced to a finite-dimensional problem. Moreover, we propose an iteratively reweighted algorithm for the finite-dimensional problem and prove its convergence. Finally, numerical experiments on Cosmic Microwave Background data are presented to show the efficiency of the non-Lipschitz regularization.},

The major challenge in establishing the expansions comes from the fact that the canonical interpolation of both nonconforming elements lacks a crucial superclose property, and the nonconformity of both elements. The main idea is to employ the relation between the lowest-order mixed Raviart–Thomas element and the two nonconforming elements, and consequently make use of the superclose property of the canonical interpolation of the lowest-order mixed Raviart–Thomas element. To overcome the difficulty caused by the nonconformity, the commuting property of the canonical interpolation operators of both nonconforming elements is further used, which turns the consistency error problem into an interpolation error problem.

Our proofs are constructive and yield constants independent of the polynomial degree. We then detail the application of this result to the a posteriori error analysis of the curl–curl problem discretized with Nédélec finite elements of arbitrary order. The resulting estimators are reliable, locally efficient, polynomial-degree-robust, and inexpensive. They are constructed by a broken patchwise equilibration which, in particular, does not produce a globally $\boldsymbol H(\boldsymbol {\operatorname {curl}})$-conforming flux. The equilibration is only related to edge patches and can be realized without solutions of patch problems by a sweep through tetrahedra around every mesh edge.

In particular, our analysis allows for curved element shapes, without the use of non-linear elemental maps. The feasibility of the method relies on the definition of a suitable choice of the discontinuity penalization, which turns out to be explicitly dependent on the particular element shape, but essentially independent on small shape variations. This is achieved upon proving extensions of classical trace and Markov-type inverse estimates to arbitrary element shapes. A further new $H^1-L_2$-type inverse estimate on essentially arbitrary element shapes enables the proof of inf-sup stability of the method in a streamline-diffusion-like norm. These inverse estimates may be of independent interest. A priori error bounds for the resulting method are given under very mild structural assumptions restricting the magnitude of the local curvature of element boundaries. Numerical experiments are also presented, indicating the practicality of the proposed approach.},
