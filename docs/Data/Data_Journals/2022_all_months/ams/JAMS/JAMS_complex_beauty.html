We prove that in a uniform random $n$-element sorting network $\sigma ^n$, all particle trajectories are close to sine curves with high probability. We also find the weak limit of the time-$t$ permutation matrix measures of $\sigma ^n$. As a corollary of these results, we show that if $S_n$ is embedded into $\mathbb {R}^n$ via the map $\tau \mapsto (\tau (1), \tau (2), \dots \tau (n))$, then with high probability, the path $\sigma ^n$ is close to a great circle on a particular $(n-2)$-dimensional sphere in $\mathbb {R}^n$. These results prove conjectures of Angel, Holroyd, Romik, and Vir√°g.},

  abstract     = {We prove that the grand canonical Gibbs state of an interacting quantum Bose gas converges to the Gibbs measure of a nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation in the mean-field limit, where the density of the gas becomes large and the interaction strength is proportional to the inverse density. Our results hold in dimensions $d \leqslant 3$. For $d &gt; 1$ the Gibbs measure is supported on distributions of negative regularity and we have to renormalize the interaction. More precisely, we prove the convergence of the relative partition function and of the reduced density matrices in the $L^r$-norm with optimal exponent $r$. Moreover, we prove the convergence in the $L^\infty$-norm of Wick-ordered reduced density matrices, which allows us to control correlations of Wick-ordered particle densities as well as the asymptotic distribution of the particle number. Our proof is based on a functional integral representation of the grand canonical Gibbs state, in which convergence to the mean-field limit follows formally from an infinite-dimensional stationary phase argument for ill-defined non-Gaussian measures. We make this argument rigorous by introducing a white-noise-type auxiliary field, through which the functional integral is expressed in terms of propagators of heat equations driven by time-dependent periodic random potentials and can, in turn, be expressed as a gas of interacting Brownian loops and paths. When the gas is confined by an external trapping potential, we control the decay of the reduced density matrices using excursion probabilities of Brownian bridges.},

  abstract     = {Let $X$ be an affine spherical variety, possibly singular, and $\mathsf L^+X$ its arc space. The intersection complex of $\mathsf L^+X$, or rather of its finite-dimensional formal models, is conjectured to be related to special values of local unramified $L$-functions. Such relationships were previously established in Braverman‚ÄìFinkelberg‚ÄìGaitsgory‚ÄìMirkoviƒá for the affine closure of the quotient of a reductive group by the unipotent radical of a parabolic, and in Bouthier‚ÄìNg√¥‚ÄìSakellaridis for toric varieties and $L$-monoids. In this paper, we compute this intersection complex for the large class of those spherical $G$-varieties whose dual group is equal to $\check G$, and the stalks of its nearby cycles on the horospherical degeneration of $X$. We formulate the answer in terms of a Kashiwara crystal, which conjecturally corresponds to a finite-dimensional $\check G$-representation determined by the set of $B$-invariant valuations on $X$. We prove the latter conjecture in many cases. Under the sheaf‚Äìfunction dictionary, our calculations give a formula for the Plancherel density of the IC function of $\mathsf L^+X$ as a ratio of local $L$-values for a large class of spherical varieties.},

We prove that for every $n$, all but countably many reals are $n$-random for such a measure, where $n$ indicates the arithmetical complexity of the Martin-L√∂f tests allowed. The proof rests upon an application of Borel determinacy. Therefore, the proof presupposes the existence of infinitely many iterates of the power set of the natural numbers. In the second part of the paper we present a metamathematical analysis showing that this assumption is indeed necessary. More precisely, there exists a computable function $G$ such that, for any $n$, the statement ‚ÄúAll but countably many reals are $G(n)$-random with respect to a continuous probability measure‚Äù cannot be proved in $\mathsf {ZFC}^-_n$. Here $\mathsf {ZFC}^-_n$ stands for Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice, where the Power Set Axiom is replaced by the existence of $n$-many iterates of the power set of the natural numbers.

This implies controllability for the Schr√∂dinger equation by any nonempty open set, and shows that every semiclassical measure has full support. We also prove exponential energy decay for solutions to the damped wave equation on such surfaces, for any nontrivial damping coefficient. These results extend previous works (see Semyon Dyatlov and Long Jin [Acta Math. 220 (2018), pp. 297‚Äì339] and Long Jin [Comm. Math. Phys. 373 (2020), pp. 771‚Äì794]), which considered the setting of surfaces of constant negative curvature.

However, in the variable curvature case the stable/unstable foliations are not smooth, so we can no longer associate to these foliations a pseudodifferential calculus of the type used by Semyon Dyatlov and Joshua Zahl [Geom. Funct. Anal. 26 (2016), pp. 1011‚Äì1094]. Instead, our argument uses Egorov‚Äôs theorem up to local Ehrenfest time and the hyperbolic parametrix of St√©phane Nonnenmacher and Maciej Zworski [Acta Math. 203 (2009), pp. 149‚Äì233], together with the $C^{1+}$ regularity of the stable/unstable foliations.},

  abstract     = {The support of the tensor product decomposition of integrable irreducible highest weight representations of a symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie algebra $\mathfrak {g}$ defines a semigroup of triples of weights. Namely, given $\lambda$ in the set $P_+$ of dominant integral weights, $V(\lambda )$ denotes the irreducible representation of $\mathfrak {g}$ with highest weight $\lambda$. We are interested in the tensor semigroup \begin{equation*} \Gamma _{\mathbb {N}}(\mathfrak {g})‚âî\{(\lambda _1,\lambda _2,\mu )\in P_{+}^3\,|\, V(\mu )\subset V(\lambda _1)\otimes V(\lambda _2)\}, \end{equation*} and in the tensor cone $\Gamma (\mathfrak {g})$ it generates: \begin{equation*} \Gamma (\mathfrak {g})‚âî\{(\lambda _1,\lambda _2,\mu )\in P_{+,{\mathbb {Q}}}^3\,|\,\exists N\geq 1 \quad V(N\mu )\subset V(N\lambda _1)\otimes V(N\lambda _2)\}. \end{equation*} Here, $P_{+,{\mathbb {Q}}}$ denotes the rational convex cone generated by $P_+$. In the special case when $\mathfrak {g}$ is a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra, the tensor semigroup is known to be finitely generated and hence the tensor cone to be convex polyhedral. Moreover, the cone $\Gamma (\mathfrak {g})$ is described in Belkale and Kumar [Invent. Math. 166 (2006), pp. 185‚Äì228] by an explicit finite list of inequalities. In general, $\Gamma (\mathfrak {g})$ is neither polyhedral, nor closed. In this article we describe the closure of $\Gamma (\mathfrak {g})$ by an explicit countable family of linear inequalities for any untwisted affine Lie algebra, which is the most important class of infinite-dimensional Kac-Moody algebra. This solves a Brown-Kumar‚Äôs conjecture in this case (see Brown and Kumar [Math. Ann. 360 (2014), pp. 901‚Äì936]). The difference between the tensor cone and the tensor semigroup is measured by the saturation factors . Namely, a positive integer $d$ is called a saturation factor , if $V(N\lambda _1)\otimes V(N\lambda _2)$ contains $V(N\mu )$ for some positive integer $N$ then $V(d\lambda _1)\otimes V(d\lambda _2)$ contains $V(d\mu )$, assuming that $\mu -\lambda _1-\lambda _2$ belongs to the root lattice. For $\mathfrak {g}={\mathfrak {sl}}_n$, the famous Knutson-Tao theorem asserts that $d=1$ is a saturation factor (see Knutson and Tao [J. Amer. Math. Soc. 12 (1999), pp. 1055‚Äì1090]). More generally, for any simple Lie algebra, explicit saturation factors are known. In the Kac-Moody case, $\Gamma _{\mathbb {N}}(\mathfrak {g})$ is not necessarily finitely generated and hence the existence of such a factor is unclear a priori. Here, we obtain explicit saturation factors for any affine Kac-Moody Lie algebra. For example, in type $\tilde A_n$, we prove that any integer $d\geq 2$ is a saturation factor, generalizing the case $\tilde A_1$ shown in Brown and Kumar [Math. Ann. 360 (2014), pp. 901‚Äì936].},

  abstract     = {We exhibit the first examples of hyperbolic three-manifolds for which the Seiberg-Witten equations do not admit any irreducible solution. Our approach relies on hyperbolic geometry in an essential way; it combines an explicit upper bound for the first eigenvalue on coexact $1$-forms $\lambda _1^*$ on rational homology spheres which admit irreducible solutions together with a version of the Selberg trace formula relating the spectrum of the Laplacian on coexact $1$-forms with the volume and complex length spectrum of a hyperbolic three-manifold. Using these relationships, we also provide precise numerical bounds on $\lambda _1^*$ for several hyperbolic rational homology spheres.},

  abstract     = {We show that the identity component of the group of diffeomorphisms of a closed oriented surface of positive genus admits many unbounded quasi-morphisms. As a corollary, we also deduce that this group is not uniformly perfect and its fragmentation norm is unbounded, answering a question of Burago‚ÄìIvanov‚ÄìPolterovich. As a key tool we construct a hyperbolic graph on which these groups act, which is the analog of the curve graph for the mapping class group.},

  abstract     = {We consider a natural class of ${\mathbf {R}}^d$-valued one-dimensional stochastic partial differential equations (PDEs) driven by space-time white noise that is formally invariant under the action of the diffeomorphism group on ${\mathbf {R}}^d$. This class contains in particular the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, the multiplicative stochastic heat equation, the additive stochastic heat equation, and rough Burgers-type equations. We exhibit a one-parameter family of solution theories with the following properties: For all stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) in our class for which a solution was previously available, every solution in our family coincides with the previously constructed solution, whether that was obtained using It√¥ calculus (additive and multiplicative stochastic heat equation), rough path theory (rough Burgers-type equations), or the Hopf-Cole transform (KPZ equation). Every solution theory is equivariant under the action of the diffeomorphism group, i.e. identities obtained by formal calculations treating the noise as a smooth function are valid. Every solution theory satisfies an analogue of It√¥‚Äôs isometry. The counterterms leading to our solution theories vanish at points where the equation agrees to leading order with the additive stochastic heat equation. In particular, points (2) and (3) show that, surprisingly, our solution theories enjoy properties analogous to those holding for both the Stratonovich and It√¥ interpretations of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) simultaneously . For the natural noisy perturbation of the harmonic map flow with values in an arbitrary Riemannian manifold, we show that all these solution theories coincide. In particular, this allows us to conjecturally identify the process associated to the Markov extension of the Dirichlet form corresponding to the $L^2$-gradient flow for the Brownian loop measure.},
