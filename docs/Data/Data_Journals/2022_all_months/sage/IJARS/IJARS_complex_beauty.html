  abstract     = {To solve some defects of exoskeleton robot at present, this article establishes the dynamic model of human lower limb. The torque curves for hip joint and knee joint are obtained. A dynamics simulation is conducted in ADAMS which will guide the selection of motors and reducers for exoskeleton joints. Three structural design projects for leg and an integrated joint with the function of force perception are proposed. Then a lightweight exoskeleton is put forward and a kinematics simulation of man–machine coupling system is carried out in ADAMS. This article sets up a 24-V low-voltage control electrical system and a rehabilitation training expert system. Some performance tests and clinical experiments are carried out by an experimental prototype. The results show that the joints have sufficient driving torque. Leg structure has large adjustment range and self-locking function. The exoskeleton has lightweight and does not interfere with human body during movement. The expert system has a friendly operation interface and abundant functions. Clinical experimental results show that lower limb exoskeleton has good rehabilitation effect for some diseases.},

The convergence characterization of the algorithm for TMRs under both external disturbances and noises is carried on rigorous mathematical proof.

  abstract     = {This research proposes a multifaceted approach of three-dimensional trajectory planning based on the combination of Rapidly-exploring Random Tree–Connect algorithm and artificial potential field method to improve the path search ability and dynamic obstacles avoidance capability of unmanned aerial vehicles. Firstly, an improved method of the target gravity is developed by controlling the sampling range to reduce invalid sampling and speed up the convergence speed of the algorithm so as to lessen the restriction of low efficiency and random sampling of the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree–Connect algorithm. Moreover, the regulation factor is introduced into the artificial potential field method to deal with the problem of target unreachable in the trajectory planning. Then the improved Rapidly-exploring Random Tree–Connect algorithm is implemented to plan the global path in a complex environment. This step is carried out via selecting the local target point on the global path found in the global plan, dividing the complex environment into simple environment and utilizing the artificial potential field method to achieve the effect of avoiding unknown dynamic obstacles in the simple environment. Finally, cubic B-spline is employed to smoothing of the planned trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate that the combination of two improved algorithms improves the path search ability and dynamic barrier avoidance capability of the unmanned aerial vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Hexapod robots are widely used for resource exploration, post-disaster rescue, and military equipment. They typically travel on rugged and complex roads. The robot itself has a high probability of failure owing to mechanical failure, driving motor failure, or external environmental interference. To improve the adaptability of the robot to a complex environment, a motion control method for fault-tolerant gait was designed. The trajectory generator based on zero-moment point information can generate a smooth desired trajectory for the body’s center of mass, thereby improving the robot’s zero-moment point trajectory tracking effect and motion stability. The force-distribution algorithm based on torque optimization selects the minimum square sum of the driving force as the objective function and reduces the number of constraint equations through QR decomposition to increase the speed at which the expected contact force at the foot is calculated. A CoppeliaSim and MATLAB/Gurobi joint simulation platform were built to simulate and verify the fault-tolerant motion planning of the hexapod robot and foot contact force control algorithm. The feasibility and effectiveness of the fault-tolerant motion planning and foot force control algorithm applied to a hexapod robot with a single-foot failure are verified.},

As manipulators are complex online multivariable systems, there are various uncertainties in different environments and working conditions. Accurate dynamic parameters are difficult to obtain in practical engineering applications. In this article, a controller is designed by combining the precise control torques obtained by the analytical dynamics method with the compensation control torques obtained by sliding mode method for trajectory tracking of the manipulator with bounded uncertainty. Precise control torques obtained from the Udwadia–Kalaba modeling method could be applied for the control of the ideal manipulator tracking the desired trajectory. Compensation control torques obtained from the sliding mode concept and the Lyapunov stability theory could be applied to compensate the uncertainties of parameters and external disturbances, thus enhancing the robustness of the system. By combining precise control torques with compensation control torques, the end point of the manipulator with uncertainty could track the end of the ideal manipulator and then track the desired trajectory. The simulation results of the three-link manipulator with uncertainty show that the control method can make the controlled target approach the desired trajectory in relatively small torque ranges and obtain high stability accuracy, and the chattering is effectively reduced at the stage of approaching the sliding mode surface.},

This article presents ROMERIN, a new concept of a modular legged climbing robot where each leg is an autonomous robotic module in terms of processing capacity, control, and energy. The legs are equipped with suction cups that allow the robot to adhere to different types of surfaces. The proposed design allows the creation of climbing robots with a different number of legs to perform specific inspection tasks. Although each of the legs acts as an independent robot, they have the ability to share information and energy. The proposed control concept enables the development of climbing robots with the ability to adapt to different types of inspection tasks and with resilience characteristics. This article includes a description of the mechatronic design, the kinematics of the seven degree-of-freedom robotic legs, including the adhesion system, and the architecture of the control and simulation system. Finally, we present experimental results to test the modularity concept, mechanical design, and electronics using a four-legged robot configuration. We analyze the performance of the gripping system in different situations on four different surfaces and the behavior of the control architecture for two different robot body trajectories.},

In view of the properties of fast convergence speed and great estimation performance in radial basis function neural network, radial basis function neural network is used to approximate the internal uncertain dynamic parameters of the system. An observer-based estimator is introduced for estimating the matched and mismatched disturbances in flexible-joint robotic manipulator dynamics. As to the differential explosion problem in backstepping control design, this article utilizes second-order command filters to overcome it. This article also adopts barrier Lyapunov functions for implementing output constraint to consider security issues in practical use. For demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed controller, numerical simulations on two-link flexible-joint robotic manipulators are conducted.

  abstract     = {This article proposes a mutual positioning relay method that enables multiple robots to monitor indoor environments. Here, robots refer to a small number of parent robots with high positioning performance and a large number of child robots with minimal positioning performance. The parent robot can estimate its state accurately by itself. In comparison, the child robots have position errors that accumulate with time as they use only odometry information for positioning. Each robot can recognize other robots in its field of view by using a depth camera. It then performs relative positioning and estimates its position of itself or that of other robots on the map. The uncertainty of the position estimation is compared with each other, and the robot with a certain position becomes a positioning reference for the robot with an uncertain position. In this way, both the parent and child robots relay relative positioning with each other, following which all the robots accurately estimate their positions. In this study, six robots based on Roomba were used. The performance of the proposed method was verified based on experimental data of autonomous navigation tests. Our results showed that the proposed method could realize an accuracy that was four to five times better than that performed independently by a child robot. Our findings also revealed that the proposed method can recover the failure of the state estimation of the parent robot.},

A brief perspective on the focus of the experimental design is presented on the stick–slip friction of a palletizing robot’s hand guidance as a collaborative robot. The palletizing robot typically has a simple mechanical structure but possesses over 16 bearings to constrain the motion of the dual-parallelogram linkage mechanism. First, the hand-guiding force was successfully measured. Second, an image model was built based on the obtained measurement results. Third, the stick–slip results for the working space were analyzed using an image model. Finally, related conclusions and recommendations are provided for precision positioning control. A significant aspect of this study is identifying the hand-guiding force in the working space of a ceiling-mounted collaborative robot.

This article proposes a multichannel information fusion method for the movement conversion process of squat/sit-to-stand, which can help online movement conversion classification during rehabilitation training. We collected a training dataset from a total of eight subjects performing three different motions, including half squat, full squat, and sitting, equipped with plantar pressure sensors, RGB cameras, and five inertial measurement units. Our evaluation includes the misjudgment rate for each action and the time needed for classification. The experimental results show that, compared with the recognition of a single sensor, the accuracy after fusion can reach 96.6% in the case of no occlusion and 86.7% in the case of occlusion. Compared with the complete time window, the classification time window is shortened by approximately 25%.},

  abstract     = {This article is dedicated to solving the problem of predefined-time cooperative control for autonomous surface vessels encountering model uncertainties and external perturbations. By virtue of the prescribed-time stable theory, a robust formation controller is constructed, with which the settling time of the cooperative system can be prescribed in advance. The controller is developed under the backstepping framework, where the dynamic surface control is applied to generate the real-time command. Considering the unmodeled autonomous surface vessel dynamics, the neural network-based nonlinear approximator is incorporated with minimum-learning-parameter technique. Under this scenario, the real-time control can be pursed with one parameter being estimated. Finally, comparative simulation examples are provided to exhibit the effectiveness and advantages of designed control strategies.},

  abstract     = {With the introduction of the laterally bounded forces, the tilt-rotor gains more flexibility in the controller design. Typical feedback linearization methods utilize all the inputs in controlling this vehicle; the magnitudes as well as the directions of the thrusts are maneuvered simultaneously based on a unified control rule. Although several promising results indicate that these controllers may track the desired complicated trajectories, the tilting angles are required to change relatively fast or in large scale during the flight, which turns to be a challenge in application. The recent gait plan for a tilt-rotor may solve this problem; the tilting angles are fixed or vary in a predetermined pattern without being maneuvered by the control algorithm. Carefully avoiding the singular decoupling matrix, several attitudes can be tracked without changing the tilting angles frequently. While the position was not directly regulated in that research, which left the position-tracking still an open question. In this research, we elucidate the coupling relationship between the position and the attitude. Based on this, we design the position-tracking controller, adopting feedback linearization. A cat-trot gait is further designed for a tilt-rotor to track the reference; three types of references are designed for our tracking experiments: set point, uniform rectilinear motion, and uniform circular motion. The significant improvement with less steady state error is witnessed after equipping with our modified attitude–position decoupler. It is also found that the frequency of the cat-trot gait highly influenced the steady state error.},

However, existing methods generally only focus on the exploration effect of target decision but neglect the environment information gained with trajectory planning during flight, resulting in redundant exploration trajectories and low exploration efficiency. This article proposes an upgraded method of trajectory planning for autonomous exploration work. We design a fresh cost term considering the frontier information in the part of trajectory optimization. Besides, yaw angles are planned independently to catch more environment information during flight. We present extensive simulations and real-world tests. The results show that our proposed method reduces the exploration cost time by 10–15% compared with the previous one.},

  abstract     = {Redundant manipulators are flexible enough to adapt to complex environments, but their controller is also required to be specific for their extra degrees of freedom. Inspired by the morphology of snakes, we propose a path planning algorithm named Swinging Search and Crawling Control, which allows the snake-like redundant manipulators to explore in complex pipeline environments without collision. The proposed algorithm consists of the Swinging Search and the Crawling Control. In Swinging Search, a collision-free manipulator configuration that of the end-effector in the target point is found by applying reinforcement learning to self-motion, instead of designing joint motion. The self-motion narrows the search space to the null space, and the reinforcement learning makes the algorithm use the information of the environment, instead of blindly searching. Then in Crawling Control, the manipulator is controlled to crawl to the target point like a snake along the collision-free configuration. It only needs to search for a collision-free configuration for the manipulator, instead of searching collision-free configurations throughout the process of path planning. Simulation experiments show that the algorithm can complete path planning tasks of hyper-redundant manipulators in complex environments. The 16 degrees of freedom and 24 degrees of freedom manipulators can achieve 83.3% and 96.7% success rates in the pipe, respectively. In the concentric pipe, the 24 degrees of freedom manipulator has a success rate of 96.1%.},

The six-axis robotic scanning free-space measurement system uses a RobotStudio to extract the position and orientation of each target point on the specimen to be evaluated and uses a robotic scanning algorithm to transform all the points into a scan path. The system was verified by variable and constant curvature radar absorbing structure specimens with frequency selective surfaces. Return losses ( S 11 s) of the nonsymmetrical cambered airfoil specimen and S-shaped double curvature specimen that could not be accurately evaluated with a three-axis stage-based scanning free-space measurement system were measured by the six-axis robotic scanning free-space measurement system. All the specimen results adhere to the theoretical parameters of the specimen. The transition region results of the S-shaped specimen were studied using effective radius of curvature.

  abstract     = {In nuclear and radiation-related industries, it is crucial to ensure that the radiation dose exposure to the radiation worker is maintained below the permissible dose limit. A radiation map is a useful tool for visualizing the radiation distribution across the work area and for coordinating activities involving the hotspots (high radiation areas). The goal of this work was to design and implement a coverage path planning approach for autonomous radiation mapping carried out by a mobile robot. Given a 2D occupancy map, a method to generate uniformly distributed sampling points was proposed. The geometry of the region of interest, the radiation detector module, and the radiation measurement parameters were considered in formulating the sampling positions. Next, the coverage path planning planner integrates the nearest neighbor and depth-first search algorithms to create a continuous path that enables the robot to visit all the sampling points. The K-means clustering algorithm is added for systematic coverage of a large number of sampling points. The clustering provides options to partition the region of interest into smaller spaces, where the robot would perform the mapping cluster by cluster. Finally, the method of building the radiation map from the acquired data was also presented. The approach was implemented in ROS using a commercial mobile robot equipped with a Geiger–Muller detector. The performance and reliability of the proposed approach were evaluated with a series of simulations and real-world experiments. The results showed that the robot is able to perform autonomous radiation mapping at various target areas. The accuracy of the generated radiation map and the hotspots classifications were also compared and evaluated with conventional manual measurements. Overall, the theoretical frameworks and experiments have provided convincing results in the automation of hazardous work and subsequently toward improving the occupational safety of radiation workers.},

First, by utilizing the generalized proportional integral observer, the lumped time-varying disturbances of unmanned aerial vehicle are estimated. Secondly, combining the value of disturbance estimation and feedforward controller by using backstepping control technology together, a composite controller has been developed, which can be called as backstepping control + generalized proportional integral observer.

  abstract     = {For patients with upper limb dysfunction after stroke, robot-assisted rehabilitation training plays an important role in functional recovery. The existing upper limb rehabilitation robots have some problems, such as complex mechanisms, insufficient compliance, and can only realize the rehabilitation training of shoulder and elbow joints in the horizontal plane. This research proposes a novel end-effector upper limb rehabilitation robot with three degrees of freedom. Two horizontal rotation freedoms are driven by motors and one vertical translation freedom is driven by a pneumatic cylinder. So it can realize the spatial rehabilitation training of shoulder and elbow joints. The rotation and translation transformation of the robot can be represented by a dual quaternion, which is concise in form and clear in the physical meaning. Therefore, this article adopts dual quaternions to complete the robot’s kinematics modeling, inverse kinematics calculation, and terminal spiral motion trajectory planning. To improve the low-speed moving performance of the spiral motion, a sliding mode control strategy plus feedforward compensation is employed to control the displacement of the cylinder. Experiments show that the robot can realize proximal joints training and has good position tracking accuracy (tracking error is within 2 mm) with smoothness under the proposed control strategy, which can guarantee the accuracy and comfort of passive rehabilitation training, contributing to restoring the function of the impairment upper limbs.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes an Intelligent Carom Billiards Assistive System for a novice at Carom Billiards. Since a novice player is very difficult to find the solution paths of the cue ball, the ICBAS automatically calculates the solution paths for given ball configuration which is detected by a monocular vision and displays them in a guidance monitor. For rapid and systematically calculating the solution paths, the five and half system that is the most representative method in the field of billiard is implemented. In addition, the paths of the cue ball changed by the direction of the cue stick are predicted in real time and projected onto the pool table bed. By comparing the solution paths of the cue ball with the projected paths, a player can hit the cue ball easily and successfully. For automatically providing the solution paths and the predicted paths during billiard game, the ball movement is detected by the principal component analysis under linear motion constraints robustly against image noise, occlusion, and so on. Whenever all of the balls stop, both paths are newly calculated and provided for a player. For verifying the feasibility of the proposed Intelligent Carom Billiards Assistive System, the experiments are conducted with the real pool table.},

  abstract     = {This article presents the design, functional simulation, and prototype of an innovative adaptive jaw gripper. First, based on the comparative analysis of several types of anthropomorphic finger grippers and adaptive jaw grippers, to avoid their disadvantages, the structural scheme of a gripper module based on a polycontour mechanism, comprising a guided parallelogram contour, was established to obtain a parallel translational movement of the elements of the jaw holders and therefore of the jaws. Then the structural analysis is briefly made to verify the correct operation of the mechanism of the gripping module, and details of the kinematic analysis and of the design of the components in the CATIA software are given. After obtaining the 3D version of the gripping module, its functional simulation and ADAMS analysis is performed. The sensory system used at the level of the jaws is also described and then the gripper assembly is obtained including a base plate and five gripper modules and as a result an adaptive gripper with five jaw holder elements is created. Next is the functional simulation of the adaptive gripper for gripping several types of parts. The prototype made and the test are presented for gripping five types of parts and we show the prospects of continuing this research with practical applicability by mounting on a robot and implementing in a robotic line for gripping and handling a series of parts of various shapes and sizes.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, surface electromyogram signals have been increasingly used to operate wearable devices. These devices can aid to help workers or soldiers to lower the load in the task to boost efficiency. However, achieving effective signal prediction has always been a challenge. It is critical to use an appropriate signal preprocessing method and prediction algorithm when developing a controller that can accurately predict and control human movements in real time. For this purpose, this article investigates the effect of various surface electromyogram preprocessing methods and algorithms on prediction results. Walking data (surface electromyogram angle) were collected from 10 adults (5 males and 5 females). To investigate the effect of preprocessing methods on the experimental results, the raw surface electromyogram signals were grouped and subjected to different preprocessing (bandpass/principal component analysis/independent component analysis, respectively). The processed data were then imported into the random forest and support vector regression algorithm for training and prediction. Multiple scenarios were combined to compare the results. The independent component analysis-processed data had the best performance in terms of convergence time and prediction accuracy in the support vector regression algorithm. The prediction accuracy of knee motion with this scheme was 94.54% ± 2.98. Notably, the forecast time was halved in comparison to the other combinations. The independent component analysis algorithm’s “blind source separation” feature effectively separates the original surface electromyogram signal and reduces signal noise, hence increasing prediction efficiency. The main contribution of this work is that the method (independent component analysis + support vector regression) has the potency of best prediction of surface electromyogram signal for knee movement. This work is the first step toward myoelectric control of assisted exoskeleton robots through discrete decoding.},

However, only a few methods completely decouple the control. This study introduces a novel camera pose estimation method, which is a closed-form solution, based on the image moments of planar objects. Traditional position-based visual servoing estimates the pose of a camera relative to an object, but the pose estimation method directly estimates the pose of an initial camera relative to a desired camera. Because the estimation method is based on plane parameters, a plane parameters estimation method based on the 2D rotation, 2D translation, and scale invariant moments is also proposed. A completely decoupled position-based visual servoing control scheme from the two estimation methods above was adopted. The new scheme exhibited asymptotic stability when the object plane was in the camera field of view. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the two estimation methods and the advantages of the visual servo control scheme compared with the classical method.},

Firstly, the influence of the guidance distance to the nonlinear path following method was verified through a flight experiment, and the importance of the critical time for route switchover was deduced. The on-line transition trajectory generation was expected to realize the automation of the switchover process, including the computation of the critical switchover time and desired paths. Secondly, to generate the on-line transition trajectory, the computation method was derived for typical intense maneuvers, such as the turning maneuver for square trajectory, or the converging maneuver to the expected trajectory under initial numerous errors (such as modifying the waypoint during a flight mission). Finally, to solve the situations in which the transition trajectory does not exist, an adaptive guidance distance algorithm was proposed to improve the flight stability and accuracy. From the simulation and flight experiment results, stability and high accuracy can be guaranteed for different situations with the proposed methods. The path following error is smaller than 1.0 m when it is converged (in downwind or upwind situations), which is important for the method to be used widely.},

As a result, efforts are focused on two aspects, and diverse structures of end-effector, target recognition methods as well as their combinations are yielded continuously. A good understanding for the working principle, advantages, limitations, and the adaptability in respective fields is helpful to design picking robots. Therefore, depending on different grasping ways, separating methods, structures, materials, and driving modes, main characteristics existing in traditional schemes will be depicted firstly. According to technical routes, advantages, potential applications, and challenges, underactuated manipulators and soft manipulators representing future development are then summarized systematically. Secondly, partial recognition and localization methods are also demonstrated. Specifically, current recognition manners adopting the single-feature, multi-feature fusion and deep learning are explained in view of their advantages, limitations, and successful instances. In the field of 3D localization, active vision based on the structured light, laser scanning, time of flight, and radar is reflected through the respective applications. Also, another 3D localization method called passive vision is also evaluated by advantages, limitations, the degree of automation, reconstruction effects, and the application scenario, such as monocular vision, binocular vision, and multiocular vision. Finally portrayed from structural development, recognition, and localization methods, it is possible to develop future end-effectors for fruit and vegetable picking robots with superior characteristics containing the less driving element, rigid–flexible–bionic coupling soft manipulators, simple control program, high efficiency, low damage, low cost, high versatility, and high recognition accuracy in all-season picking tasks.},

As such, a novel predictive-guide following strategy is proposed to improve the stability of astronaut–robot distance in obstructive environments. This strategy combines a deep reinforcement learning navigator and a Kalman filter-based predictor to generate optimized motion sequences for safely following the astronaut and acquire predictive guidance concerning future astronaut movements. The proposed model achieved a success rate of 95.0% in simulated navigation tasks and adapted well to untrained complex environments and varied robot movement settings. Comparative tests indicated our strategy managed to stabilize the following distance to within ±1.0 m of the reference value in obstructed environments, significantly outperforming other following strategies.

  abstract     = {In hazardous situations involving the dispersion of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear pollutants, timely containment of the emission is critical. A contaminant disperses as a dynamically evolving plume into the atmosphere, introducing complex difficulties in predicting the dispersion trajectory and potential evacuation sites. Strategies for predictive modeling of rapid contaminant dispersion demand localization of the emission source, a task performed effectively via unmanned mobile-sensing platforms. With vast possibilities in sensor configurations and source-seeking algorithms, platform deployment in real-world applications involves much uncertainty alongside opportunity. This work aims to develop a plume source detection simulator to offer a reliable comparison of source-seeking approaches and performance testing of ground-based mobile-sensing platform configurations prior to experimental field testing. Utilizing ROS, Gazebo, MATLAB, and Simulink, a virtual environment is developed for an unmanned ground vehicle with a configurable array of sensors capable of measuring plume dispersion model data mapped into the domain. For selected configurations, gradient-based and adaptive exploration algorithms were tested for source localization using Gaussian dispersion models in addition to large eddy simulation models incorporating the effects of atmospheric turbulence. A unique global search algorithm was developed to locate the true source with overall success allowing for further evaluation in field experiments. From the observations obtained in simulation, it is evident that source-seeking performance can improve drastically by designing algorithms for global exploration while incorporating measurements of meteorological parameters beyond solely concentration (e.g. wind velocity and vorticity) made possible by the inclusion of high-resolution large eddy simulation plume data.},

Aiming at high efficiency and low energy consumption of self-reconfigurable robot configuration transformation, a self-reconfiguration strategy based on module mapping of the common parts is proposed. This strategy describes the configuration of the robot in the form of a graph, and a method to determine the central node of configuration is proposed. The central node module as the starting node for comparison of different configurations, and the common part between the two configurations is reserved. Then the module closest to the target module is searched, the target configuration is reconfigured from the inside to the outside with the minimum energy consumption constraint. Finally, based on the experiment results, compared with other self-reconfiguration strategies, the proposed self-reconfiguration strategy reduces the times of reconfiguration operations and improves the reconfiguration efficiency.},

  abstract     = {To improve the precision and reduce the movement uncertainty of the industrial robot, a novel hybrid optimization algorithm which combines adaptive genetic algorithm with simulated annealing algorithm is proposed in this article. First, for the sake of increasing the global exploring ability of relevant individuals, the adaptive crossover and mutation operator are used in the phase of adaptive genetic algorithm. If the population optimized by adaptive genetic algorithm is trapped in the local optimal area and simultaneously meets the transformation rule, then it is consequently optimized by simulated annealing to enhance the population diversity and hunt for a better solution so that the probability of finding the global optimal solution is greatly increased. Then, corresponding experiments based on single point repeatability are conducted to acquire data and identify the structural parameters of the industrial robot. Moreover, the single point repeatability test and length test are all implemented at the same time to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. At last, the result reveals that the proposed method is effective to identify the real structural parameters of the industrial robot, thus enormously decreasing the single point repeatability and length deviation at the same time, which extremely increases the precision and decreases the movement uncertainty of the industrial robot.},

A deep Q-network learning agent learns a policy estimating the interaction matrix for visual servoing of a rotor unmanned helicopter using continuous observation. The observation includes a combination of feature errors. The current matrix and the desired matrix constitute the action space. A well-designed reward guides the deep Q-network agent to get a policy to generate a time-varying linear combination between the current matrix and the desired matrix. Then, the interaction matrix is calculated by the linear combination. The potential mapping between the observation and the interaction matrix is learned by cascading the deep neural network layers. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves faster convergence and lower target loss probability in tracking than the visual servoing methods with the fixed parameter.},

The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles in public airspace is becoming an important issue that should be addressed. As the number of unmanned aerial vehicles and their applications are largely increasing, air traffic with more unmanned aircraft has to be given more attention to prevent collisions and maintain safe skies. Unmanned aerial vehicle air traffic integration and regulation has become a priority to different regulatory agencies and has become of greater interest for many researchers all around the world. In this research, a sampling-based air traffic integration, path planning, and collision avoidance approach is presented. The proposed algorithm expands an existing 2D sampling-based approach. The original 2D approach deals with only two unmanned aircraft. Each of the two aircraft shares location information with a ground-based path planner computer, which would send back the avoidance waypoints after performing the 2D sampling. The algorithm proposed in this article can handle any number of drones in the 3D space by performing either 2D or 3D sampling. The proposed work shows a 10-fold enhancement in terms of the number of unmanned aerial vehicle collisions. The presented results also contribute to enabling a better understanding of what is expected of integrating more drones in dense skies.},

To improve the motion performance of the remotely operated underwater vehicle with this configuration for some typical operation tasks, a multistep thrust allocation method based on priority idea is proposed. Firstly, the thrust allocation result of every single force/moment among the horizontal thrusters is obtained by using a piecewise calculation method. Then, a thrust allocation function of multiple forces and moment is constructed, transforming the thrust allocation problem into a multiparameter optimization problem. The objective function of the optimization problem is established based on priority idea, and limits of the thrusters are considered as constraints. Finally, a thrust redistribution method is adopted in order to further utilize the unsaturated thrusters in the propulsion system. Simulation results show that the proposed thrust allocation method has various advantages over the pseudo-inverse method, which makes the remotely operated underwater vehicle perform perfectly in the given operation task. The proposed method has important practical value and application prospects.},

  abstract     = {Complete coverage, which is integral to many robotic applications, aims to cover an area as quickly as possible. In such tasks, employing multiple robots can reduce the overall coverage time by appropriate task allocation. Several multi-robot coverage approaches divide the environment into balanced subareas and minimize the maximum subarea of all robots. However, balanced coverage in many situations, such as in the cases of robots with different velocities and heterogeneous multi-robot systems, may have inefficient results. This study addresses the unbalanced complete coverage problem of multiple robots with different velocities for a known environment. First, we propose a novel credit model to transform the unbalanced coverage problem into a set of single-objective optimization problems, which can find a combinational optimal solution by optimizing each separate objective function of the single-objective optimization problem to alleviate the computational complexity. Then, we propose a credit-based algorithm composed of a cyclic region growth algorithm and a region fine-tuning algorithm. The cyclic region growth algorithm finds an initial solution to the single-objective optimization problems set by a regional growth strategy with multiple restricts, whereas the region fine-tuning algorithm reallocates the tasks of the partitions with too many tasks to the partitions with too few tasks by constructing a search tree, thereby converging the initial solution to the optimal solution. Simulation results indicate that compared with conventional multi-robot complete coverage problem algorithms, the credit-based algorithm can obtain the optimal solution with the increased number of robots and enlarged size of the mission environment.},

In this article, we present an efficient and adaptive sensor-fusion odometry framework based on simultaneous localization and mapping to handle the localization problems of agricultural unmanned ground vehicles without the assistance of a global positioning system. The framework leverages three kinds of sub-odometry (lidar odometry, visual odometry and inertial odometry) and automatically combines them depending on the environment to provide accurate pose estimation in real time. The combination of sub-odometry is implemented by trading off the robustness and the accuracy of pose estimation. The efficiency and adaptability are mainly reflected in the novel surfel-based iterative closest point method for lidar odometry we propose, which utilizes the changeable surfel radius range and the adaptive iterative closest point initialization to improve the accuracy of pose estimation in different environments. We test our system in various agricultural unmanned ground vehicles’ working zones and some other open data sets, and the results prove that the proposed method shows better performance mainly in accuracy, efficiency and robustness, compared with the state-of-art methods.},

Cave sites often contain the best-preserved material in the archeological record. Yet few sites are fully mapped. Large caves environment usually contains complex geometric structures and objects, which must be scanned with long overlapped camera trajectories for better coverage. Due to the error in camera tracking of such scanning, reconstruction results often contain flaws and mismatches. To solve this problem, we propose a framework for surface loop closure, where loops are detected with a compute unified device architecture accelerated point cloud registration algorithm. After a loop is detected, a novel surface loop filtering method is proposed for robust loop optimization. This loop filtering method is robust to different scan patterns and can cope with tracking failure recovery so that there is more flexibility for unmanned aerial vehicles to fly and record data. We run experiments on public data sets and our cave data set for analysis and robustness tests. Experiments show that our system produces improved results on baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Despite advances in modern control theory and artificial intelligence technology, current methods for tuning proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller parameters based on the traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm do not meet the requirements for controlling an unmanned surface vessel (USV) propulsion motor. To overcome the disadvantages of the PSO algorithm, such as low precision and easily falling into a local optimum, the beetle antennae search (BAS) algorithm can be introduced into the PSO algorithm by replacing particles with beetles, and effectively prevents the PSO algorithm from easily falling into the local optimum. At the same time, the BAS algorithm will no longer be limited to single objective parameterization. Herein, we propose a PID parameter optimization method based on the hybrid BAS-PSO algorithm for a USV propulsion motor. The PID parameter optimization of propulsion motor effectively becomes a beetle foraging problem with group optimization. Numerical results show that the method can effectively solve the problems of PSO and greatly improve convergence speed. Compared with the genetic algorithm and standard PSO algorithm, the BAS-PSO algorithm is superior for PID parameter tuning and can improve performance of USV propulsion system.},

  abstract     = {Many robot manipulation processes involve large visual range variation between the hand-eye camera and the object, which in turn causes object scale change of a large span in the image sequence captured by the camera. In order to accurately guide the manipulator, the relative 6 degree of freedom (6D) pose between the object and manipulator is continuously required in the process. The large-span scale change of the object in the image sequence often leads to the 6D pose tracking failure of the object for existing pose tracking methods. To tackle this problem, this article proposes a novel scale-adaptive region-based monocular pose tracking method. Firstly, the impact of the object scale on the convergence performance of the local region-based pose tracker is meticulously tested and analyzed. Then, a universal region radius calculation model based on object scale is built based on the statical analysis result. Finally, we develop a novel scale-adaptive localized region-based pose tracking model by merging the scale-adaptive radius selection mechanism into the local region-based method. The proposed method adjusts local region size according to the scale of the object projection and achieves robust pose tracking. Experiment results on synthetic and real image sequences indicate that the proposed method achieves better performance over the traditional localized region-based method in manipulator operation scenarios which involve large visual range variation.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the learning-based LiDAR odometry has obtained robust estimation results in the field of mobile robot localization, but most of them are constructed based on the idea of supervised learning. In the network training stage, these supervised learning-based methods rely heavily on real pose labels, which is defective in practical applications. Different from these methods, a novel self-supervised LiDAR odometry, namely SSLO, is proposed in this article. The proposed SSLO only uses unlabeled point cloud data to train the three-view pose network to complete the robot localization task. Specifically, first, due to the sparseness and disorder of the original LiDAR point cloud, it is difficult to use deep convolutional neural networks for feature extraction. In this article, the spherical projection of the point cloud is used to convert the original point cloud into a regular vertex map. Then the vertex map obtained by the projection is used as the input of the neural network. Second, in the network training phase, SSLO uses multiple geometric losses for different situations of matching point clouds and introduces uncertainty weights when calculating the losses to reduce the interference of noise or moving objects in the scene. Last but not least, the proposed method is not only used in the simulation experiments based on the KITTI dataset and Apollo-SouthBay dataset but also applied to a real-world wheeled robot SLAM task. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method has good performance in different environments.},

After that, a set of localization rules is designed to apply this method to the swarm system, which mainly include establishment of reference coordinate system, localization of the adjacent layer of the seed robot, and localization between layers, so that the initial coordinates of all robots can be obtained directly with only one seed robot. Then we described the implementation process of dynamic localization of swarm robots based on the initial static localization in the edge detour motion mode.

In this article, a kind of topology optimization method based on orthogonal experiment was proposed to avoid this mismatch. For this method, the extreme working condition of robots was determined by finding out the combination of robot joint angles when the stress of the part was maximum based on orthogonal experiment. And then, the structure of the part was optimized with the objective of minimizing mass and the constraint of the maximum end displacement of the robots. Finally, the proposed method and the existing method were applied to the lightweight design of a 7 degree of freedom upper limb powered exoskeleton robot, and the results demonstrated that the presented approach can reduce 6.78% maximum end displacement of the robot on average compared with the existing one. It can be concluded that the proposed method in this article is more reasonable and applicable to the structure optimization of collaborative robots.},

And velocity planning is one of the most important factors to determine the performance of position–velocity–time motion. To generate smooth trajectory while satisfying the kinematic constraints of the devices such as the maximum velocity, acceleration, and jerk, a novel velocity planning method is proposed. Firstly, a modified S-shaped acceleration/deceleration algorithm is designed to restrict the kinematic parameters. Meanwhile, a series of rules are specified to constrain the velocity profile to simplify the velocity planning process. On this basis, the velocity planning method is proposed based on the modified acceleration/deceleration algorithm. For reasonable position–velocity–time command, the given position–velocity–time conditions can be satisfied with smooth velocity profile, where the kinematic parameters can be limited in their allowable ranges. For unreasonable position–velocity–time commands, a series of planning strategies are designed to adjust the given conditions according to the user needs, which is suitable for the real application. The comparative experiments show that the proposed method can realize the velocity planning for position–velocity–time motion with smooth trajectory while restricting the kinematic parameters. The computational load is also tested to satisfy the real-time requirement. Therefore, the proposed velocity planning method has good performance and strong practicability.},

However, the computing power of embedded devices is limited. It is unreasonable for the visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm to occupy most CPU computing resources while the GPU is idle. In this article, a parallelization scheme for the VINS-Mono algorithm based on GPU parallel computing technology is proposed. Based on the compute unified device architecture, the construction and solution of the incremental equation are parallelized in the nonlinear optimization process of the algorithm, and the parallelization methods provided by cuSOLVER and cuBLAS are used to carry out the marginalization of the algorithm. In addition, the program for the detection and matching of image feature points in the process of optical flow tracking is rewritten in the algorithm to realize the parallelization of optical flow tracking. After parallelization, the algorithm is found to run well on a heterogeneous computing model composed of a CPU and GPU and can fully exploit the parallel computing power of the GPU. The proposed method was tested on an NVIDIA’s Jetson TX2 module and compared with the VINS-Mono algorithm; the speeds of the construction and solution of the incremental equation were found to be the same, but the optical flow tracking and marginalization speed of the proposed scheme exhibited improvements of about 1.5–1.7 times and 1.9 times, respectively.},

  abstract     = {As a new type of ground transportation system, an unmanned metamorphic vehicle can naturally switch between wheeled driving and legged walking through vehicle reconstruction. Therefore, compared with traditional vehicles, unmanned metamorphic vehicles can move quickly on structural roads and have high trafficability on nonstructural roads. Furthermore, an unmanned metamorphic vehicle is applicable to interstellar detection and earthquake rescue. In this study, the topological structure of an unmanned metamorphic vehicle was designed and the reconstruction process was described. In addition, a kinematic analysis was conducted on the three stages (supporting, lifting, and standing-up) of reconfiguring the metamorphic vehicle. The kinematic and corresponding dynamic models were established based on the screw theory and the Lagrange equation. A Matlab/Simulink simulation was then carried out for the unmanned metamorphic vehicle. The simulation results describe the motion behavior of the system reconstruction, illustrating that the established kinematic and dynamic models are reasonable. Finally, the correctness of the abovementioned kinematic and dynamic models was further verified by Adams virtual prototype simulation. The above findings provide a solid foundation for future studies on stability control during the reconstruction of unmanned metamorphic vehicles.},
