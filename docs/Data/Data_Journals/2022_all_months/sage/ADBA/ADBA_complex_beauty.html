  abstract     = {This article aims to sketch a new integrative perspective on what I call change-ability. I define change-ability as skilled ways of coordinating with a rapidly changing world. Many urgent societal challenges – from climate change to obesity, from the mass extinction of species to fraying social cohesion – require people to collectively change everyday patterns of behaviour they take for granted. The key insight I start from is that to durably change undesirable patterns of behaviour, we could start by changing the affordances the environment offers – the possibilities for action offered to us by the living environment. The aim of this article is to sketch an integrative conceptual framework for understanding change-ability in terms in terms of a dynamical ‘brain ↔ body ↔ community ↔ landscape of affordances’ system. This Change-Ability Conceptual Framework starts from the idea that individuals and communities are situated in the same rich landscape of affordances and suggests that making communities more change-able entails transforming the material ‘grooves’ that have formed in this landscape of affordances.},

Departing from personal experience and Nicholas Mirzoeff’s counterhistory of visuality, I analyze what it means to imagine “the end of sitting.” Through an engagement with crip theory and disability activism, I aim to understand which architectural sites should be disrupted. RAAAF’s practice of cutting and splitting closely relates to the work of the ‘70s artist Gordon Matta-Clark. But the radical proposals of both RAAAF and Matta-Clark engage with power in almost oppositional ways. While Matta-Clark offers the cut as a final space, RAAAF aims to create new worlds. I question the need for new worlds, since they are built on current power structures, instead of dismantling them.},

  abstract     = {It is usually a mark of good design when technologies and tools that mediate goal-directed action are such that the user’s attentional focus is maintained on the intended ends of action rather than on the technologies and tools themselves. When the mediators become the focus, the continuity of goal-directed action is disrupted, and the flow of action can be re-directed. What then is the purpose of the projects designed by the RAAAF studio, as described by Rietveld, which seem to be intended to do both? Disruption of the continuity of goal-directed perception-action may prompt reflection about the circumstances at work, and in so doing provoke a transformation in habitual patterns of action and of thought. The project “The End of Sitting” is intended to remediate the adverse health effects of standard chair-dominated offices through an unconventional office landscape that prompts intermittent postural readjustments, boosting the levels of activity common in such settings. The project “Bunker 599” demonstrates that seemingly unremarkable features of the landscape can sometimes conceal aspects of culture’s history, and that design can function to draw attention to a hidden and even vanishing history. Design can enrich an individual’s sense of place in a stream of cultural history.},

Ross Gibson’s concept of a ‘memoryscope’ helps us identify distinct but complementary ways of focussing the forces of the past. Emotions and imaginings are transmitted over time in many forms. The past is not easily washed, blasted or sliced away. By considering other settings and modes of encounter, we can recognise and applaud the novelty of RAAAF’s interventions while urging further attention to the variable dynamics and rhythms of remembering and of sociomaterial residues.},

  abstract     = {In this commentary on Rietveld’s inaugural lecture, we exemplify with one of our design cases for project Expedition RWS 2050, how Rietveld’s and our method are complementary. Within this project, RWS invited us to contribute our design skills and make relevant future scenarios experienceable. To scaffold imaginative discussions about everyday life in 2050 with a cross-section of the Dutch population, we wrote seven short speculative stories and designed a set of physical discussion tools. When looking at this design case and the cases Rietveld describes in his inaugural lecture, one can see that we both are guided by and contributing to the development of ecological and enactive philosophy, which rejects the dichotomy between sensorimotor and higher cognition. In his approach, Rietveld pushes the boundaries of the affordances of the material during the making process, whereas we predominantly investigate the affordances of the things and practices which we have designed. Despite these differences, we are both pursuing engagement with philosophical practice through non-discursive means while imagining new sociomaterial practices.},

In his lecture, Erik describes three affordance-related aspects of the making practices at Rietveld Architecture-Art-Affordances (RAAAF), a visual art and architecture studio Erik and his brother Ronald Rietveld founded in 2006. The special issue includes 22 reflections on Erik’s lecture written by commentators from a broad range of different fields including art history, architecture, ecological psychology, dynamical systems cognitive science, anthropology, archaeology and the philosophy of 4e cognition. Erik and I provide a response that reflects on what it means to make philosophical art installations. The special issue also includes an interview conducted with art-historian Anja Novak reflecting on the potential of ecological-enactive cognitive science to further our understanding of experiential engagement with art. Finally, Erik has written an opinion article in which he sets out the next steps in his research programme of developing a conceptual framework for understanding ‘change-ability’ – skills for coordinating with a rapidly changing world. The key insight behind the framework is that changing the affordances of the living environment can contribute to changing otherwise rigid and undesirable patterns of behaviour. Erik reflects on the role that artworks can play in inviting reflection on how the practices that organise and shape human life could be different, a task that is increasingly urgent in a time when removing obstacles to change is necessary.},

This concept considers apparently opposite phenomena (e.g. consistency-variability) as complementary and as contemplated in the same structure. The hierarchy in open systems is characterised by three main relativities: (a) whole and parts, (b) control and (c) variability. From a hierarchical standpoint, motor skills phenomena are structured under two levels: macro (responsible for the consistency and configuration of patterns) and micro (responsible for variability and, consequently, the flexibility of patterns). Study findings make it possible to understand how adaptations in the soccer, futsal, swimming, golf, coincident timing and graphic motor skills take place by altering the microstructure (parameterisation) or reorganising the macrostructure (self-organisation). The distinction between these two modes of adaptation allows us to consider the increase of complexity in the motor skills phenomena as a basic feature of living systems.},

  abstract     = {A challenge in using robots in human-inhabited environments is to design behavior that is engaging, yet robust to the perturbations induced by human interaction. Our idea is to imbue the robot with intrinsic motivation (IM) so that it can handle new situations and appears as a genuine social other to humans and thus be of more interest to a human interaction partner. Human-robot interaction (HRI) experiments mainly focus on scripted or teleoperated robots, that mimic characteristics such as IM to control isolated behavior factors. This article presents a “robotologist” study design that allows comparing autonomously generated behaviors with each other and, for the first time, evaluates the human perception of IM-based generated behavior in robots. We conducted a within-subjects user study ( N = 24) where participants interacted with a fully autonomous Sphero BB8 robot with different behavioral regimes: one realizing an adaptive, intrinsically motivated behavior and the other being reactive, but not adaptive. The robot and its behaviors are intentionally kept minimal to concentrate on the effect induced by IM. A quantitative analysis of post-interaction questionnaires showed a significantly higher perception of the dimension “Warmth” compared to the reactive baseline behavior. Warmth is considered a primary dimension for social attitude formation in human social cognition. A human perceived as warm (friendly, trustworthy) experiences more positive social interactions.},

This article offers an alternative framework for classification of behaviour based upon only the behavioural outcomes. The framework is specified from first principles of a state-space approach, allowing us to discuss intermediate outcomes that may have instrumental value. This approach could provide a firmer foundation to consider the hierarchical nature of goals and allows us to address both the ‘how’ and the ‘why’ questions within a single framework. This taxonomy is designed to complement rather than replace existing attempts; the classification of behaviour by outcome is orthogonal to questions of the mechanisms of decision making or of the implementation of actions. This article specifies nine basic classes of behaviour and provides precise definitions for each of these. We then develop a formal language for the description of observed activities, the representation of behavioural hierarchies and for the analysis of possibility sets for achieving future goals. We follow up with some critique and discussion of the problems such a framework poses.},

Fifty-six boys between 7 and 10 years were classified into groups as overweight ( n = 33) or normal-weight ( n = 23). They performed two trials of running and hopping over a 20-m straight line distance. Accelerometers were attached on the trunk and head for collecting body movements in different directions from 15 strides. Postural variability and coordination were calculated by multiscale entropy and cross approximate entropy for the running and hopping trials, separately. Findings highlight overweight boys had significantly higher trunk-head coordination in mediolateral direction than normal-weight boys (0.72 vs. 0.68). The hopping movement pattern had highest variability (9.88 vs. 8.77) and trunk–head coordination (0.61 vs. 0.67) than running. Excess body mass demands additional postural adaptations to compensate for reducing the risk of losing balance laterally in boys with overweight.},

  abstract     = {Living organisms act as integrated wholes to maintain themselves. Individual actions can each be explained by characterizing the mechanisms that perform the activity. But these alone do not explain how various activities are coordinated and performed versatilely. We argue that this depends on a specific type of mechanism, a control mechanism. We develop an account of control by examining several extensively studied control mechanisms operative in the bacterium E. coli . On our analysis, what distinguishes a control mechanism from other mechanisms is that it relies on measuring one or more variables, which results in setting constraints in the control mechanism that determine its action on flexible constraints in other mechanisms. In the most basic arrangement, the measurement process directly determines the action of the control mechanism, but in more complex arrangements signals mediate between measurements and effectors. This opens the possibility of multiple responses to the same measurement and responses based on multiple measurements. It also allows crosstalk, resulting in networks of control mechanisms. Such networks integrate the behaviors of the organism but also present a challenge in tailoring responses to particular measurements. We discuss how integrated activity can still result in differential, versatile, responses .},

  abstract     = {Human–swarm interaction is a frontier in the realms of swarm robotics and human-factors engineering. However, no holistic theory has been explicitly formulated that can inform how humans and robot swarms should interact through an interface while considering real-world demands, the relative capabilities of the components, as well as the desired joint-system behaviours. In this article, we apply a holistic perspective that we refer to as joint human–swarm loops, that is, a cybernetic system made of human, swarm and interface. We argue that a solution for human–swarm interaction should make the joint human–swarm loop an intelligent system that balances between centralized and decentralized control. The swarm-amplified human is suggested as a possible design that combines perspectives from swarm robotics, human-factors engineering and theoretical neuroscience to produce such a joint human–swarm loop. Essentially, it states that the robot swarm should be integrated into the human’s low-level nervous system function. This requires modelling both the robot swarm and the biological nervous system as self-organizing systems. We discuss multiple design implications that follow from the swarm-amplified human, including a computational experiment that shows how the robot swarm itself can be a self-organizing interface based on minimal computational logic.},

We argue that, although these approaches may look like diverging views within the wider enactivist program, when appraised in a conciliatory spirit, they can be interpreted as developing converging ideas. We examine how the notion of know-how figures in them to show an important point of convergence, namely, that the normativity of human cognitive capacities rests on shared know-how . Radical enactivism emphasizes the diachronic dimension of shared know-how, and linguistic bodies emphasize the synchronic one. Given that know-how is a normative notion, it is subject to success conditions. We then argue it implies basic content , which is the content of the successful ongoing interactions between agent(s) and environment. Basic content does not imply accuracy conditions and representational content, so it evades Hutto and Myin’s Hard Problem of Content. Moreover, this account is amenable to the central claim by Di Paolo et al. that the participatory sense-making relations at play in linguistic exchanges are explained in continuity with explanations of biological organization and sensorimotor engagements.},

  abstract     = {Dual-process theories divide cognition into two kinds of processes: Type 1 processes that are autonomous and do not use working memory, and Type 2 processes that are decoupled from the immediate situation and use working memory. Often, Type 1 processes are also fast, high capacity, parallel, nonconscious, biased, contextualized, and associative, while Type 2 processes are typically slow, low capacity, serial, conscious, normative, abstract, and rule-based. This article argues for an embodied dual-process theory based on the phenomenology of Martin Heidegger. According to Heidegger, the basis of human agents’ encounters with the world is in a prereflective, pragmatically engaged disposition marked by readiness-to-hand ( Zuhandenheit ), sometimes equated with “smooth coping.” Examples of smooth coping include walking, throwing a ball, and other embodied actions that do not require reflective thought. I argue that smooth coping primarily consists of Type 1 processes. The Heideggerian dual-process model yields distinctly different hypotheses from Hubert Dreyfus’ model of smooth coping, and I will critically engage with Dreyfus’ work.},

Through an extensive review of existing literature on GVF applications and representative affordance research in robotics, we demonstrate that GVFs provide the right framework for learning affordances in real-world applications.

  abstract     = {The adaptive morphology of a robot, such as shape adaptation, plays a significant role in adapting its behaviors. Shape adaptation should ideally be achieved without considerable cost, like the power required to deform the robot’s body, and therefore, it is reasonably considered as the last resort in classical rigid robots. However, the last decade has seen an increasing interest in soft robots: robots that can achieve deformability through their inherent material properties or structural compliance. Nevertheless, the dynamics of these types of robots is often complex and therefore it is difficult to substantiate whether the cost like the required power for changing its shape will be worthwhile to achieve the desired behavior. This article presents an approach in the development and analysis of a shape-changing locomoting robot, which relies on the ability of elastic beams to deform and vibrate. Through a proper use of elastic materials and the robot’s vibration-based dynamics, it will be shown both analytically and experimentally how shape adaptation can be designed such that it leads to desirable behaviors, with better power efficiency compared to when the robot solely relies on changing its control input. The results encourage emerging direction in robotics that investigates approaches to change robots’ behaviors through their adaptive morphology.},

With hundreds of thousands of articles published each year, the dense, tangled thicket of knowledge grows even more entwined. Although natural language processing and new methods of generating knowledge graphs can extract increasingly high-level interpretations from research articles, the results are inevitably biased toward recent, popular, and/or prestigious sources. This is a result of the inherent nature of human social-learning processes. To preserve and even rediscover lost scientific ideas, we employ the theory that scientific progress is punctuated by means of inspired, revolutionary ideas at the origin of new paradigms. Using a brief case example, we suggest how phylogenetic inference might be used to rediscover potentially useful lost discoveries, as a way in which machines could help drive revolutionary science.},

  abstract     = {Upon starting a collective endeavour, it is important to understand your partners’ preferences and how strongly they commit to a common goal. Establishing a prior commitment or agreement in terms of posterior benefits and consequences from those engaging in it provides an important mechanism for securing cooperation. Resorting to methods from Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT), here we analyse how prior commitments can also be adopted as a tool for enhancing coordination when its outcomes exhibit an asymmetric payoff structure, in both pairwise and multi-party interactions. Arguably, coordination is more complex to achieve than cooperation since there might be several desirable collective outcomes in a coordination problem (compared to mutual cooperation, the only desirable collective outcome in cooperation dilemmas). Our analysis, both analytically and via numerical simulations, shows that whether prior commitment would be a viable evolutionary mechanism for enhancing coordination and the overall population social welfare strongly depends on the collective benefit and severity of competition, and more importantly, how asymmetric benefits are resolved in a commitment deal. Moreover, in multi-party interactions, prior commitments prove to be crucial when a high level of group diversity is required for optimal coordination. The results are robust for different selection intensities. Overall, our analysis provides new insights into the complexity and beauty of behavioural evolution driven by humans’ capacity for commitment, as well as for the design of self-organised and distributed multi-agent systems for ensuring coordination among autonomous agents.},

The former being called the self-organized aggregation, and the latter being called the cue-based aggregation. One of the fascinating examples of cue-based aggregation is the thermotactic behavior of young honeybees. Young honeybees aggregate on optimal temperature zones in the hive using a simple set of behaviors. The state-of-the-art cue-based aggregation method BEECLUST was derived based on these behaviors. The BEECLUST method is a very simple, yet a very capable method that has favorable characteristics such as robustness to noise and simplicity to apply. However, the BEECLUST method does not perform well in low robot densities. In this article, inspired by the navigation techniques used by ants and bees, a self-adaptive landmark-based aggregation method is proposed. In this method, robots use landmarks in the environment to locate the cue once they “learn” the relative position of the cue with respect to the landmark. With the introduction of an error threshold parameter, the method also becomes adaptive to changes in the environment. Through systematic experiments in kinematic and realistic simulators with different parameters, robot densities, and cue sizes, it was observed that using the information of the environment makes the proposed method to show better performance than the BEECLUST in all the settings, including low robot density, high noise, and dynamic conditions.},

Here, we repeatedly exposed the slime mould to three stimuli with differing levels of potential risk: light, salt and lavender. We asked if the slime mould would change its foraging behaviour depending on the level of risk. In our experiment, taking risk yielded better food. We consistently selected individuals that made the same foraging decision (accepting risk or avoiding risk) over multiple trials. Hence, the same individuals were tested over a period of time, but only individuals that continued to make the same decision were allowed to continue. Regardless of selection regime, slime moulds in the light became more likely to select the food in the light over time, while those exposed to salt became more salt averse. Lavender had no effect. Our results can cautiously be interpreted as examples of non-associative learning, adding to a growing body of work showing that the absence of a central nervous system is no impediment to possessing sophisticated information processing.},

Perturbation-based balance training has emerged as an effective fall prevention intervention, which provides physical postural perturbations for postural control training and adaptation. With the advent of technology, virtual reality (VR) has also been used for fall prevention training by providing visual postural perturbations. This article addresses such VR studies, including a recent experiment which involved recreating the classical “moving room” paradigm into a “virtual moving room-wall paradigm” to assess the impact of VR-induced visual postural perturbations on postural stability and control. Evidence of both compensatory and anticipatory postural responses during unexpected and expected visual postural perturbations is presented. The future scope, required virtual environment set-up variations, limitations, and significance of a “virtual moving wall” paradigm in the learning and adaptation of postural control behavior are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we use mobile robots as physical entities to model the iterated learning of collections of forms that consist of randomly generated movement sequences. The robots implement an abstract model of embodied iterated social learning in which the forms evolve due to limited perceptual abilities of the robots during multiple learning cycles. It is shown that shared chunks that consisted of similar movement sequences emerge in the learned forms, and as these emergent shared sequences can be learned with high accuracy, they cause a cumulative increase in the learnability of the collections. Therefore, we are able to present robotic experiments in which embodied learning on robots leads to combinatorial structure as a result of cultural interactions in the form of iterated learning without a communicative task.},

Subsequently, it is applied to choose the optimal emergency alternative(s) for the prevention and control of COVID-19 on a college campus. The main innovations and contributions of this article are as follows: (a) Individual modified perceived utility (MPU) based on disappointment theory is integrated into the determination of attribute weights and construction of consensus reaching process (CRP). (b) The MPU-based individual contribution degree and the MPU-based soft group consensus degree are developed. (c) The new emergency CRP mechanism not only considers the rewards and penalties of expert weights but also regards the adaptive updating of attribute weights. Compared with the existing emergency MAGDM models in a hesitant fuzzy linguistic environment, the proposed consensus model has some advantages in improving consensus efficiency and simulating uncertain psychological behavior.},

  abstract     = {In this article, I aim to elucidate minimality in cooperation by drawing on a previously developed multi-dimensional approach to cooperation. This approach provides a useful framework to locate any cooperative phenomenon at a specific point on the continua of different dimensions. That point, in turn, determines the criteria for a particular cooperative phenomenon to emerge. Thus, on one hand, the analysis provides a contribution to the philosophical debate on minimal cooperation by elucidating different kinds of minimalism in cooperation that are characterized by the lowest point of the continua of either dimension, including (1) cognitive minimalism, (2) behavioural minimalism, (3) affective minimalism, (4) social minimalism and (5) contextual minimalism. On the other hand, it facilitates the dialogue among disciplines insofar as it helps determining whether the skills and capacities that are required for particular cooperative activities (e.g. cooperative games like the Joint Simon task or the prisoner’s dilemma) are not only present in typically developing individuals but also individuals with developmental disorders like autism. Drawing on an externalist/internalist distinction, the analysis shows that high-functioning individuals with autism perform particularly well in cooperative activities that amount to externalism and are highly defined by an institutional context, social rules and regularities as well as the roles of the agents.},

  abstract     = {The increase of violence in Mexico and consequent suffering during the last decades is evident, but its effects over feelings and moral judgments remain uncertain. We used journalistic news showing real-life situations to investigate the effects of facing violence over the experience of four moral emotions which represent powerful impulses for social actions in situations of suffering linked to violence: Negative Compassion, Positive Compassion, Schadenfreude, and Indignation. We evaluate brain activation by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during three cognitive conditions: reading, introspection, and resting. When reading the news, only Indignation-evoking stimuli elicited salient brain activations in the posterior cerebellum, and temporal and parietal cortical regions, whose functions are related to anger experiences and processing of socially relevant circumstances. When introspecting the emotional experience, cerebellar, frontal, parietal, and occipital activations related to self-focused experiences were observed for all emotions. When resting after facing the stimuli, only the Negative Compassion emotion elicited brain activations in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus related to emotional self-reference processing; thus, negative compassion may produce more perdurable cognitive-affective effects related to sadness while perceiving suffering in others. Our results may suggest different emotional-based social decisions to face suffering and violence and to motivate pro-social actions in the collectivistic Mexican culture.},

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {In recent decades, several theories have claimed to explain the teleological causality of organisms as a function of self-organising and self-producing processes. The most widely cited theories of this sort are variations of autopoiesis, originally introduced by Maturana and Varela. More recent modifications of autopoietic theory have focused on system organisation, closure of constraints and autonomy to account for organism teleology. This article argues that the treatment of teleology in autopoiesis and other organisation theories is inconclusive for three reasons: First, non-living self-organising processes like autocatalysis meet the defining features of autopoiesis without being teleological; second, organisational approaches, whether defined in terms of the closure of constraints, self-determination or autonomy, are unable to specify teleological normativity, that is, the individuation of an ultimate beneficiary; third, all self-organised systems produce local order by maximising the throughput of energy and/or material (obeying the maximum entropy production (MEP) principle) and thereby are specifically organised to undermine their own critical boundary conditions. Despite these inadequacies, an alternative approach called teleodynamics accounts for teleology. This theory shows how multiple self-organising processes can be collectively linked so that they counter each other’s MEP principle tendencies to become codependent. Teleodynamics embraces – not ignoring – the difficulties of self-organisation, but reinstates teleology as a radical phase transition distinguishing systems embodying an orientation towards their own beneficial ends from those that lack normative character.},

It introduces the free energy principle and active inference in terms of Bayesian theory and predictive coding, and then discusses how directed inquiry employing analogous models may bring us closer to representing the sense of self in cognitive neurorobots. The first section quickly locates cognitive neurorobotics in the broad field of computational cognitive modeling. The second section introduces principles according to which cognition may be formalized, and reviews cognitive neurorobotics experiments employing such formalizations. The third section interprets the results of these and other experiments in the context of different senses of self, both “minimal” and “narrative” self. The fourth section considers model validity and discusses what we may expect ongoing cognitive neurorobotics studies to contribute to scientific explanation of cognitive phenomena including the senses of minimal and narrative self.},

Searches were conducted with MeSH terms for clinical trials to determine the behavior of brain activity over time through evaluations performed before and after a period of intervention involving tDCS. The search was limited to articles published in English in the last ten years. It was found 257 articles during the initial search, where 14 of which were submitted to an appraisal of methodological quality, and 4 were considered to have adequate quality. Based on the results, there is inconsistency in the processes and procedures used for the acquisition of brain signals, even when limiting the search to clinical trials offering an analysis of evaluations performed before and after clinical interventions.

In this article, agent-based modelling has been applied to study the chances of dairy farmers increasing annual milk yield by learning better farming strategies from each other. Two sets of strategies were considered; in one set ( S ), each farmer agent would possess a number of farming strategies based on their knowledge, and in a second set ( S ′ ) , farmer agents would possess farming strategies that they have adopted from their peers. Regression models were used to determine litres of milk that could be produced whenever new strategies were applied. By using data from Ethiopia and Tanzania, 28 and 25 determinants for increase in milk yield were fitted for the two countries, respectively. There was a significant increase in average milk yield as the farmer agents interacted and updated their S ′ – from baseline data, average milk yield of 12.7 ± 4.89 and 13.62 ± 4.47 to simulated milk yield average of 17.57 ± 0.72 and 20.34 ± 1.16 for Tanzania and Ethiopia, respectively. The peer-to-peer learning approach details an inexpensive method manageable by the farmers themselves. Its implementation could range from physical farmer groups to online interactions.},

Seven participants with traumatic spinal injury were selected to undergo learning in an adapted boat equipped with wind-measuring instrument. A learning program, defined by two conditions, (1) blocked practice and (2) random practice, was applied. In blocked schedule, fixed sequence of two maneuvers consist of tacking on a close-hauled course (45°–55°) and gybing on a broad reaching course (135°–145°). In random schedule, the same maneuvers were carried out randomly. Eight 30-min practice sessions were carried out over a period of 2 weeks, in 3 days per week. Velocity Made Good was analyzed in the familiarization test, pre-test, post-test, and retention test. The learning program was effective in both random and blocked practice conditions on all participants. However, there is an evident variability in the results. This study demonstrates the suitability of applying contextual interference to facilitate the learning of adapted sailing. The variability of the results could be related to the heterogeneity of the participants and suggests the need for further research that can provide information about how restricted mobility affects the learning process.},

We study here the capabilities and limitations in controlling experimental robot swarms of a decentralized control algorithm that only requires information on the positions of neighboring agents, and not on their headings. Using swarms of e-Puck robots, we implement this algorithm in experiments and show its ability to converge to self-organized collective translation or rotation, starting from a state with random orientations. Through a simple analytical calculation, we also unveil an essential limitation of the algorithm that produces small persistent oscillations of the aligned state, related to its marginal stability. By comparing predictions and measurements, we compute the experimental noise distributions of the linear and angular robot speeds, showing that they are well described by Gaussian functions. We then implement simulations that model this noise by adding Gaussian random variables with the experimentally measured standard deviations. These simulations are performed for multiple parameter combinations and compared to experiments, showing that they provide good predictions for the expected speed and robustness of the self-organizing dynamics.},
