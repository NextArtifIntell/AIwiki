In this work, a systematic multi-layer optimization scheme is proposed in conjunction with particle swarm optimization algorithm to locate a global optimum that fits a cost function. The technique utilizes SP-lines to form three-dimensional patches surfaces from experimental data in multi-layer fashion and incorporates a multi-layer search using particle swarm optimization. The novel technique is illustrated and verified over two layers of experimental data to show its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Many eye-related diseases will lead to blindness or worse when it is lack of treatment in the early stages of the disease. Retinal vessel is important for doctors to detect eye diseases, even though the increase of some thin vessels may also mean the occurrence of certain diseases. Therefore, automatic retinal vessel segmentation is of great help to doctors in diagnosing diseases. In this paper, an automatic vessel segmentation method is proposed for retinal image, which is based on support vector machine combining multi-scale feature fusion model and B-COSFIRE filter response. Firstly, the inverted green channel image is enhanced by B-COSFIRE filter to strengthen bar-like vessel structures. Then the features are extracted by means of line operator in a multiresolution way, namely that each filtered image is down-sampled to cover a wider area, hence each sampled pixels can obtain not only the global but also local information. Then the final obtained features from three scales together along the depth direction are combined to train the SVM model. Finally, we use the classifier model to predict blood vessels. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the public available fundus images datasets (DRIVE: Precision = 0.8657, Se = 0.7088, Sp = 0.9660 and ACC = 0.9900; STARE: Precision = 0.8782, Se = 0.6189, Sp = 0.9908 and ACC = 0.9494). The experiment results show that our proposed algorithm has effects on retinal vessels segmentation.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the research of deep learning has received extensive attention, and many breakthroughs have been made in various fields. On this basis, a neural network with the attention mechanism has become a research hotspot. In this paper, we try to solve the image classification task by implementing channel and spatial attention mechanism which improve the expression ability of neural network model. Different from previous studies, we propose an attention module consisting of channel attention module (CAM) and spatial attention module (SAM). The proposed module derives attention graphs from channel dimension and spatial dimension respectively, then the input features are selectively learned according to the importance of the features. Besides, this module is lightweight and can be easily integrated into image classification algorithms. In the experiment, we combine the deep residual network model with the attention module and the experimental results show that the proposed method brings higher image classification accuracy. The channel attention module adds weight to the signals on different convolution channels to represent the correlation. For different channels, the higher the weight, the higher the correlation which required more attention. The main function of spatial attention is to capture the most informative part in the local feature graph, which is a supplement to channel attention. We evaluate our proposed module based on the ImageNet-1K and Cifar-100 respectively. Through a large number of comparative experiments, our proposed model achieved outstanding performance.},

  abstract     = {There is a significant public demand for rapid data-driven scientific investigations using aggregated sensitive information. However, many technical challenges and regulatory policies hinder efficient data sharing. In this study, we describe a partially synthetic data generation technique for creating anonymized data archives whose joint distributions closely resemble those of the original (sensitive) data. Specifically, we introduce the DataSifter technique for time-varying correlated data (DataSifter II), which relies on an iterative model-based imputation using generalized linear mixed model and random effects-expectation maximization tree. DataSifter II can be used to generate synthetic repeated measures data for testing and validating new analytical techniques. Compared to the multiple imputation method, DataSifter II application on simulated and real clinical data demonstrates that the new method provides extensive reduction of re-identification risk (data privacy) while preserving the analytical value (data utility) in the obfuscated data. The performance of the DataSifter II on a simulation involving 20% artificially missingness in the data, shows at least 80% reduction of the disclosure risk, compared to the multiple imputation method, without a substantial impact on the data analytical value. In a separate clinical data (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) validation, a model-based statistical inference drawn from the original data agrees with an analogous analytical inference obtained using the DataSifter II obfuscated ( sifted ) data. For large time-varying datasets containing sensitive information, the proposed technique provides an automated tool for alleviating the barriers of data sharing and facilitating effective, advanced, and collaborative analytics.},

The existing outlier detection methods are mainly divided into two directions: local outliers and global outliers. Aiming at the limitations of the existing outlier detection methods, we propose a novel outlier detection algorithm which is named as kNN-LOF. First, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm is applied to divide different areas for outlier attributes, which is more suitable for outlier detection in different density distributions. Secondly, a hierarchical adjacency order is proposed to hierarchize the neighborhood range according to the link distance. The average sequence distance is calculated from the data objects in the hierarchy, and the reachable distance of an object is redefined to introduce a new local outlier factor. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has good performance in improving the accuracy of outlier detection.},

The proposed solution procedure is second order accurate in space and employs a second-order accurate dual time-stepping scheme. The momentum conservation equations are written in terms of the Piola-Kirchhoff stresses. The stress tensor is related to the Lagrangian strain tensor through the St. Venant-Kirchhoff constitutive relationship. The structural solver presented is verified through two test cases. The first test case is a three-dimensional cantilever beam subject to a gravitational load that is verified using theory and two-dimensional simulations reported in literature. The second test case is a three-dimensional highly deformable cantilever plate subject to a gravitational load. The results of this case are verified through a comparison with the modal response calculated by commercially available software. The focus of the current effort is the development and verification of the structural dynamics portion of a future fully coupled monolithic fluid-thermal-structure interaction code package.},

Our methodology is a means for other algorithm engineers to improve their own algorithms for specific real-world problems that are hard to improve. In our case, the placement algorithms are difficult to improve, and to find better heuristics we analyze the results of placement solutions to find clustered information which can then be used to improve the algorithms. Specifically, we show a technique for gathering cluster information about placement, we create a new simulated annealing algorithm and a new genetic algorithm that can deal with a mixed granularity of placement objects on a virtual field-programmable gate array, and we show that these algorithms either execute faster or improve the overall quality of solution compared to their basic algorithm without this clustering data and improved heuristics. For our improved simulated annealing placer we improve the algorithms run-time by 17% across a range of benchmarks, and our genetic algorithm improves placement metrics—-critical path by 10% and channel-width by 4%.},
