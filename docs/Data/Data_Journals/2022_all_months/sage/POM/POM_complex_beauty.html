  abstract     = {A dramatically changing business landscape characterized by volatility and uncertainty (which in turn are driven by unpredictable alterations of conditions by such factors as geopolitical events, climate changes, disasters—natural and human causes, reduction in food, potable water, and critical materials supply along with environmental contamination), has created a situation whereby a rethink of Production and Operations Management (POM) strategies and practices is considered timely and appropriate. Against a backdrop of current POM strengths and weaknesses, and expected POM futures, a response path for POM adoption to deal with such uncertainties and risks is proposed and described in some detail. This involves the treatment of POM as a more interconnected and integrated system than has hitherto been the case. Such an interconnected approach is described as a POM symphony where all key players would be playing from the same script and the POM leader must serve as a coach‐coordinator, that is, the symphony&#39;s conductor.},

Here, we report an experiment examining how the numeracy of decision makers relates to the efficacy of forecast information provided in two alternative mechanisms to decision makers facing a loss event. The uncertainty mechanism states the probability of the loss event. The recommendation mechanism directly advises on which decision to take. We find that probabilities are better at inducing preventative action than are recommendations, even among those who score low on numeracy. Those who score high on numeracy use probabilities somewhat more effectively than do those who score low. But recommendations exhibit a greater trust problem that is most pronounced among those who score low on numeracy.},

Yet, entrepreneurship is important to the economy, and many schools are growing significantly their entrepreneurship programs and offerings but often without reference to or inclusion of operations courses. This paper is motivated by the question of the operations needs of new ventures and how they might differ from the needs of large, established firms. Toward that end, we review briefly the state of entrepreneurship scholarship in POM (and beyond), present our own (field‐based) research (and cases), and propose a framework for what we call “operations for entrepreneurs,” that we hope can be a basis for further productive research and curriculum development by the OM community.},

  abstract     = {As innovation is critical in driving growth and competitiveness, companies establish innovation (or new product) portfolio processes to select the “right” innovation projects that are allocated the necessary resources. These processes have attracted considerable interest from both academics and practice. However, the results of innovation portfolio management processes are widely perceived as unsatisfactory. This study provides a systematic overview of portfolio management approaches and research advances of the past decades, and it explores the root causes of innovation portfolio management challenges. We propose that the problem is a result of an overemphasis on project selection (from an assumed available list of reasonable candidates), which has led to a focus on analytical methods of portfolio evaluation that are applied generically (not customized to the specific strategy of the organization). As a result, the creation or assembly of initiatives that cover the strategic innovation goals of the organization, in other words, portfolio design as a creative process, has been neglected. The result has been sophistication but little alignment with the specific strategic aims of the organization. We propose that a focus on portfolio design, followed by portfolio evaluation and management (with iteration feedback) may at least mitigate the widely observed challenges. We illustrate with a case example how the process might work. This proposal asks for new empirical research.},

We surface the key underlying assumptions of different causal estimation methods and discuss how OM scholars have used these methods in the last few years. We hope that reflecting on the plausibility and substantive meaning of underlying assumptions regarding different identification strategies in a particular context will lead to a better conceptualization, execution, evaluation, dissemination, and consumption of OM research.

We posit that aligning cross‐platform effect across digital and physical infrastructure enhances system outcomes. Our arguments are informed by evidence on private–public partnerships for developing production and distribution infrastructure in the pharmaceutical industry. We identify enablers and inhibitors for cross‐platform effects within these data in terms of product and process technology readiness, path‐dependent standards creation, organizational alignment, regulatory fragmentation, and the desire towards such infrastructure yielding resilient outcomes.

However, our understanding of platform adoption in B2B is less developed than for B2C. In the few cases where B2B platforms have been explicitly examined, it is often assumed that they can be understood using principles developed from the study of B2C platforms. However, the two types of platforms have important differences that often require different managerial policies to be successful. B2B supply chains are much more complex because of multiple echelons, the sophistication of their purchasing and other organizations, the competition they face, and the value of their data. The result is that, among other things, the nature of their value exchange is likely different. To address this gap, we create a novel framework. The value creation lens is grounded in theory and creates a better understanding of the dynamics of platform creation and growth by separating the platform&#39;s value into three components: (1) the standalone value of the product, such as a smartphone&#39;s ability to take pictures, (2) the value of other participants on the platform, such as the number of friends on Instagram or merchants on eBay, and (3) the value created by complementary products from third‐party providers, such as apps for a smartphone. A dynamic perspective explores the trajectory of differences in value between B2B and B2C platforms along with managerial implications.},

Recent advances in information and communication technologies, such as the cloud, big data, Internet of things, and artificial intelligence and nanotechnology, have accelerated the adoption of Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0. Because of these advancements, organizations are now facing new challenges in the form of cybersecurity risks that are partly caused by these technologies. In recent years, there has been a spike in the number of cyberattacks, and organizations are taking steps to minimize the impacts of these attacks. To address this critical issue, in this article, we discuss possible future research directions that production and operations management (POM) researchers can undertake to help organizations, supply chains, and governments develop robust strategies for reducing the number of attacks and their repercussions. In particular, we identify several avenues for future research in the following domains of POM: (1) global operations strategy, (2) healthcare operations management, (3) public policy, (4) management of technology, (5) supply chain management, and (6) disruptive technologies.

We answer this question by providing a brief review of the evolution of technologies and operations management (OM) over time. Because terms such as “Industry 4.0” do not have a precise definition, we focus on more fundamental issues raised by Industry 4.0 emerging technologies for research in OM. We propose a theory of disruptive debottlenecking and the SACE framework by classifying emerging technologies in terms of the functionalities they enable: sense, analyze, collaborate, and execute. Subsequently, we review the nascent but rapidly growing literature at the interface between digital technologies and OM. Our review suggests that one way to assess the value of Industry 4.0 technologies can be via their influence on adding revenues, differentiating, reducing costs, optimizing risks, innovating, and transforming business models and processes. Finally, we conclude by proposing an agenda for further research.},

The main challenge is to achieve the optimal trade‐off between revenue benefits from shorter delivery time and the increase in inventory cost associated with placing inventory closer to market demand. To predict the effects of modified demand under service response time variations, we introduce a demand prediction and elasticity model to quantify the sensitivity in demand for particular product categories. Of course, shortening response time by positioning products close to market demand may increase inventory costs. Hence, the team developed a novel data‐driven two‐stage stochastic programming approach complementing the demand prediction and elasticity model, which optimally trades safety stock with service response time and hence revenue increase. We then illustrate the impact of our approach through data provided by an e‐commerce retailer in North America. Our approach offers supply chain managers a general‐purpose decision support tool that optimizes the inventory network to generate recommended stocking levels for stores, distribution centers, and warehouses on a daily basis.},

  abstract     = {The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in augmenting healthcare is expected to grow substantially in future decades. Current research in medical AI focuses on developing, validating, and implementing point‐level AI applications in an ad hoc manner. To harness the full power of AI to improve the patient experience and outcomes at a societal scale, however, requires a gestalt shift—with a systematic understanding of AI in the context of healthcare—and so results in its widespread adoption. This translates to four pillars of incorporating AI into healthcare workflow, including physician buy‐in, patient acceptance, provider investment, and payer support (the “4Ps”). To achieve these 4Ps, it is imperative to design AI‐augmented healthcare delivery systems in view of (1) how physicians integrate AI into their clinical practice and (2) how patients perceive the role of AI in healthcare delivery. This will in turn boost provider investment and payer support. In this paper, we draw from the literature to discuss a series of research questions, including barriers to physician buy‐in and patient acceptance, transparency and disclosure, service design, and strategies for increasing AI uptake. We shed light on the principles of purposeful design for AI‐augmented healthcare delivery systems and propose a research agenda for operations management scholars to consider as they continue to strengthen their engagement with both healthcare professionals and AI developers.},

  abstract     = {Distributing scarce resources such as COVID‐19 vaccines is often a highly time‐sensitive and mission‐critical operation. Our research was prompted by a significant obstacle that the United States and other nations encountered during the early months of the COVID‐19 vaccination campaign: Most COVID‐19 vaccines require two doses given 3 or 4 weeks apart. Given the severely limited supply and mounting pressure on many countries to reduce hospitalizations and mortality, how to effectively roll out two‐dose vaccines was a critical policy decision. In this paper, we first model and analyze inventory dynamics of the rollout process under three rollout strategies: (1) holding back second doses, (2) releasing second doses, and (3) stretching the lead time between doses. Then we develop an SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) model that incorporates COVID‐19 asymptomatic and symptomatic infections to evaluate these strategies in terms of infections, hospitalizations, and mortality. Among our findings, we show releasing second doses reduces infections but creates uneven vaccination patterns. In addition, to ensure second doses are given on time without holding back inventory, strictly less than half of the supply can be allocated to first‐dose appointments. Stretching the between‐dose lead time flattens the infection curve and reduces both hospitalizations and mortality compared with the strategy of releasing second doses. We also consider an alternative single‐dose vaccine with lower efficacy and show that the vaccine can be more effective than its two‐dose counterparts in reducing infections and mortality. We conduct extensive sensitivity analyses related to age composition, risk‐based prioritization, supply disruptions, and disease transmissibility. Our paper provides important implications for policymakers to develop effective vaccine rollout strategies in developed and developing countries alike. More broadly, our paper sheds light on how to develop effective operations strategies for distributing time‐sensitive resources in times of crisis.},

Drinking water may be essential, but it is not necessary to provide it in small plastic bottles. Injections may save lives, but inappropriately discarded syringes are hazardous. Can humanitarian relief be made more sustainable? This paper summarizes a 1‐day workshop on this topic, held at INSEAD in 2019 in connection with Luk Van Wassenhove&#39;s transition to emeritus professor. This workshop involved over 100 academics and practitioners. Five areas were discussed in detail: material convergence, coordination between humanitarian organizations (HOs), logistics, partnerships with industry, and health. The discussions demonstrate the possibility of better integrating sustainability with humanitarian operations despite the inherent tension between the immediate need to save lives and the longer term perspective associated with sustainability. This requires that various stakeholders, including HOs, donors, and watchdog organizations, think differently about the balance between short‐term and long‐term interventions, the metrics and incentives they apply, and the role of local versus global organizations. Leading practitioners and scholars in humanitarian operations are well aware of these challenges and opportunities in each domain separately; this paper aims to introduce these issues to a broader audience in a single more integrated overview, based on the themes that were discussed at the workshop.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, our field has seen an increase in research that explicitly emphasizes an objective of social impact in the most unprivileged parts of the world—the so‐called global base of the pyramid (BOP; referring to the 2.7 billion people living on less than $2.50 per day, the largest but most resource‐poor economic group globally). This trend seems to cut across the traditional application areas of operations management (OM) and operations research (OR), and it coincides with an increased emphasis on environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) values in industry, a greater prominence of the United Nations&#39; Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), and increases in social impact research in other academic fields. In this paper, we pull together representative examples from our field of what we consider as social impact research aimed at improving living conditions at the BOP. We first examine the scale and scope of work published in Production and Operations Management over the last 25 years, and then provide a broader summary of the spectrum of research within OM and OR that constitute this stream of literature. We adopt the stance that OM and OR should embrace the current societal emphasis on social responsibility and positive social impact—and strive to contribute to the most pressing problems for those living at the BOP. Although our field has produced a body of work addressing such problems, individual research projects of this type are usually not viewed as falling under the broad umbrella of social impact operations (SIO), but rather are classified as part of the closest application area. By providing an initial overview of this work, we wish to celebrate the contribution of our field to this area, highlight common themes, catalyze a dialogue across application areas among researchers with a common perspective, and identify opportunities for future research.},

We empirically examine this question using all 1542 environmental incidents committed by 418 public Chinese manufacturers listed on the Shanghai/Shenzhen Stock Exchange from 2004 to 2013. We use the Coarsened Exact Matching to match a sample firm with (exposed) environmental incidents with a control firm that exhibits the same characteristics in our sample. Our comparative analysis reveals that relative to control firms, firms with (exposed) environmental incidents have poor business performance (e.g., sales growth, market share, returns on sales, and returns on assets) over a 5‐year period after being exposed. Using our training samples (data from 2004 to 2012), we also develop a predictive model and a “risk” scoring system to characterize the likelihood of a Chinese manufacturer violating environmental regulations in 2013. Specifically, we use publicly available financial data to identify factors (e.g., firm age, total assets, percentage of government ownership, and past environmental incidents) to predict which firm is more likely to violate environmental regulations. Using our training samples (data from 2004 to 2012), we can expose over 71% of the violations in 2013 by inspecting only 21.5% of the firms with risk scores above the top 80 percentile. Given the long‐term penalty and the potential for the Chinese government to use our predictive model as a building block for developing a more effective inspection policy, the number of environmental incidents in China will decline.},

  abstract     = {Environmental and energy independence concerns lead to government subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs). Operational decisions for a government are (i) to incentivize EV ownership by a direct consumer subsidy, a station subsidy that reduces charging inconvenience, or by both subsidies; and (ii) to minimize subsidy expenditure or to maximize EV adoption level. We model the interactions between the government and the charging supplier as a Stackelberg game and study the optimal structure of subsidies by incorporating charging inconvenience. We prove that this inconvenience is decreasing convex in the number of stations. In the expenditure minimization case, the optimal policy depends on the government adoption target and the charging station construction cost. If the adoption target is below a threshold that depends on the construction cost, the government provides pure consumer subsidy or no subsidy; otherwise, a combination of consumer and station subsidies is optimal. As the construction cost increases, the charger builds fewer stations, regardless of the subsidy type. We establish that expenditure minimization and adoption maximization yield the same subsidy policy if the charging inconvenience is linear. In a real‐life case, we find numerically that a station subsidy alone is optimal if the construction cost is not low but the adoption target is low. Besides, a long driving range reduces the need for subsidies significantly if the construction cost is high, whereas a long charging time necessitates high expenditure allocated mostly to a station subsidy.},

Results show that the volume of news reports about safety in a manufacturer&#39;s products increases voluntary recalls by managers. Further, the negativity in these news reports strengthens the main effect of news volume, whereas news positivity does not moderate the main effect. Last, The media&#39;s rating of the manufacturer&#39;s products weakens the news volume effect, thus acting as a buffer. The supplementary analysis demonstrates that none of the main or moderation effects exists for involuntary recalls, confirming the theory that news affects managers’ voluntary behavior. Finally, the effects exist for high (and not low) severity voluntary recalls only. The findings unearth the news media&#39;s role in enhancing public safety by affecting managerial decisions about recalls.},

  abstract     = {Technological applications disrupt the way to assess risks in the auto‐insurance business. Contrasted with the common practice based on static demographics, usage‐based insurance predicts risks using driving data collected from Internet‐of‐things–enabled telematics. This study proposes a novel solution leveraging the synergy between big data and hierarchical modeling. We specifically consider two aspects of mobility, namely, trait and trajectory , monitored by global positioning system (GPS), on‐board diagnostics, and in‐vehicle cameras in real time. Traits here refer to drivers’ distinctive driving behaviors (styles), whereas trajectories consist of the vehicle motion sequences and the contextual factors on trips. We operationalize semantic features of the two to assess risks at both trip and driver levels. Using fine‐granular driving data and crash reports, we find that behavioral traits play a significant role in predicting crashes, given individual heterogeneity and temporal dynamics. In a series of empirical validations, the proposed solution outperforms the current practice and alternative predictive models considered by prior literature. We show that the mobility‐based models are superior to the demographic‐based ones. Moreover, our model achieves the comparable performance of neural networks, improving the recall of class‐weighted logistic regression, nested support vector machine, and cost‐sensitive random forests by 44.23%, 29.18%, and 24.59%, respectively. Last, our approach is robust, data independent, and computationally efficient for skewed and small samples. This study provides several managerial implications and a blueprint for the auto‐insurance industry to operationalize IoT‐enabled risk assessments in the era of 5G communication.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies two fundamental questions regarding probabilistic selling in vertically differentiated markets: When is it profitable and how does one design it optimally? For the first question, we identify an important but overlooked economic mechanism driving probabilistic selling in vertically differentiated markets: the convexity of consumer preferences. In stark contrast to the literature finding that probabilistic selling is never profitable except in the presence of certain capacity constraint or consumer bounded rationality, we find that with many alternative utility functions capable of representing convex preference, probabilistic selling is always profitable. For the second question, we study the optimal strategy of probabilistic selling, including the design and price of the probabilistic good and the prices of the component goods. We show that under some technical conditions, the optimal price of the high‐quality component good increases while the optimal price of the low‐quality component good decreases upon the introduction of probabilistic selling, thereby increasing the market coverage and the economic efficiency without launching an actual new product line. To further illustrate the design of probabilistic selling, we use an example based on the canonical utility function, which is widely used in the economics literature on vertical product differentiation. We derive a closed‐form solution to the problem of optimal probabilistic selling. We also take advantage of the analytical tractability of the canonical utility to further explore the design of multiple probabilistic goods.},

  abstract     = {A challenge for online retail firms is managing stockouts of products when substitutes are available. We develop a game‐theoretic model to analyze the competition between multiple‐product online firms and characterize the scenarios when they can use prices as stockout recovery mechanisms. Depending on the consumer costs of searching for unfamiliar substitute products on their sites and the consumer mismatch costs of shopping at backup compared to favorite firms, in our primary analysis, we demonstrate that the equilibrium of a pricing game can be one of three possible types: Following stockouts the firms retain their customers, the firms release their customers, or all consumers turn to one of the firms. We also examine a firm&#39;s combined use of prices and product recommender systems to manage stockouts. Results in the primary section of the analysis and a first extension combine to demonstrate a firm&#39;s strategic marketing complementarity of its prices and quality of its product recommender system. That is, when a firm uses a better product recommender system to retain consumers following stockouts, we show that it also raises prices. In our primary section, we also show that by implementing a better product recommender system, surprisingly a firm&#39;s sales may fall. However, implementing higher quality recommender systems may not be jointly optimal for the firms. In the first extension&#39;s game, depending on the cost of better product recommender systems, the firms, when choosing recommender systems, may engage in a prisoner&#39;s dilemma, where the price increase associated cannot fully compensate the implementation cost. In a second extension, we show that positively (negatively) correlated stockouts of a product between the competitors reduces (raises) each firm&#39;s profit and prices because the positive (negative) correlation reduces (raises) each consumer&#39;s expected utility of shopping experience.},

The objective is to provide minimum waste solutions that are robust against such raw material imperfections as those possibly occurring with float glass production technology. The stochastic realization of defects is modeled as a spatial Poisson point process. A mixed integer program in the classical vein of robust optimization is presented and tested on data taken from a real plant application. Defective final products must in any case be discarded as waste but, if a recourse strategy is adopted, faults in glass sheets can sometimes be recovered. Closed forms for the computation of faulty item probabilities are provided in simple cases, and obtained via Monte Carlo simulation in more complex ones. The computational results demonstrate the benefits of the robust approach in terms of the reduction of back‐orders and overproduction, thereby showing that recourse strategies can enable nonnegligible improvements. Encouraged by this result, the management is presently evaluating the possibility of adopting the proposed model in plant operation.},

  abstract     = {A consumer‐side innovation in online retailing is membership‐based free shipping (MFS) in which a retailer bears the shipping cost for purchases made by members that have paid an upfront membership fee. On the supplier side, the agency model of selling, where a retailer allows a third‐party manufacturer to sell his product on the site for a commission, has been gradually replacing the wholesale model, where the retailer buys from the manufacturer at a wholesale price and resells to consumers at a retail price. We show that the shift to the agency model enhances the value of the MFS program to the retailer in the sense the retailer gains more from the MFS program and MFS is profitable to the retailer in a larger region of the parameter space under the agency model than the wholesale model. The retailer&#39;s gain from MFS comes at the expense of consumers and the society under the wholesale model, but the consumers and the society can also benefit from MFS under the agency model. The key driver of these results is that, under the wholesale model, the MFS program increases the severity of the double‐marginalization problem because the MFS program increases the retailer&#39;s marginal cost; however, under the agency model, the MFS program reduces the impact of marginalization at the manufacturer end because the manufacturer faces consumers with lower purchasing cost on average. Thus, the MFS program hurts channel coordination in the wholesale model but helps it under the agency model.},

  abstract     = {Consumers are becoming more knowledgeable about companies&#39; social responsibility (SR) practices. As a result, they are increasingly skeptical when companies do not provide clear information about these practices. One way to overcome this skepticism is to strengthen consumer trust through improved supply chain transparency. To create transparency requires a company to both gain visibility into its supply chain and disclose information to consumers. However, the current SR literature has only focused on the effect of disclosure on consumer trust, while the effect of visibility on trust in SR communications is not well understood. Our work addresses this gap. In this paper, we employ an incentivized human‐subject laboratory experiment, an online vignette study, and causal mediation analysis to investigate the impact of visibility on consumer trust in a company&#39;s SR communication, and as a result, its impact on consumers&#39; purchase decisions. To further enhance our understanding of consumer behavior, we examine how consumer heterogeneity and workers&#39; conditions in the upstream supply chain influence our results. We find that increasing visibility always strengthens consumer trust. Also, opportunities exist for a trust‐driven revenue benefit (due to greater visibility) when consumers are highly prosocial or have low general trust beliefs, or when the impact of an SR initiative is small. Our results underscore the crucial role that supply chain visibility plays in engendering consumer trust. Moreover, identifying trust as a mechanism to help explain the effect of visibility on sales of SR products offers actionable insights to improve a company&#39;s communication strategies.},

  abstract     = {To protect soil quality for sustainable development and raise farmers&#39; incomes, agricultural firms are increasingly developing green and efficient raw materials (GRMs) that can improve crop yields and reduce soil damage compared to TRMs. However, farmers have heterogeneity in both the trust in agricultural information and sustainable development attitudes, leading to underestimation of the value of GRMs. This paper explores the optimal subsidy policy of the government to promote GRMs considering the effect of farmer heterogeneity using a government‐firm‐farmer Stackelberg game. Our analysis reveals that the government should subsidize both farmers and the GRM firm when the GRMs&#39; effectiveness is not high enough; otherwise, it is more effective to subsidize farmers but not the GRM firm. Such a government subsidy policy can bring a win–win–win outcome for farmers, the GRM firm, and social welfare under certain conditions. Although higher farmers&#39; trust in agricultural information or sustainable development attitudes can increase their subjective willingness to adopt GRMs, counterintuitively, the total farmer surplus will decrease because in this situation: (1) the government will reduce the subsidy to farmers or (2) the GRM firm will increase the GRM price. In addition, compared with considering two‐dimensional heterogeneity of farmers, considering only one‐dimensional heterogeneity or no heterogeneity of farmers will cause the government subsidy to deviate from the goal of promoting GRMs, resulting in a 59.3% reduction in GRM market demand, a 17.3% decrease in the profit of GRM firm, and possibly even making the GRM firm “die out.”},

  abstract     = {Omni‐channel services, such as buy‐online‐pick‐up‐from‐store, transfer the in‐store logistics once completed by shoppers to retailers. To cost‐effectively meet the high demands for such pickup services, we introduce a crowdsourced order‐fulfillment policy that deploys in‐store customers to pick items for online orders while completing their own personal shopping. As opposed to existing store fulfillment policies, this new concept utilizes in‐store customers to help, not constrain, dedicated pickers. Empirical data indicate that a high percentage of surveyed in‐store shoppers would be willing to occasionally participate in such a program. In‐store customers willing to participate were observed to be heterogeneous in their efforts, with variability in how much extra time they would be willing to provide and would prefer picking tasks that had only a small deviation from their personal shopping. Motivated by these empirical results, the decision problem of how to assign picking tasks for arriving online orders with a given service commitment, to a set of arriving in‐store customers or an abundant set of dedicated pickers, was formalized to capture the uncertainty and heterogeneity of using in‐store customers for in‐store picking tasks. We propose a tractable decision‐making methodology to determine whether an order will meet both service commitment feasibility and in‐store customer availability with a probability at least equal to a target threshold. This method captures dynamic order placements and in‐store customer arrivals and stochasticity in in‐store customers&#39; shopping baskets. Extensive computational experiments for varying operational conditions of a grocery store dynamically matching actual online orders to arriving in‐store customers helps answer open questions from practitioners. Compensating in‐store customers based on their additional efforts reduced costs of fulfillment by greater than 30%, on average, compared to a baseline that uses only dedicated pickers for store fulfillment. Using the past five shopping baskets of participating in‐store customers to estimate assignment decisions can achieve both high online order service commitments and in‐store customer availability requirements. Our results suggest that in‐store customers should be assigned smaller orders than dedicated pickers.},

  abstract     = {To combat the nationwide opioid epidemic, many states have implemented policies that require prescribers to check a patient&#39;s prescription history with Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) prior to initiating or refilling opioid prescriptions. Using a difference‐in‐differences approach, we show that after states mandated PDMP use, opioid prescriptions decreased by 6.1% as intended. However, PDMP mandates had the unintended effect of driving existing opioid users towards more lethal illicit substitutes such as heroin. We found that reductions in prescription rates were accompanied by unprecedented rises in heroin overdose deaths: there were 6.37 more heroin‐related deaths per million population per year—a 50.1% increase—following PDMP mandates. Although stronger PDMP mandates (e.g., based on comprehensiveness, legal enforcement, integration with other health records, and interstate information sharing) reduced opioid prescriptions, we also find that stronger mandates inadvertently increased heroin overdose deaths. Additional analyses show that the substitution effect was not statistically significant among states with lower preexisting levels of pain reliever dependence, lower heroin availability, and greater access to substance abuse treatment. These findings point to an important policy implication: supply‐side restrictions such as mandated PDMP need to account for possible demand‐side substitution effects.},

  abstract     = {Home care provides personalized medical care and social support to patients within their own homes. Our work proposes a dynamic scheduling framework to assist in the assignment of health practitioners (HPs) to patients who arrive stochastically over time and are heterogeneous with respect to their health requirements, service duration, and region of residence. We model the decision of which patients to assign to HPs as a discrete‐time, rolling‐horizon, infinite‐stage Markov decision process. Due to the curse of dimensionality and the combinatorial structure associated with an HP&#39;s travel, we propose an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach based on a one‐step policy improvement heuristic. Four policies are investigated: The first two prioritize HP fairness by balancing service and travel times, respectively, while the other two are based on fluid approximations of the system. We show that the first fluid model is optimal if the number of patient arrivals is sufficiently large while the second performs better experimentally; both approaches leverage pricing and decomposition strategies. We compare our framework to more commonly implemented policies—constrained versions of the classical vehicle routing problem—in a simulation study using data collected from a Canadian home care provider. We show that, in contrast to these approaches, by accounting for future uncertainty, substantial cost savings can be obtained while a fewer number of referrals are rejected. We also find that well‐performing policies assign patients to HPs operating within a small set of adjacent regions while considering the number of periods that a patient requires care for. Otherwise, HP workload may not be appropriately balanced over the long‐term even if travel time is minimized.},

  abstract     = {Prostate cancer (PCa) is common in American men with long latent periods, during which the disease is asymptomatic. Active surveillance is a monitoring strategy commonly used for patients diagnosed with low‐risk PCa who may harbor latent high‐risk PCa. The optimal monitoring strategy attempts to minimize the disutility of testing while ensuring that the patient is detected at the earliest time when the disease progresses. Unfortunately, guidelines for the active surveillance of PCa are often one‐size‐fits‐all strategies that ignore the heterogeneity among multiple patient types. In contrast, personalized strategies based on partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) models are challenging to implement in practice given the large number of possible strategies that can be used. This article presents a two‐stage stochastic programming approach that selects a set of strategies for predefined cardinality based on patients&#39; disease risks. The first‐stage decision variables include binary variables for the selection of periods at which to test patients in each strategy and the assignment of multiple patient types to strategies. The objective is to maximize a weighted reward function that considers the need for cancer detection, missed detection, and cost of monitoring patients. We discuss the structure and complexity of the model and reformulate a logic‐based Bender&#39;s decomposition formulation that can solve realistic instances to optimality. We present a case study for the active surveillance of PCa and show that our model results in strategies that vary in intensity according to patient disease risk. Finally, we show that our model can generate a small number of strategies that can significantly improve the existing “one‐size‐fits‐all” guideline strategies used in practice.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of advance scheduling of ward admission requests in a public hospital, which affects the usage of critical resources such as operating theaters and hospital beds. Given the stochastic arrivals of patients and uncertain usage of resources, it is often infeasible for the planner to devise a risk‐free schedule to meet these requests without violating resource capacity constraints and creating adverse effects that include healthcare overtime, long patient waiting times, and bed shortages. The difficulty of quantifying these costs and the need to safeguard against resource overutilization lead us to propose a resource satisficing framework that renders the violation of resource constraints less likely and also diminishes its impact whenever it occurs. The risk of resource overutilization is captured by our resource satisficing index (RSI), which is calibrated to reflect a risk‐adjusted utilization rate for a better interpretation to the healthcare planner. Unlike the expected utilization rate, RSI is risk‐sensitive and serves to mitigate the risks of overutilization better whenever overutilization can be avoided in expectation. Our satisficing approach aims to balance out the overutilization risks by minimizing the maximal RSI among all resources and periods. Under our proposed partial adaptive scheduling policy , the resource satisficing model can be formulated and solved via a converging sequence of mixed‐integer linear optimization problems. A computational study establishes that our approach reduces resource overutilization risks to a greater extent than the benchmark methods.},

  abstract     = {Many field office leaders contend that authoritarian leadership improves the performance of humanitarian operations. The common narrative is that authoritarian leadership helps aid workers more quickly adapt to changes and thus deliver better job performance (e.g., by improving operations in their field office). However, given that field reports often highlight extant leadership as the source of serious operational failures, could leaders with an authoritarian style be part of the problem? We draw on psychological theorizing on the nature of human motivation to address this question. Specifically, we note that many aid workers primarily join humanitarian operations with the prosocial motive to help beneficiaries. While proactive adaptability is inherent to prosocial motivation, we hypothesize that authoritarian leadership may curtail the relationship by impeding aid workers’ autonomy. We find support for our theorizing in a sample of 299 humanitarian aid workers from the field. Additionally, we conducted 31 expert interviews to contextualize and validate our empirical findings. The paper concludes by discussing the findings’ theoretical and managerial implications for humanitarian operations.},

The availability of the rental equipment depends on the fleet size of the firm and has a direct impact on its profitability. In our setting, we allow for partial backordering, reneging, and finite commitment capacity. Moreover, we explicitly consider the breakdown possibility of the available equipment fleet. We develop an efficient recursive algorithm to solve the underlying two‐dimensional stochastic single‐player model. Our algorithm determines the global optimal fleet size of the firm for the same reneging and equipment return rates. Our extensive managerial insights quantify the behavior of various performance measures in the single‐player model with regard to repair performance of the firm, customer impatience level, traffic intensity, and equipment rental revenue. We demonstrate that by applying our model to a real case, there is a potential of more than a 4% (400,000 USD) increase in total daily profits. Extending our model to a two‐player game, we propose an approximation heuristic to derive closed‐form solutions to estimate equilibrium fleet sizes under complete information. Using our heuristic as the initial solution, we develop a simulation model to determine the exact equilibrium fleet sizes and draw a detailed comparison between the two‐player and single‐player models.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge sharing has become an important practice in the era of knowledge economy. This paper concerns the management of contributor performance in social knowledge‐sharing communities. Based on ability‐motivation‐opportunity theory, we propose a hidden Markov model to characterize the change in a knowledge contributor&#39;s latent state, which then determines the performance of knowledge sharing in terms of quantity and quality. The proposed model is calibrated using data from a social question‐and‐answer community. Three latent states are identified: unmotivated , exploratory , and sophisticated . Several factors influence the state‐transition process. Specifically, the increase in followers encourages contributors in the unmotivated state to transition to the motivated states and, therefore, contribute knowledge. When the contributors are in the exploratory state, observing the behavior of their followees increases the probability of their transitioning to the sophisticated state, in which they will make high‐quality contributions. These results suggest that followers influence mainly the quantity of contributions, while followees help mainly to increase the quality of contributions. This study contributes to the literature by revealing the dynamics of contributor performance in the context of knowledge sharing and by showing the roles of different social factors in influencing contributor performance. The modeling framework and findings of this study can help managers to identify the latent contribution states and then intervene in the performance of knowledge contributors in a variety of settings.},

  abstract     = {Platelets are perishable (5–7 day shelf life) blood products required for a variety of clinical treatments. In North America, hospitals typically procure platelet units from a central supplier. As such, the remaining shelf life of the delivered units could be subject to high uncertainty. Our work focuses on developing new models that leverage the increasingly available data from hospital information systems to prescribe ordering decisions in the presence of this uncertainty. Specifically, we consider a periodic review, perishable inventory system with zero lead time and uncertainty in demand and remaining shelf life of orders, operating under an oldest‐unit, first‐out allocation policy. We consider a family of base stock policies and adopt an empirical risk minimization approach to estimate the required inventory at the beginning of each period. The required inventory level for each period is assumed to be a linear function of a set of observed features in that period and the coefficients of the linear model are obtained by minimizing an approximate measure of the in‐sample empirical cost, comprised of a weighted sum of shortage and expiry costs. Our fixed initial age model assumes a constant remaining shelf life for all units. Our robust model assumes that an adversary selects the remaining shelf life of units subject to an uncertainty budget determined through an endogenous uncertainty set. We investigate the out‐of‐sample performance of the proposed models in a case study using data from two Canadian hospitals and in comparison to the hospitals&#39; historical performances as well as other benchmarks. Both models achieve significant improvements over the historical decisions. For instance, the fixed initial age model achieves a 53% and 93% reduction in the expiry rate and an 82% and 99% reduction in the shortage rate for the two hospitals, respectively. Further, it either outperforms or performs as well as the other benchmarks. The robust model achieves better out‐of‐sample generalizability and demonstrates a more “robust” performance under counterfactual remaining age distributions.},

The corporate online community also offers companies a novel source to understand employee&#39;s behaviors such as voluntary turnover, an important part of workforce management. Little is known, however, about whether and to what extent an employee&#39;s voluntary turnover is related to their knowledge‐sharing activities in the corporate online community. In this study, we address this critical issue by jointly considering in‐degree ties (i.e., knowledge acquisition) and out‐degree ties (i.e., knowledge contribution), which we combine into two novel knowledge‐sharing indicators: (i) the existence of bidirectional (vs. unidirectional) knowledge‐sharing ties and (ii) the equivalence of knowledge‐sharing ties (i.e., the balance between in‐degree centrality and out‐degree centrality). We theorize the relationships between these two indicators and the likelihood of voluntary employee turnover, and we test our hypotheses by collaborating with a large company to collect official voluntary turnover records and a unique dataset of detailed knowledge‐sharing behaviors in its corporate online community. A survival model and a series of robustness checks consistently indicate that voluntary turnover is less likely among employees who establish bidirectional knowledge‐sharing ties (rather than unidirectional ties) and that voluntary turnover is less likely among those with a higher equivalence of knowledge‐sharing ties. In light of the critical role of workforce management and the extensive use of online communities, our study offers important managerial implications and can help companies better understand or predict employees’ voluntary turnover from their online knowledge‐sharing activities.},

However, how different types of manufacturing experience relate to the characteristics of an organization&#39;s process innovation output is an open question. In this study, we investigate how a firm&#39;s accumulated related and unrelated manufacturing experiences are associated with this firm&#39;s ability to innovate its production methods. To characterize firms&#39; process innovation output, we observe their portfolios of patented manufacturing inventions, which we qualitatively evaluate over time, through a unique collaboration with expert patent attorneys, along two critical dimensions: novelty and scope. We argue that related manufacturing experience leads to a better understanding of parts of the focal product&#39;s technological landscape that will allow the development of inventions of broader scope. However, it may also contribute to inertia in that it might restrict the firm&#39;s innovative activity to more familiar regions of the landscape, thereby limiting inventions&#39; novelty. Conversely, manufacturing experience with products that are unrelated to the focal product is expected to stimulate and support a broader search that includes more distant regions of the focal product&#39;s technological landscape, which would lead to more novel manufacturing inventions. Yet, the application of this unrelated experience to the production of the focal product is likely to require additional exploratory effort in a not‐well‐understood region of the focal product&#39;s landscape, likely resulting in inventions of limited scope. In line with our hypotheses, we find that related (unrelated) manufacturing experience is positively (negatively) associated with inventions&#39; scope, and negatively (positively) associated with inventions&#39; novelty. In addition to supporting the relevance of a multidimensional evaluation of innovations, our findings provide practical guidance regarding the strategic implications of a firm&#39;s knowledge management.},

Our findings show that a mental health professional&#39;s previous prosocial behavior has a positive impact on economic performance and that this effect may manifest through the relationship capital pathway.

In the base scenario, the selling prices are exogenously given, and the firms decide on the product quality across two periods to optimize their respective profits. We study the equilibrium decisions in the static setting (in which the product quality remains the same across the two periods) and in the dynamic setting (in which the product quality can be improved in the second period), respectively. In the extended scenario, the selling prices can be endogenously determined as well.

  abstract     = {In today&#39;s competitive market environment, it is vital for companies to gain insight about competitors&#39; new product launches. Past studies have demonstrated the predictive value of prerelease online search traffic (PROST) for new product forecasting. Relying on these findings and the public availability of PROST, we investigate its usefulness for estimating sales of competing products. We propose a model for predicting the success of competitors&#39; product launches, based on own past product sales data and competitor&#39;s prerelease Google Trends. We find that PROST increases predictive accuracy by more than 18% compared to models that only use internally available sales data and product characteristics of video game sales. We conclude that this inexpensive source of competitive intelligence can be helpful when managing the marketing mix and planning new product releases.},

  abstract     = {This paper analyzes the contracting of maintenance services provided by an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to an operator for a device. The service provider can exert different levels of maintenance effort during the course of the contract and the device&#39;s reliability (uptime) is influenced by these levels. However, the service provider&#39;s effort level is noncontractible. Our research seeks to find the optimal structures, as well as parameters, of performance‐based maintenance contracts. We single out a unique uptime‐guarantee contract structure that contains profit‐maximizing contracts in many situations. Complete servitization is the essence of such optimal contract structures. With this contract structure, the service provider simply guarantees 100% uptime and compensates the operator&#39;s for any occurred downtime at a higher unit rate than it charges for maintenance services. Our findings show that some of the well‐known performance‐based contract structures used in practice (e.g., pay‐for‐performance contracts) can be suboptimal for the OEMs. We incorporate the customer&#39;s ability to affect the uptime and show that the optimal contract structures can also coordinate the customer&#39;s effort. We demonstrate the advantages and limitations of offering menus of contracts to increase the service provider&#39;s expected profits. Finally, through simulations using a sample data set, we find that a contract designed using the key ideas in our paper shows very promising results for practitioners.},

  abstract     = {Service‐level requirements play a crucial role in eliminating stock‐outs in a production pipeline. However, delivering a specific service level can become an unattainable goal given the various uncertainties influencing both the production pipeline and customer demand and causing the manufacturer to adapt the initial strategy in response to disruptions. Such deviations from optimality frequently result in unexpected (and potentially very high) costs and are complex to manage. On the one hand, the manufacturer can use a robust or distributionally robust approach to prepare for the worst‐case disruption, ensuring that the realized cost will be lower than the estimated cost with high probability. On the other hand, this solution may lead to overly conservative production schedules. In this article, we take a different approach and develop a bilevel stochastic optimization model with chance constraints, which allows us to make the production more predictable in the event of disruptions by driving costs and optimal schedules closer to the benchmark for each scenario considered. We introduce doubly probabilistic service‐level requirements to account for two interdependent layers of uncertainty, that is, production disruptions and distributional uncertainties in customer demand. This allows us to make high‐quality production decisions with only a limited understanding of the demand pattern. Approximating the problem for a numerical solution, we guarantee tight optimality gaps for high service levels and propose an efficient solution scheme, combining robust scenario reduction with a customized Benders decomposition procedure. In the managerial section, we use the Omega× Swatch MoonSwatches example to demonstrate that a desirable doubly probabilistic service level can be attained for disruptions with a drop in demand. In the case of disruptions followed by a peak in demand, one can tighten the optimality gaps if the service level is reduced.},

  abstract     = {The extensive adoption of business analytics (BA) has brought financial gains and increased efficiencies. However, these advances have simultaneously drawn attention to rising legal and ethical challenges when BA inform decisions with fairness implications. As a response to these concerns, the emerging study of algorithmic fairness deals with algorithmic outputs that may result in disparate outcomes or other forms of injustices for subgroups of the population, especially those who have been historically marginalized. Fairness is relevant on the basis of legal compliance, social responsibility, and utility; if not adequately and systematically addressed, unfair BA systems may lead to societal harms and may also threaten an organization&#39;s own survival, its competitiveness, and overall performance. This paper offers a forward‐looking, BA‐focused review of algorithmic fairness. We first review the state‐of‐the‐art research on sources and measures of bias, as well as bias mitigation algorithms. We then provide a detailed discussion of the utility–fairness relationship, emphasizing that the frequent assumption of a trade‐off between these two constructs is often mistaken or short‐sighted. Finally, we chart a path forward by identifying opportunities for business scholars to address impactful, open challenges that are key to the effective and responsible deployment of BA.},

However, little is known about how these financial innovations affect an underlying firm&#39;s operations. In this empirical study, we find that an underlying firm&#39;s operational efficiency is significantly improved with the inception of CDS trading. Our results are robust to multiple causal identification strategies. Further analysis suggests that the inception of CDS tends to enhance the operational efficiency of a firm through the supply chain financing capability and trade credit. We also postulate that CDS leads to enhanced efficiency through institutional monitoring and improvements in management effectiveness. We then obtain suggestive evidence. Our findings have direct implications concerning the ongoing policy debate surrounding CDS. We contribute to operations management research by exploring how innovations in the financial market would, in turn, affect the operational performance of firms.},

  abstract     = {What are supply chain management challenges in a lower‐income economy, and how do managers at smaller firms address them? This field study presents these challenges from the perspective of the 60 managers who run firms selling irrigation equipment in Senegal. By canvasing 35 cities, we gain unique visibility into how private supply chains, on which public officials and smallholder farmers in Africa rely, effectively deliver agricultural goods. The primary challenges for managers in this supply chain are day‐to‐day risks that are quality and contractual in nature and have financial implications. City size in combination with supplier type, firm size, and manager network determine risk exposure. Firms’ efforts to manage the chain are more reactive than proactive and more informal than formal, which reveals an opportunity for public agencies to support supplier and customer coordination. Public decision makers should tailor support to account for the differential risks that city size brings to supply chain management. This support should include not just financing the firms directly but should also entail giving loans to customers, certifying suppliers, and sharing inventory risk with public and nonprofit partners.},

  abstract     = {We consider a dynamic pricing and learning problem where a seller prices multiple products and learns from sales data about unknown demand. We study the parametric demand model in a Bayesian setting. To avoid the classical problem of incomplete learning, we propose dithering policies under which prices are probabilistically selected in a neighborhood surrounding the myopic optimal price. By analyzing the effect of dithering in facilitating learning, we establish regret upper bounds for three typical settings of demand model. We show that the dithering policy achieves an upper bound of order log T $\log T$ when the parameter set is finite. It can be modified to achieve a constant regret bound under an additional assumption. We also prove an upper bound of order T log T $\sqrt {T\log T}$ when the parameter set is compact and convex. Each bound matches (up to a logarithmic factor) the existing lower bound of any pricing policy. In this way, we show that dithering policies achieve asymptotically optimal performance in three different parameter settings, which demonstrates dithering as a unified approach to strike the balance between exploration and exploitation.},

Sales data from Alibaba, a major global online retailer, illustrate the prevalence of low‐sale products. For these products, existing single‐product dynamic pricing algorithms do not work well due to insufficient data samples. To address this challenge, we propose pricing policies that concurrently perform clustering over product demand and set individual pricing decisions on the fly. By clustering data and identifying products that have similar demand patterns, we utilize sales data from products within the same cluster to improve demand estimation for better pricing decisions. We evaluate the algorithms using regret, and the result shows that when product demand functions come from multiple clusters, our algorithms significantly outperform traditional single‐product pricing policies. Numerical experiments using a real data set from Alibaba demonstrate that the proposed policies, compared with several benchmark policies, increase the revenue. The results show that online clustering is an effective approach to tackling dynamic pricing problems associated with low‐sale products.},

  abstract     = {Reward‐based crowdfunding is a form of innovative financing that allows project creators to raise funds from potential backers to start their ventures. A crowdfunding project is successfully funded if and only if the predetermined funding goal is achieved within a given time. We study the optimal timing of contingently placing a “fulcrum” in the random pledging process, with the potential of tilting it toward success, which would be a win‐win for the creator, backers, and platform. Specifically, we consider a model where backers arrive sequentially at a crowdfunding project. Upon arrival, a backer makes her pledging decision by taking into account the expected success of the project. We characterize the dynamics of the project&#39;s pledging process. We show that there exists a cascade effect on backers&#39; pledging, which is mainly driven by the all‐or‐nothing nature of crowdfunding projects. According to our data collected from the most popular online crowdfunding platform, Kickstarter, the majority of projects fail to achieve their goals. To address this issue, we propose three contingent stimulus policies, namely, seeding, feature upgrade, and limited‐time offer. As a result of the cascade effect on backers&#39; pledging, the optimal timing to apply stimulus policies has a cutoff‐time structure. Lastly, we show that the benefit of contingent policies is greatest in the middle of crowdfunding campaigns. Testing with the dataset of Kickstarter, we obtain empirical evidence that the projects&#39; success rates improve by 14.6% on average with updates in the middle of the campaign and when the pledging progress is lagging.},

To test the proposed model, the authors use a transaction‐level dataset from a large brokerage firm in the residential construction materials industry. The dataset spans 3 years, enabling authors to observe changes in network structure and model the interplay between social capital and transaction efficacy and their impact on performance. They find that while a salesperson&#39;s social capital has a direct effect on performance, these effects are contingent on the salesperson&#39;s transaction efficacy.

We tackle the effect of flexibility and ranking knowledge and answer the above questions considering a single server Markovian queue with a generic batch size distribution. We consider two levels of flexibility: an inflexible setting, under which a family makes a common decision, and a flexible setting, under which each member makes her own decision. We pair each level with two sublevels with respect to the ranking knowledge: the case where the members set their ranking beforehand, and the case where they do not and assume they will be served according to a random order. We provide a full analytical characterization of the equilibrium and socially optimal strategies, and a comprehensive analysis of the intricate interplay among flexibility, ranking knowledge, and batch size variability, notions that do not exist in single‐ins arrival systems. We offer insights as to under which circumstances entity jettison is preferable. We investigate the corresponding implications of the above on system throughput and social welfare and determine which setting is preferable for the customers and which for the society, depending on the objective and the system dynamics. Further, we highlight key differences between single versus batch‐arrival models and provide high‐level guidelines for managers and policymakers as to how they can influence customer decisions so that they move toward the preferable setting (e.g., by revealing/concealing the ranking, encouraging flexibility, pricing, etc.).},

  abstract     = {The past decade has seen significant pressure to return manufacturing to developed countries. Such movements call for import tariffs to be raised and consumers&#39; valuation of products made from locally sourced components increased. These factors are believed to stimulate firms operating in a single market to source components locally. However, it is not clear that they are equally effective for multinational firms that produce and sell products in multiple markets. To enrich the understanding of this issue, we build a game‐theoretical model to analyze the sourcing decisions of a global manufacturer that maintains production sites and sells products in both domestic and foreign markets in a competitive environment. The firm can choose either to source components from suppliers located in the same markets as the manufacturing sites to gain tariff savings and a price premium from consumers&#39; higher valuation, or to source all components from a single foreign supplier to obtain a lower sourcing cost. We find that the structure of the global supply chain plays a critical role in the firm&#39;s sourcing strategy. Consumers&#39; higher valuation of locally manufactured goods always promotes local sourcing. Raising tariffs, however, might backfire and discourage local sourcing because of the firm&#39;s global supply chain structure and the foreign supplier&#39;s strategic response to higher tariffs. Finally, local sourcing may reduce the consumer surplus even though consumers place a higher value on locally manufactured goods. This paper sheds light on recent movements to return manufacturing to developed countries and demonstrates the importance of taking the manufacturer&#39;s global supply chain structure and vertical interaction with suppliers into account.},

  abstract     = {Empirical evidence indicates that consumers subjectively weigh the near future more heavily than the further future. When purchasing investment products, they make payments and exert efforts before receiving payoffs. Due to the time difference between incurring cost and receiving payoff, subjective discounting can cause consumers to exhibit time‐inconsistent purchase behavior. We investigate the impact of this consumer behavior on the pricing strategies of two competing firms that sell quality‐differentiated products. In a two‐period setting, each consumer purchases the product of a firm in period one or two or leaves without a purchase. Each firm adopts either dynamic pricing to adjust prices over periods or static pricing to commit to a price. We demonstrate that a firm should adopt a strategy alongside a price trajectory that suits the magnitude of consumers’ time inconsistency and the quality of its product. Stronger time inconsistency of consumers strengthens the firm&#39;s incentive to adopt dynamic pricing. The skimming policy to decrease prices over time is not necessarily optimal for a firm adopting dynamic pricing. Static pricing is not always effective in deterring purchase postponement by consumers but can undermine a firm&#39;s profit. Compared to when both firms adopt dynamic pricing, the firm selling the high‐quality product is more likely to suffer profit loss due to consumers’ self‐control problem by unilaterally adopting static pricing, while the firm selling the low‐quality product is more likely to suffer profit loss due to lack of pricing flexibility in managing demands from differential consumer segments when both firms adopt static pricing.},

This research question has not been examined in the research literature. But it is an important one because the revenue of an FTP game developer is based on in‐app ads watched by players (which depend on play duration) and in‐app purchases. Using different regression models to analyze weekly data associated with 100,000 players&#39; activities and expenditures of an FTP mobile game over a 3‐year period, we provide three key results and their implications. First, game performance has an “inverted‐U” effect. Players with exceptionally good/bad performance in 1 week tend to play for a shorter duration and make fewer purchases in the following week. This result implies that a game developer should monitor a player&#39;s performance and offer rewards to prevent players from dropping out. Second, virtual item novelty has a positive effect. Players who acquired new virtual items in 1 week tend to play for a longer duration and make more purchases in the following week. This result suggests that, to entice players to extend their play and increase their expenditure, the game developer should design customized virtual items with personalized pricing. Third, social interaction has a positive effect. Players who are “clan members” or played more with friends in 1 week tend to play for a longer duration and make more purchases in the following week. Hence, the game developer can benefit from this result by developing incentive for players to invite their friends to play together.},

In this paper, we analyze the effects of algorithm transparency on the use of advice from algorithms with different degrees of complexity. We conduct a set of laboratory experiments in which participants receive identical advice from algorithms with different levels of transparency and complexity. Our results indicate that not the algorithm itself, but the individually perceived appropriateness of algorithmic complexity moderates the effects of transparency on the use of advice. We summarize this effect as a plateau curve: While perceiving an algorithm as too simple severely harms the use of its advice, the perception of an algorithm as being too complex has no significant effect. Our insights suggest that managers do not have to be concerned about revealing algorithms that are perceived to be appropriately complex or too complex to decision‐makers, even if the decision‐makers do not fully comprehend them. However, providing transparency on algorithms that are perceived to be simpler than appropriate could disappoint people&#39;s expectations and thereby reduce the use of their advice.},

  abstract     = {Many agricultural commodities are traded in both forward and spot markets. This paper studies the interplay of random yield and forward market in a hybrid market with spot and forward transactions. We examine two main questions: (a) How does yield uncertainty (yield risk and yield correlation) affect the equilibrium outcome in this hybrid market? (b) How does the existence of a forward market influence the firms&#39; strategic behaviors and spot price volatility, and how does yield uncertainty mediate the role of the forward market? In our baseline model that considers two firms and no withholding behavior by the firms, it is found that as yield risk increases, firms may sell less in the forward market, and counterintuitively, higher yield risk may benefit firms and make the spot price less volatile. The existence of a forward market leads to greater spot price volatility; that is, a forward market destabilizes spot prices. We identify a mitigating effect of yield variability, but an enhancing effect of yield correlation, on the role of the forward market. Finally, we extend our baseline model to the case with more than two firms and the setting where the firms may withhold some products and demonstrate that some of the key results in the baseline model carry over to these extensions. Nevertheless, the firms&#39; withholding behavior represents a new driving force that changes some results. For example, the decreasing trend of spot price volatility in yield risk disappears in the withholding model.},

  abstract     = {Live‐stream selling is becoming increasingly popular in e‐commerce platforms, where streamers sell products through real‐time interactions, while consumers make purchases during live‐stream time. We identify several important factors to evaluate the live‐stream selling: (1) the streamer&#39;s ability to sell , which brings an extra value to consumers through real‐time illustrations and social interactions; (2) whether the extra value is positively or negatively correlated to consumers’ preference value; and (3) consumers’ cost to purchase through the live‐stream channel since consumers have to participate in the live‐stream show during a fixed time. We find that adding a live‐stream channel is profit‐enhancing only when the streamer&#39;s ability to sell is sufficiently high. If we consider the switching demand to the traditional channel from consumers who would have purchased from the live‐stream channel during the live‐stream time, we find that (1) a single live‐stream channel can be optimal, and (2) a high streamer&#39;s ability to sell may result in a profit loss. We also find that regardless of the switching demand, live‐stream selling is always more profitable when the extra value is negatively correlated with the consumer&#39;s preference value than the scenario when the extra value is positively correlated. These findings not only contribute to the literature on live‐stream selling and price discrimination but also offer guidelines for firms to make strategic decisions on live‐stream selling.},

A service triad comprises two serviced customers from the supplier&#39;s standpoint and two service providers from the end user&#39;s standpoint, which can cause operational complexity and challenges. We view the service triad as an operating entity and study four information‐rich cases to improve our understanding of this operational complexity. Leveraging scholarly knowledge related to service operations management and ecosystems theory, we uncover several interesting patterns related to the formation, functioning, and feedback exchanges. First, the formation exchanges depend on the value creation goal of the service triad. Second, the service buyer engages in operational coordination, despite delegating the delivery of services to the supplier. Third, feedback exchanges allow the service triad to monitor service performance for further improvement and innovation. Our qualitative inquiry focusing on the visualization and codification of members’ participation in exchanges advances our collective understanding of service triads beyond the dominant focus on structure and governance.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty before purchase often gives rise to postpurchase emotions that consumers might anticipate when making purchase decisions. Our study investigates how consumers&#39; anticipated postpurchase regret affects their optimal search behavior and how this affects firms&#39; price and assortment competition. The key tension considered in this study is that consumers balance between saving the cost of product evaluation by searching less and alleviating the potential postpurchase regret on their purchase by searching more. We use a classical sequential search framework to examine this key tension. Our results show that anticipated regret encourages more intense search across competitive alternatives, leading to an intensified price competition when search depth is exogenous (searching a fixed number of attributes) or when search depth is endogenous but full‐depth search (inspecting all attributes) emerges (with high regret intensity). However, when search depth is endogenous but partial‐depth search (inspecting a subset of attributes) emerges (with low regret intensity), the blessing effect of anticipated regret on softening firms&#39; price competition begins to emerge. In addition, anticipated regret can achieve a “win‐win‐win” situation for consumers, firms, and the social planner. Moreover, multiproduct firms use different competitive devices with different levels of regret intensity: When regret intensity is low (high), firms focus on assortment (price) competition to retain consumers. The relevant managerial implications are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Companies that provide a two‐sided platform for users to proactively seek a match face great challenges in increasing matching efficiency and ensuring match quality. This paper examines how information designs can be used to improve matching outcomes when users derive utility from a match&#39;s vertical attribute (i.e., quality) and its horizontal attribute (i.e., idiosyncratic fit). We consider a game‐theoretic model in which competing senders propose matching requests to competing receivers and users on the two sides are differentiated both horizontally and vertically. We first demonstrate that users&#39; preference for the vertical attribute intensifies competition and hurts matching efficiency, and to avoid competition a sender may switch from a close receiver to a distant receiver even when the weight that he places on a match&#39;s horizontal closeness increases. Second, we examine four information designs in which one type of information from one side of the market is withheld. Designs that withhold either side&#39;s vertical information increase the number of matches, with the improvement from withholding receivers&#39; information being greater. By contrast, designs that withhold either side&#39;s horizontal information can cause all requests to concentrate on one receiver and lead to the most severe match failure. Third, an increase in matching volume comes at the expense of certain users&#39; welfare, as withholding one side&#39;s vertical information can hurt not only high‐quality users on both sides but also the low‐quality users on the opposite side. Although withholding one side&#39;s horizontal information may increase the matching volume under certain conditions, it can be Pareto dominated by a design that withholds one side&#39;s vertical information. Fourth, when strategic user pricing is involved, it not only redistributes user welfare but also corrects for matching distortion. Finally, in contrast to the result when strategic pricing is absent, when strategic pricing is present the platform withholding one side&#39;s vertical information can benefit all users on the opposite side, while withholding one side&#39;s horizontal information can benefit all users on the same side.},

  abstract     = {We examine how different strategies can be used to protect global manufacturers from the prevalent issue of supplier copycatting in emerging markets. In particular, using a game‐theoretical model, we consider a manufacturer that sells a product to an emerging market, which requires the completion of multiple tasks. The manufacturer can perform any of these tasks in‐house or outsource any of them to an emerging market supplier. The former approach carries a higher cost, while the latter puts the manufacturer&#39;s intellectual property (IP) at risk of supplier copycatting. Either the manufacturer or the emerging market government can exert enforcement effort to protect the IP rights within the supply chain. Our results show that, surprisingly, there are cases where the manufacturer should outsource fewer tasks when in‐house production is more costly. Further, even though the supplier is the target of the enforcement, we show that the manufacturer&#39;s enforcement effort can help the supplier but hurt customers and the emerging market. Concerning whether the government or the manufacturer should take responsibility for IP protection, we recommend that the government enforce IP protection when the manufacturer has a weak brand quality and that the manufacturer enforce IP protection when it has a strong brand. This managerial insight provides a theoretical framework for the recent practitioners’ debate about who should be responsible for protecting IP rights within the supply chain.},

  abstract     = {Nonprofits&#39; performance is often evaluated based, in part, on their program spending ratio (PSR). Yet, ranking nonprofits based on PSR has been criticized because it is an imprecise index of a nonprofit&#39;s actual social impact. Further, too much emphasis on PSR creates an incentive for nonprofits to increase their program spending at the expense of investing in overhead, regardless of the social value it generates. In extreme cases, excessive focus on PSR can create incentives to manipulate or even misreport financial statements. Communicating information regarding governance can potentially counterbalance the pressures created by this focus on PSR. In 2008, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service implemented significant changes in the type of information that nonprofits are required to disclose, which helps them to better display their governance quality. Studying the tax forms of 38,226 nonprofits active in social services and relief operations during 2010–2017, we find that governance quality is now an important factor in driving public donations to nonprofits, although PSR still remains a key driver. Moreover, our findings show that better governance is associated with a lower likelihood of misreporting, consistent with the argument that better governance reduces the pressure to report a high PSR. Overall, our results suggest that nonprofits should consider improving their governance quality in their strategies for securing donation income, even though that may lead to lower PSR levels.},

  abstract     = {The United States has long recognized the potential of improved energy efficiency to profitably reduce energy consumption in manufacturing. The Department of Energy (DOE) has also recognized the potential and initiated several programs to enhance energy efficiency in manufacturing. Despite the attention, studies point out that many energy‐efficiency opportunities remain unexploited. Increasingly, scholars have emphasized that behavioral factors could facilitate the uptake of energy‐efficiency practices. Accordingly, we adopt a behavioral perspective and investigate whether precision (a hitherto unexplored behavioral factor) affects the adoption of energy‐efficiency practices. Specifically, we examine whether the implementation of energy‐efficiency practices depends on whether the costs and savings associated with such practices are presented as precise (e.g., $20,431) or round (e.g., $20,400) numbers. First, we explore the impact of precision with econometric analysis using data on energy‐efficiency recommendations made by the DOE to small‐ and medium‐sized manufacturing firms. Our econometric analysis indicates that energy‐efficiency recommendations with precise cost and precise saving exhibit higher adoption rates as compared to other recommendations. Next, we use individual interactions with managers and laboratory experiments with managers and students to replicate and isolate the precision effects. Then, we elicit the mechanism by which precision affects the adoption of energy‐efficiency initiatives. We find that credibility serves as a key mechanism that drives the precision effect. Our findings suggest that credibility‐enhancing cues such as precision can be leveraged to increase the uptake of energy efficiency and possibly other process improvement practices.},

The manufacturers can adopt financial hedging to reduce profit variability or spot trading to mitigate the demand–supply mismatch risk, and they can also combine these two strategies or adopt neither of them. We characterize the equilibria of several representative games where two different risk management strategies are available, and find that financial hedging complements spot trading by protecting both contract procurement and spot trading from the demand uncertainty and spot price volatility. Hence, the combined strategy brings a synergy benefit and dominates spot trading; however, it cannot always outperform financial hedging because the price risk introduced by spot trading overwhelms its benefits. Interestingly, asymmetric risk management equilibria may arise between symmetric manufacturers because the sequential production competition under strategy differentiation allows them to better utilize their respective strategies. We further find that when all four strategies are simultaneously available, financial hedging should normally be adopted, whereas spot trading should not be used alone. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis with a real‐data–calibrated numerical study to show which risk management strategy performs better in the soybean processing industry.},

  abstract     = {Previous studies on horizontal outsourcing between competing duopolists emphasize cost factors, such as economies of scale and/or variable cost advantages in Cournot markets, as potential explanations. Our paper studies horizontal outsourcing when two competing firms engage in Bertrand competition, and highlights the important role of sole sourcing commitment. We adopt the framework of a multistage duopoly game that comprises of an incumbent and an entrant. The incumbent has the capability to make a key component in‐house, and the entrant, who is a rival of the incumbent in the downstream market, can source the component from either the incumbent or a supplier not participating in the end‐product market. We find that if the entrant commits to sole sourcing, horizontal outsourcing can occur when the incumbent has a component cost advantage or even a small cost disadvantage over the alternative supplier. Specifically, if the component cost gap is small, horizontal outsourcing may soften downstream market competition and benefit both firms at the expense of inducing higher prices for the consumers. If the incumbent has a significant cost advantage, horizontal outsourcing may lead to an increased downstream price war by expanding the total supply of end products. Without sole sourcing commitment, horizontal outsourcing occurs only when the incumbent has a cost advantage, and it always strengthens downstream price competition. By contrast, if the firms engage in downstream Cournot competition, sole sourcing commitment has no impact on the adoption of horizontal outsourcing, and the entrant sources from her rival only when the incumbent enjoys a significant cost advantage. Finally, we also study various extensions to check and confirm the robustness of our main results to key model assumptions.},

  abstract     = {We study the joint pricing and inventory management problem in the presence of online customer reviews. Customers who purchase the product may post reviews that would influence future customers&#39; purchasing behaviors. We develop a stochastic joint pricing and inventory management model to characterize the optimal policy in the presence of online reviews. We show that a rating‐dependent base‐stock/list‐price policy is optimal. Interestingly, we can reduce the dynamic program that characterizes the optimal policy to one with a single‐dimensional state space (the aggregate net rating). The presence of online reviews gives rise to the trade‐off between generating current profits and inducing future demands, thus having several important implications for the firm&#39;s operations decisions. First, online reviews drive the firm to deliver a better service and attract more customers to post a review. Hence, the safety‐stock and base‐stock levels are higher in the presence of online reviews. Second, the evolution of the aggregate net rating process follows a mean‐reverting pattern: When the current rating is low (respectively, high), it has an increasing (respectively, decreasing) trend in expectation. Third, although myopic profit optimization leads to significant optimality losses in the presence of online reviews, balancing current profits, and near‐future demands suffices to exploit the network effect induced by online reviews. We propose a dynamic look‐ahead heuristic policy that leverages this idea well and achieves small optimality gaps that decay exponentially in the length of the look‐ahead time window. Finally, we develop a general paid‐review strategy, which provides monetary incentives for customers to leave reviews. This strategy facilitates the retailer to (partially) separately generate current profits and induce future demands via the network effect of online reviews.},

In this study, we examine news articles on crowd‐sourced digital platforms for financial markets. Assembling a unique dataset of financial news articles that were investigated and prosecuted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, along with the propagation data of such articles on digital platforms and the financial performance data of the focal firm, we develop a well‐justified machine learning system to detect financial disinformation published on social media platforms. Our system design is rooted in the truth‐default theory, which argues that communication context and motive, coherence, information correspondence, propagation, and sender demeanor are major constructs to assess deceptive communication. Extensive analyses are conducted to evaluate the performance and efficacy of the proposed system. We further discuss this study&#39;s theoretical implications and its practical value.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce and study the joint inventory selection and online resource allocation problem, which is characterized by two sequential sets of decisions that are irrevocably linked. First, a decision maker (DM) must select starting inventory levels for a set of available resources. Subsequently, the DM must match arriving customers to available resources in an online fashion so as to maximize expected reward. We first study the problem in its most general form, before focusing on a specific version that arises at Anheuser Busch InBev (ABI). This particular application of our general setting is referred to as the ABI Trailer Problem, and it considers how ABI ships its beer to vendors via third‐party delivery trucks. In this problem, ABI must select the weights of preloaded trailers of beer, which are then matched in an online fashion to the arriving third‐party delivery trucks. For the general setting, we develop simple and easy‐to‐implement approaches that come with robust worst‐case performance guarantees. For the ABI setting, we reveal a simplifying structural property related to the optimal matching policy, which gives rise to a natural adaptation of our original approach. We test the efficacy of these policies through extensive numerical experiments, where we find that our approaches are either near‐optimal or improve upon state‐of‐the‐art benchmarks. In particular, using a data set from ABI, we are able to generate instances of the ABI Trailer Problem, on which our algorithm has the potential to yield revenue improvements in the range of millions of dollars per year.},

  abstract     = {We consider a seller who repeatedly sells a nondurable product to a single customer whose valuations of the product are drawn from a certain distribution. The seller, who initially does not know the valuation distribution, may use the customer&#39;s purchase history to learn and wishes to choose a pricing policy that maximizes her long‐run revenue. Such a problem is at the core of personalized revenue management where the seller can access each customer&#39;s individual purchase history and offer personalized prices. In this paper, we study such a learning problem when the customer is aware of the seller&#39;s policy and thus may behave strategically when making a purchase decision. By using a Bayesian setting with a binary prior, we first show that a popular policy in this setting—the myopic Bayesian policy (MBP)—may lead to incomplete learning of the seller, namely, the seller may never be able to ascertain the true type of the customer and the regret may grow linearly over time. The failure of the MBP is due to the strategic action taken by the customer. To address the strategic behavior of the customers, we first analyze a Stackelberg game under a two‐period model. We derive the optimal policy of the seller in the two‐period model and show that the regret can be significantly reduced by using the optimal policy rather than the myopic policy. However, such a game is hard to analyze in general. Nevertheless, based on the idea used in the two‐period model, we propose a randomized Bayesian policy (RBP), which updates the posterior belief of the customer in each period with a certain probability, as well as a deterministic Bayesian policy (DBP), in which the seller updates the posterior belief periodically and always defers her update to the next cycle. For both the RBP and DBP, we show that the seller can learn the customer type exponentially fast even if the customer is strategic, and the regret is bounded by a constant. We also propose policies that achieve asymptotically optimal regrets when only a finite number of price changes are allowed.},

  abstract     = {Retail stores are geographically dispersed as a part of a multiunit organization. In such a setting, store managers play an important role in driving store performance. To motivate them to exert effort, retailers have provided group incentives for store managers. Using data from 75 stores of a U.S.‐based retail chain that changed its incentive plan for store managers from being purely dependent on store performance to being dependent upon both store and corporate performance, we investigate the effect of this change on store performance. We also examine the moderating role of geographical proximity among stores and past performance of the focal store. To establish a causality, we identify a control group from a matched store of another retail chain in the same industry and perform a difference‐in‐differences analysis. We find that making managers&#39; bonus dependent on corporate goals has resulted in overall worsening of store performance. However, such an effect is contingent upon both geographical proximity among stores and past performance of the focal store. The impact of the incentive change on store performance is positively moderated by the increase in stores within close geographical proximity, while it is negatively moderated by the past performance of the focal store. This paper broadens our understanding of how incentives work in practice, and more importantly, documents how firms can design more effective incentive schemes for managers by considering relevant conditions, such as stores&#39; geographical networks and their past performance.},

  abstract     = {Large‐scale production of a new vaccine, such as the COVID‐19 vaccine, is characterized by evolving demand and production yield uncertainties. Further, following its FDA approval for efficacy and safety, a vaccine may not even be manufacturable due to its low production yield and the resulting lack of profitability. To deal with those challenges in practice, a vaccine manufacturer can (stochastically) increase the uncertain yield of a vaccine prior to launching large‐scale production by learning through small‐scale, experimental production runs about manufacturing conditions that are conducive to raising that yield. After starting large‐scale production and receiving revenues from the sale of the vaccine, the manufacturer can continue to stochastically improve vaccine yield by acquiring knowledge from real‐time production data. The two key decisions faced by a vaccine manufacturer concern the optimal timing and capacity of the vaccine&#39;s large‐scale production. To determine the structure of vaccine manufacturer&#39;s optimal decisions, we formulate and solve a stochastic, multiperiod, sequential‐decision model, while incorporating the dynamic evolution of vaccine yield uncertainty under those two yield improvement strategies. We establish the optimality of a threshold stopping policy for the timing of the large‐scale vaccine production. This policy depends in a fundamental way on the relative stochastic rates of the two yield improvement strategies. We characterize the manufacturer&#39;s optimal capacity decision and identify conditions under which optimal capacity and production yield become substitutes. We analyze the implications of our results for rendering a new vaccine large‐scale manufacturable, and bringing it to the market sooner during a pandemic period.},

  abstract     = {As the ongoing battle between brick‐and‐mortar stores and e‐commerce shops escalates, managers of the former are becoming more cautious regarding their strategic store site selection and decoration decisions, particularly if foreseeable competition from rival companies exists. This paper investigates a bilevel competitive facility location (BCFL) problem, where two companies, a leader and a follower, plan to enter a market sequentially. Each company has a budget to open and design facilities. The goal is to maximize expected revenue that is forecasted through a discrete choice model. To reflect a practical environment, we further consider a situation with elastic demand, explaining the market expansion effect when customers are offered better service due to the opening of new facilities. We formulate the problem as a nonlinear 0‐1 bilevel program. Because of the bilevel structure and the market expansion effect, this problem is so challenging that we are unaware of any exact algorithms in the literature. Motivated by this gap, we develop an exact framework that leverages the state‐of‐the‐art value‐function–based approach. However, this framework requires solving a mixed‐integer nonconvex optimization problem (MINOP) at each iteration, which is computationally prohibitive even for medium‐scale instances. To mitigate the intractability, we propose a new framework that avoids MINOP and tackles instances with hundreds of location variables. Finally, we conduct extensive computational studies to show the efficiency and effectiveness of our method as well as provide insightful guidance for managers to have win–win/dominate outcomes and choose an appropriate market size function when dealing with expansion decisions in chained business operations.},

The objective is to maximize the expected discounted revenue. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process, prove the anti‐multimodularity of the value function, and characterize the structure of the optimal policy. We show that the optimal policy has a simple structure and is characterized by state‐dependent rationing and priority thresholds. Moreover, a solution algorithm is proposed to calculate the optimal policy. We study the impacts of the system state on the optimal action and find that the optimal action has limited sensitivity to the system state. Numerical studies are conducted to compare the performance of the optimal policy with that of two heuristic methods and to derive some managerial insights by analysis.

  abstract     = {One of the most popular ways of shopping in an omnichannel retailing environment is buy‐online‐pickup‐in‐store (BOPS). Retailers often promise BOPS shoppers short in‐store pickup ready times. We study fulfillment scheduling decisions of BOPS orders destined for a single store of a retailer. There are two fulfillment options for BOPS orders: they can be either processed at a fulfillment center (FC) and delivered to the store or processed at the store without needing delivery. There are two types of trucks available to deliver the BOPS orders fulfilled at the FC: prescheduled trucks that are already committed to replenishing store inventory and have some spare capacity that can be utilized, and additional trucks that can be hired from third‐party logistics providers. There is a fixed cost for using each truck; the cost for using a prescheduled truck is lower than that for using an additional truck. If an order is fulfilled at the store, it incurs a processing cost and a processing time, whereas the processing cost and time are negligible if an order is fulfilled at the FC. The problem is to determine where to fulfill each order (FC vs. the store), how to assign the orders fulfilled at the FC to trucks for delivery, and how to schedule the orders fulfilled at the store for store processing, so as to minimize the total fulfillment cost, including the delivery cost from the FC to the store incurred by the orders processed at the FC, and the processing cost for fulfilling the rest of the orders at the store, subject to the constraint that each order is ready for pickup at the store by its promised pickup ready time. We consider various cases of the problem by clarifying their computational complexity, developing optimal algorithms and heuristics, and analyzing theoretical performance of the heuristics. We also conduct computational experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed heuristics in both static and dynamic settings and derive important insights about how the presence of prescheduled trucks and the presence of store fulfillment option impact the fulfillment cost and decisions.},

(ii) How should a firm&#39;s positioning strategies change as consumers&#39; perceptions of healthful messaging and taxation change? and (iii) How do these factors impact firm profits and social welfare (SW)? Using an analytical model of duopolistic competition, we highlight that both firm profits as well as SW could increase when the importance of healthfulness messaging to consumers increases. Furthermore, we show that increased taxation could reduce the quality gap between alternatives in the market, forcing firms to lower prices. In contrast, when healthfulness messaging becomes more important to consumers, the quality gap between both firms increases. Our results provide important implications for public policy as well as firm profits as a consequence of the strategic decisions of firms in a health policy context.},

  abstract     = {E‐commerce platforms struggle to create and maintain high‐quality reputation systems. One promising option is “purchase verification,” which confirms that the user reviewing a product purchased the product from the platform. Previous works comparing platforms that require purchase verification with platforms that do not offer purchase verification found that review manipulation is easier in the latter. But what happens in platforms where purchase verification is optional? In such platforms, there is no monetary cost for posting fake reviews. Yet, optional purchase verification (OPV) might introduce indirect costs for fake reviewers through expectation disconfirmation, hence positively affecting the reputation ecosystem of an e‐commerce platform. To investigate, we use a quasi‐experimental setup to analyze 336,043 book reviews. We find empirical evidence that introducing OPV reduces fake reviews, most of which are positive. This reduction of fake reviews results in lower, more representative product ratings and longer and more helpful reviews posted by more experienced reviewers. These new findings extend our understanding of how OPV can improve a platform&#39;s reputation ecosystem and suggest managerial interventions for platforms that have yet to develop a verification mechanism.},

  abstract     = {The shipping industry touches approximately 90% of all international trade, producing roughly one billion tons of greenhouse gases each year. Changes in the operations and coordination of global‐shipping vessels can have a substantial impact on vessel&#39;s carbon emissions, but these efforts need to fulfill the service expectation of individual firms receiving consignments. We examine the associated gains (or losses) in operational efficiencies and environmental benefits (if there are any) from vessel sharing. We do so by analyzing a dataset that merges multiple years of U.S. port records and maritime emissions data. Using simultaneous regression equation models, our results indicate that the maritime emissions (attributable to receiving firms) drop by 5%, on average, for each additional carrier sharing a vessel. We confirm several operational efficiencies emerging from vessel sharing, such as increased average utilization and reductions in “route redundancy.” These operational changes mediate the total effect of vessel sharing on emissions. However, we do find that vessel sharing is associated with a slight increase in lead time, measured as the number of days it took to deliver the goods. Although our empirical setting is in the global shipping industry, asset sharing is a mechanism that can be adopted by any industry. Our findings show the importance of exploring the conditions and settings where sharing may or may not have operational and/or environmental trade‐offs.},

  abstract     = {Strategic customers typically patronize service systems at a higher rate than the socially optimal one. Much literature has focused on inducing customers to join such systems at this latter rate. This entire literature considers nonidling policies that are the focus of queueing theory. We demonstrate that strategically imposing delays into service systems can improve the social welfare using the M/G/1 queue with orbit. This versatile queueing model has been extensively studied from a performance evaluation perspective. In this system, customers who arrive and find the server idle begin immediately their service. However, strategic customers who find the server busy decide whether to balk or join a virtual queue, that is, an orbit. Then, each time the server finishes a service, he begins to retrieve a customer from the orbit and the corresponding retrieving time is not negligible. These retrieving times function as extra delays that are imposed on customers that find a busy server. We show that when customers are strategic, there are certain ranges of the parameters where delaying the orbit customers can increase the welfare of a system or even maximize it. To this end, we characterize and compute the equilibrium strategies for the customers&#39; joining/balking dilemma. We consider both the unobservable and observable versions of the system, and provide some insight on the optimal delay and level of information in such systems. We further show that the welfare for this system is higher than the corresponding standard M/G/1 queue with the same delay.},

  abstract     = {Firms that sell products over a limited selling season often have only imperfect information about (a) the exact timing of that season, (b) the demand volume to expect, and (c) the temporal distribution of demand over the selling season. Given these uncertainties, firms must determine not only how much inventory to stock but also when to make that inventory available to customers. We thus ask: What is a firm&#39;s optimal inventory quantity and timing for products sold during a stochastic selling season? Although the newsvendor literature has developed a thorough understanding of the firm&#39;s optimal inventory quantity, it has failed to inform decision‐makers about choosing the optimal inventory timing. We address this issue by developing a theoretical model of a firm that sells a product over a stochastic selling season, and we study how this firm should choose its inventory timing and inventory quantity so as to maximize expected profits. We also identify the effects of optimal inventory timing on the firm&#39;s ability to satisfy customer demand and show how early inventory timing can be detrimental to customer service. Our core results imply three immediate recommendations for managers. First, optimal inventory timing is an effective weapon for combating both high inventory holding costs and high levels of uncertainty in the firm&#39;s customer demand pattern. Second, to be effective, a firm&#39;s inventory timing must be carefully aligned with the firm&#39;s inventory quantity. Third, naïve decision rules (e.g., “earlier is better”) may reduce not only the firm&#39;s profits but also its capacity to serve customer demand.},

In the marketplace, manufacturers and suppliers first participate in long‐term contracts in which manufacturers reserve capacity at one or more suppliers. Subsequently, manufacturers and suppliers trade in a spot market to fulfill residual demand and sell residual capacity, respectively; in the spot market, the equilibrium price is determined dynamically and endogenously by the balance of supply and demand for capacity. We build a model to derive insights on the decisions taken by the manufacturers and suppliers and on the equilibrium characteristics of the market. We show existence of equilibria in both long‐ and short‐term contract markets and establish a relationship between the equilibrium prices for the two types of contracts. We also find that when short‐term–only contracts are available, the expected backlog is lower compared to when integrated contracts are used for much of the planning horizon. Further, we find that the presence of long‐term contracts increases the volatility of spot prices. Our results will make practicing managers aware that contractual arrangement can influence spot price volatility.},

We model such circumstances and derive managerial implications that help us explain real‐world conundrums, illustrating the intricate interactions between the operational decision to build up capacity and the financial decision to exit an industry. Shutting down may be delayed in the hope of expanding capacity upon recovery; an expansion may also be delayed in the presence of a valuable exit option. Numerical extensions provide further managerial insights. In particular, the presence of fixed or proportional financing costs may lead the firm to delay its expansion decision, but the scale of investment will only be affected by proportional costs. If herding behavior causes equipment prices to increase (respectively, decrease) when electricity prices are high (respectively, low), managers should invest earlier (respectively, later) and more (respectively, less) while equipment prices are low (respectively, high). Furthermore, although volume swings (due to capacity decommissionings and expansions) are marked in a homogeneous industry (when the default and expansion thresholds are reached), heterogeneity in the population of wind farms smooths out such effects.},

It demonstrates that the relationship between capacity and capital structure is not as simple as the existing literature suggests. If the supplier is very powerful, it will use a mixed capital structure and build less capacity than if it were equity financed. If the buyer is very powerful, the supplier will use all debt financing and overbuild capacity. In this case, the supplier would not agree to build capacity ex ante if it were prohibited from borrowing. Hence, borrowing is Pareto optimal. Under a more balanced power structure, the supplier may choose all debt financing and overbuild capacity or all equity financing and underbuild capacity, depending on the trade‐off of the bargaining benefits and costs of debt financing.},

  abstract     = {R&amp;D projects in small biotechnology firms frequently involve knowledge from multiple technical fields and research in different problem domains. An increase in project knowledge scope, defined as the number of technical fields an R&amp;D project covers, can be challenging for resource‐constrained small firms. These firms often rely primarily on their principal investigators (PIs), who act as heavyweight project managers in guiding project ideas to successful R&amp;D outcomes. PIs also work concurrently on multiple projects, a strategy to promote learning across projects. To better understand how small firms PIs manage projects with high knowledge scope, our research assembles and analyzes a data set of 1374 R&amp;D projects conducted by 933 small firms in the context of U.S. Small Business Administration awards. Results, after accounting for endogeneity, suggest a negative association between project knowledge scope and project success, which we measured using patent forward citation counts. We also find that a PI&#39;s multiproject status negatively moderates (i.e., amplifies) this association, while project management experience positively moderates (i.e., weakens) it. A follow‐up post hoc analysis suggests that a shared problem domain is a key contingency for the moderation effects of both multiproject status and project management experience. Taken together, our research offers insights on how to effectively manage R&amp;D projects in resource‐constrained small firms.},

The supply sources may thus be differentiated by their lead times, capacities, and fixed and variable order costs. Salvage options allow for inventory reductions and incur fixed cost and variable revenues. We first analyze the tactical problem of determining an optimal procurement strategy under given capacity profiles at the two suppliers. We then address the strategic model in which optimal capacity profiles, both static and dynamically adjusted, are obtained based on two‐part capacity contracts. We characterize the structure of optimal procurement strategies when the lead times of the two suppliers differ by a single period and the lead time for salvage opportunities matches that of one of the suppliers. For general lead time combinations, we show that the optimal procurement strategies satisfy monotonicity and limited sensitivity properties, and construct effective heuristics and upper and lower bounds based on our structural results.},

The focus of this paper is to identify factors that help to drive venue popularity revealed by location‐based services, which then better facilitate companies’ operational decisions, such as procurement and staff scheduling. Using data collected from Foursquare and Yelp, we build, evaluate, and compare a wide variety of machine learning methods including deep learning models with varying characteristics and degrees of sophistication. First, we find that support vector regression is the best performing model compared to other complex predictive algorithms. Second, we apply SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify the contribution from each business feature at both the global and local levels. The global interpretability results show that customer loyalty, the agglomeration effect, and the word‐of‐mouth effect are the top three drivers of venue popularity. Furthermore, the local interpretability analysis reveals that the contributions of business features vary, both quantitatively and directionally. Our findings are robust with respect to different popularity measures, training and testing periods, and prediction horizons. These findings extend our knowledge of location‐based services by demonstrating their potential to play a prominent role in attracting consumer engagement and boosting venue popularity. Managers can make better operational decisions such as procurement and staff scheduling based on these more accurate venue popularity prediction methods. Furthermore, this study also highlights the importance of model interpretability which enhances the ability of managers to more effectively utilize machine learning models for effective decision‐making.},

To achieve it, countries worldwide donate large amounts of development aid (USD 15.18 billion annually). However, current practice in allocating development aid is largely based on decision heuristics and thus subject to inefficiencies. To address this problem, we aim to support managers of funding bodies in identifying cost‐effective allocations of development aid and thus develop a new decision model. We combine data analytics with mathematical optimization, whereby the former estimates the country‐specific effectiveness of aid, and the latter suggests an allocation under budget constraints. We evaluate our decision model using aid data obtained from the SDG Financing Lab of the OECD, demonstrating that our decision model could reduce the infection rate over current practice. Our work directly benefits managers of funding bodies tasked with financing development activities and helps them achieve cost‐effective progress toward ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic.},

  abstract     = {Care coordination involves shaping patient care activities and sharing information among all participants concerned with a patient&#39;s care to achieve safe and effective care. The objectives of care coordination are to promote sharing of patients’ clinical information, keep patients and families informed, and manage effective referrals and care transitions. Failures in care coordination account for a large amount of waste per year in the United States. Many innovative healthcare organizations have recently recognized the danger of poorly coordinated care and have implemented analytics to improve it. Therefore, more analytics‐based research (especially combining explanatory analytics with predictive analytics) is needed to direct efforts to improve care coordination. This paper focuses on systematically studying the extant literature to understand how analytics play a role in improving care coordination. Our goal is to identify a set of key research questions that would lead to new research areas in the use of analytics for care coordination. Based on these questions, we offer new analytics solution pathways to care coordination problems.},

Our NIM provides a clear strategy for interdicting STNs. Namely, it determines when to monitor (i.e., gather information) or arrest the criminals to maximize the impact of the interdiction operation and cripple the network. We tested our NIM using three federally prosecuted sex trafficking cases in the United States of different sizes and structural properties: hybrid, international transactional, and Tenancingo models. Our experiments show promising results regarding the effectiveness of our NIM in all network types. In addition to that, we tested our model with an increasingly higher fraction of missing information to account for the inherently hidden nature of illicit networks. Our study provides analytical insight regarding (1) the importance of building the case prior to the arrests of criminals in illicit networks and (2) deploying a holistic strategy to improve interdiction and enhance the fight against sex trafficking.},

  abstract     = {In distribution channels, the growing popularity of downstream retailers is a cause of both delight and despair for their upstream suppliers. While such retailers can generate more sales for the suppliers, they may also have higher leverage during any bargaining. This paper uses an analytical model to explore how a supplier&#39;s preference about the structure of her retail distribution channel is shaped by (1) the level of substitutability between the end products sold by the retailers, (2) the correlation between the popularity of the retailers and their bargaining power, and (3) the intensity of competition from other channels. In our base model, a monopolist supplier sells two substitutable products to two retailers who then sell to end customers. The two retailers are asymmetric in their ability to attract customers and their bargaining power during any contract negotiation with the supplier is proportional to that attraction potential. Analysis of the model and its extension reveals a number of robust insights, irrespective of whether the negotiation between the channel partners is about profit allocation or about wholesale price. First, an ideal situation for the supplier is that less asymmetric retailers sell differentiated products while more asymmetric ones sell similar products. That is, a supplier whose products are quite substitutable should not be too concerned about a dominant retail partner, but one selling differentiated products should be worried. Second, a stronger correlation between the retailers&#39; popularity and their bargaining power makes the retail structure with less asymmetric retailers preferable from the supplier&#39;s perspective. Finally, the presence of competing channels selling substitutable variants significantly impacts the supplier&#39;s preference about its own channel structure, and a high level of channel competition reverses some of the above findings.},

We investigate their effect on the probability of a test order and the number of tests ordered for a patient who receives a test order. Empirical analysis of data from a public research and training hospital shows that these workload measures have different effects: A higher unfinished workload increases the probability of giving a test order, while a higher finished load decreases the number of tests ordered for those patients who receive a test order. The observed effects of the operational factors workload and finished load, which have no relation to the patients&#39; complaints and hence, should have no bearing on the eventual diagnosis, and have significant implications for the quality and cost of health care. We also observe that the control variable, examination time, has a significant negative effect on the likelihood of ordering and the number of tests.

Simply put, observing another&#39;s high performance is a clue that can lead solvers to devise ways of achieving their own breakthroughs. Using a unique dataset of predictive modeling contests from Kaggle, we use 25,898 distinct attempts at innovation to highlight this new learning effect in contests and show how discontinuous leaps in innovation (as opposed to incremental steps) result in different outcomes. We achieve this by exploiting differences in the problem complexity. First, we find that leaps increase rates of entry and improve overall contest performance in complex problems. This effect applies not only to the best‐performing solvers but also to trailing solvers. Second, we provide evidence that suggests solvers actually change their approach and tackle innovation problems differently after a leap. This adds a new understanding about innovation contests and their incentives and has implications for contest design.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a single‐stage make‐to‐stock production–inventory system under random demand and random yield, where defective units are reworked. We examine how to set cost‐minimizing production/order quantities in such imperfect systems, which is challenging because a random yield implies an uncertain arrival time of outstanding units and the possibility of them crossing each other in the pipeline. To determine the order/production quantity in each period, we extend the unit‐tracking/decomposition approach, taking into account the possibility of order‐crossing, which is new to the literature and relevant to other planning problems. The extended unit‐tracking/decomposition approach allows us to determine the optimal base‐stock level and to formulate the exact and an approximate expression of the per‐period cost of a base‐stock policy. The same approach is also used to develop a state‐dependent ordering policy. The numerical study reveals that our state‐dependent policy can reduce inventory‐related costs compared to the base‐stock policy by up to 6% and compared to an existing approach from the literature by up to 4.5%. From a managerial perspective, the most interesting finding is that a high mean production yield does not necessarily lead to lower expected inventory‐related costs. This counterintuitive finding, which can be observed for the most commonly used yield model, is driven by an increased probability that all the units in a batch are either of good or unacceptable quality.},

We investigate customers&#39; equilibrium strategies: (i) joining or balking and (ii) if joining, accepting PTAS or rejecting PTAS, in response to such a mechanism; we show that customers&#39; equilibrium strategies exhibit both avoid‐the‐crowd (ATC) and follow‐the‐crowd (FTC) types of behavior. Our results indicate that the adoption of PTAS is efficient in improving the system performance (e.g., revenue and throughput) when the demand volume is intermediate. We also discover that, upon selecting the appropriate queue‐length information disclosure policy, the service provider has to trade off between collecting a higher revenue through PTAS and improving the system throughput, because revealing the queue‐length information will impact the aforementioned two performance metrics in opposing directions. Finally, we compare our new setting to other common mechanisms including regular vacation queues and pay‐for‐priority queues.},

Using business analytics, SaaS applications are increasingly embedded in the day‐to‐day activities of businesses and consumers with competition and innovative pricing. Due to the evolution in cloud business models, new issues are surfacing to challenge practitioners and scholars. A number of issues encountered in the practice have not been properly addressed or even recognized. In this paper, we attempt to fill this important gap. We propose a framework of recent business research on SaaS in light of wide adoption of the SaaS business model. This framework broadly classifies SaaS research into two basic themes. For each theme, we review past work that has been instrumental in setting the direction of this line of research and discuss how emerging research opportunities can be addressed. For each research opportunity, we also propose an initial model and the applicable methodology. Further, in order to aid researchers, we identify the data sources wherever applicable, and even present some of the initial results. We conclude by describing promising directions on a roadmap for future research and explain why an integrative perspective of operations, marketing, and information systems is critical to SaaS. In this paper, we bridge the gap between research and practice by identifying the relevant industry problems that would help researchers who are interested in working in this area both to get a starting point and to address important theoretical and practical challenges.},

  abstract     = {Sellers are conventionally generous with their return policies for valuation‐uncertain products, such as experience products and new products. However, with the development of online review platforms, an increasing number of consumers are engaging in social learning by referring to others&#39; reviews to reduce valuation uncertainty. In this study, we investigate how social learning interacts with sellers&#39; return policies. There are three main conclusions. First, when sellers have a relatively higher expectation of product quality (or simply the product quality is high), social learning makes the sellers offering either no‐refund policies or partial‐refund policies better off in terms of the increased profit. It will cause the no‐refund sellers to choose higher prices and inventory, and the partial‐refund sellers to set lower prices and refund amounts. Second, under social learning, the partial‐refund policy tends to be more beneficial to sellers than both full‐refund and no‐refund policies; although, when the product quality is high, the no‐refund policy tends to bring more benefits to sellers than the full‐refund policy. Hence, sellers may finally switch to the partial‐refund policy. Third, for partial‐refund policies, more often than not, social learning increases social welfare when the product quality is high; specifically, in many cases, it increases not only the profit of the seller but also the welfare of consumers.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, research on supply chain coordination (SCC) with risk‐averse agents has received much attention. Previous studies are primarily concerned with the coordination of a single manufacturer–single retailer supply chain using different definitions of SCC. What is lacking is a comprehensive analysis of the achievability of SCC. In this paper, we provide a systematic analysis of SCC with risk‐averse agents. We see that three definitions of SCC have been proposed in the literature to investigate SCC with risk‐averse agents, among which the one based on Pareto optimality (PO) stands out. Here we explore the challenges of using the PO criterion. Specifically, we first examine the standard two‐agent supply chain under the mean–variance (MV) and mean‐downside‐risk (MDR) objectives. What we find is that the achievability of PO depends on the contract type. The wholesale price contract even with a side payment may not lead to PO. Also, unlike under MV where risk sharing is Pareto optimal, we observe that the least risk‐averse agent must take all the risk to achieve SCC under MDR. Importantly, we extend our analysis to multiretailer, multimanufacturer, and multitier supply chains. In each case, we characterize the efficient Pareto‐optimal manifold in the multidimensional space and design coordinating contracts that result in Pareto‐optimal actions acceptable to all agents. We also discover that identifying PO across all the contract forms is difficult when some other risk‐aversion criteria are considered. We conclude by providing suggestions and methods for SCC when we are unable to identify PO.},

  abstract     = {Online user‐generated reviews have received significant importance in the literature as they help consumers make consumption decisions. However, despite significant developments in this domain in the past decade, little attention has been paid to how narrative aspects of reviews affect consumers’ consumption decisions and, consequently, influence sales. A narrative can be defined as a sequentially structured discourse that provides an understanding of the events that unfold around the narrator. Relying on the literature on narrative transportation, we examine the role of review narrativity in determining firm sales, the contingency effect of the competitive environment, and review polarity. Specifically, we propose that review narrativity has an asymmetric U‐shaped (or, J‐shaped ) relationship with sales; the impact of review narrativity on sales would have significant positive interaction with the polarity of the review text; and that under high (low) competitive agglomeration, review narrativity would have a significant (insignificant) positive impact on sales. Operationalizing review narrativity using three different measures from a unique and rich dataset collected from OpenTable and using a Bayesian framework, consistent with our hypotheses, we find that the narrativity of textual reviews exerts a significant nonlinear impact on sales contingent on their polarity. Enriching the relatively nascent empirical literature on the effects of competitive context on eWOM, the current paper further offers clear empirical evidence that the impact of review narrativity on sales is significantly higher (lower) under a high (low) competitive agglomeration. The paper makes a methodological contribution by developing a flexible framework to identify the proposed relationships better while accounting for heterogeneity, endogeneity, and temporal patterns in the context of dynamic panels.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we explore why users’ experiences with emerging supply chain technologies comprise inflated expectations followed by disappointment in the early stages of adoption, as per the Gartner Hype Cycle. We used “affordance theory” to study how managers perceive emerging technologies to explain their adoption experience. Affordance theory indicates that perceived benefits—and goals and constraints—depend on the interaction between technology and the users, not on the technology alone. First, we used the literature for two purposes: first, to obtain characteristics of blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI) as emerging technologies; and second, to itemize generic goals, affordances, and constraints in adopting any supply chain technology. Next, we asked 400+ supply chain managers to select those affordances, constraints, and goals that they viewed as pertinent to their organizations’ supply chains for whichever of these three technologies they were implementing. Finally, we compared the responses across technologies for individual respondents (who selected more than one technology) and within the pool of respondents. We found that respondents who selected more than one technology made distinct selections individually for the different technologies relevant to them. The pooled responses across all respondents, however, prioritized the aggregated goals, affordances, and constraints in the same way, regardless of the technology, the organization, or the network features of the supply chain. Overall, it appears that the characteristics of the technology do not inform user expectations at the early stages of adoption. This initial disconnect—between characteristics and expectation—may explain the “inflated expectations” followed by the early “trough of disappointment” with emerging technologies in the Gartner Hype Cycle, as users focus on obtaining the same benefits for the supply chain from any new emerging technology. Only subsequent shared experiences can lead to the long “slope of enlightenment.”},

  abstract     = {We consider a periodic‐review multiproduct inventory system where customers&#39; purchasing decisions are affected by the product availabilities. Demands need to be learned on the fly, through the partial and censored feedback of customers. For this learning problem, if one ignores the inventory dynamic and treats it as a multiarmed bandit problem and directly applies some existing algorithms, for example, the upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm, the convergence can be extremely slow due to the high‐dimensionality of the policy space. We propose a UCB‐based learning framework that utilizes the sales information based on two improvement ideas. We illustrate how these two ideas can be incorporated by considering two specific systems: (1) multiproduct inventory system with stock‐out substitutions, (2) multiproduct inventory assortment problem for urban warehouses. We develop improved UCB algorithms for both systems, using the two improvements. For both systems, the algorithm can achieve a tight worst‐case convergence rate (up to a logarithmic term) on the planning horizon T $T$ . Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the improved UCB algorithms for the two systems. In the experiments, when there are more than 1000 candidate policies to choose from, the algorithms can achieve around 15 % $15\%$ average expected regret within 50 periods and continue to steadily improve as time increases.},

  abstract     = {In 2020, inventory shrinkage eroded $61.7 billion profit in the U.S. retail industry. Unfortunately, fighting inventory shrinkage to protect retailers&#39; already slim profits is challenging due to unknown shrinkage rates and invisible inventory levels. While the latter has been studied in the literature, the former has not. To deal with this challenge, we introduce two new features to the Bayesian inventory models: (1) interleaving customer and theft arrival processes that contribute to actual sales and shrinkages, respectively, and (2) learning of both inventory level and shrinkage rate. We first derive the learning formulae using the triple‐censored sales data (invisible lost sales, shrinkages, and “lost shrinkages”) and then use them to construct a POMDP (partially observable Markov decision process) model for making inventory and loss prevention decisions. For a different level of information deficiency, we analyze the model property and design heuristic order policies to capture the benefit of learning. Through a numerical study, we show that our estimated shrinkage rate converges quickly and monotonically to the actual value. For products with high shrinkage rates (5–12%), our heuristic policy can help seize 82–94% of the ideal profit retailers could earn under full information. We note that feature (1) of our model is crucial. It not only reflects the actual arrival order but also allows us to learn the unknown shrinkage rate, which, in turn, can prevent serious underordering and vicious inventory cycles and can increase the profit by 108% in some cases. Our approach thus enables both effective inventory management and early identification of ineffective loss prevention strategies, reducing shrinkage, and increasing sales and profit.},

  abstract     = {Governments and healthcare organizations increasingly pay attention to social media for handling a disease outbreak. The institutions and organizations need information support to gain insights into the situation and act accordingly. Currently, they primarily rely on ground‐level data, collecting which is a long and cumbersome process. Social media data present immense opportunities to use ground data quickly and effectively. Governments and HOs can use these data in launching rapid and speedy remedial actions. Social media data contain rich content in the form of people&#39;s reactions, calls‐for‐help, and feedback. However, in healthcare operations, the research on social media for providing information support is limited. Our study attempts to fill the gap mentioned above by investigating the relationship between the activity on social media and the quantum of the outbreak and further using content analytics to construct a model for segregating tweets. We use the case example of the COVID‐19 outbreak. The pandemic has advantages in contributing to the generalizability of results and facilitating the model&#39;s validation through data from multiple waves. The findings show that social media activity reflects the outbreak situation on the ground. In particular, we find that negative tweets posted by people during a crisis outbreak concur with the quantum of a disease outbreak. Further, we find a positive association between this relationship and increased information sharing through retweets. Building further on this insight, we propose a model using advanced analytical methods to reduce a large amount of unstructured data into four key categories—irrelevant posts, emotional outbursts, distress alarm, and relief measures. The supply‐side stakeholders (such as policy makers and humanitarian organizations) could use this information on time and optimize resources and relief packages in the right direction proactively.},

  abstract     = {Storage assets are critical for physical trading of commodities under volatile prices. State‐of‐the‐art methods for managing storage facilities such as the reoptimization heuristic (RH), which are part of commercial software, approximate a Markov Decision Process (MDP) assuming full information regarding the state and the stochastic commodity price process and hence suffer from informational inconsistencies with observed price data and structural inconsistencies with the true optimal policy, which are both components of generalization error. Focusing on spot trades, we find via an extensive backtest that this error can lead to significantly suboptimal RH policies. We develop a forward‐looking data‐driven approach (DDA) to learn policies and reduce generalization error. This approach extends standard (backward‐looking) DDA in two ways: (i) It represents historical and estimated future profits as functions of features in the training objective, which typically includes only past profits; and (ii) it enforces structural properties of the optimal policy. To elaborate, DDA trains parameters of bang‐bang and base‐stock policies, respectively, using linear‐ and mixed‐integer programs, thereby extending known DDAs that parameterize decisions as functions of features without policy structure. We backtest the performance of RH and DDA on six major commodities, employing feature selection across data from Reuters, Bloomberg, and other public data sets. DDA can improve RH on real data, with policy structure needed to realize this improvement. Our research advances the state‐of‐the‐art for storage operations and can be extended beyond spot trading to handle generalization error when also including forward trades.},

  abstract     = {The unprecedented rate at which data are being generated has led to the growth of data markets where valuable data sets are bought and sold. A salient feature of this market is that a data‐buyer (agent) is endowed with multidimensional private information, namely, her “ideal” record that she values the most and how her valuation for a given record changes as its distance from her ideal record changes. Consequently, the revenue‐maximization problem faced by a data‐seller (principal), who serves multiple buyers, is a multidimensional mechanism‐design problem, which is well recognized as being difficult to solve. Our main result in this paper is an approximation scheme that guarantees a revenue within as close a positive amount from the optimal revenue as desired. The scheme generates a posted‐price menu consisting of a set of item–price pairs—each entry in the menu consists of an item, that is, a set of records from the data set, and the price corresponding to that item. As a trade‐off, the length of the menu resulting from the scheme increases as the desired guarantee gets closer to zero. For convenience in practice, data‐sellers may want the ability to limit the length of the menu used by the scheme. To facilitate this, we extend our analysis to obtain a general approximation guarantee corresponding to a menu of any given length. We also demonstrate how the seller can exploit buyers&#39; preferences to generate intuitive and useful rules of thumb for an effective practical implementation of the scheme.},

  abstract     = {Online word‐of‐mouth studies generally assume that a product&#39;s average rating is the primary force shaping consumers’ purchase decisions and driving sales. Similarly, practitioners place more emphasis on average ratings by displaying them at more salient places than individual reviews. In contrast, emerging evidence suggests that individual reviews also affect the decision‐making of those consumers who consult both kinds of information. However, because average ratings and individual reviews are often correlated and confounded empirically, little research has attempted to disentangle their effects. To address this empirical challenge, we construct trade‐off situations in which the average ratings and top‐ranked reviews of different product options do not align with each other. We then investigate consumers’ preferences that can indirectly reveal the relative impact of average ratings versus top reviews. Through an archival analysis of a panel dataset and two laboratory experiments, we find consistent evidence for a swaying effect of individual reviews and reveal their textual content as a likely reason. These findings challenge the commonly accepted assumption of average ratings being the primary driver of consumers’ purchase decisions and suggest that consumers may not be as rational as previous literature assumed. In addition, this paper is the first to disentangle the effects of average ratings and individual reviews on consumer decision‐making and explore a possible reason for the swaying effect of individual reviews. Our paper illustrates the importance of information accessibility in consumers’ purchase decisions, and our findings offer valuable insights for product manufacturers, online retailers, and review platforms.},

  abstract     = {Overdiagnosis of breast cancer, defined as diagnosing a cancer that would otherwise not cause symptoms or death in a patient&#39;s lifetime, costs U.S. health care system over $1.2 billion annually. Overdiagnosis rates, estimated to be around 10%–40%, may be reduced if indolent breast findings can be identified and followed with noninvasive imaging rather than biopsy. However, there are no validated guidelines for radiologists to decide when to choose imaging options recognizing cancer grades and types. The aim of this study is to optimize breast cancer diagnostic decisions based on cancer types using a large‐scale finite‐horizon Markov decision process (MDP) model with 4.6 million states to help reduce overdiagnosis. We prove the optimality of a divide‐and‐search algorithm that relies on tight upper bounds on the optimal decision thresholds to find an exact optimal solution. We project the high‐dimensional MDP onto two lower dimensional MDPs and obtain feasible upper bounds on the optimal decision thresholds. We use real data from two private mammography databases and demonstrate our model performance through a previously validated simulation model that has been used by the policy makers to set the national screening guidelines in the United States. We find that a decision‐analytical framework optimizing diagnostic decisions while accounting for breast cancer types has a strong potential to improve the quality of life and alleviate the immense costs of overdiagnosis. Our model leads to a 20 % $20\%$ reduction in overdiagnosis on the screening population, which translates into an annual savings of approximately $300 million for the U.S. health care system.},

  abstract     = {Reduction in hospital readmissions has long been identified as a target area for healthcare public policy reform by the US government. In October 2012, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) established the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) program, which requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to reduce payments to hospitals with excess readmissions. Even with recent changes in ACA, the HRRP program is still in place. In this study, we empirically examine the effectiveness of the introduction of the HRRP on hospital readmission and mortality rates. We observe that, in general, the introduction of the HRRP has significantly reduced readmission rates. However, the introduction of the HRRP does not necessarily decrease the mortality rates, which highlights the unintended consequences of public policy. What is more interesting is that the impact of the HRRP is heterogeneous in hospital size and racial groups. First, after the HRRP introduction, large hospitals have experienced a greater reduction in readmission rates than small hospitals. Second, after the introduction of the HRRP, the zip code regions with a higher percentage of Hispanic and African‐American populations have experienced a larger reduction in readmission rates. These results contribute to both theory and practice in public policy and provide important and nuanced policy implications for evaluating the effectiveness of the HRRP. Policy‐makers also need to pay close attention to these results for future implementations of policies similar to the HRRP.},

  abstract     = {The requirement of social distancing during the COVID‐19 pandemic has presented significant challenges for high‐rise buildings, which heavily rely on elevators for vertical transportation. In particular, the need for social distancing has reduced elevator capacity typically by at least two‐thirds or as much as over 90 % $90\%$ of the normal amount. This reduction is a serious concern, as reduced elevator capacities cause large queues to build up in lobbies, which makes social distancing difficult and results in large wait times. The objective of this study is to safely manage the elevator queues by proposing simple, technology‐free interventions that drastically reduce the waiting time and length of lobby queues. We use mathematical modeling, epidemiological expertise, and simulation to design and evaluate our interventions. The key idea is to explicitly or implicitly group passengers that are going to the same floor into the same elevator as much as possible. In the Cohorting intervention, we attempt to find passengers going to the same floor as the first person in the queue. In the Queue Splitting intervention, we create a different queue for different groups of floors. Based on simulation and analytical findings, Cohorting and Queue Splitting can significantly reduce queue length and wait time, while also maintaining safety from viral transmission in otherwise crowded elevators, building lobbies, and entrances. These interventions are generally accessible for many buildings since they do not require programming the elevators, and rely on only using signage and/or a queue manager to guide passengers.},

In this study, we use eight states that did not implement the orders as a control group and six neighboring states that did implement them as a treatment group to estimate the effectiveness of stay‐at‐home orders. We find that although residents in both groups were staying at home even before the implementation of any order, these orders reduced the number of new COVID‐19 cases by 7.6%. To understand the mechanisms behind these results, we compare the mobility of residents in the control and treatment groups over time. We find stay‐at‐home orders significantly reduced residents&#39; mobility at grocery stores and pharmacies, transit stations, workplaces, and retail and recreation locations. The results of this study are useful to policymakers in conducting cost–benefit analyses of back‐to‐work plans versus stay‐at‐home policies and deciding whether to implement, extend, lift, or reimplement stay‐at‐home orders amid a pandemic such as COVID‐19. Our results are also useful to researchers because we highlight the importance of correcting for potential selection issues. As we illustrate in this study, ignoring potential selection issues would lead to the wrong conclusion that stay‐at‐home orders increase the number of new COVID‐19 cases.},

  abstract     = {Parallel imports of gray products across markets are a worldwide concern for manufacturers. Extant research has focused on parallel imports of regular goods that do not provide status value. In this paper, we investigate parallel imports of conspicuously consumed status goods. We consider a manufacturer who directly sells a status product to consumers in two markets that value the product differently and a gray marketer that can import the product across markets. Our analysis shows that, though parallel imports decrease a manufacturer&#39;s profit from selling regular goods, it can increase their profit from selling status goods. Furthermore, the manufacturer decides whether to use the same or different aesthetic design for products across markets. With the same design, the gray and manufacturer‐authorized products look identical, while different designs make them distinguishable, which affects their status value. We find that parallel imports benefit the manufacturer in a broader range of situations under the different‐design strategy, whereas the same‐design strategy increases the gray marketer&#39;s profit. When the two markets are sufficiently similar, the manufacturer uses the same design to induce parallel imports. When the two markets are sufficiently different, the manufacturer uses different designs to either deter parallel imports or improve their profit while competing with the gray marketer.},

As a more informed NOK is more likely to consent to tissue donation, we introduced the delivery of two alternative videos that discuss the benefits of donation as part of the donation request. One was an animated, freely available video developed by the US Health Resources and Services Administration, and the other was a customized interview‐based video made in partnership with the Nevada Donor Network. We focused our analysis on studying the effect on White donation rates; many historical factors (in the United States) make the kind of simple, minimal intervention we implemented unlikely to be sufficient to encourage non‐White donation. We found in the field experiment that NOKs were more likely to donate if they viewed either video but that the two videos were not statistically different in their effect. As those who viewed a video may have been predisposed to donate, we additionally performed an online experiment that does not suffer from this endogeneity concern. We found results parallel to those in the field, and based on written comments by participants, we found suggestive evidence that the informational content in the videos was the mechanism that led to increased donation willingness and not emotional connectivity. We have identified a cheap and easy‐to‐implement intervention that could improve tissue availability across the nation.},

Grocery retailers need to understand the impact of pandemic conditions on their operations, but the literature has not modeled and analyzed this issue. We bridge this gap through economic models that consider the documented changes in the customers&#39; shopping behavior during the COVID‐19 pandemic, including less frequent in‐store shopping and bulk‐shopping tendency. We capture the impact of occupancy limitation guidelines on grocery retailers&#39; service capacity, customers&#39; shopping behavior, and, consequently, on the retailers&#39; store traffic and profit. We find that though store occupancy limitations reduce the in‐store foot traffic (which helps with curbing the disease spread), interestingly, they do not necessarily result in a profit decline. Under occupancy limitations and when the retailer offers the delivery or curbside pickup service, our analyses highlight the externality impact of online customers on the shopping behavior of in‐store customers. When the retailer adds the delivery service, such externalities may increase the store traffic (higher infection risk inside the grocery store) and reduce the retailer&#39;s profit. When the retailer adds the curbside pickup instead, it has more control over the impact of externalities, which helps in lowering the store traffic and increasing the profit. Our results offer valuable insights into how retailers should regard occupancy limitations and health safety measures. Our results also highlight conditions under which various operating modes may help retailers reduce infection risk and achieve higher profit.},

This paper utilizes queueing‐game‐theoretic models to study how testing facilities should set scheduling and pricing policies to incentivize individuals to test, with the goal to identify the most cases of infection. Our findings are as follows. First, under the first‐in‐first‐out discipline (FIFO), the common practice of making testing free attracts the most testees but may not catch the most cases. Charging a testing fee may surprisingly increase case detection. Second, even though people who show symptoms are more likely to carry the virus, prioritizing these individuals over asymptomatic ones (another common practice) may let more cases go undetected than FIFO testing does. Third, we characterize the optimal scheduling and pricing policy. To maximize case detection, testing can be made free but one should also (partially) prioritize individuals with symptoms when testing demand is high and switch to (partially) prioritize the asymptomatic when testing demand is moderately low.},

  abstract     = {As software‐as‐a‐service (SaaS) becomes an increasingly popular business model, free‐trial acquisition, which allows prospective consumers to explore the service at no charge, also becomes a norm for SaaS companies. However, empirical research on the role of marketing communications, consumers’ free‐trial usage, and their interactions is still lacking. This study utilizes the granular data from a leading SaaS firm that provides prospects with free trials and examines the impact of and interactions among various marketing touchpoints, different types of message content, and the frequency and variety of free‐trial usage on consumers’ subscription decisions. Regarding advertising effectiveness, this study finds that consumer‐initiated touchpoints with all message content enhance conversion, but the firm‐initiated touchpoints conveying persuasive messages discourage conversion. Meanwhile, free‐trial usage does not always follow the old adage “the more, the merrier.” When usage is unpacked as frequency and variety, more frequent free‐trial usage encourages conversion, but exploring a greater variety of software leads to a lower conversion rate. For the focal firm, advertising and free‐trial usage attenuate each other in leading to conversion, except for the persuasive messages sent to frequent users and featured messages to variety‐seeking users. The robustness of these findings is tested, and two simulations demonstrate how the model helps firms determine when to contact consumers with additional display ads or emails. This research provides guidance to SaaS managers on the impact of advertising, free‐trial usage, and the interplay between both on conversion, which facilitates decisions on marketing strategies and resource allocations.},

Lack of health insurance is a leading contributor to emergency department (ED) visits from the uninsured. Using a natural experiment from Massachusetts, we follow previously uninsured individuals over time—both before and after the implementation of universal healthcare—to study the effects of insurance availability on their healthcare seeking behavior. We find that the availability of health insurance has a significant impact on the type of healthcare sought by the previously uninsured. Specifically, individuals are less likely to continue visiting the ED and instead more likely to choose hospital inpatient and outpatient services. We find that frequent fliers and patients with chronic conditions, who are both known to account for a substantial share of healthcare costs, exhibit heterogeneity in this behavior. Finally, we examine the effect of the policy on quality of care, as measured by short‐term ED revisits. Although the overall revisit rates remain unchanged, frequent ED users and chronic patients experience a decline in short‐term ED revisits. With key features of the Affordable Care Act being frequently criticized for repeal, understanding how these changes influence patient choice and quality of care is significantly policy relevant.},

  abstract     = {New product and service introductions require careful joint planning of production and marketing campaigns. Consequently, they typically utilize multiple information channels to stimulate customer awareness and resultant word‐of‐mouth (WOM), availing of standard budget allocation tools. By contrast, when enacting strategic allocation decisions—which must align with other management imperatives—dividing expenditures across channels is far more complex. To this end, we formulate a multichannel demand model for new products (or services), amenable to analysis of inter‐ and intrachannel interaction patterns and with the WOM process, without building such interactions directly into the modeling framework. To address the notorious complexity of media planning over time, we propose a novel decomposition of the multichannel dynamic programming problem into two distinct “tiers”: the strategic tier addresses how to allocate total expenditure across channels, while the tactical tier studies how to allocate the channel‐specific budgets (determined in the strategic tier) over time periods. This decomposition enables optimal media strategies to sidestep the curse of dimensionality and renders the model pragmatically estimable. Strategic tier analysis suggests a variety of novel insights, primarily that funds should not be allocated based on (relative) channel effectiveness alone but also systematically aligned with WOM generation. Specifically, each channel can face a “chasm‐crossing” threshold, abruptly transitioning the adoption process from lead‐users to mass‐market penetration. Moreover, the model provides actionable managerial insights into when, and which, channel interactions are synergistic versus substitutive. Specifically, a channel&#39;s interactions are governed primarily by its own “leverage” (potential demand impact) and the WOM‐based demand “momentum” (market penetration) it can generate, affording a novel basis for channel typography and firm action. The modeling framework is illustrated by examining camera sales for two media channels (free‐standing inserts and radio) and their effects over 28 months. We use Bayesian machinery to estimate a highly flexible diffusion‐based model, along with forecasts, media plans, and both theoretical and empirically‐based qualitative insights.},

Due to canonical results establishing the optimality of stationary value functions and policies for infinite‐horizon dynamic programs, the literature has largely focused on approximation architectures that are stationary over time. In a departure from this literature, we apply a nonstationary approximation architecture to an infinite‐dimensional linear programming formulation of the stochastic dynamic programs. We solve the resulting problems using a finite‐horizon approximation. Such finite‐horizon approximations are common in the theoretical analysis of infinite‐horizon linear programs, but have not been considered in the approximate linear programming literature. We illustrate the approach on a rolling‐horizon capacity allocation problem using an affine approximation architecture. We obtain three main results. First, nonstationary approximations can substantially improve upper bounds on the optimal revenue. Second, the upper bounds from the finite‐horizon approximation monotonically decrease as the horizon length increases, and converge to the upper bound from the infinite‐horizon approximation. Finally, the improvement does not come at the expense of tractability, as the resulting ALPs admit compact representations and can be solved efficiently. The resulting approximations also produce strong heuristic policies and significantly reduce optimality gaps in numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {E‐commerce supply chains and their members face risks from cyber‐attacks. Consumers who purchase goods online also risk having their private information stolen. Thus, businesses are investing to improve cyber‐security at a nontrivial cost. In this paper, we conduct a Stackelberg game‐theoretical analysis. In the basic model, we first derive the equilibrium pricing and cyber‐security level decisions in the e‐commerce supply chain. Based on real‐world practices, we then explore whether governments should impose cyber‐security penalty schemes. Our findings show that when the government is characterized by having sufficiently high emphasis on consumer surplus, implementing the penalty scheme is beneficial to social welfare. Then, we extend the analysis to examine how adopting systems security enhancing technologies (such as blockchain) will affect the government&#39;s choice of imposing penalty. We uncover that when it is beneficial to have government&#39;s penalty scheme, the technology benefit‐to‐cost ratio is a critical factor that governs whether the optimal penalty will be lower or higher with the adoption of systems security enhancing technologies. To generate more insights, we conduct further analyses for various extended modeling cases (e.g., with alliance, competition, and the defense‐level dependent penalty scheme) and find that our main results remain robust. One important insight we have uncovered in this study is that imposing government penalty schemes on cyber‐security issues may do more harm than good; while once it is beneficial to implement, the government should charge the heaviest possible fine. This finding may explain why in the real world, governments basically always adopt a polarized strategy, that is, either do not impose penalty or impose a super heavy penalty, on cyber‐security issues.},

  abstract     = {The Covid‐19 pandemic is triggering several supply chain disruptions that have a tremendous impact on firms’ activities. Consequently, firms have pushed suppliers to develop their disruption orientation through the exchange of information and collaboration with the aim to enhance their own performance. Although this is important from the industry perspective, relationships among the focal firm&#39;s disruption orientation, the suppliers’ disruption orientation, and the focal firm&#39;s performances have not been investigated in the literature. Hence, in order to fill this important gap, we investigate both (i) how the suppliers’ disruption orientation helps translate the focal firm&#39;s disruption orientation into environmental and economic performances and (ii) how the supplier ecocentricity (ability to learn from nontraditional stakeholders) is related to these relationships. In order to analyze these issues, we draw upon the dynamic capabilities, relational view, and stakeholder resource‐based view theories. Our results indicate that the focal firm&#39;s disruption orientation creates a positive association between its suppliers’ disruption orientation and its own environmental and economic performances. Further, our results reveal that the association between the firm&#39;s disruption orientation and environmental performance is not necessarily direct and occurs through the suppliers’ disruption orientation. Our study also reveals that the positive association between the focal firm&#39;s disruption orientation and environmental performance through suppliers’ disruption orientation is stronger under medium and high levels of suppliers’ ecocentricity. Our results provide useful managerial insights for supply chain stakeholders that could help in managing disruption orientation, especially during and after a pandemic.},

Therefore, after a new product generation enters the market, its sales often exhibit a declining pattern, which renders traditional diffusion models unsuitable for characterizing consumers’ decisions on upgrade timing. In this study, we propose an Exponential‐Decay proportional hazard model (Expo‐Decay model) to predict consumers’ time to product upgrade. The Expo‐Decay model is parsimonious, interpretable, and performs better than do existing models. We apply the Expo‐Decay model and three extensions to study consumers’ upgrade behavior for a sports video game series. Empirical results reveal that consumers’ previous adoption and usage patterns can help predict their timing to upgrades. In particular, we find that consumers who have adopted the immediate past generation and those who play games from previous generations more often tend to upgrade earlier, whereas those who specialize in a small subset of game modes tend to upgrade later. Further, we find that complex extensions to the Expo‐Decay model do not lead to better prediction performance than does the baseline Expo‐Decay model, whereas a time‐variant extension that updates the values of covariates over time outperforms the baseline model with static data.},

  abstract     = {This study posits that executive attention can significantly influence the impacts of customer‐facing electronic business (e‐Business) systems on firm performance. Using the exploration–exploitation perspective (EEP) as an overarching theoretical framework, and the theoretical lens of attention‐based view (ABV), we develop an integrated model to provide insights into the impacts of customer‐facing e‐Business systems on firm performance. We categorize the capabilities of customer‐facing e‐Business systems into e‐Transaction and e‐CRM (customer relationship management) capabilities as exploitation and exploration capabilities, respectively. Further, following ABV, we conceptualize focused and expansive attentions as two different types of executive attention that also incorporate exploitation and exploration orientations. We hypothesize e‐Transaction and e‐CRM capabilities to have nuanced interactive effects with focused and expansive attention on firm performance measured using return on sales and Tobin&#39;s Q. We use a panel dataset with 484 firm‐year observations from 180 firms to test our hypotheses. We estimate our models using a two‐step generalized method of moments (GMM) approach to address issues relating to endogeneity, heteroskedasticity, and serial correlation, and to produce efficient estimates. The results provide broad support for the hypotheses and are robust to the alternative measurement of dependent variables, alternative econometric model specification, and potential endogeneity from omitted covariates. The integrated model developed and empirically validated in this study serves to provide a deeper understanding of the impacts of customer‐facing e‐Business systems on firm performance. The study also highlights the need for dual attention processes on the part of senior executives to fully realize the benefits offered by these systems.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the need of small and medium‐sized hospitals to improve their platelet inventory management and achieve best practices, we consider an inventory system for a perishable product with a three‐period shelf life over a finite horizon. In the system, the regular replenishment in each cycle is supplemented by an inventory adjustment opportunity in mid‐cycle involving expedited orders and returns. We show that an optimal regular replenishment policy is an ( s, S, S ( x )) policy. Namely, if the initial net inventory x is below the threshold s , it is optimal to place a regular order to raise the inventory to a state‐independent target S ; otherwise, raise the inventory to a state‐dependent target S ( x ). We also show that the mid‐cycle inventory adjustment policy is a control‐band policy with two thresholds. If the mid‐cycle net inventory is above the upper threshold, it is optimal to return the inventory in excess of that threshold to a central blood bank; if the mid‐cycle net inventory is below the lower threshold, it is optimal to expedite replenishment up to that threshold; otherwise, do nothing. If non‐fresh platelets are used in the expedited order, we can obtain closed‐form expressions for the optimal policy parameters. When fresh platelets are used for the expedited order, we apply anti‐multimodularity techniques to establish structural properties of the optimal policy to guide practice and reveal the substitution relationship between the replenishment quantity and the existing inventory of various ages. These structural properties also hold for the case of general shelf lives. Our numerical study shows that the more flexible and adaptive policy proposed in this research outperforms those studied in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Two‐sided platforms have become omnipresent. In this context, firms compete not only for customers but also for flexible self‐scheduling workers who can work for multiple platforms. We consider a setting where two‐sided platforms simultaneously choose prices and wages to compete on both sides of the market. We assume that customers and workers each follow an endogenous generalized attraction model that accounts for network effects. In our model, the behavior of an agent depends not only on the price or wage set by the platforms, but also on the strategic interactions among agents on both sides of the market. We show that a unique equilibrium exists and that it can be computed using a tatônnement scheme. The proof technique for the competition between two‐sided platforms is not a simple extension of the traditional (one‐sided) setting and involves different arguments. Armed with this result, we study the impact of coopetition between two‐sided platforms, that is, the business strategy of cooperating with competitors. Motivated by recent practices in the ride‐sharing industry, we analyze a setting where two competing platforms engage in a profit sharing contract by introducing a new joint service. We show that a well‐designed profit sharing contract (e.g., under Nash bargaining) will benefit every party in the market (platforms, riders, and drivers), especially when the platforms are facing intensive competition on the demand side. However, if the platforms are facing intensive competition on the supply side, the coopetition partnership may hurt the profit of at least one platform.},

This is why the United Nations has formed clusters to facilitate information and resource exchange among humanitarian organizations. Yet, coordination failures in prior disasters raise questions as to the effectiveness of the cluster approach in coordinating relief efforts. To better understand barriers to coordination, we developed a grounded theory and augmented the theory with an agent‐based simulation. Our theory discerns a cluster lead&#39;s roles of facilitating coordination, but also investing in its own ground operations. We find that specifically serving such a dual role impairs swift trust and consequent coordination among cluster members. The additional simulation findings generalize the detrimental effect of the cluster lead&#39;s dual role versus a pure facilitator role and specify it against various boundary conditions.},

  abstract     = {Innovation contests within firms offer the potential to tap latent employee expertise across the organization and expand innovation beyond the core R&amp;D teams. Still, firms undertaking an internal contest, unlike the more commonly studied external contests, incur significant opportunity costs when employees divert their efforts toward the contest (and away from their routine work). Managing this key challenge forms the focus of the current study, with the overarching question being How should firms design internal contests? Motivated by fieldwork in electronics companies, we develop an application‐driven model that explicitly captures the fundamental trade‐off between incurring greater opportunity cost (of lost routine work) and increasing participation and contest effort. Analysis of our model demonstrates that for problem types that do not need significant effort for solution generation, the optimal contest reward is non‐monotonic in both the problem uncertainty and the wage rate of the participating employees. In case of more complex problems that require contestants to exert some minimal effort, the firm uses the reward decision to restrict participation and to ensure that contestants exert the required effort. In this case, the optimal reward increases with problem uncertainty, thereby incentivizing more contestants to enter. While the firm can attempt to mitigate the loss due to opportunity costs by organizing internal contests during employee leisure time, we identify conditions under which it is still optimal to organize these contests during working hours.},

Because these sellers vary in quality, it is often unclear what type of seller is more motivated to participate in diversion. We develop an analytical model to demonstrate how vertically differentiated sellers make diversion decisions responding to an unauthorized dealer under unique circumstances not considered by previous research. The model demonstrates that when diversion occurs, the low‐quality seller can actually earn a greater profit than the high‐quality seller. Furthermore, a higher quality differential can lead to an overall profit loss for the high‐quality seller when both sellers divert. The sellers will divert products to the competing dealer if and only if they are sufficiently similar to each other. The low‐quality seller has an incentive to divert more units in general, and is motivated to divert alone when the quality differential is not too high. Additionally, changes in vertical differentiation have nonmonotonic effects on the sellers. Overall, the results establish seller vertical differentiation as a new key variable in analyzing product diversion and demonstrate its unique consequences for the authorized sellers and the unauthorized dealer.},

  abstract     = {We investigate a server&#39;s best queue disclosure strategy in a single‐server service system with an uncertain quality level (which is assumed to be binary). We consider this problem from the perspective of a Bayesian persuasion game. The server first commits to a possibly mixed strategy stating the probability that the queue length will be revealed to customers on their arrival given a realized quality level. The service quality level is then realized, and the server&#39;s corresponding queue‐disclosure action is observed by customers, who then update their beliefs regarding service quality and decide whether to join the service system. We reformulate the server&#39;s decision problem as looking for the best Bayes‐plausible distribution of posterior beliefs regarding service quality. We demonstrate that the maximal expected effective arrival rate, as a function of the prior belief, can be graphed as the upper envelope of all convex combinations of any two arbitrary points on the two effective arrival rate functions of the revealed and concealed queues. We show that when the market size is sufficiently small (large), the server always conceals (reveals) the queue, regardless of the realized service quality. Numerically, we find that in a medium‐sized market, the server&#39;s optimal commitment strategy is often hybrid or mixed, that is, randomizing queue concealment and revelation. We also extend our analysis to a situation in which the server aims to maximize social welfare. We show that under certain conditions, it is always beneficial for the welfare‐maximizing social planner to randomize queue concealment and revelation, regardless of the market size.},

The paper first analyzes secondary data and the results of 24 in‐depth interviews in order to develop an analytical framework, which is then complemented by a system dynamics model to explore the complexity and interactions among stakeholders in SAR operations. The study shows that the death toll at sea can be reduced by enhancing cooperation among stakeholders by providing legal migration pathways under certain conditions and by engaging in more effective migrant detection and interception at sea. Lastly, raising potential migrants’ awareness about the risk of death during the sea crossing should be seen as an additional measure, while SAR activities should be maintained to prevent loss of life at sea.},

  abstract     = {Business rivals often collaborate on specific aspects of their operations in order to achieve cost efficiency. To better understand and manage such an operational collaboration, we formulate a multi‐stage duopoly competition model to study the strategic and welfare implications of a cost‐reducing cooperation between competing firms. Without any additional agreement beyond the collaborative effort in deterministic cost reduction, we characterize intuitive conditions under which there exists a unique equilibrium for the operational collaboration, where the high‐cost firm inputs more effort. Furthermore, the equilibrium cost reduction would benefit both firms when they have similar costs and/or their products have small substitutability. Moreover, such a pure operational collaboration never hurts consumer surplus. We then consider the effect of facilitating agreements and find that, with a properly designed unit transfer payment, the competition may be softened so that both firms are willing to collaborate. However, consumer surplus may decrease as a consequence. Finally, we assume that firms could receive signals of some random shock on the cost reduction process and examine the resulting Bayesian game. If the random shock is on the cost reduction fraction, then firms&#39; equilibrium efforts could be independent of the random signal. If, however, the random shock is on the effort, then we apply simplifying assumptions and use special stochastic orders to capture the impact of signal variability on firms&#39; effort levels. Our findings provide useful managerial insights into the underlying drivers of an operational collaboration between rivals.},

  abstract     = {Human decision making in the newsvendor context has been analyzed intensively in laboratory experiments, where various decision biases have been identified. However, it is unclear whether the biases also exist in practice. We analyze the ordering decisions of a manufacturer who faces a multiproduct newsvendor problem with an aggregate service‐level constraint. We find that the manufacturer broadly exhibits the same biases as subjects in the laboratory and is prone to another bias that has not been identified before, that is, group aggregation. The bias can be attributed to the multi‐product problem of the manufacturer, and refers to the observation that the service levels are not optimized for individual products, but rather for product groups. Our data allow us to analyze the performance of a manufacturer in detail and we find that target service levels are achieved effectively, but not efficiently. We provide rationales for the manufacturer&#39;s ordering behavior, discuss managerial implications, and quantify the financial benefits of debiasing ordering decisions. Author Video},

  abstract     = {Consider a single‐product, make‐to‐stock, risk‐averse company that manages its finished goods inventory by a basestock policy. Item demand is modeled as a Poisson process, and unit production time is modeled as an exponential random variable. Annual cost is equal to the sum over one year of the inventory‐holding and back‐ordering costs. The company wants to minimize the annual cost conditional value‐at‐risk by an appropriate basestock selection called the optimal basestock. After offering evidence that the optimal basestock is analytically intractable, we derive a closed‐form approximation of the optimal basestock. In two independent simulation experiments, we found that the average penalty for using the approximation is less than 1%; we believe this accuracy would be acceptable for practical applications. Leveraging the approximation&#39;s accuracy and simplicity, we establish several results that may serve as predictors of the company&#39;s appropriate basestock adjustments to changes in operational, economic, and risk aversion parameters. We illustrate how our research results were successfully applied in a Fortune 10 energy company.

  abstract     = {Hunger occurs in all locations around the globe, from developing to developed countries. In fact, there were over 37 million food insecure individuals (those without access to consistent nutritious food) in the United States in 2018, and this number increased in recent years due to the COVID pandemic. In many countries, food banks are used to consolidate food donations from individuals or government agencies and then provide that food to local partner agencies (such as food pantries and soup kitchens), who distribute it to food insecure individuals. As nonprofit humanitarian organizations, food banks strive to achieve geographic equity in their food distribution, so one area (or county) is not favored over others. However, food banks also want to maximize food distribution with their limited budgets. This equitable distribution versus cost balancing act is made even more challenging since food banks experience extreme variability in both the supply (donations) of food and partner agencies&#39; capacity to deliver food to the food insecure. Our paper focuses on how mobile pantry programs, additional food bank storage capacity, and improved partner agency capacity can be utilized to address this supply and distribution capacity variability while considering food expiration times. Mobile pantry programs allow food banks to distribute food directly to the food insecure by sending their own trucks and employees to locations where food is most needed. Although all three of these approaches can be helpful, our results show that mobile pantries are a more effective approach to achieve high equity levels. This is especially true in the case of produce with relatively short expiration times. We also find that utilizing mobile pantry programs can increase equitable partner agency distribution considerably, because even small amounts of mobile pantry distribution in under‐served areas allow for more equitable partner agency distribution in areas with available partner agency distribution capacity. Our research is based on data from our partner food bank, but our modeling and extensive sensitivity analysis should be applicable to many food banks with a similar collection and distribution structure.},

  abstract     = {We consider an order allocation game in which a manufacturer sources from two suppliers due to supply capacity limitations and allocates uneven orders to take advantage of incremental quantity discount. Laboratory experiments are conducted to examine empirical decisions by all three members in this dual sourcing channel. We observe that the supplier who receives large orders mostly agrees to supply; however, the supplier who receives small orders frequently refuses to supply. Consequently, the manufacturer experiences severe supply shortage, which hurts its profit and the supply chain efficiency. We develop behavioral models to explain the empirical decisions, and find that fairness concerns of the small‐order supplier cause supply rejections and shortages. To mitigate this behavioral supply risk, we apply the modeling results to design a subsidy mechanism and conduct a validation experiment. The experiment shows that the proposed subsidy mechanism successfully reduces supply rejections, and that the channel efficiency is significantly enhanced at no additional cost to the manufacturer. The study demonstrates the viability of the behavioral mechanism design approach in addressing issues in empirical decision‐making, and offers insights for manufacturers to manage asymmetric sourcing with two suppliers.},

Every player in an m $m$ ‐attribute game is endowed with a vector of m $m$ attributes that can be combined in an additive fashion; that is, if players form a coalition, the attribute vector of this coalition is obtained by adding the attributes of its members. Another fundamental feature of m $m$ ‐attribute games is that their characteristic function is defined by a continuous attribute function π $\pi$ —the value of a coalition depends only on evaluation of π $\pi$ on the attribute vector possessed by the coalition, and not on the identity of coalition members. This class of games encompasses many well‐known examples, such as queueing games and economic lot‐sizing games. We believe that by studying attribute function π $\pi$ and its properties, instead of specific examples of games, we are able to develop a common platform for studying different situations and obtain more general results with wider applicability. In this paper, we first show the relationship between nonemptiness of the core and identification of attribute prices that can be used to calculate core allocations. We then derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which every m $m$ ‐attribute game embedded in attribute function π $\pi$ has a nonempty core, and a set of necessary and sufficient conditions that π $\pi$ should satisfy for the embedded game to be convex. We also develop several sufficient conditions for nonemptiness of the core of m $m$ ‐attribute games, which are easier to check, and show how to find a core allocation when these conditions hold. Finally, we establish natural connections between TU games and m $m$ ‐attribute games.},

  abstract     = {Besides using earmark budget to support farmer cost subsidies, governments in many developing countries use minimum support price (MSP) as an alternative subsidy scheme to (i) safeguard farmers&#39; incomes against vagaries in crop price and (ii) ensure sufficient crop production. Among different MSP schemes, we focus on the credit‐based MSP scheme under which a government will not take any possession of a crop; instead, it will credit farmers if the prevailing market price is below the prespecified MSP. In this paper, we consider a market consisting of infinitesimally small, rational, and strategic farmers (with heterogeneous production costs) who face market and yield uncertainties. Our equilibrium analysis reveals that (i) although both cost subsidy and MSP induce more production, cost subsidy leads to a higher crop production than MSP; (ii) MSP improves farmer&#39;s and consumer&#39;s surpluses; however, cost subsidy improves consumer&#39;s surplus but it can decrease farmer&#39;s surplus, which is unexpected; (iii) although both programs achieve the same optimal net value (i.e., sum of farmer&#39;s and consumer&#39;s surpluses minus shortage cost and expenditure), MSP always offers higher farmer&#39;s surplus than cost subsidy; and (iv) it is beneficial to invest only in cost subsidy, in both cost subsidy and MSP, and only in MSP, when the budget availability is low, moderate, and high, respectively, so that the net surplus (i.e., sum of farmer&#39;s and consumer&#39;s surpluses less the shortage cost) is also maximized along with the net value generated being maximized.},

Three nontherapeutic policies—mobility restrictions (MR), securing social interactions (SSI), and a combination of both (MR + SSI)—are compared in terms of effectiveness and efficiency in preventing infections and saving lives. The costs associated with these policies are economic as well as operational. The objective is to select the lowest cost policy that is the least sensitive to the cited contextual factors. In many ways, our model applies to the Covid‐19 pandemic in its prevaccine phase. Our study shows the significant influence of popular discontent on epidemic control policies. We show that in contrast to the standard delayed peak strategy, which seeks to delay and flatten the epidemic peak, there is an alternative strategy, counter to conventional wisdom, which consists of accelerating the onset of the epidemic peak. Although the delayed peak strategy is contingent on popular neutrality, the advanced peak strategy results from popular discontent as a corollary of a cost‐centered approach. We also find that social fatigue does not affect the social cost much but, in contrast to the controlled scenarios without social fatigue, it amplifies the peak of infections. In this context, the inclusive policy that incorporates MR + SSI mitigates the negative impact of social fatigue, although it comes at the cost of tighter restrictions than either of the exclusive policies. We conclude that, as opposed to popular discontent, social fatigue should be disregarded for the sake of greater effectiveness and efficiency in infection and death prevention. Our results can be used by policymakers to allocate resources appropriately in MR, SSI, or both and to build treatment capability.},

This paper argues that effective management of this trade‐off requires a deep understanding of the process through which consumers perceive, evaluate, and respond to return policies that vary in terms of leniency across five key dimensions identified in the literature: monetary, time, effort, scope, and exchange. To this end, we theorize on a cognitive process model and empirically test the model using randomized experiments with diverse consumer samples. By viewing each of the five leniency dimensions as returns service design levers, we examine (1) how a retailer&#39;s return policy leniency across different levers impacts a consumer&#39;s intention to purchase from a retailer, through the influence of leniency on the perceptions regarding returns service quality and transaction costs that jointly form perceived returns service value, and (2) how different leniency levers are compared in terms of their impacts. We find significant heterogeneity in the effectiveness of different leniency levers in influencing consumers&#39; purchase intentions through increased perceived service quality, reduced perceived transaction costs, and subsequently increased perceived service value.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have seen robust growth in online medical consultation platforms. These platforms allow patients to access various healthcare services provided by doctors (e.g., health assessment, diagnosis, consultation, and supervision). In China, many such platforms allow patients to give small monetary gifts to doctors as an expression of gratitude. The implicit assumption is that expensive gifts influence doctors&#39; medical service and generate conflicts of interest but small gifts do not. However, there is little empirical evidence to support this assumption. In order to fill this gap in the literature, our study investigates whether small gifts from patients impact the quality of service provided to the gift‐givers (i.e., direct effect) and the nongivers (i.e., spillover effect). We examine three aspects of online medical service quality: (i) patient wait time, (ii) the amount of information in doctors&#39; responses, and (iii) the degree of emotional support in doctors&#39; responses. We find that despite the gifts&#39; negligible monetary value, doctors who receive gifts do reciprocate to the gift‐givers by providing them with more timely responses and greater emotional support. Furthermore, after receiving the small gifts, doctors may be slower in responding to nongivers and offer them less emotional support. We also investigate whether these effects (both direct and spillover effects) vary with doctors&#39; backgrounds, including their professional experience and geographic location. Our findings have both theoretical and practical implications for patients, online medical consultation platforms, and healthcare policy makers.},

We consider a distribution channel with a manufacturer and a retailer. The manufacturer produces two products and sells them either separately or in the form of bundles to end consumers through a downstream retailer. Our analysis reveals that a manufacturer may have a stronger incentive to bundle when selling through a downstream retailer than when selling directly to consumers. Bundling serves as a tool for the manufacturer to reduce the harm associated with the well‐documented double marginalization problem. Therefore, our paper provides a new rationale to the bundling literature, which has traditionally focused on the role of bundling in helping a firm price‐discriminate consumers or gain competitive advantages against peer firms. Further, contrary to the conventional wisdom that asymmetries in bundled products hurt a firm&#39;s bundling incentive, we show that asymmetries can strengthen the manufacturer&#39;s incentive to bundle in a distribution channel. We also find that, as the marginal production costs decrease, a decentralized channel structure is more likely to lead to manufacturer bundling than a centralized one. Our results help explain the prevalence of bundling, especially digital products, in practice.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by several industry examples, we study the interaction between a technology provider introducing a new technology and downstream manufacturers adopting the new technology into their products. The manufacturers, once decided on their adoption timing, both cooperate in making demand‐boosting investments to promote the technology and compete in price in the product market. Our main objective is to explore the important question of how the technology provider manipulates manufacturers’ adoption timing. We develop a stylized continuous‐time multi‐stage game‐theoretic model with one technology provider and two downstream manufacturers, and derive pure‐strategy equilibria for the manufacturers and the technology provider. We find that in the absence of the technology provider&#39;s intervention, in equilibrium there is simultaneous adoption when the market competition is relatively mild, and sequential adoption otherwise. In particular, under the sequential‐adoption equilibrium, the second manufacturer strategically postpones adoption in order to freeride on the first manufacturer&#39;s demand‐boosting investment. We show that manufacturers’ equilibrium adoption timing is not always in line with the technology provider&#39;s interest. To align these different preferences, we suggest that when the competition is in a relatively mild region, the technology provider can make an initial investment to incentivize both manufacturers to adopt the technology early, whereas when the competition is relatively intense, an exclusive period should instead be offered to one manufacturer to keep the other from adopting the technology early. Interestingly, these self‐interested interventions often improve the efficiency of the system. Finally, we show that our main findings remain robust when we assume that the effect of manufacturers’ demand‐boosting investments decreases over time, or when we allow the technology provider to optimize over the technology&#39;s licensing fee.},

  abstract     = {Substitution is a commonly adopted strategy for matching the demand mix by appropriately allocating the supplies. The recent development of information technology has allowed firms to easily swap products to meet consumers’ preferences. When formulating substitution policies, firms have to take into account the supply and demand conditions, as well as the cost and benefit of substitution. We formulate a dynamic model, in which the firm replenishes the product inventories from uncertain sources and dynamically allocates the available products to meet the uncertain demands with the flexibility of substitution. To address the analytical challenge associated with multi‐product management, we develop a heuristic algorithm that leverages the value of substitution, while allowing separability of future profit among the products. This heuristic algorithm iteratively solves a transportation problem in a network with the reverse Monge property. The application of the reverse Monge property allows us to deal with general substitution structures, which generalizes the commonly studied downward substitution models. Given the product inventories, the derived allocation policy is asymptotically optimal when the firm can frequently remix the products to fulfill the received demands. Through an extensive numerical analysis, we demonstrate that the heuristic policy yields good performance measured by the percentage profit gap from an upper bound problem. We also show that substitution can generate significant benefits when the supply capacities are moderate, the supply and demand uncertainties are high, or the replenishment cycle is short.},

  abstract     = {We study a risk‐averse newsvendor problem where demand distribution is unknown. The focal product is new, and only the historical demand information of related products is available. The newsvendor aims to maximize its expected profit subject to a profit risk constraint. We develop a model with a value‐at‐risk constraint and propose a data‐driven approximation to the theoretical risk‐averse newsvendor model. Specifically, we use machine learning methods to weight the similarity between the new product and the previous ones based on covariates. The sample‐dependent weights are then embedded to approximate the expected profit and the profit risk constraint. We show that the data‐driven risk‐averse newsvendor solution entails a closed‐form quantile structure and can be efficiently computed. Finally, we prove that this data‐driven solution is asymptotically optimal. Experiments based on real data and synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We observe that under data‐driven decision‐making, the average realized profit may benefit from a stronger risk aversion, contrary to that in the theoretical risk‐averse newsvendor model. In fact, even a risk‐neutral newsvendor can benefit from incorporating a risk constraint under data‐driven decision‐making. This situation is due to the value‐at‐risk constraint that effectively plays a regularizing role (via reducing the variance of order quantities) in mitigating issues of data‐driven decision‐making, such as sampling error and model misspecification. However, the above‐mentioned effects diminish with the increase in the size of the training data set, as the asymptotic optimality result implies.},

  abstract     = {As supply chain channels physical, financial, and information flows as well as associated risks, a firm&#39;s supply chain information should be helpful in understanding and predicting its credit risks. Credit ratings, as an approximate but important measure of corporate credit risks, have been widely used by investors, creditors, and supply chain partners in their decision‐making. This study studies the role of supply chain information in predicting companies’ credit ratings. Using firm‐level supplier–customer linkages and corporate credit rating data, we develop a machine learning framework with gradient boosted decision trees to examine whether and what supply chain features can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of credit ratings, and what types of supply chain links have higher information content that positively affects the predictability of the supply chain features. We construct a firm&#39;s supply chain variables from its supplier and customer portfolios. We show that incorporating supply chain features can improve prediction accuracy over the benchmark credit rating model using only the focal firm&#39;s features. Moreover, the informativeness of supply chain links in focal credit risk prediction depends on the focal firm&#39;s industry sector, the relationship strength of such links, and the switching costs. Finally, we develop a focal credit rating prediction model with a high accuracy level using supply chain factors solely, which can potentially be applied to predict credit risks of small‐ and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) and private firms with no public financial information, as long as their supply chain information is available.

  abstract     = {This study aims to examine and design operational strategies for mixed flows of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human‐driven vehicles (HVs). We propose a stylized model wherein utilitarian individuals either drive HVs or take privately operated AVs that are collectively dispatched. In the baseline mixed policy where AVs and HVs share the same lanes, we find that AVs under‐join the traffic (queue) while HVs over‐join. We identify a “crowding‐out effect” such that AVs will tend to mitigate the over‐joining HVs and reduce overall congestion/throughput. To improve the traffic efficiency of the baseline mixed policy, we consider a fully dedicated policy in which both AVs and HVs are segregated to different lanes and a partially dedicated policy in which only AVs enjoy dedicated lanes. We find that dedicated policies outperform the mixed policy in both social welfare and the aggregate throughput when the platooning effect is moderate or strong. Exact conditions are derived for the selection of fully dedicated policy and partially dedicated policy. Furthermore, we find that a carefully designed subsidy is necessary for the dedicated policy to simultaneously improve the social welfare and the throughput when the platooning effect is very weak. These results shed interesting light on the policy regulation for the emerging mixed autonomous paradigm: a dedicated policy with proper lane design and subsidy (if necessary) will improve both social welfare and aggregate throughput.},

  abstract     = {We study how customer satisfaction affects platforms’ advertising competition and their equilibrium market shares and profits. Consider a market with multiple competing (online) platforms, all of which decide advertising outlay to maximize their own average profit. A customer chooses which platform to visit depending on her experience of the last purchase and on the platforms’ advertising outlays. After purchasing from a platform, with certain probability (satisfaction probability), the customer would be satisfied. A satisfied customer is more likely to repurchase from the platform than if she is dissatisfied. There are two types of customers in the market: loyal and switcher. Conditional on either satisfaction outcome, the loyal is more likely to repurchase from the last‐visited platform than the switcher. In the duopoly, we show that lower a platform&#39;s customer satisfaction or a higher proportion of switcher may alleviate the advertising competition. Consequently, a platform does not necessarily get a higher profit when its customer satisfaction is higher; and the platform with higher (lower) customer satisfaction benefits from a larger proportion of loyal (switcher). We then study the case with more than two competing platforms. Under the symmetric market, the equilibrium advertising outlay first increases and then decreases as the number of platforms increases. Every platform spends more on advertising and gets a lower profit when customer satisfaction improves. The equilibrium profit of platform is always increasing in the proportion of switcher. Under the fragmented market, we find that similar to the duopoly, the platforms with higher (lower) customer satisfaction benefit more when facing the loyal (switcher) than when facing the switcher (loyal). Several extensions are considered: two‐period impact of purchasing experience, an outside option for customers, endogenous satisfaction probabilities, and asymmetric information between platforms.},

  abstract     = {In some stockout situations, a retailer may be better off declining to fulfill some demand even though it could have been backordered. We study the conditions under which endogenous (retailer‐driven) partial backordering is the cost‐minimizing strategy in an infinite horizon periodic review inventory system with dual sourcing. At the beginning of each period, the retailer can place two orders. The first order (with higher unit purchase cost) is delivered immediately from the fast supplier and brings the inventory level up to a target level Z . The second order (with lower unit purchase cost) is delivered one period later from the slow supplier (or the same supplier using a slower delivery mode) and brings the inventory position up to the base‐stock R . In each period, the realized demand can be accepted up to the maximum of inventory on‐hand and R – k , implying that some excess demand requests may be backordered while the rest is rejected. The on‐order quantity k denotes the reservation quantity held back for use in subsequent periods. Each of k , Z , and R is a decision variable in our model with dual sourcing. The case k = R – Z yields the full lost sales model while the case k = –∞ yields the full backorder model. We determine structural properties of the optimal ( k , Z , R ) policy and discuss how to find the optimal base‐stock and reservation quantities. In a complementary numerical investigation, we find that a suitably designed single supplier partial backorder policy can be nearly as cost‐effective as the optimal dual source policy.},

This study investigates the separate and joint effect of quantity and quality feedback on both performance metrics in order picking. We collected data from two real‐effort experiments with in total 212 participants, who conducted an order picking task in an experimental warehouse. The results of the main experiment show that giving only quantity feedback improves productivity performance, without compromising on quality. No significant effects of quality feedback were identified. Furthermore, combining quantity and quality feedback does not create a synergistic or a weakening effect on both performance dimensions. The second experiment was used as a robustness check in a different setting, and its results show that quantity feedback not only positively impacts productivity, but can also improve quality. We further decompose the aggregate productivity improvement into the separate impact on pickers who perceive different relative positions. We find that the top‐ranked and middle‐ranked workers in their group accelerate less relative to themselves than the bottom‐ranked workers do, and the acceleration gap between the top‐ranked and the bottom‐ranked pickers is smaller when quantity feedback is present. Our findings show that managers can achieve both fast and faultless performance by carefully designing the performance feedback to their employees.},

Our models seek to provide timely access to care by coordinating clinic and surgery appointments to ensure that patients can see a surgeon in the clinic and (if needed) schedule their surgery within a maximum wait time target based on patient classes. There are different types of uncertainty including the number of appointment requests, whether a patient requires surgery, and surgery durations. We develop an integrated multi‐stage stochastic and distributionally robust optimization (IMSDRO) approach to determine the optimal clinic and surgery dates for patients such that the access target constraints are satisfied, and the clinical and surgical overtimes are minimized. The IMSDRO approach synergizes multi‐stage stochastic optimization with distributionally robust optimization to simultaneously incorporate multiple types of uncertainties by including stochastic scenarios for appointment request arrivals and ambiguity sets for surgery durations. Several new transformations are introduced to turn the nonlinear model derived from the IMSDRO approach to a tractable one, and a constraint generation algorithm is developed to solve it efficiently. We propose a data‐driven rolling horizon procedure to facilitate implementation. We use case data to assess the performance of our policies. The results suggest that our policy can significantly improve surgical access delay times compared to the current practice. Our methodology is not limited to a particular setting and can be applied to other service industries where access delay matters.},

We shed light on this mixed evidence by considering the moderating role of strategic fit. A strategically aligned supplier can provide long‐term benefits to the customer. As a result, powerful customers may trade off the short‐term benefits obtained through supplier concessions with the long‐term benefits derived from strategic fit. Thus, strategic fit can mitigate the negative impact of customers&#39; bargaining power on supplier performance. We use data on supplier–customer dyads identified using financial disclosures of firms&#39; major customers to examine this research question. We find that a strategic fit between suppliers and their customers on three distinct dimensions (innovation, customer orientation, and efficiency) attenuates the negative association between customers&#39; relative bargaining power and supplier performance.

To understand why this occurs in practice, we study the efficiency of risk aligning in the competitive energy industry through derivative contract trading. We derive conditions that need to hold for a contract to provide the most efficient risk aligning, among all possible derivative contracts imaginable. We develop a game‐theoretical model that includes multiple competing producers and retailers whose decision‐makers are heterogeneous in their risk preferences that are captured using mean‐variance utilities. We derive closed‐form equilibrium quantities for the exchanged contracts and contract prices. We show using a simplified setup that, under an inelastic spot price, the optimal quantity and the price of the traded futures contract are driven by the proportion of the electricity spot price that retailers pass down to the consumers. In particular, this proportion impacts who are the buyers and the sellers of the contracts, what quantities of contracts are traded, and at what price the contracts are traded. We apply the model to the German electricity market and show that the conditions for guaranteeing a futures contract to be the most efficient risk aligning contract hold approximately. Our result can explain the dominance of futures contract trading in the energy industry and also the counter‐intuitively large quantity of traded futures, which exceeds multiple times the supplied quantity of electricity. Our results can aid decision‐makers in deciding on the types, amounts, and prices of contracts to trade.

A farming cooperative has some private quality information of its product and can convey it via quality certification in the planting stage. A product distributor makes the order decision based on the farming cooperative&#39;s quality certification and can observe the exact product quality information only after the product is reaped. During this process, a local government provides free but imperfect demand forecasting to help the farming cooperative make more efficient pricing and quality certification decisions. We show that the impact of quality certification on the farming cooperative&#39;s profit hinges on three factors: the quality standard, the cost of certification, and the precision rate of government information, and the profit exhibits non‐monotonic relationship with any of these factors. The farming cooperative could become worse off with the government&#39;s free information provision, and a higher information precision rate could result in a down‐side jump for the farming cooperative&#39;s profit. In comparison to government information channel, the farming cooperative may choose to costly acquire the demand information by itself and controls the information precision rate. Our main results hold when the distributor can determine the retail price and discuss the possible signaling role of wholesale price under our game framework.},

We review the basic notions of stochastic orders and stochastic functions, with which the conventional (deterministic) way of modeling can be generalized. Based on the orders among distribution functions associated with random variables, we can treat the input–output relationship as stochastic functions in our models. This viewpoint, leads to extended functional properties in the stochastic sense. Taking the existing models involving inventory and pricing decisions, we show how the stochastic notions are powerful in simplifying and generalizing the analysis, as well as generating new insights.},

In conjunction with payment terms, we model the impact of two commonly recommended supply chain risk management (SCRM) practices: quick response to supply disruptions and use of a secondary (backup) source. Among other results, we uncover a feedback mechanism that contributes to the negative effect of extended payment terms on a supplier&#39;s finances and show that longer payment terms can worsen buyer outcomes, especially when the supplier faces a higher risk of disruptions. We also show that, when considered alongside extended payment terms, common SCRM practices may not always be beneficial for buyer firms. Our research suggests decisions related to SCRM and extended payment terms should not be made independently.},

Contestants who enter such a contest earlier than other contestants must weigh the potential costs of revealing their identities and submissions against the potential benefits of improving their submissions through emerging information and early engagement. In this study, we examine how top‐ranked contestants or stars, who rank in the top 5% of winning experience on the contest platform, react to the contest incentives in deciding when to begin observable participation in such an innovation contest. Subsequently, we examine how endogenous entry by top‐ranked contestants influences participation of future contestants. Our analysis, based on detailed data from contests and participating contestants from a popular graphic design platform, indicates that contest incentives have interesting second‐order effects on competition. Although top‐ranked contestants enter a focal contest earlier than other contestants when the prize is high relative to other available contests, early entry by top‐ranked contestants deters new contestants from entering a contest and reduces participation of those who do enter. Furthermore, the contestants who enter a focal contest following early entry by a top‐ranked contestant tend to have lower levels of prior success on the platform. This research has important implications for how the design of contests, where a contestant&#39;s identity and submissions are visible, can be modified to encourage greater competition and participation by all contestants.},

It is widely regarded as a disruptive technology that brings tremendous opportunities to supply chain members. This study uses a game‐theoretical model to study an e‐commerce setting in which an online platform provides IoT infrastructure and a manufacturer sells its products on the platform. Our work examines the interaction among the manufacturer&#39;s IoT investment decision, the platform&#39;s choice of pricing models, and the platform&#39;s transfer payment strategy. We solve the model analytically and obtain several interesting findings. Our study shows that the manufacturer in a wholesale pricing model is more likely to invest, and invests more, in IoT technology than in an agency one. One surprising finding is that both the manufacturer and the channel performance could be hurt by an increase in IoT technology value in certain situations. Also surprisingly, even having the option of investing in IoT technology by the manufacturer can make both the manufacturer and the channel performance worse off. Therefore, the advancement of IoT technology might not benefit either manufacturers or the whole industry, although e‐commerce platform giants and the news media have been advocating the benefits of IoT technology enthusiastically in recent years. Our results should concern both device manufacturers who contemplate adopting or have adopted IoT technology and policymakers who are interested in overall channel performance.},

  abstract     = {Cross‐training is an important tool to improve the performance of manufacturing and service systems through dynamic worker allocation. This study investigates how cross‐training can be leveraged when worker collaboration is not possible and frequent worker reassignment is undesirable. We consider a tandem queueing system with finite buffers between tasks. We show that if each worker is the fastest at a different task, then the optimal policy is always dedicated, regardless of the magnitude of the reassignment costs. Otherwise, if the system is Markovian with two homogeneous tasks and a faster and a slower worker, we completely characterize how the profit‐optimal policy depends on the (constant) reassignment cost. We also prove that for any given reassignment cost, dedicated worker allocation policies are strictly suboptimal for large enough buffer sizes. Instead, the faster worker should move to the downstream task only if there are enough jobs in the intermediate buffer and return to the upstream task when the buffer is sufficiently empty. Furthermore, the benefit of task switching increases as the buffer size becomes larger. We use our theoretical results to develop worker allocation heuristics both for more general systems with two tasks and for systems with more tasks. Numerical experimentation provides insights on how the profit depends on the buffer sizes and reassignment costs, shows that policies that are optimal when workers are collaborative result in excessive switching for non‐collaborative workers, and indicates that our pick‐the‐best heuristics perform well in all settings.},

  abstract     = {To retain old customers and promote sales, firms offer trade‐in programs in which consumers bring in an old product and receive a trade‐in rebate when buying a new one. However, after buying the new product, the consumer who has traded in (the “trade‐in consumer”) may return the new product and claim a refund for it if she/he is not satisfied with it. In this situation, under a full‐trade‐in‐return (FTR) policy, trade‐in consumers receive a generous refund that includes a trade‐in‐rebate for them to redeem if they purchase again in future. Alternatively, some firms have a partial‐trade‐in‐return (PTR) policy under which trade‐in consumers who return a newly purchased product only receive a refund for the amount of money they paid (without including the trade‐in‐rebate). In this study, we build stylized analytical models to explore the optimal choice of a trade‐in‐return policy. We find that there is no difference to the firm between an FTR and a PTR policy when no trade‐in consumers keep unsatisfactory new products. In the case of a relatively medium residual value of the used product, FTR is always the better choice for the firm. When some trade‐in consumers keep unsatisfactory new products, we show that FTR (PTR) is the better choice when the used product&#39;s durability is sufficiently low (high). We also show that the firm may not reduce its trade‐in rebate when the “average new product satisfaction rate” of trade‐in consumers increases. In the extended models, we find that, the firm is more likely to prefer PTR to FTR under the online–offline dual‐channel retailing mode, but tends to prefer FTR to PTR when there is a competitive secondhand market, and should make the same optimal trade‐in return policy when there are two selling periods.},

  abstract     = {Market share contracts, a form of loyalty discounts, where the discount is contingent on the buyer meeting or exceeding a target share of total procurement, are used in many business to business (B2B) settings. We study the impact of such contracts on demand allocation, prices, and welfare in a setting where a single central B2B buyer procures multiple units of a product on behalf of a set of users with heterogeneous preferences. We find that linear pricing creates a demand distortion, which goes away with the use of market share contracts. These contracts serve as strategic tools for vendors whose products are strongly preferred by a substantial fraction of the users in the buying organization to shift the locus of competition and extract away rents from weaker rivals, and sometimes from buyers. The impact of such contracts on the welfare of the buyers is therefore ambiguous, but when these contracts are used, the overall surplus goes up as disutility from demand distortion is avoided. While both quantity threshold contracts and two‐part tariffs can replicate the efficiency properties of market share contracts when demand is deterministic, they cannot guarantee the avoidance of demand distortion when buyer demand is uncertain.},

Each month the staff planner decides the number of anesthesiologists on regular duty and an on‐call consideration list for each day of the following month. In addition, each day, the staff planner decides how many on‐call anesthesiologists to call for the following day. Total costs consist of explicit and implicit costs. Explicit costs include the costs of calling an anesthesiologist and overtime costs. These costs are specified by the organization. Implicit costs encompass costs of not calling an on‐call anesthesiologist and under‐utilizing an anesthesiologist, and these have to be deduced from past decisions. We model the staff planning problem as a two‐stage integer stochastic dynamic program. We develop structural properties of this model and use them in a sample average approximation algorithm constructed to solve this problem. We also develop a procedure to estimate the implicit costs, which are included in this model. Using data from the operating services department at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center, our model shows the potential to reduce overall costs by 16%. We provide managerial insights related to the relative scale of these costs, hiring decisions by service, sensitivity to cost parameters, and improvements in the prediction of the booked time durations.},

  abstract     = {In many markets, consumers have time‐varying needs for product or service quality. Recent technology advances equip firms with the on‐demand product‐adjustment capability (OPAC), which allows them to efficiently process customers&#39; requests for short‐term (e.g., daily or hourly) changes of service quality to meet their time‐varying demands. This paper examines how OPAC affects a firm&#39;s optimal pricing and product‐line decisions in a market with consumers having time‐varying product needs and different average need levels. OPAC gives the firm a new way to price discriminate consumers—having a targeted consumer use a low‐end product in her low‐need state and upgrade to a high‐end product in her high‐need state; this contrasts the traditional use of a product line to segment consumers based on their expected valuations, that is, average need levels, whereby each consumer uses only one product and cannot flexibly adjust the product quality over time. We show that OPAC does not always improve the firm&#39;s profit: it does so only when consumers&#39; valuations vary significantly over time or when each segment of consumers with different probabilities of having a high valuation is not too small. Moreover, although OPAC enables the firm to provide additional options to serve more consumer segments, it may actually induce the firm to optimally serve fewer consumer segments. One may intuit that OPAC would induce the firm to reduce the low‐end product&#39;s quality to elicit more upgrades; our analysis shows that, interestingly, OPAC can lead to an increase in quality for both high‐end and low‐end products.},

We fully characterize the equilibrium decisions and show how they depend on the commission rate of the agency channel, channel substitutability, and information accuracy. Our analysis unfolds a novel wholesale price effect that extends related results in the literature. We also show that encroachment and information sharing are complementary, and therefore managers should not ignore the impact of one decision on the other decision even when the latter is not a primary motivation of the former.

In this study, we model and derive patients&#39; optimal doctor shopping decisions. After each visit, patients update their beliefs about their health status following the Bayes&#39; rule. We show that the patients&#39; doctor shopping decisions are critically affected by the diagnosis accuracy, the relative value of identifying a severely ill patient, and the cost per visit. We examine how the patients&#39; doctor shopping behavior affects social welfare from two aspects, namely, an objective one that accesses whether doctor shopping improves the judgment accuracy regarding the patient&#39;s health status, and a subjective one concerning whether doctor shopping relieves patients&#39; anxiety. We find that allowing patients to conduct doctor shopping exacerbates the system congestion ( congestion effect ), but it can help those patients who have decided to join obtain a higher reward ( reward effect ). There exists a diagnosis accuracy threshold above which allowing doctor shopping incurs a welfare loss and below which allowing doctor shopping improves welfare. Moreover, this diagnosis accuracy threshold increases as patients become more pessimistic or hold more diverse initial illness perceptions. The objective welfare maximization prefers a higher doctor shopping rate than the subjective welfare maximization does only when the value of identifying a severely ill patient is high enough, which may help explain why doctor shopping is encouraged for the critical illness such as cancer.},

  abstract     = {We study a dynamic job assignment problem in queueing systems with one class of Poisson arrivals and K groups of heterogeneous servers. A scheduling policy prescribes the job assignment among servers in each group at every state n (number of jobs in the system). Our goal is to obtain the optimal policy to minimize the long‐run average cost, which involves the increasingly convex holding cost for jobs and the operating cost for working servers. This problem has wide application scenarios in operations management, such as job scheduling in manufacturing systems, packet routing in communication systems, and staffing in service systems. We prove that the optimal policy has monotone structures and quasi bang–bang control forms. Specifically, we discover that the optimal policy is governed by the marginal cost rate c − μG ( n ), where c is the operating cost rate, μ is the service rate, and G ( n ) is called the perturbation realization factor at state n . Under the condition of scale economies which can be guaranteed by any increasingly concave operating cost in μ , we prove that the optimal policy obeys a so‐called c / μ ‐ rule : Servers with a smaller c / μ should be occupied by jobs with higher priority. Optimality of multi‐threshold type policies is further proved when the c / μ ‐rule is applied. Our c / μ ‐rule in group‐server queues can be viewed as a counterpart of the famous cμ ‐rule in polling queues, which both significantly reduce the complexity of optimization problems. By utilizing these optimality structures, we also develop computational‐efficient algorithms to determine the optimal policy numerically. Simulation experiments demonstrate the good scalability and robustness of the c / μ ‐rule, which are important for managerial practice.},

  abstract     = {This study centers on the roles of marketing and operations capabilities in preventing future recalls. However, prior literature identifies operations capability as critical for recall prevention, the current research highlights the equivalent importance of marketing capability. Furthermore, rather than limiting marketing&#39;s role to damage control efforts after a recall, this study identifies its potential for preventing future recall incidents. With research conducted in the consumer packaged goods industry, the authors determine that firms that improve their marketing and operations capabilities after a recall lower their likelihood of future recalls. A proposed motivation‐based model for post‐recall marketing and operations capability improvement predicts that recalling public firms, by default, do not invest in capability improvements. The test of the propositions, with a sample of 276 product recalls using joint estimation, reveals that stock market penalties for recalls, combined with analyst following and independent boards, push recalling firms to make capability improvements. However, well‐reputed firms and those whose competitors recently engaged in recalls push back against investors&#39; demands.},

  abstract     = {We show that a two‐product newsvendor problem with partial demand substitution is equivalent to the classical newsvendor problem with the same economic parameters but an adjusted demand—the effective demand. By comparing the adjusted demand and the primary demand stochastically, we examine the impacts of demand substitution on the expected profit and optimal order quantities. We demonstrate that demand substitution reduces the newsvendor&#39;s demand variability in the sense of convex order. Furthermore, as the degree of substitution increases or the two products’ demands become less dependent in the sense of supermodular order, the newsvendor&#39;s effective demand becomes less uncertain, which implies a higher expected profit. Under rather general assumptions, we show that the distribution function for the newsvendor&#39;s effective demand satisfies the single‐crossing property as the degree of substitution changes. This allows us to rank the optimal order quantities for two different degrees of substitution. To further develop insights, we analyze the case where the demand dependence structure is modeled using copula. We show that the optimal profit is decreasing and convex in demand dependence. Furthermore, by exploring the interaction effect of demand dependence and the degree of substitution, we show that a firm can achieve positive synergy by simultaneously increasing the substitution degree and decreasing demand dependence.},

  abstract     = {Product proliferation occurs in supply chains when manufacturers respond to diverse market needs by trying to produce a range of products from a limited variety of raw materials. In such a setting, delaying the point of the proliferation helps manufacturers improve their responsiveness by postponing the ordering decisions of the final products until there is partial or full resolution of the demand uncertainty. This strategy can be implemented in two different ways: (i) redesigning the operations so that the point of proliferation is swapped with a downstream operation or (ii) reducing the lead times. To establish cost efficiency, manufacturers can systematically reduce their operational costs or postpone the high‐cost operations. We consider a multi‐echelon and multi‐product newsvendor problem with demand forecast evolution to analyze the value of each operational lever of the responsiveness and the efficiency. We use a generalized forecast‐evolution model to characterize the demand updating process, and develop a dynamic optimization model to determine the optimal order quantities at different echelons. We demonstrate that reducing the lead time of a downstream operation is more beneficial to manufacturers than reducing the lead time of an upstream operation by the same amount, whereas reducing the upstream operational costs is more favorable than reducing the downstream operational costs. We also indicate that delaying the proliferation may cause a loss of profit, even if it can be achieved with no additional costs. Finally, a decision typology is developed, which shows effective operational strategies depending on product/market characteristics and process flexibility.},

  abstract     = {This study considers a dyadic supply chain in which a large and creditworthy buyer procures a product from a capital‐constrained supplier subject to disruption risk. In facilitating the production, the buyer may offer direct financing to the supplier by way of advance payment (AP). Concurrently, the buyer may also set a tailored discount rate (TR) that applies to the AP and an extended payment timeline (PE) for the balance due. We analyze the value and interplay of these elements by comparing optimal contractual terms with different AP, PE, and TR potentials. In general, AP applies to more reliable suppliers, and the coverage could be broadened by the inclusion of PE and TR. Specifically, when the advance discount rate is regulated within a certain limit, the buyer should offer TR without PE to the most reliable suppliers, vs. the floor discount rate with PE to those posing higher risk. Although the buyer normally benefits from practicing PE, the supplier benefits from it only when the risk level is relatively high and suffers from it when the risk level is relatively low; these effects persist although they are weakened in the presence of TR. Overall, PE and TR focus on different risk spectrums and are strategic substitutes for each other. The buyer can thereby retain its maximum payoff by properly configuring PE or TR when the other is under strict regulation. These insights offer strategic guidance for buyers to engineer business cash flows with respect to the risk level of their suppliers and the external regulation environment. Author Video},

  abstract     = {Textile waste is one of the most pollutant items globally, being strongly affected by fast fashion (FF) products. Public pressure has made many FF firms voluntarily collect a small fraction of their preowned items and export them to developing countries for reuse. However, some developing countries are launching import bans on second‐hand clothes. In addition, FF firms may soon be forced by extended producer responsibility legislation to collect more preowned items for reuse and recycling. To date, they do not have sufficient capacity to deal with this. Charities have been the key collectors and recyclers of unwanted clothes. Therefore, charities could help FF firms increase their capacity in this reverse supply chain (SC). However, we hardly witness such a collaboration for two main reasons: (i) charities prefer to sell high‐quality preowned items in the primary market to generate the highest possible revenue and FF firms may fear cannibalization, (ii) many charities believe that FF firms generate quantities of low‐quality items that require collection and sorting while being difficult to sell in the primary market. Charities also face competition from many small for‐profit organizations selling FF preowned items. While charities have the support of volunteers, they tend to be less efficient. This work urges Operations Management (OM) researchers to suggest innovative business models to help (i) FF firms and charities collaborate to solve the abovementioned issues, and (ii) charities to improve their traditional practices for competitiveness. This study is primarily a position paper highlighting some challenges and introducing interesting research problems. Although the paper is not a research paper, it follows a qualitative research method to collect and analyze the required supporting documents to justify arguments and statements. We collected primary and secondary data from the textile reverse SC members to familiarize the OM community with this context. The current changes in the textile reverse SC offer many great opportunities for impactful OM research.},

  abstract     = {Two field case studies uncover information discounting in supply chains, which manifests in the form of schedule padding and order inflation. Buyers often exaggerate the urgency and quantity of their needs (“crying wolf”). However, both buyers and suppliers eliminate old, inflated orders from their behavioral ordering/supply system implicitly (“knowing wink”) even though they exist in the hyper‐rational ordering system represented by the ERP system. This behavior results in (and from) low credibility of information exchanged between the buyers and suppliers and their subsequent actions, and settles in a suboptimal equilibrium. Eye tracking experiments based on these case studies unpack the psychophysiological mechanisms behind this behavior, specifically, how decision makers consider past UnFilled Orders under different experimental conditions. We find that merely improving the supplier behavior does not help: information discounting reduces only when we sensitize the buyer to the improvement in the supplier behavior. However, this comes with no financial performance improvements; performance improves by further educating the buyers of the optimal target inventory. Author Video},

We propose a dynamic relocation model using dynamic programming (DP) and develop both analytical and numerical results regarding optimal relocation policies, the minimum cost‐to‐go function, and the value of inventory mobility over traditional warehouse pre‐positioning. Given the computational complexity of the backwards DP algorithm, we develop a base state heuristic (BSH) for general problems by exploiting the real‐world disaster pattern of occurrence. For problems with temporally independent demand, we propose a polynomial time exact algorithm based on a spatial–temporal graph. For problems with spatially independent demand, we design a speedup technique to implement BSH in polynomial time. The proposed model and algorithms are further extended to consider the impact of transportation uncertainties. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithms return high‐quality decisions only in a small fraction of the time required by an exact algorithm and a myopic algorithm. The proposed model and algorithms are applicable to any type of mobile inventory, facility, or server in similar settings.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we study the assortment planning games in which multiple retailers interact in the market. Each retailer owns some of the products and their goal is to select a subset of products, that is, an assortment to offer to the customers so as to maximize their expected revenue. The purchase behavior of the customer is assumed to follow the Markov chain choice model. We consider two types of assortment games under the Markov chain choice model—a competitive game and a cooperative game. In the assortment competition game, we show that there always exists a pure‐strategy Nash equilibrium and such equilibrium can be found in polynomial time. We also identify an easy‐to‐check condition for the uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium. Then we analyze the equilibrium outcome of this competition game, and compare the outcome with that in a monopolistic setting and a central planner setting. We show that under the assortment competition game, each retailer will offer a broader assortment in the equilibrium, which could include products that are not profitable in the monopolistic or the central planner setting, and it will eventually lead to a decrease in revenue for each player. Furthermore, we show that the price‐of‐anarchy and the price‐of‐stability of the game can be arbitrarily large. Motivated by these results, we further consider the assortment cooperation game under the Markov chain choice model, in which retailers are allowed to form coalitions. We consider two settings of cooperative games distinguished by the way we assume other players’ behaviors outside a coalition. Interestingly, we find that when the players are assumed to be intrinsically competitive (meaning that players outside a coalition are assumed to be a collection of competing players), then there is incentive for all the players to form a grand coalition and there exists an allocation of the total revenue that makes the coalition stable (exists a core to the game). However, when the players are assumed to be intrinsically collaborative (meaning that players outside a coalition are assumed to form another coalition), then a stable coalition may not exist.},

In this study, we analyze the optimal stocking policy for a retailer, in a setup with a single horizontally differentiated product with an arbitrary number of product variants, stochastic demand, and two‐level consumer choice. The demands for individual product variants are negatively correlated conditional on the total demand. We assume that each customer will purchase one unit of a preferred product variant, if it is in stock, and will seek to buy a second choice product, if the former is not in stock. We formulate an exact model, with Poisson customer arrivals. In order to maintain tractability and characterize an optimal policy analytically, we develop a benchmark model which does not explicitly account for the stochastic nature of customer arrival times. In this model, which is a heuristic approximation of the exact model, we find simple conditions under which the objective of maximizing expected profit is jointly concave in the stocking levels of the product variants; under these conditions we prove that the optimal stocking levels are simply scaled versions of the optimal newsvendor quantities. We then analytically establish a connection between the exact and benchmark models. We develop a dynamic Monte Carlo simulation experiment to gain further insights on the impact of different performance measures on the effectiveness of the optimal policy in the benchmark model and its performance in reference to the exact optimal policy.},

However, even though the degree of privacy could enhance the privacy mechanism, this mechanism is still much weaker than a trust mechanism.

While previous work has explored the effect of functional goals (i.e., external motivation) in cross‐functional team performance, we extend research in this area to incorporate individual team members&#39; psychological needs (i.e., internal motivation). Specifically, we consider how the interplay of these motivational mechanisms can lead to status conflict within the team, and the ensuing implications on team performance. We conduct an experiment of 136 ad hoc team‐based sourcing decisions, complemented with a sequential qualitative study involving interviews with 37 practicing managers. The results show that functional goal misalignment leads to status conflict, as expected. Yet, counterintuitively, this effect can be mitigated with the team&#39;s composition in individual psychological needs for dominance, specifically with heterogeneously dominant individuals. Our study contributes to the behavioral operations management literature on sourcing teams and to the team motivation literature. We provide guidance on how managers can compose cross‐functional teams to improve decision outcomes considering the interplay of external and internal motivational mechanisms. Author Video},

In this study, we study a retailer&#39;s MBG policy with dynamic pricing of limited inventory. A key decision for the retailer is to decide whether to offer MBGs. When the product can be returned instantly, we find that the optimal MBG policy is a simple threshold policy: given the inventory level, it is optimal to offer an MBG if and only if the remaining selling time is longer than a threshold. Moreover, the threshold is decreasing with the inventory level. We also address the problem of dynamic pricing with positive return times. Due to the complexity, we analyze the associated fluid model, which has an infinite number of constraints. We consider a series of relaxations that have a nested structure and use the Lagrangian approach to explicitly solve these relaxed problems. This allows us to develop an iterative approach that is guaranteed to solve the fluid model in finite iterations. Our numerical analysis shows that the deterministic solution is asymptotically optimal for the stochastic system.},

The reservation policy has two components: pricing and overbooking. For the former, the firm charges a reservation fee (at the time of reservation) and a service price (at the time of service). For the latter, the firm imposes a booking limit that caps the number of reservations it sells. Given the firm&#39;s reservation policy, customers make reservations in advance and later decide whether to show up. Denying service to reservation holders is costly. We obtain the following equilibrium results. First, when demand is small relative to capacity, the firm&#39;s pricing structure relies on reservation fees prepaid in advance, but when demand is large relative to capacity, it relies on payment received upon service. Second, when demand is low and/or predictable, the firm accepts all reservation requests, but when demand is high and/or variable, the firm uses a booking limit.},

  abstract     = {The new sharing economy model has introduced a dramatic, disruptive impact on the traditional industries by matching the demand and supply in real time. In this study, we examine how the entry of Uber, a ride‐sharing services digital platform, brings new disruptive changes in public transportation operations. Significant debate has surrounded whether the new ride‐sharing model siphoned riders from public transit or made public transit feasible for more riders, but no consensus has been reached. One reason could be that the commonly used difference‐in‐differences empirical strategy fails to account for time‐varying unobserved confounders. To address this issue, we introduce a class of counterfactual estimators (CEs) to strengthen our causal identification and perform diagnostic tests to validate model assumptions for each CE. A significant drop in passenger trips with buses is found after Uber entry from both the conventional two‐way fixed effects model and the CEs. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence that the entry of Uber has not significantly affected public demand response transportation, which indicates that Uber is not directly competing with other transportation services that aim to solve the “last‐mile problem.” Last, our additional analyses suggest that the effect of Uber entry is not uniform for different urban areas. All these empirical findings can be coherently explained in our framework of the substitution effect of Uber.},

  abstract     = {This study is motivated by the challenges faced by clinics in sub‐Saharan Africa in allocating scarce and unreliable supply of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) among a large pool of eligible patients. Existing discussion of ARV allocation is focused on qualitative rules for prioritizing certain socioeconomic and demographic patient segments over others at the national level. However, such prioritization rules are of limited utility in providing quantitative guidance on scaling up of treatment programs at individual clinics. In this study, we take the perspective of a clinic administrator whose objective is to maximize the quality‐adjusted survival of the entire patient population in its service area by allocating scarce and unreliable supply of drugs among two activities: initiating treatment for untreated patients and continuing treatment for previously treated patients. The key trade‐off underlying this allocation decision is between the marginal health benefit obtained by initiating an untreated patient on treatment and that obtained by avoiding treatment interruption of a treated patient. This trade‐off has not been explicitly studied in the clinical literature, which focuses either on the incremental value obtained from initiating treatment (over no treatment) or on the value of providing continuous treatment (over interrupted treatment) but not on the difference of the two. We cast the clinic&#39;s problem as a stochastic dynamic program and provide a partial characterization of the optimal policy, which consists of dynamic prioritization of patient segments and is characterized by state‐dependent thresholds. We use this structure of the optimal policy to design a simpler Two‐Period heuristic and show that it substantially outperforms the Safety‐Stock heuristic, which is commonly used in practice. In our numerical experiments based on realistic parameter values, the performance of the Two‐Period heuristic is within 4% of the optimal policy whereas that of the Safety‐Stock heuristic can be as much as 20% lower than that of the optimal policy. Our model can serve as a basis for developing a decision support tool for clinics to design their ARV treatment program scale‐up plans.},

We review the existing developments on the modeling of consumers’ choices, including the attraction model, the utility‐based model, the temporal model, and the rank‐based model. The relationships among different classes of structural models are established and analyzed. Moreover, an operational data analytics (ODA) framework is presented to estimate the general consumer choice model using data. This framework, generalizing the existing estimation methods for specific structural models, strikes a delicate balance between the (likely imprecise) structural knowledge and the data. This is achieved by articulating the domain of validation through extending the structural knowledge and by formulating the data‐integration model based on the associated structural properties. We demonstrate the implementation of the ODA framework to identify the appropriate consumer choice models. The ODA estimate outperforms the existing parametric and nonparametric methods, particularly over the choice sets that are not covered in the data. We also discuss potential future research of developing ODA approaches to study the related aspects of consumer choice models.},

  abstract     = {Universal health coverage (UHC) is an integral part of the United Nations sustainable development goals. The private sector plays a prominent role in achieving UHC, being the primary source of essential medicines for many people. However, many private healthcare facilities in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) have insufficient stocks of essential medicines. Simultaneously, these same facilities carry excessive quantities of other drugs, leading to obsolescence. This suggests poor inventory control. To propose potential remedies it is vital to fully understand the underlying causes. In semi‐structured interviews with managers of private healthcare facilities in Nairobi, we asked them about their (1) inventory control systems, (2) inventory control skills, (3) time/human resource constraints, (4) budget constraints, (5) motivations for inventory control, and (6) suppliers. Our results suggest that the problems are driven by resource limitations (budget and time/human resources), managerial issues (relating to skills and systems), and market mechanisms that limit overage and underage costs. Unavailability at the supplier level and motivations for inventory control are relatively minor issues. We posit that the key causes are interlinked and stem from wider issues in the market and regulatory environment. Our results challenge prevalent beliefs about medicine supply chains in LMICs and lead to novel hypotheses. Testing these hypotheses could improve our understanding of inventory management in private healthcare facilities and aid progress in achieving UHC.},

Maritime transportation is the backbone of global supply chains and maritime accidents can lead to costly disruptions. We describe a case study performed for the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to develop a prototype risk prediction system to provide early alerts of elevated risk levels to vessel traffic managers and operators in the Lower Mississippi River, the second largest port of entry in the United States. Integrating incident and accident data from the USCG with environmental and traffic data sources, we tested existing machine learning algorithms in their predictive ability. We found poor accident prediction accuracy in cross‐validation using the traditional measures of precision and sensitivity. In this specific operational context, however, such single‐class accuracy metrics can be misleading. We define action precision and action sensitivity metrics that measure the accuracy of predictions in engendering the correct behavioral response (actions) among vessel operators, rather than getting the specific event classification correct. We use these operationally appropriate measures for maritime risk prediction to choose an algorithm for our prototype system. While the traditional metrics indicated that none of the algorithms would perform sufficiently well to use in the early warning system, the modified metrics show that the top performing algorithm will perform well in this operational context.},

We utilize this approach in the emergency department (ED) context and specifically in predicting whether a patient will be admitted to an interior hospital unit or discharged from the ED. Data used to generate this prediction are available at different times, introducing a time‐cost associated with different data used in the prediction. We focus on minimizing the time‐cost of prediction without sacrificing accuracy. Using our approach, we are able to reduce the time‐cost of prediction by more than two‐thirds and significantly reduce the need to use privacy‐sensitive features. Yet, we still maintain high accuracy of prediction that is comparable to standard approaches which do not reduce data costs (area under the ROC curve of 0.86). Our work has significant potential value to healthcare entities and contributes to a growing stream of work on how to realize the value of healthcare analytics efforts.},

  abstract     = {With over half a trillion dollars in trade credit flowing between firms in the United States, it is critically important for managers to understand how the trade credit that their firm receives and provides affect its value. Trade credit is a strategic investment in supply chain relationships that allows the recipient to make payment later rather than at the time of the sale. A firm provides trade credit to its downstream business customers and also receives trade credit from its upstream suppliers. Although research has shown that provided trade credit builds a firm&#39;s shareholder value, it has not examined what effect, if any, received trade credit has on the firm&#39;s value. As a result, one might assume that received trade credit affects firm value in the same manner as provided trade credit. We argue otherwise and show that received trade credit and provided trade credit have differential effects on firm value. Received trade credit has a negative direct effect and a positive indirect effect (through profit), whereas provided trade credit has a positive direct effect and a negative indirect effect. The difference in direct effects hinges on the disparate nature of dependence in the supply chain. Provided trade credit increases customers&#39; dependence on the firm, building the firm&#39;s value. In contrast, received trade credit increases the firm&#39;s dependence on its suppliers, destroying the firm&#39;s value. Empirical results using a sample of 2804 firms from 1986 to 2017 provide robust support for the hypotheses. They show that managers risk overestimating the value of a 1 SD increase in received (provided) trade credit by $284.74 ($74.95) million, on average, if they do not consider both the direct and indirect effects it has on their firm&#39;s value.},

In this study, we investigate how app adoption changes customers’ hotel booking behaviors using a dataset of around 16,000 randomly selected customers’ hotel booking and stay information from one of the largest hotel chains in China. Our analyses find that customer purchase frequency and total sales increased after app adoption. Additional investigation shows that customers’ search behaviors also evolved post‐adoption. Specifically, customers tended to book rooms earlier and select options with less discount, which indicates that app users reduced their search intensity after app adoption. We further investigate the differential impact of mobile app adoption on sales, taking into account consumer heterogeneity in price sensitivity and purchase frequency. We find that both price‐sensitive and ‐insensitive customers increased the number of bookings, and they tended to book earlier post‐adoption. Furthermore, price‐sensitive customers on average booked more expensive rooms with less discount after app adoption, suggesting that these customers likely decreased their search effort. In terms of hotel stay frequency, app adoption increased low‐frequency customers’ purchase frequency but did not have any significant effect on high‐frequency customers. These analyses provide a more nuanced view of how mobile apps change consumer search and purchase behaviors. Our findings have important managerial implications. With a better understanding of customer behaviors, firms can provide incentives to customers who are more likely to be affected by mobile app adoption.},

  abstract     = {Firms dread product recalls. Consequently, firm leaders may take steps to avoid recalls when possible, or to avoid the blame for them when there is someone else to blame. We analyze how the appointment of a new chief executive officer (CEO) for a firm in the consumer product industry influences the hazard of subsequent recalls initiated by that firm. Using 25 years of consumer product industry data, including 125 publicly traded firms that experienced 307 new CEOs and 584 voluntary recalls from 1992 to 2016, we find a unique recall pattern following new CEO appointments. The hazard of a recall is high immediately following a new CEO appointment, and then decreases significantly until the next CEO is appointed. We contend that the high hazard of a recall early in CEO tenure may be due to the attribution of blame to the prior CEO. We find evidence to support this contention by showing that the increase in recalls is even higher when the prior CEO was forced out. We also propose that the low hazard of a recall later in CEO tenure may be explained by recalls that can be more easily hidden, allowing them to go unannounced. We find evidence supporting this contention by showing that the decrease in recalls late in a CEO&#39;s tenure is stronger when recalls are more discretionary. We conclude with one firm governance recommendation and four regulatory policy recommendations for the Consumer Product Safety Commission.},

We examine the impact of competition from open source software (OSS) on proprietary software providers by analyzing three cases: (i) proprietary software as a monopoly, (ii) mixed duopoly competition between proprietary software provider and OSS, and (i) duopoly competition between two proprietary software providers. We use an analytical model to capture two important features of OSS: (i) its zero licensing price and (ii) its lower usability in comparison with proprietary software. Prior studies have shown that competition from OSS causes the proprietary software provider to produce software that is both lower quality and lower priced than software offered by a monopolist. In contrast, our paper shows that these results hold under certain conditions but are not always true. We find that competition from OSS can induce the proprietary software provider to increase its software quality and price relative to those of the monopolist when the proprietary software provider&#39;s cost of enhancing software quality is moderate. Surprisingly, we also find that competition from OSS can lead to a reduction in social welfare. Whereas prior research has shown this result in the context of network effects, we show that this can occur in the absence of network effects and offer a novel explanation.},

The transaction level data set includes nearly 80 million transactions, corresponding to $2 billion in sales over a 25‐month period. We find that store sales increase with respect to a store&#39;s proximity to closed competitor locations. More interestingly, we find that online channel sales also increase in geographic locations where competitors close stores and where our focal retailer has store locations in close proximity to the markets it serves. This latter finding highlights the important role that stores play in the online channel. Stores provide a level of shopping assurance generally not available online and support customer webrooming and showrooming to mitigate purchase uncertainty. Stores are also integral to omnichannel services like return‐to‐store wherein stores provide a convenient nearby location to make a free return should an online purchase not meet expectations. Consistent with these shopping behaviors, our results demonstrate that the focal retailer, in markets affected by competitor store closures, is able to capture demand that exhibits greater uncertainty in purchases as evidenced by (i) a disproportionate increase in riskier high value vs. low value store purchases consistent with webrooming, (ii) increased online sales of product categories associated with showrooming, and (iii) an increase in return‐to‐store instances for online purchases.},

  abstract     = {Creative crowdsourcing is an innovative online business model in which a platform marshals independent professionals (e.g., designers) to conduct creative work projects. Typically, clients submit project requests stochastically to a platform which possesses a pool of registered designers. For each submitted project, designers decide whether to participate and attempt to submit a design, and the client either chooses a winner among all submissions, or rejects them all, based on subjective criteria. In general, platforms cannot control individual designers directly because of the nature of the freelance market, incurring possible mismatches between designers and arriving projects. To tackle the problem, we present a dynamic control policy applied to the maximum number of participants for each arrived project. Our study reveals that the optimal policy follows an inverted‐ U ‐shaped function of the project value, highlighting the importance of applying a stronger restriction on the number of participants for some sufficiently high‐valued projects. In addition, the optimal policy we have developed allows the platform to gain higher rewards judiciously even when the market is more volatile. Furthermore, extensive numerical studies have been conducted to glean managerial insights. Specifically, the optimal policy becomes more beneficial even when more designers are available, which is counter‐intuitive to the common‐sense notion that control should be more valuable when designers are scarcer; and the optimal policy is further shown to be robust when the objective is changed from maximizing the total reward to maximizing the total number of successful projects.},

  abstract     = {Accessibility of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations is an important factor for adoption of EV, which is an effective green technology for reducing carbon emissions. Recognizing this, many governments are contemplating ideas for achieving EV adoption targets, such as constructing extra EV charging stations directly or offering subsidies to entice automakers to construct more EV charging stations. To achieve these targets, governments need to coordinate with automakers to ensure that the total number of charging stations is planned optimally. We study this coordination problem by considering the interactions among the government, automakers, and consumers, our equilibrium analysis yields three major results. First, both the government and the automaker should build extra EV charging stations when their construction costs are independent . Simultaneously, the government should offer a per‐station subsidy to the automaker only when the adoption target and the construction cost are both high. However, when the construction costs are dependent , the government should delegate the construction to the automaker by offering a per‐station subsidy. Second, when the government considers consumer purchase subsidy as an extra lever, we find that the purchase subsidy for consumers is more cost‐effective than offering a per‐station subsidy to the automaker. Third, the structure of the optimal government policy remains the same regardless of whether the government&#39;s goal is to improve EV adoption or consumer welfare. Our results can serve as guidelines for governments when contemplating coordination with automakers for the construction of EV charging stations to improve EV adoption as well as consumer welfare further.},

We collected data from two online markets on sales of two luxury handbags that differ principally in the prominence of their logo. We use these data to estimate the premium in consumers’ willingness to pay for the handbag with the quiet logo, and to estimate how the condition of the handbag affects that premium. We find consumers are willing to pay a sizeable premium of $161–$174, or 17%–18% of the retail price, for quiet handbags as compared to loud handbags. Furthermore, while consumers’ willingness to pay for both types of handbags is less for handbags in worse condition, it diminishes more rapidly with the worsening condition for quiet handbags. Our findings suggest that counter to conventional wisdom, consumers are willing to pay more for quietly marked luxury goods that allow them to signal a more targeted group of peers with similar cultural capital or social connectedness.

  abstract     = {Emergency department (ED) overcrowding and long patient wait times have become a worldwide problem. We propose a novel approach to assigning physicians to shifts such that ED wait times are reduced without adding new physicians. In particular, we extend the physician rostering problem (PRP) by including heterogeneity among emergency physicians in terms of their productivity (measured by the number of new patients seen in 1 hour) and by considering the stochastic nature of patient arrivals and physician productivity. We formulate the PRP as a two‐stage stochastic program and solve it with a sample average approximation and the L‐shaped method. To formulate the problem, we perform a data analysis to investigate the major drivers of physician productivity using patient visit data from our partner ED, and we find that the individual physician, shift hour, and shift type (e.g., day or night) are the determining factors of ED productivity. A simulation study calibrated using real data shows that the new scheduling method can reduce patient wait times by as much as 13% compared to the current scheduling system at our study ED. We also demonstrate how to incorporate physician preference in scheduling through physician clustering based on productivity. Our simulation results show that EDs can receive almost the full benefit of the new scheduling method even when the number of clusters is small.},

Our objective is to analyze how marketing at the industry level affects the evolution of primary demand in different stages of the product life cycle. We characterize the aggregate marketing activities in two constructs: marketing breadth and competitive spread. The first construct reflects the spread of spending across different marketing instruments at the industry level, and the second construct reflects the spread of spending across different firms . Though both constructs are related to the spread of spending within a category, we find that they have qualitatively different effects on category growth. An econometric model making use of the hierarchical nature of time observations within countries is estimated for each category. First, we find that high degrees of spending breadth impede market growth when the number of competitors is small (the category is young) but accelerate market growth when the number of competitors is higher (the category is maturing). Second, we find that high levels of competitive spread decrease category growth when spending levels are relatively low. However, as spending levels increase, the negative effect of competitive spread on demand growth all but evaporates.},

Our analysis reveals that sales for a particular item at a focal store increases when that same item experiences stock‐outs in neighboring stores. Our empirical findings suggest that there is substitutability across stores, and that this substitutability is the strongest in the period when the stock‐out is observed for the first time, and decreases as time passes following the stock‐out. In order to assess the implications of considering the impact of stock‐outs on inventory allocation, we develop an optimization model that is calibrated using parameters estimated via our earlier DDIV analysis. The simulation analysis confirms that revenues markedly improve on average by 6% under low demand variance and by 14% under high demand variance when neighboring stock‐out information is taken into account for sales forecasting while optimizing initial inventory allocations. Finally, we conduct sensitivity analysis to evaluate how these potential revenue improvements vary with turnover, product price, and inventory.},

We leverage big data to optimize patient monitoring frequencies and improve treatment. Our research is motivated by the need to improve patient care at the Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals. We propose an integrated model to better serve patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD is prevalent, complex, and costly. The demand for kidney care has steadily increased; however, there is a decline in the availability of nephrologists. We propose a finite‐horizon Markov decision process (MDP) model, which utilizes evidence‐based and data‐driven approach to identify the best follow‐up appointment schedule for patients. The MDP model helps attain an optimal dynamic treatment plan to enhance patient&#39;s quality of life. It is parameterized by data from 11 US Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals, containing 68,513 CKD patients (mostly males between 60 and 90 years old) geographically dispersed throughout the United States between January 1, 2009 and February 21, 2016. Through various estimates and assumptions, we propose an optimal monitoring policy. We find that CKD severity, comorbidities, age, and distance to nephrologist all play roles in shaping patients’ needs of care. Through the VA clinical data, we have numerically validated our recommendation and shown that it considerably outperforms the current kidney care guidelines adopted by the VA.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates diagnostic testing and pharmacy expenditures, commonly referred to as ancillary costs in the United States acute‐care hospitals. These ancillary costs are charges associated with services provided to support patient treatment, including laboratory, radiology, and pharmacy charges. Despite of investment in inter‐organizational and technological collaboration practices, these costs continue to rise. Our research examines the role of individual healthcare providers, namely multisiting physicians, who practice at more than one hospital, in reducing ancillary cost. We also look at how inter‐organizational collaboration measured by the hospital&#39;s affiliation in an accountable care organization (ACO) model affect this relationship. To do this, we assembled a unique data set of 163,617 patients treated by 4411 physicians at 182 hospitals in Florida from 2014 to 2016. Using an econometric estimation approach accounting for endogeneity, we find that patients treated by multisiting physicians experienced, on an average, per‐hospitalization reduction in laboratory and radiology charges of 58.57% and 30.11%, respectively. These savings increase when multisiting physicians have less practice experience. We also find that hospitals participating in ACO model complement the savings achieved through multisiting physicians in the form of even lower pharmacy costs. In post‐hoc analyses, we find such cost reduction comes from reducing the total number of procedures or tests ordered. We also show that the lower treatment charges do not compromise the clinical quality of patients treated by multisiting physicians. Collectively, the findings offer important insights to the healthcare operations management literature on the interaction between individual‐organizational collaboration efforts and patient‐level outcomes.},

The borrower compensates the lender by a payment equal to the “borrowing cost.” Hence, the servers share their capacities via borrowing, but they also compete against each other for their pooled capacities. We formulate this problem as a stochastic dynamic game and characterize the equilibrium strategic admission behavior of servers. We show that the critical factors that affect the equilibrium behavior and the system revenue are the magnitude of the borrowing cost, the arrival rate of customers and the revenue difference between different classes of customers. We have identified conditions under which servers maximizing their own payoffs end up making decisions that benefit the system.

Leveraging a rich data set from Taobao, a large e‐commerce platform in China, this study strives to understand the mechanisms of physical goods sampling via online channels. Specifically, we investigate (1) how the sampling size (number of free samples provided) acts as a signal of product quality and (2) how the signaling effect of sampling size varies across product types (i.e., search, experience, and credence products). We use a structural model to characterize the e‐tailers&#39; decision process as a trade‐off between the incurred cost of free sampling at present and the economic returns in future. We find that a 1% increase in sampling size leads to a total sales increase of 5.34% daily sales over a month. Of all product types, experience products benefit the most from the signaling effect of sampling size, whereas search products benefit the least. We further perform a policy simulation on the sampling threshold, that is, the minimum total value of the sampling product required to join the sampling campaign. Our results show that increasing the threshold leads to decreases in average sales and the number of e‐tailers involved, and vice versa. As one of the first studies focusing on the mechanisms of physical goods sampling in the online context, our study provides empirical evidence of the signaling effect of sampling size.},

  abstract     = {A total minimum commitment contract is a supply contract under which a firm commits to buying a minimum quantity of a product from its supplier during the contract duration (e.g., 1 year). Such contracts are widely used in industries, because they provide the buyer with flexibility in terms of the timing and size of each order and the supplier with a guaranteed total order volume. Previous studies on such contracts have focused primarily on the firm&#39;s inventory decisions, and none of them has considered the coordination of inventory and pricing decisions. In this study, we fill this gap by studying dynamic inventory and pricing problems under a commitment contract. Under a general demand model with backlogging and zero lead time, we prove that the optimal policy is a committed‐inventory‐position‐dependent base‐stock list‐price policy and characterize its structural properties. We also conduct an extensive numerical study to derive further managerial insights. In particular, we find that dynamic pricing can substantially improve the firm&#39;s profitability and enables it to select contracts with large committed quantities and price discount rates, and that ignoring the commitment in joint pricing and ordering decisions can result in substantial profit loss. Finally, we partly extend our results to a lost‐sales model and a backlogging model with lead times.},

We consider an unobservable queueing system with a nonlinear waiting cost function, which is concave up to a certain point and then becomes convex, capturing the mixed‐risk attitude of customers observed in empirical studies. We assume that customers are sensitive with respect to waiting time (delay) and strategic regarding their balking and abandonment decisions. We characterize the optimal pricing policy that maximizes the service provider&#39;s revenue. We show that the pricing policies studied in the literature, including the joint service and cancellation (entrance) fee policy, are suboptimal and cannot induce the socially optimal behavior. We demonstrate that while the cancellation fee can regulate a customer&#39;s balking strategy, the service fee cannot effectively control a customer&#39;s abandonment decision. We then provide conditions under which the joint service and cancellation fee policy is optimal. We finally prove that the service provider should compensate customers for their waiting in order to efficiently control the abandonment of customers. We propose a pricing policy, which includes entrance, service, and wait time (delay) fees, that maximizes the provider&#39;s revenue. We derive the optimal fees and show that, under the proposed optimal pricing policy, customers pay service and cancellation fees while they are partially compensated for the time spent waiting for service.},

  abstract     = {Consumer Surplus is traditionally defined for the case where demand is a deterministic function of the price. However, demand is usually stochastic and hence stock‐outs can occur. Policy makers who consider the impact of different regulations on Consumer Surplus often ignore the impact of demand uncertainty. We present a definition of the Consumer Surplus under stochastic demand. We then use this definition to study the impact of demand and supply uncertainty on consumers in several cases (additive and multiplicative demand noise). We show that, in many cases, demand uncertainty hurts consumers. We also derive analytical bounds on the ratio of the Consumer Surplus relative to the deterministic setting under linear demand. Our results suggest that ignoring uncertainty may severely impact the Consumer Surplus value.},

  abstract     = {Competing and coexisting policies (CACPs) may arise from the incompatibility of incentives, standards, and regulatory models between a local state and a federal government, or between two government jurisdictions across which supply networks operate. Traditional studies of supply chain dynamics typically explore the impact of policy regimens as standalone instruments. This study explores how the interplay between CACP regimens can affect the supply dynamics between producers, customers, and their intermediaries. We use a supply network configuration lens to assess implications for supply chain actors and system‐level outcomes. Our work is motivated by the federal‐state dissonance in the current dispute between India&#39;s farmers and the federal government regarding new laws that impact agricultural supply chains in India. In this case, alternative and coexisting policy interventions, ostensibly aimed at modernizing and transforming production and distribution, can lead to significant supply chain netting and inventory pooling reconfigurations in terms of material, information, and financial flows among Indian agricultural stakeholders, along with inventory repositioning and market creation options. In addition, of significance is the consequent shift in the balance between state/nation and federal/supranational equity and bargaining power, an increasingly relevant context where supply chains operate across a common but multi‐jurisdictional territory, and implications for system‐level outcomes, in this particular case equity, welfare economics, and food security. We conclude by pointing to the implications of CACP regimens, and their interplay, for the broader field of operations management and supply chain research.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we examine how firms can leverage reference‐group effects (RGEs) in sequential introduction of upgraded products. RGEs arise when consumers engage in social comparisons: leaders desire to distinguish themselves from followers and followers desire to mimic leaders. We find that RGEs have a non‐monotonic impact on the profitability of product upgrades: a stronger RGE first increases and then decreases profits. This inverted‐U effect is fundamentally driven by two opposite effects of RGEs: a positive push effect on leaders’ upgrading to a new generation when followers adopt an existing product that leaders possess, and a negative pull effect on followers’ adoption of the existing product when leaders upgrade to the new product. We also offer insights on inter‐generational differentiation in the presence of RGEs. We find that by coordinating product differentiation in two dimensions, functional improvement and exterior form, the firm is able to eliminate the negative pull effect, which occurs when the strength of RGEs is intermediate. In such cases, both functional improvement and exterior differentiation increase with the strength of RGEs. When the strength of RGEs is sufficiently high, however, the firm will focus on exterior differentiation rather than functional improvement. Managerial implications are discussed.},

  abstract     = {We study the impact of three well‐known inventory allocation mechanisms, including proportional, linear, and uniform, on the ordering behavior of retailers serviced from a central distribution center. Based on the allocation mechanism, retailers may have an incentive to adjust (either inflate or deflate) their orders to gain a more favorable allocation, a behavior that may reduce allocation efficiency from a system perspective. We find that while all three mechanisms are centrally optimal under common knowledge of local demands, only the uniform allocation incentivizes retailers to set orders truthfully. Consistent with theory, our experimental results show that using proportional or linear allocation results in larger and more frequent order adjustments, with the degree of strategic ordering being largest under the linear mechanism. Across all mechanisms, order adjustments decrease both allocation efficiency and local retail profits. While uniform allocation results in smaller and less frequent adjustments overall, it may not be feasible to implement in more general settings. Hence, we propose and test a new mechanism, tailored uniform, that leverages the uniform principle while overcoming some practical limitations. It provides more flexibility by allowing for differences in the allocated quantities among retailers, while still providing no incentive for order manipulation. The tailored uniform mechanism performs similarly to uniform in terms of order adjustments, and further increases allocation efficiency when retailers have heterogeneous demands.},

However, there is little empirical evidence on whether and to what extent the implementation of an internal online community affects individual job performance in the geographically dispersed organization. In this study, we investigate this question with a quasi‐natural experiment: A large manufacturer (i.e., the company) introduced an internal online community for its sales representatives across geographically dispersed subunits. The unique data set from the company&#39;s different departments enables us to observe detailed information about each representative&#39;s community usage, sales performance, and demographics. Our difference‐in‐differences design and instrumental‐variable analysis jointly demonstrate a positive relationship between community usage and individual sales performance. In addition, we find that the online community has heterogeneous effects: It is significantly more beneficial for representatives with fewer offline opportunities to observe and learn from their colleagues&#39; activities (i.e., representatives from subunits with fewer employees and lower average job performance). Finally, sales performance is more positively associated with reading posts from nonlocal subunits (vs. posts from the local subunit) and posts that summarize multiple selling events (vs. posts that describe a single selling event). Our study has implications for managers regarding the benefits of corporate online communities, especially for the geographically dispersed organization.},

Moreover, we establish that introducing a higher‐quality private label can improve both channel profit and consumer welfare.

  abstract     = {Bucket brigades are notably used to coordinate workers in production systems. We study a J ‐station, I ‐worker bucket brigade system. The time duration for each worker to serve a job at a station is exponentially distributed with a rate that depends on the station&#39;s expected work content and the worker&#39;s work speed. Our goal is to maximize the system&#39;s productivity or to minimize its inter‐completion time variability. We analytically derive the throughput and the coefficient of variation (CV) of the inter‐completion time. We study the system under two cases. (i) If the work speeds depend only on the workers, the throughput gap between the stochastic and the deterministic systems can be up to 47 % when the number of stations is small. Either maximizing the throughput or minimizing the CV of the inter‐completion time, the slowest‐to‐fastest worker sequence always outperforms the reverse sequence for the stochastic bucket brigade. To maximize the throughput, more work content should be assigned to the stations near the faster workers. In contrast, to minimize the CV of the inter‐completion time, more work content should be allocated to the stations near the slower workers. (ii) If the work speeds depend on the workers and the stations such that the workers may not dominate each other at every station, the asymptotic throughput can be expressed as a function of the average work speeds and the asymptotic expected blocked times of the workers, and can be interpreted as the sum of the effective production rates of all the workers.},

  abstract     = {Despite a significant rise in consumer interest in local foods, supply constraints limit access to these products in many markets. Online platforms for local foods may help solve these constraints. However, to our knowledge, there is no empirical research on the economic viability of these platforms. We study this problem by analyzing a two‐sided platform subject to indirect network effects. If present, these effects will create a virtuous cycle where consumers’ demand for products sold through the platform rises in the number of vendors and suppliers’ demand for product distribution through the platform increases in consumer demand. In the case of our study&#39;s platform, analyses reveal the existence of indirect network effects, as consumers prefer a variety of local vendors and vendors derive greater surplus from greater consumer demand. Therefore, platforms like the one we analyze may serve as viable alternatives for the commercialization of local foods, and could provide greater access to these products. Importantly, however, our analysis also reveals the existence of not only nonlinearities in the strength of indirect network effects, but also non‐monotonic effects. Non‐monotonicity derives from consumers’ attraction to the platform marginally decreasing in the number of local vendors and from the existence of marginally increasing costs as more of these vendors join in. As a result, indirect network economies are subject to a cap imposed by the number of vendors participating in these platforms. Through counterfactual simulations, we evaluate the magnitude of this constraint and offer recommendations on how to minimize its impact. Author Video},

  abstract     = {Traditionally, outlet stores were situated away from main stores in order to provide older, less desirable products at discounted prices. More recently, some firms have featured an outlet‐within‐a‐store concept and offer consumers the experience of outlet shopping at the same location. With interest in examining the effect of location differentiation and uncertain outlet store&#39;s product fit on a firm&#39;s distribution strategy, we model a firm with an existing main store and study its motivation on whether to open an outlet store, and where to locate it. The analysis leads to a number of key observations. First, if the firm decides to open an outlet store, it may be co‐located with the main store or at a remote location, depending on the combined role of customer dispersion, outlet store&#39;s product fit, customer travel sensitivity, and fixed costs. Second, there exists a substitution effect between location and quality (and price) differentiation. We show that customer dispersion always encourages the firm to offer outlet stores so as to achieve better market coverage. While a higher probability of product fit at the outlet store makes its more attractive (e.g., it makes customers at one location more willing to travel to the outlet store at another location), interestingly, it has a non‐monotone effect on its location. Also, in contrast to intuition, higher customer travel sensitivity may even lead to locating the outlet store away from the city center depending on the level of customer dispersion. We also study three extensions. First, the results of our base model are shown to be robust if product quality at the outlet store can positively influence the outlet product&#39;s fit probability. Second, heterogeneous consumer travel sensitivity makes it easier for the firm to segment consumers and hence can increase profits even when travel sensitivity is high. Finally, we consider a continuum of possible outlet store locations, and demonstrate the robustness of the base model results.},

  abstract     = {Physicians caring for chronically ill individuals need to predict patients&#39; disease progression, as accurate disease projections can facilitate better treatment decisions. The power of prediction is prevention, as it is easier to prevent than to reverse. In this research, we propose a data‐driven model for accurate and fast disease trajectory prediction, using electronic health records (EHRs) from Veterans Affairs Hospitals. EHRs contain tremendous amount of frequently updated, highly dimensional and not equally spaced data in diverse formats (e.g., numeric, textual, images, and videos). We propose an intelligent case‐based reasoning (iCBR) approach to better predict kidney disease progression, which can help prevent patients&#39; health deterioration and prolong lives. Our iCBR contributes to the literature by enhancing the automation and personalization capabilities of the conventional case‐based reasoning (CBR). Through the iCBR, we advance the utilization of patient&#39;s laboratory data, vital sign, clinic visit, and comorbidity information. We examine (1) if the number of cases chosen for predicting the new patient&#39;s disease progression should be tailored, and (2) what the best number of prediction cases should be if customization is warranted. We link the number of cases selected for disease prediction with patient&#39;s disease characteristics. By comparing the results of the iCBR and popular machine learning and statistics models adapted to our problem, we find that the iCBR outperforms other methods. While the proposed model is applied to patients with chronic kidney disease, it can be readily applied to other chronic diseases such as diabetes, due to its similar data structure.},

  abstract     = {The role of information technology (IT) in managing operations that support environmentally sustainable growth has been emphasized a lot in operations management and information systems research. In this paper, we study the impact of the IT‐based on‐demand ridesharing platforms on an important aspect of sustainability—traffic congestion. Our theoretical prediction suggests two countervailing effects from the entry of ridesharing platforms to urban areas: the efficiency‐enhancing effect that reduces traffic congestion and the demand‐inducing effect that increases traffic congestion. We propose that the impacts of ridesharing services on traffic congestion should vary with urban spatial features. Given the theoretical tension, we investigate the impact of Uber entry on traffic congestion in urban areas of the United States with a focus on the moderating role of urban compactness. Based on a unique dataset that combines multiple archival sources, we empirically examine whether the entry of Uber&#39;s on‐demand ridesharing service affects traffic congestion by using a difference‐in‐differences framework. Our empirical evidence indicates that ridesharing services significantly increase traffic congestion in compact areas. Meanwhile, we find some marginal evidence that ridesharing services decrease traffic congestion in sprawling urban areas. The results are robust to a series of additional analyses, including the use of alternative measures, relative time model, entry exogeneity test, and placebo tests. We conclude that the efficiency‐enhancing and demand‐inducing effects shape traffic congestion and that the net effect varies according to different levels of urban compactness. We provide circumstantial evidence for the underlying mechanisms by analyzing public transit and commuting characteristic data. Author Video},

  abstract     = {Traditional analyses of firms that compete in multiple markets examine settings in which firms sell directly to consumers. However, in many industries, firms sell their products through intermediaries. Importantly, these firms usually have common intermediaries, and the degree of this overlap varies across markets and over time. We empirically study the effect of the asymmetry of distribution channel relationship overlap across markets on retail prices. An increase in distribution channel relationship asymmetry can provide firms with an enhanced ability to punish rivals through shared distribution relationships in addition to shared markets. This increased ability to punish can then soften competition (increase prices), that is, the mutual forbearance mechanism. However, an increase in distribution channel relationship asymmetry can also make it difficult for firms to pursue similar goals with their rivals, and thus weakening the potential for tacit coordination. This can then intensify competition (reduce prices), that is, the goal congruence mechanism. Due to these opposing mechanisms, the net impact of distribution channel relationship asymmetry on competitive intensity is not clear. Using extensive scanner panel data for multiple product categories, on average, we find that an increase in distribution channel relationship asymmetry results in higher retail prices. Consistent with the mutual forbearance mechanism, this effect becomes more positive (or less negative) when (i) the manufacturer size or the number of retail stores in the focal market increases or (ii) when the manufacturer is a public (vs. private) firm. Conversely, the effect becomes less positive when the strategic similarity among manufacturers increases, in line with the goal congruence mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Many decisions must be made before relevant uncertainties are revealed; hence robustness approaches to decision making are often considered. There are two major approaches to robustness in the literature: (i) maximizing the value of the worst outcome and (ii) minimizing the maximum ex post regret of the decision. While the first approach seeks the best worst‐case outcome, it may result in substantial opportunity losses relative to the ex post optimal decision; this is particularly critical in new product design decisions as it leaves the leading firm exposed to a late entrant who designs its products after uncertainties are resolved. The second approach seeks to minimize these ex post opportunity losses, but it may expose the decision maker to greater downside risk, that is, lower outcome in the worst case. Most studies have examined one of these approaches in isolation; in contrast, in this study, we explore the trade‐offs between protecting upside regret and downside risk with a focus on a product line design (PLD) problem, which relies greatly on conjoint analysis data. The PLD problem may suffer from significant uncertainty in the partworth utilities which define the attribute‐level consumer preferences on a product for different population segments. Our numerical experiments, based on a real conjoint data set, show that neither robustness approaches dominates the other and hence our proposed approach uses both. We construct a Min‐Value vs. Max‐Relative‐Regret efficient frontier to narrow down the PLD choice and propose a metric to quantify the trade‐offs and finalize the selection.},

  abstract     = {In service systems with heterogeneous customers, prioritization with respect to the relative importance of customers is known to improve certain performance measures. However, in many applications, information necessary to determine the importance level of a customer may not be available immediately but can be revealed only through some preliminary investigation, which is sometimes called triage . This triage process is typically error‐prone and may take substantial amount of time, and hence, it is not always clear if and when it should be implemented for purposes of priority assignment. To provide insights into this question, we study a stylized queueing model with a single server and two types of customers with hidden type identities, which differ in their rates of service and waiting costs. By means of a Markov decision formulation, we first show that the optimal dynamic policy on triage is characterized by a switching curve. The comparison of two state‐independent policies (no‐triage and triage‐all) shows that the information from triage is more beneficial when the traffic intensity is neither too low nor too high. Our numerical results show that the system manager should consider implementing a state‐dependent triage policy when the probability of classifying a customer into the important class and the mean triage time are of moderate size, when the difference between the importance levels of the two classes of customers is large, and/or when the traffic intensity is high.},

  abstract     = {Failing to sell fresh produce before expiration not only hurts the bottom line of grocery retailers, but also leads to food waste. This work combines dynamic pricing and information disclosure to help retailers to effectively sell fresh produce and promote sustainability. We focus on a quality‐based pricing strategy and whether retailers should disclose information on food quality to customers. We consider a model where a monopolistic retailer sells fresh produce to customers who have different perceptions about food quality within a given time period. We employ a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to derive the optimal pricing and information strategies. Our simulation results show that a quality‐based pricing strategy yields lower prices than a pricing strategy that does not consider quality. Lower prices drive demand, thus improving profits and reducing food waste. Additionally, we show that, when an information strategy is allowed, the prices in a quality‐based pricing strategy stay the same or even increase during the selling season. This is because information disclosure helps align customers’ biased perceptions on food quality with the actual levels. We show that a combination of quality‐based pricing and information disclosure further improves profits and reduces food waste when a large portion of customers consider quality to be lower than actual levels. To implement our ideas, we propose a cloud‐based automated system that integrates sensor data, artificial intelligence, and customer communications. Our results have profound implications for the food industry on managing fresh produce.},

  abstract     = {The phenomenon of copycats is common in a wide range of industries. Recently, to indicate product authenticity and combat copycats, many brand name companies (BNCs) have started selling products through retailers. These BNCs deploy a scalable protocol that is integrated into a permissioned blockchain technology (PBT) platform. We examine how PBT combats copycats in the supply chain and how it benefits BNCs. Although PBT implementation helps novice customers identify product authenticity and the real quality of products, that is, to take advantage of a quality disclosure effect , we show that, if and only if the number of novice customers is large enough, then selling through a PBT retailer can effectively combat copycats. Thus, PBT increases the profit of the BNC, consumer surplus, social welfare, and reduces the profit of a copycat. Moreover, conventional wisdom tells us that PBT ensures supply chain transparency and motivates a firm to improve its product quality. However, the BNC reduces the quality of its products when using PBT, because an improvement in product quality is not profitable if consumers can distinguish between genuine and imitation products. Furthermore, we extend the model by considering the case where the BNC itself implements PBT. Without the double marginalization effect , even if the number of novice customers is small, blockchain technology may exist in the market (the BNC self‐implements). In addition, if the unit production cost of a genuine product is large enough, social welfare increases when production cost increases.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the disruptive power of the mobile digital sharing economy to the road freight logistics industry. New information technologies, such as the mobile internet, mobile payment methods, and GPS, have enabled platforms to match freight shippers’ demand with carriers’ supply by utilizing the convenience and mobility of smartphones. We empirically study the influence of the emergence of mobile digital freight matching platforms in the U.S. on the profitability and stock performance of two types of incumbent road freight logistics companies: freight arrangement companies (freight forwarders and brokers) and trucking companies (freight carriers). Since the mobile digital freight matching platforms mainly match small and mid‐sized trucking companies with shipping demand, we expect the platforms to introduce interference (direct) competition to traditional freight arrangement companies and exploitation (indirect) competition to large trucking companies, which potentially raises operational challenges for both types of incumbents. We use Difference‐in‐Differences (DID) analyses to study the incumbents’ profitability and the event study method to evaluate their stock performance. We find that after the advent of the mobile digital freight matching platforms in the U.S., the profitability of the traditional freight arrangement companies counter‐intuitively remained unchanged. In contrast, the profitability of the large trucking companies increased. Furthermore, we examine the changes in sales and costs behind these profitability changes. Our dynamic analyses suggest a time lag of the influence of the mobile digital freight matching platforms. Besides, we find that the stock value of the traditional freight arrangement companies received a significant negative shock, whereas the stock value of the large trucking companies showed no significant reaction. This study contributes to understanding the disruptive power of an emerging technology innovation of sharing economy to firm performances in an increasingly competitive and innovative business environment.},

Such systems raise the challenge of designing good work schedules for human pickers; they also give rise to a new class of operational scheduling problems in human–robot coordinated order picking systems. This work studies the problem of finding a suitable robot schedule that takes into account the schedule‐induced fluctuation of the working states of human pickers. A proposed model enables mobile racks with various workloads to be assigned to pickers, and schedule the racks that are assigned to every picker to minimize the expected total picking time. The problem is formulated as a stochastic dynamic program model. An approximate dynamic programming (ADP)‐based branch‐and‐price solution approach is used to solve this problem. The developed model is calibrated using data that were collected from a dominant e‐commerce company in China. Pickers&#39; working state transitions are modeled based on data obtained from this warehouse. Counter‐factual studies demonstrate that the proposed approach can solve a moderately sized problem with 50 racks in under 2 minutes. More importantly, the approach yields high‐quality solutions with picking times that are 10% shorter than the solutions that did not consider schedule‐induced fluctuations of pickers&#39; working states.},

In this study, we study the effects associated with AI automation of the retailer&#39;s order decision in a decentralized supply chain comprising one supplier and one regretful retailer. In the absence of AI automation, the retailer has a regret bias in that it behaves as though considering the deviation between the realized demand and order quantity, when making an ex ante inventory decision. We find that if profit margins of the supply chain are high, regret bias drives the retailer to decline the supplier&#39;s contract, whereas, if profit margins are low, regret drives retailers to order more from the supplier. As a result, although the automation of retailer decision leads to a higher expected profit for a retailer that operates in a centralized vacuum, it nevertheless can be a negative force for a decentralized supply chain with either high or low profit margins. Perhaps more interestingly, as a retailer&#39;s decision becomes automatic, it is not destined to earn a higher expected profit. In the extreme, a lose‐lose outcome can prevail in which automation potentially leaves both the retailer and supplier worse off.},

As an innovative service model, the unique characteristics of the space‐sharing economy require the understanding of emotional and psychological aspects in managing such a disruptive service model. We empirically examine the impact of unstructured emotional information that service providers offer (i.e., marketer‐generated content) on the popularity and sales of services in space‐sharing platforms (e.g., Airbnb) above and beyond objective qualities such as guest ratings or the size and amenities of the properties. For this, we leverage a unique dataset of a large‐scale sample of Airbnb listings from New York City (NYC). The results of a panel analysis and a series of robustness checks reveal a curvilinear association between the affective expression of service providers and the sales of their services, that is, the effect of emotional expressions is positive at low levels, but it diminishes at high levels. To address the potential endogeneity, we use a 2SLS‐IV approach, and the results validate our findings. Moreover, we conduct a randomized experiment to further establish causal inference. This study makes valuable contributions to the literature on service operation management and the sharing economy. Our findings shed light on how operations managers and service providers can use emotional information in space‐sharing platforms. We provide practical examples to guide their actions.

Yet, an understanding of the technology&#39;s financial value remains elusive. Based on 175 firm announcements between 2015 and 2019, we conduct an international event study to estimate the impact of blockchain initiatives on the market value of the firm. We empirically demonstrate that blockchain announcements are associated with a significant average abnormal return of 0.30% on the announcement day, and that there are indications of positive long‐term effects on shareholder value. We further demonstrate how blockchain use case, project, and firm characteristics affect the stock market reaction. Specifically, we find that the stock market reaction to blockchain announcements is less positive when blockchain is used to trace physical objects or to share sensitive data, providing empirical evidence for the risk associated with current challenges in the design of blockchain use cases. Our results also suggest that the involvement of an external information technology service provider in a blockchain project attenuates the positive stock market reaction. Interestingly, more innovative firms do not experience a stronger stock market reaction to blockchain announcements. Leveraging the international scope of our sample, we further shed light on how the firm&#39;s competitive (i.e., industry factors) and macro environment (i.e., country factors) affect the stock market reaction. Our findings indicate that the industry&#39;s R&amp;D intensity and the country&#39;s data restriction level play a crucial role in driving the value attributed to blockchain initiatives.},

  abstract     = {Can technology and operations enable the world to achieve various United Nation Sustainable Development Goals? I provide my own perspective on this question by focusing on the issue of gender equality through the lens of “women&#39;s economic empowerment.” To do so, I use case examples to describe how innovative operations enabled by technologies (mobile phones/online platforms, solar technology, blockchain/AI, and Internet of Things) can empower women to alleviate poverty, reduce hunger by improving health, increase access to clean water and sanitation, increase access to education and decent work. Then I share some ideas for Operations Management researchers to consider so that we can explore and develop ways to close the “gender gap.”},

  abstract     = {In the Industry 4.0 era, automation and data analytics emerge as the major forces to enhance efficiency in operations management (OM). Disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, blockchain, 3D printing, 5G, Internet‐of‐Thing, digital twins, and augmented reality, are widely applied. They potentially will bring a radical change to real world operations. In this study, we first explore several major disruptive technologies, examine the corresponding OM studies, and highlight their current applications in the industry. Then, we discuss the pros and cons associated with the use of these technologies and uncover the potential human–machine conflicting areas. After that, we propose measures which may be able to achieve human–machine reconciles in the coming Industry 5.0 era. A concept of “sustainable social welfare” which includes worker welfare, privacy, etc. is proposed and the roles played by policy makers are also discussed. Finally, a future research agenda, which covers topics in both the Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0 eras, is established.},
