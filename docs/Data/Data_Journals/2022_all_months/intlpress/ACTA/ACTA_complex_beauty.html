  abstract     = {Sendov’s conjecture asserts that if a complex polynomial $f$ of degree $n \geqslant 2$ has all of its zeros in closed unit disk $\lbrace z: \vert z \vert \leqslant 1 \rbrace$, then for each such zero $\lambda_0$ there is a zero of the derivative $f^\prime$ in the closed unit disk $\lbrace z: \vert z-\lambda_0 \vert \leqslant 1 \rbrace$. This conjecture is known for $n \lt 9$, but only partial results are available for higher $n$. We show that there exists a constant $n_0$ such that Sendov’s conjecture holds for $n \geqslant n_0$. For $\lambda_0$ away from the origin and the unit circle we can appeal to the prior work of Dégot and Chalebgwa; for $\lambda_0$ near the unit circle we refine a previous argument of Miller (and also invoke results of Chijiwa when $\lambda_0$ is extremely close to the unit circle); and for $\lambda_0$ near the origin we introduce a new argument using compactness methods, balayage, and the argument principle.},

Hypersurfaces with every Newton polytope can be obtained. Our proof has the following ingredients. Using recent results on localization, we may trade wrapped Fukaya categories for microlocal sheaf theory along the skeleton of the hypersurface. Using Mikhalkin–Viro patchworking, we identify the skeleton of the hypersurface with the boundary of the Fang–Liu–Treumann–Zaslow skeleton. By proving a new functoriality result for Bondal’s coherent-constructible correspondence, we reduce the sheaf calculation to Kuwagaki’s recent theorem on mirror symmetry for toric varieties.},

  abstract     = {We prove that the $L_4$ norm of the vertical perimeter of any measurable subset of the $3$-dimensional Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}$ is at most a universal constant multiple of the (Heisenberg) perimeter of the subset. We show that this isoperimetric-type inequality is optimal in the sense that there are sets for which it fails to hold with the $L_4$ norm replaced by the $L_q$ norm for any $q \lt 4$. This is in contrast to the $5$-dimensional setting, where the above result holds with the $L_4$ norm replaced by the $L_2$ norm. The proof of the aforementioned isoperimetric inequality introduces a new structural methodology for understanding the geometry of surfaces in $\mathbb{H}$. In a previous work (2017) we showed how to obtain a hierarchical decomposition of Ahlfors-regular surfaces into pieces that are approximately intrinsic Lipschitz graphs. Here we prove that any such graph admits a foliated corona decomposition , which is a family of nested partitions into pieces that are close to ruled surfaces. Apart from the intrinsic geometric and analytic significance of these results, which settle questions posed by Cheeger–Kleiner–Naor (2009) and Lafforgue–Naor (2012), they have several noteworthy implications. We deduce that the $L_1$ distortion of a word-ball of radius $n\geqslant 2$ in the discrete $3$-dimensional Heisenberg group is bounded above and below by universal constant multiples of $\sqrt[4]{\operatorname{log}n}$; this is in contrast to higher dimensional Heisenberg groups, where our previous work (2017) showed that the distortion of a word-ball of radius $n \geqslant 2$ is of order $\sqrt{\operatorname{log} n}$. We also show that, for any $p \gt 2$, there is a metric space that embeds into both $\ell_1$ and $\ell_p$, yet not into a Hilbert space. This answers the classical question of whether there is a metric analogue of the Kadec–Pełczyński theorem (1962), which implies that a normed space that embeds into both $L_p$ and $L_q$ for $p \lt 2 \lt q$ is isomorphic to a Hilbert space. Another consequence is that for any $p \gt 2$ there is a Lipschitz function $f : \ell_p \to \ell_1$ that cannot be factored through a subset of a Hilbert space using Lipschitz functions, i.e., there are no Lipschitz functions $g : \ell_p \to \ell_2$ and $h : g (\ell_p) \to \ell_1$ such that $f = h \circ g \,$; this answers the question, first broached by Johnson–Lindenstrauss (1983), whether there is an analogue of Maurey’s theorem (1974) that such a factorization exists if $f$ is linear. Finally, we obtain conceptually new examples that demonstrate the failure of the Johnson–Lindenstrauss dimension reduction lemma (1983) for subsets of $\ell_1$; these are markedly different from the previously available examples (Brinkman–Charikar, 2003) which do not embed into any uniformly convex normed space, while for any $p \gt 2$ we obtain subsets of $\ell_1$ for which the Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma fails, yet they embed into $\ell_p$.},

  abstract     = {A set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is said to be spectral if the space $L^2 (\Omega)$ has an orthogonal basis of exponential functions. A conjecture due to Fuglede (1974) stated that $\Omega$ is a spectral set if and only if it can tile the space by translations. While this conjecture was disproved for general sets, it has long been known that for a convex body $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ the “tiling implies spectral” part of the conjecture is in fact true. To the contrary, the “spectral implies tiling” direction of the conjecture for convex bodies was proved only in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and also in $\mathbb{R}^3$ under the a priori assumption that $\Omega$ is a convex polytope. In higher dimensions, this direction of the conjecture remained completely open (even in the case when $\Omega$ is a polytope) and could not be treated using the previously developed techniques. In this paper we fully settle Fuglede’s conjecture for convex bodies affirmatively in all dimensions, i.e. we prove that if a convex body $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is a spectral set, then $\Omega$ is a convex polytope which can tile the space by translations. To prove this we introduce a new technique, involving a construction from crystallographic diffraction theory, which allows us to establish a geometric “weak tiling” condition necessary for a set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ to be spectral.},

  abstract     = {There are many classical random walk in random environment results that apply to ergodic random planar environments. We extend some of these results to random environments in which the length scale varies from place to place, so that the law of the environment is in a certain sense only translation invariant modulo scaling . For our purposes, an “environment” consists of an infinite random planar map embedded in $\mathbb{C}$, each of whose edges comes with a positive real conductance. Our main result is that under modest constraints (translation invariance modulo scaling together with the finiteness of a type of specific energy) a random walk in this kind of environment converges to Brownian motion modulo time parametrization in the quenched sense. Environments of the type considered here arise naturally in the study of random planar maps and Liouville quantum gravity. In fact, the results of this paper are used in separate works to prove that certain random planar maps (embedded in the plane via the so-called Tutte embedding) have scaling limits given by SLE-decorated Liouville quantum gravity, and also to provide a more explicit construction of Brownian motion on the Brownian map. However, the results of this paper are much more general and can be read independently of that program. One general consequence of our main result is that if a translation invariant (modulo scaling) random embedded planar map and its dual have finite energy per area, then they are close on large scales to a minimal energy embedding (the harmonic embedding). To establish Brownian motion convergence for an infinite energy embedding, it suffices to show that one can perturb it to make the energy finite.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we prove the mean-convex neighborhood conjecture for the mean-curvature flow of surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Namely, if the flow has a spherical or cylindrical singularity at a space-time point $X=(x, t)$, then there exists a positive $\varepsilon = \varepsilon (X) \gt 0$ such that the flow is mean convex in a space-time neighborhood of size $\varepsilon$ around $X$. The major difficulty is to promote the infinitesimal information about the singularity to a conclusion of macroscopic size. In fact, we prove a more general classification result for all ancient low-entropy flows that arise as potential limit flows near $X$. Namely, we prove that any ancient, unitregular, cyclic, integral Brakke flow in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with entropy at most $\sqrt{2 \pi / e + \delta}$ is either a flat plane, a round shrinking sphere, a round shrinking cylinder, a translating bowl soliton, or an ancient oval. As an application, we prove the uniqueness conjecture for meancurvature flow through spherical or cylindrical singularities. In particular, assuming Ilmanen’s multiplicity‑$1$ conjecture, we conclude that for embedded $2$‑spheres the meancurvature flow through singularities is well-posed.},
