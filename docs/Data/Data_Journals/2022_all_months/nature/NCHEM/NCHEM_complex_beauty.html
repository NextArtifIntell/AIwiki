  abstract     = {Molecules that contain one or more fluorine atoms are crucial to drug discovery. There are protocols available for the selective synthesis of different organofluorine compounds, including those with a fluoro-substituted or a trifluoromethyl-substituted stereogenic carbon centre. However, approaches for synthesizing compounds with a trifluoromethyl- and fluoro-substituent stereogenic carbon centre are far less common. This potentially impactful set of molecules thus remains severely underdeveloped. Here we introduce a catalytic regio-, diastereo- and enantioselective strategy for the preparation of homoallylic alcohols bearing a stereogenic carbon centre bound to a trifluoromethyl group and a fluorine atom. The process, which involves a polyfluoroallyl boronate and is catalysed by an in situ-formed organozinc complex, can be used for diastereodivergent preparation of tetrafluoro-monosaccharides, including ribose core analogues of the antiviral drug sofosbuvir (Sovaldi). Unexpected reactivity/selectivity profiles, probably originating from the trifluoromethyl- and fluoro-substituted carbon site, are discovered, foreshadowing other unique chemistries that remain unknown. Methods to access organofluorine compounds with a trifluoromethyl- and fluoro-substituted carbon stereogenic centre are severely limited. Now, a flexible and stereodivergent approach has been developed for the efficient preparation of homoallylic alcohols containing this moiety. Conversion to polyfluoro furanosides and pyranosides has been demonstrated, which is relevant to antiviral drug development.},

  abstract     = {Carbon nanostructures with zigzag edges exhibit unique properties—such as localized electronic states and spins—with exciting potential applications. Such nanostructures however are generally synthesized under vacuum because their zigzag edges are unstable under ambient conditions: a barrier that must be surmounted to achieve their scalable integration into devices for practical purposes. Here we show two chemical protection/deprotection strategies, demonstrated on labile, air-sensitive chiral graphene nanoribbons. Upon hydrogenation, the chiral graphene nanoribbons survive exposure to air, after which they are easily converted back to their original structure by annealing. We also approach the problem from another angle by synthesizing a form of the chiral graphene nanoribbons that is functionalized with ketone side groups. This oxidized form is chemically stable and can be converted to the pristine hydrocarbon form by hydrogenation and annealing. In both cases, the deprotected chiral graphene nanoribbons regain electronic properties similar to those of the pristine nanoribbons. We believe both approaches may be extended to other graphene nanoribbons and carbon-based nanostructures. On-surface synthesis enables highly reactive structures to be produced under vacuum, but they need to be passivated to be incorporated into practical devices. Here, the facile protection of air-sensitive chiral graphene nanoribbons has been shown, by either hydrogenation or synthesis of an oxidized form. The chemically stable forms can subsequently be deprotected.},

  abstract     = {Ternatin-family cyclic peptides inhibit protein synthesis by targeting the eukaryotic elongation factor-1α. A potentially related cytotoxic natural product (‘A3’) was isolated from Aspergillus, but only 4 of its 11 stereocentres could be assigned. Here, we synthesized SR-A3 and SS-A3—two out of 128 possible A3 epimers—and discovered that synthetic SR-A3 is indistinguishable from naturally derived A3. Relative to SS-A3, SR-A3 exhibits an enhanced residence time and rebinding kinetics, as revealed by single-molecule fluorescence imaging of elongation reactions catalysed by eukaryotic elongation factor-1α in vitro. An increased residence time—stereospecifically conferred by the unique β-hydroxyl in SR-A3—was also observed in cells. Consistent with its prolonged duration of action, thrice-weekly dosing with SR-A3 led to a reduced tumour burden and increased survival in an aggressive Myc-driven mouse lymphoma model. Our results demonstrate the potential of SR-A3 as a cancer therapeutic and exemplify an evolutionary mechanism for enhancing cyclic peptide binding kinetics via stereospecific side-chain hydroxylation. The total synthesis and complete stereochemical assignment of the cyclic peptide natural product SR-A3—which has potential as a cancer therapeutic—has now been reported. Single-molecule biophysical and cellular experiments reveal a crucial, stereospecific role for a side-chain hydroxyl in SR-A3, which confers enhanced target residence time and efficacy in a mouse tumour model.},

Synthetic chromophore arrays provide useful models for understanding energy migration in these systems. Research has focused on mimicking rings of chlorophyll molecules found in purple bacteria, known as ‘light-harvesting system 2’. Linear meso–meso linked porphyrin chains mediate rapid energy migration, but until now it has not been possible to bend them into rings. Here we show that oligo-pyridyl templates can be used to bend these rod-like photonic wires to create covalent nanorings that consist of 24 porphyrin units and a single butadiyne link. Their elliptical conformations have been probed by scanning tunnelling microscopy. This system exhibits two excited state energy transfer processes: one from a bound template to the peripheral porphyrins and one, in the template-free ring, from the exciton-coupled porphyrin array to the π-conjugated butadiyne-linked porphyrin dimer segment. Meso–meso linked porphyrin arrays have been described as rod-like photonic wires. Now it has been shown that they can be bent into rings using template-directed synthesis. These rings of porphyrins mimic the light-harvesting arrays of chlorophyll molecules responsible for photosynthesis.},

  abstract     = {Peptide materials have a wide array of functions, from tissue engineering and surface coatings to catalysis and sensing. Tuning the sequence of amino acids that comprise the peptide modulates peptide functionality, but a small increase in sequence length leads to a dramatic increase in the number of peptide candidates. Traditionally, peptide design is guided by human expertise and intuition and typically yields fewer than ten peptides per study, but these approaches are not easily scalable and are susceptible to human bias. Here we introduce a machine learning workflow—AI-expert—that combines Monte Carlo tree search and random forest with molecular dynamics simulations to develop a fully autonomous computational search engine to discover peptide sequences with high potential for self-assembly. We demonstrate the efficacy of the AI-expert to efficiently search large spaces of tripeptides and pentapeptides. The predictability of AI-expert performs on par or better than our human experts and suggests several non-intuitive sequences with high self-assembly propensity, outlining its potential to overcome human bias and accelerate peptide discovery. Peptide design remains a challenge owing to the large library of amino acids. Rational design approaches, although successful, result in a peptide design bias. Now it has been shown that AI techniques can be used to overcome such bias and discover unusual peptides as efficiently as humans.},

Its unprecedented protein kinase C isoform selectivity make it and its analogues exceptional leads for PKC-related clinical indications, which include human immunodeficiency virus and AIDS eradication, antigen-enhanced cancer immunotherapy, Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis. Currently, the only source of tigilanol tiglate is a rain forest tree, Fontainea picrosperma, whose limited number and restricted distribution (northeastern Australia) has prompted consideration of designed tree plantations to address supply needs. Here we report a practical laboratory synthesis of tigilanol tiglate that proceeds in 12 steps (12% overall yield, &amp;gt;80% average yield per step) and can be used to sustainably supply tigilanol tiglate and its analogues, the latter otherwise inaccessible from the natural source. The success of this synthesis is based on a unique strategy for the installation of an oxidation pattern common to many biologically active tiglianes, daphnanes and their analogues. Tigilanol tiglate is a therapeutic lead for the treatment of a broad range of cancers. Now, it has been shown that tigilanol tiglate can be synthesized in a time and step economical fashion from phorbol—its naturally abundant biosynthetic precursor.

However, despite advances in in vitro genetic code reprogramming, the ribosomal incorporation of Hhc units remains challenging. Here we report a method for in vitro ribosomal synthesis of natural-product-like peptides bearing Hhc units. A series of azide/hydroxy acids were designed as chemical precursors of Hhc units and incorporated into the nascent peptide chain by means of genetic code reprogramming. Post-translational reduction of the azide induced an O-to-N acyl shift to rearrange the peptide backbone. This method allows for one-pot ribosomal synthesis of designer macrocycles bearing various β-, γ- and δ-type Hhc units. We also report the synthesis of a statine-containing peptidomimetic inhibitor of β-secretase 1 as a showcase example. Despite recent advances in engineering of in vitro translation systems, direct ribosomal incorporation of hydroxyhydrocarbon moieties—which can endow peptides with unique biochemical/folding properties—remains challenging. Now, incorporation of translation-compatible azide/hydroxy acids and their post-translational tandem backbone-acyl shifts have enabled in vitro ribosomal synthesis of peptides containing various hydroxyhydrocarbon units.},

  abstract     = {Two quantum effects can enable reactions to take place at energies below the barrier separating reactants from products: tunnelling and intersystem crossing between coupled potential energy surfaces. Here we show that intersystem crossing in the region between the pre-reactive complex and the reaction barrier can control the rate of bimolecular reactions for weakly coupled potential energy surfaces, even in the absence of heavy atoms. For O(3P) plus pyridine, a reaction relevant to combustion, astrochemistry and biochemistry, crossed-beam experiments indicate that the dominant products are pyrrole and CO, obtained through a spin-forbidden ring-contraction mechanism. The experimental findings are interpreted—by high-level quantum-chemical calculations and statistical non-adiabatic computations of branching fractions—in terms of an efficient intersystem crossing occurring before the high entrance barrier for O-atom addition to the N-atom lone pair. At low to moderate temperatures, the computed reaction rates prove to be dominated by intersystem crossing. Intersystem crossing in reaction entrance channels usually arises from ‘heavy-atom’ effects. Now molecular-beam experiments show that even without heavy atoms, the O(3P) + pyridine reaction leads to spin-forbidden pyrrole + CO products. Theoretical calculations reveal efficient intersystem crossing before the entrance barrier for O-atom addition to the N-atom lone pair, which dominates reactivity at low to moderate temperatures.},

  abstract     = {Chemical recycling of polymers is critical for improving the circular economy of plastics and environmental sustainability. Traditional thermoset polymers have generally been considered permanently crosslinked materials that are difficult or impossible to recycle. Herein, we demonstrate that by activating ‘dormant’ covalent bonds, traditional polycyanurate thermosets can be recycled into the original monomers, which can be circularly reused for their original purpose. Through retrosynthetic analysis, we redirected the synthetic route from forming conventional C–N bonds via irreversible cyanate trimerization to forming the C–O bonds through reversible nucleophilic aromatic substitution of alkoxy-substituted triazine derivatives by alcohol nucleophiles. The new reversible synthetic route enabled the synthesis of previously inaccessible alkyl-polycyanurate thermosets, which exhibit excellent film properties with high chemical resistance, closed-loop recyclability and reprocessing capability. These results show that ‘apparently dormant’ dynamic linkages can be activated and utilized to construct fully recyclable thermoset polymers with a broader monomer scope and increased sustainability. Alkyl and aryl polycyanurate networks have now been prepared through polymerization of diols and substituted triazines via a dynamic SNAr reaction. When treated with excess mono alcohol or phenol, the polycyanurate networks can be depolymerized into the starting monomers, which can be separated and reused, thus achieving closed-loop recycling.},

  abstract     = {The combination of next-generation DNA sequencing technologies and bioinformatics has revitalized natural product discovery. Using a bioinformatic search strategy, we recently identified ∼600 gene clusters in otherwise overlooked streptococci that code for ribosomal peptide natural products synthesized by radical S-adenosylmethionine enzymes. These grouped into 16 subfamilies and pointed to an unexplored microbiome biosynthetic landscape. Here we report the structure, biosynthesis and function of one of these natural product groups, which we term enteropeptins, from the gut microbe Enterococcus cecorum. We show three reactions in the biosynthesis of enteropeptins that are each catalysed by a different family of metalloenzymes. Among these, we characterize the founding member of a widespread superfamily of Fe–S-containing methyltransferases, which, together with an Mn2+-dependent arginase, installs N-methylornithine in the peptide sequence. Biological assays with the mature product revealed bacteriostatic activity only against the producing strain, extending an emerging theme of fratricidal or self-inhibitory metabolites in microbiome firmicutes. Enteropeptins are peptide natural products produced by the gut microbe Enterococcus cecorum. Now, the structure, biosynthesis and function of enteropeptins have been determined. After ribosomal biosynthesis, enteropeptins are post-translationally modified in three reactions carried out by a radical S-adenosylmethionine enzyme, an Mn2+-dependent arginase, and an Fe–S-containing methyltransferase, respectively, to form the N-methylornithine-containing peptide natural products.},

  abstract     = {Chiral π-conjugated molecules bring new functionality to technological applications and represent an exciting, rapidly expanding area of research. Their functional properties, such as the absorption and emission of circularly polarized light or the transport of spin-polarized electrons, are highly anisotropic. As a result, the orientation of chiral molecules critically determines the functionality and efficiency of chiral devices. Here we present a strategy to control the orientation of a small chiral molecule (2,2′-dicyano[6]helicene) by the use of organic and inorganic templating layers. Such templating layers can either force 2,2′-dicyano[6]helicene to adopt a face-on orientation and self-assemble into upright supramolecular columns oriented with their helical axis perpendicular to the substrate, or an edge-on orientation with parallel-lying supramolecular columns. Through such control, we show that low- and high-energy chiroptical responses can be independently ‘turned on’ or ‘turned off’. The templating methodologies described here provide a simple way to engineer orientational control and, by association, anisotropic functional properties of chiral molecular systems for a range of emerging technologies. The properties of chiral conjugated molecules, such as the absorption and/or emission of circularly polarized light or electron transport, are highly anisotropic. Now it has been shown that templating layers can control the orientation and anisotropic properties of small chiral molecules in bulk thin films useful for a range of emerging technologies.},

  abstract     = {G-protein-coupled receptors signal through cognate G proteins. Despite the widespread importance of these receptors, their regulatory mechanisms for G-protein selectivity are not fully understood. Here we present a native mass spectrometry-based approach to interrogate both biased signalling and allosteric modulation of the β1-adrenergic receptor in response to various ligands. By simultaneously capturing the effects of ligand binding and receptor coupling to different G proteins, we probed the relative importance of specific interactions with the receptor through systematic changes in 14 ligands, including isoprenaline derivatives, full and partial agonists, and antagonists. We observed enhanced dynamics of the intracellular loop 3 in the presence of isoprenaline, which is capable of acting as a biased agonist. We also show here that endogenous zinc ions augment the binding in receptor–Gs complexes and propose a zinc ion-binding hotspot at the TM5/TM6 intracellular interface of the receptor–Gs complex. Further interrogation led us to propose a mechanism in which zinc ions facilitate a structural transition of the intermediate complex towards the stable state. Native mass spectrometry has been used to interrogate both biased signalling and allosteric modulation of the β1-adrenergic receptor. Simultaneously capturing the effects of ligand binding and receptor coupling to different G proteins has enabled the relative importance of specific interactions to be investigated.},

  abstract     = {The isotopic labelling of small molecules is integral to drug development and for understanding biochemical processes. The preparation of carbon-labelled α-amino acids remains difficult and time consuming, with established methods involving label incorporation at an early stage of synthesis. This explains the high cost and scarcity of C-labelled products and presents a major challenge in 11C applications (11C t1/2 = 20 min). Here we report that aldehydes catalyse the isotopic carboxylate exchange of native α-amino acids with *CO2 (* = 14, 13, 11). Proteinogenic α-amino acids and many non-natural variants containing diverse functional groups undergo labelling. The reaction probably proceeds via the trapping of *CO2 by imine-carboxylate intermediates to generate iminomalonates that are prone to monodecarboxylation. Tempering catalyst electrophilicity was key to preventing irreversible aldehyde consumption. The pre-generation of the imine carboxylate intermediate allows for the rapid and late-stage 11C-radiolabelling of α-amino acids in the presence of [11C]CO2. Carbon-labelled α-amino acids are valuable compounds in drug development and nuclear medicine, but are difficult and time consuming to prepare. Now, an aldehyde-catalysed method has been developed for the direct C1-labelling of α-amino acids using *CO2 (* = 14, 13, 11), providing access to many proteinogenic and non-natural labelled α-amino acids.},

  abstract     = {The synthesis and study of radioactive compounds are both inherently limited by their toxicity, cost and isotope scarcity. Traditional methods using small inorganic or organic complexes typically require milligrams of sample—per attempt—which for some isotopes is equivalent to the world’s annual supply. Here we demonstrate that polyoxometalates (POMs) enable the facile formation, crystallization, handling and detailed characterization of metal–ligand complexes from microgram quantities owing to their high molecular weight and controllable solubility properties. Three curium–POM complexes were prepared, using just 1–10 μg per synthesis of the rare isotope 248Cm3+, and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, showing an eight-coordinated Cm3+ centre. Moreover, spectrophotometric, fluorescence, NMR and Raman analyses of several f-block element–POM complexes, including 243Am3+ and 248Cm3+, showed otherwise unnoticeable differences between their solution versus solid-state chemistry, and actinide versus lanthanide behaviour. This POM-driven strategy represents a viable path to isolate even rarer complexes, notably with actinium or transcalifornium elements. The study of rare isotopes is hampered by their scarcity, cost and sometimes toxicity. Now polyoxometalate ligands have been shown to facilitate the capture of f-block elements and their characterization. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction structures have been obtained for several molecular complexes, including three of the rare curium-248, from minute amounts (micrograms) of material.},

  abstract     = {In the effort to generate sustainable clean energy from abundant resources such as water and carbon dioxide, solar fuel production—the combination of solar-light harvesting and the generation of efficient chemical energy carriers—by artificial molecular photosystems is very attractive. Molecular constituents that display attractive features for chemical energy conversion (such as high product selectivity and atom economy) have been developed, and their interfacing with host materials has enabled recyclability, controlled site positioning, as well as access to fundamental insights into the catalytic mechanism and environment-governed selectivity. Among the wide variety of supports, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) possess valuable characteristics (such as their porosity and versatility) that can influence the reaction environment and material architecture in a unique fashion. Here we highlight the various existing synthetic strategies to graft molecular complexes such as catalysts and photosensitizers onto MOFs for solar fuel production. The opportunities and limitations of one-pot and stepwise approaches are critically assessed, and the resulting materials are discussed based on their photocatalytic performances and the practical applicability of selected examples. The light-driven conversion of abundant resources such as CO2 and H2O into chemical fuels for energy storage is crucial to end our dependence on fossil fuels. This Review highlights how molecular catalysts and photosensitizers can be grafted onto metal–organic frameworks to combine the advantages of both classes of compounds. Different synthetic strategies are discussed, along with their advantages and limitations.},

Here we report the discovery of a family of graspetides, the gene clusters of which also encode an O-methyltransferase with homology to the protein repair catalyst protein l-isoaspartyl methyltransferase. Using heterologous expression, we produced fuscimiditide, a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP). NMR analysis of fuscimiditide revealed that the peptide contains two ester cross-links forming a stem–loop macrocycle. Furthermore, an unusually stable aspartimide moiety is found within the loop macrocycle. We fully reconstituted fuscimiditide biosynthesis in vitro including formation of the ester and aspartimide moieties. The aspartimide moiety embedded in fuscimiditide hydrolyses regioselectively to isoaspartate. Surprisingly, this isoaspartate-containing peptide is also a substrate for the l-isoaspartyl methyltransferase homologue, thus driving any hydrolysis products back to the aspartimide form. Whereas an aspartimide is often considered a nuisance product in protein formulations, our data suggest that some RiPPs have aspartimide residues intentionally installed via enzymatic activity. The biosynthesis of fuscimiditide, a ribosomally synthesized post-translationally modified peptide, has now been reported. Heterologous expression and analysis of fuscimiditide showed it contained two side-chain–side-chain ester linkages and an aspartimide in its backbone. The aspartimide moiety is unexpectedly stable, suggesting this structure is the intended natural product.},

Here, using high-resolution cryo-adsorption studies together with characterization by inelastic neutron scattering vibration spectroscopy, we show that, near its boiling point (~20 K), H2 adsorbed on a well-ordered mesoporous silica forms a two-dimensional monolayer with a density more than twice that of bulk-solid H2, rather than a bilayer. Theoretical studies, based on thorough first-principles calculations, rationalize the formation of such a super-dense phase. The strong compression of the hydrogen surface layer is due to the excess of surface–hydrogen attraction over intermolecular hydrogen repulsion. Use of this super-dense hydrogen monolayer on an adsorbent might be a feasible option for the storage of hydrogen near its boiling point, compared with adsorption at 77 K. In some cases, hydrogen adsorption close to its boiling temperature shows unusually high monolayer capacities, but the microscopic nature of this adsorbate phase is not well understood. Now, H2 adsorbed on a well-ordered mesoporous silica surface has been shown to form a 2D monolayer with very short H2···H2 intermolecular distances and a density more than twice that of bulk-solid H2.},

  abstract     = {Robotic systems for synthetic chemistry are becoming more common, but they are expensive, fixed to a narrow set of reactions, and must be used within a complex laboratory environment. A portable system that could synthesize known molecules anywhere, on demand, and in a fully automated way, could revolutionize access to important molecules. Here we present a portable suitcase-sized chemical synthesis platform containing all the modules required for synthesis and purification. The system uses a chemical programming language coupled to a digital reactor generator to produce reactors and executable protocols based on text-based literature syntheses. Simultaneously, the platform generates a reaction pressure fingerprint, used to monitor processes within the reactors and remotely perform a protocol quality control. We demonstrate the system by synthesizing five small organic molecules, four oligopeptides and four oligonucleotides, in good yields and purities, with a total of 24,936 base steps executed over 329 h of platform runtime. Automated systems, nowadays more commonly used in laboratory settings, are typically fixed to a narrow set of reactions and used within a complex laboratory environment. Now, a portable platform has been developed for the on-demand and on-site multistep synthesis of organic molecules, oligonucleotides and oligopeptides mapped into reactionware systems.},

  abstract     = {The rapid assembly of complex scaffolds in a single step from simple precursors identifies as an ideal reaction in terms of efficiency and sustainability. Indeed, the direct single-step synthesis of complex alkaloid frameworks remains an unresolved problem at the heart of organic chemistry in spite of the tremendous progress of the discipline. Herein, we present a broad strategy in which dynamically assembled ternary complexes are converted into valuable azabicyclic scaffolds based on the concept of inverse hydride shuttle catalysis. The ternary complexes are readily constructed in situ from three simple precursors and enable a highly modular installation of various substitution patterns. Upon subjection to a unique dual-catalytic system, the transient intermediates undergo an unusual hydride shuttle process that is initiated by a hydride donation event. Furthermore, we show that, in combination with asymmetric organocatalysis, the product alkaloid frameworks are obtained in excellent optical purity. The rapid assembly of complex scaffolds in a single step from simple precursors would be an ideal reaction in terms of efficiency and sustainability. Now, the single-step construction of alkaloid-like frameworks from three dynamically assembled precursors has been reported. Using a dual-catalytic system, the transformation involves a hydride shuttle process initiated by a hydride donation event.},

Here we report on the in vitro evolution and engineering of a highly specific modular RNA endonuclease XNAzyme, FR6_1, composed of 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-β-d-arabino nucleic acid (FANA). FR6_1 overcomes the activity limitations of previous DNA- and XNAzymes and can be retargeted to cleave highly structured full-length (&amp;gt;5 kb) BRAF and KRAS mRNAs at physiological Mg2+ concentrations with allelic selectivity for tumour-associated (BRAF V600E and KRAS G12D) mutations. Phosphorothioate-FANA modification enhances FR6_1 biostability and enables rapid KRAS mRNA knockdown in cultured human adenocarcinoma cells with a G12D-allele-specific component provided by in vivo XNAzyme cleavage activity. These results provide a starting point for the development of improved gene-silencing agents based on FANA or other XNA chemistries. Oligonucleotide catalysts such as ribozymes and DNAzymes can cleave RNA efficiently and specifically but are typically dependent on high concentrations of divalent cations, limiting their biological applications. A modular XNAzyme catalyst composed of 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-β-d-arabino nucleic acid (FANA) has now been developed that can cleave long (&amp;gt;5 kb), highly structured mRNAs under physiological conditions and enables allele-specific catalytic RNA knockdown inside cells.},

Here we report the observation of excitation-energy-transfer pathways involving delocalized optical excitations of the bilin (linear tetrapyrrole) chromophores in intact phycobilisomes isolated from Fremyella diplosiphon. By using broadband multidimensional electronic spectroscopy with 6.7-fs laser pulses, we are able to follow the progress of excitation energy from the phycoerythrin disks at the ends of the phycobilisome’s rods to the C-phycocyanin disks along their length in &amp;lt;600 fs. Oscillation maps show that coherent wavepacket motions prominently involving the hydrogen out-of-plane vibrations of the bilins mediate non-adiabatic relaxation of a manifold of vibronic exciton states. However, the charge-transfer character of the bilins in the allophycocyanin-containing segments localizes the excitations in the core of the phycobilisome, yielding a kinetic bottleneck that enables photoregulatory mechanisms to operate efficiently on the &amp;gt;10-ps timescale.

Now, using broadband multidimensional spectroscopy, delocalized vibronic excitations and sub-picosecond excitation transfer pathways have been observed in the rods of intact phycobilisomes.

Insights into the molecular interactions of FG-repeat nucleoporins have, however, remained largely elusive. Using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and cryoelectron microscopy, we have identified uniformly spaced segments of transient β-structure and a stable preformed α-helix recognized by messenger RNA export factors in the FG-repeat domain of human nucleoporin 98 (Nup98). In addition, we have determined at high resolution the molecular organization of reversible FG–FG interactions in amyloid fibrils formed by a highly aggregation-prone segment in Nup98. We have further demonstrated that amyloid-like aggregates of the FG-repeat domain of Nup98 have low stability and are reversible. Our results provide critical insights into the molecular interactions underlying the self-association and phase separation of FG-repeat nucleoporins in physiological and pathological cell activities. Proteins rich in phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats can phase separate through FG–FG interactions. The molecular interactions of an important FG-repeat protein, nucleoporin 98, have now been studied in liquid-like transient and amyloid-like cohesive states. These interactions underlie the behaviour of FG-repeat proteins and their function in physiological and pathological cell activities.},

Tetracyclines, macrolides, streptogramins and lincosamides are now accessible through flexible and general synthetic routes. Pleuromutilins (antibiotics based on the fungal metabolite pleuromutilin) have remained resistant to this approach, in large part due to the difficulties encountered in the de novo construction of the decahydro-3a,9-propanocyclopenta[8]annulene skeleton. Here we present a platform for the total synthesis of pleuromutilins that provides access to diverse derivatives bearing alterations at previously inaccessible skeletal and peripheral positions. The synthesis is enabled by the serendipitous discovery of a vinylogous Wolff rearrangement, which serves to establish the C9 quaternary centre in the targets, and the development of a highly diastereoselective butynylation of an α-quaternary aldehyde, which forms the C14 secondary alcohol. The versatility of the route is demonstrated through the synthesis of seventeen structurally distinct derivatives, with many possessing potent antibacterial activity. General synthetic methods to access pleuromutilin antibiotics are limited due to their complex carbocyclic skeleton. Now, a synthetic platform has been developed to access structurally diverse pleuromutilins with variations at the quaternary C12 position and hydrindanone cores. Seventeen structurally distinct derivatives were prepared and evaluated against a panel of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.},

Nitrite reduction typically takes place within the coordination sphere of a redox-active transition metal. Here we show that Lewis acid coordination can substantially modify the reduction potential of this polyoxoanion to allow for its reduction under non-aqueous conditions (−0.74 V versus NHE). Detailed characterization confirms the formation of the borane-capped radical nitrite dianion (NO22−), which features a N(II) oxidation state. Protonation of the nitrite dianion results in the facile loss of nitric oxide (NO), whereas its reaction with NO results in disproportionation to nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitrite (NO2−). This system connects three redox levels in the global nitrogen cycle and provides fundamental insights into the conversion of NO2− to NO. The reduction of nitrite (NO2−) to nitric oxide (NO), relevant to the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle as well as radioactive waste, typically occurs at redox-active metal centres. Now, a Lewis acid-capped nitrite has been reduced to the nitrite dianion (NO22−), a nitrogen-centred radical that connects three redox levels in the global nitrogen cycle through NO2−, NO and N2O.},

However, the harsh reaction conditions required, even with metal catalysts, constrains the range of feasible crosslinkers. We report here a photoinduced IV that enables reaction at ambient temperatures, greatly broadening the scope for both substrates and products. These conditions enable volatile and gaseous alkenes and alkynes to be used in IV, leading to sustainable alternatives for environmentally harmful plastics that were hitherto inaccessible. Density functional theory calculations reveal different energy barriers for thermal, catalytic and photoinduced IV processes. This protocol circumvents the long curing times that are common in IV, generates no H2S by-products, and produces high-molecular-weight polymers (up to 460,000 g mol−1) with almost 100% atom economy. This photoinduced IV strategy advances both the fundamental chemistry of IV and its potential industrial application to generate materials from waste feedstocks. Inverse vulcanization (IV) generates sulfur-rich functional polymers from elemental sulfur and organic crosslinkers, but the harsh reaction conditions required limit the scope of suitable crosslinkers. Now, a photoinduced IV has been shown to proceed at ambient temperatures, enabling the use of volatile and gaseous alkenes and alkynes as crosslinkers and broadening the range of products.},

The most straightforward way is to recover a used catalyst after the synthesis of cyclic polymers and reuse it. Unfortunately, this is demanding because of the catalyst’s vulnerability and inseparability from polymers, which reduce the practicality of the process. Here we develop a continuous circular process, where polymerization, polymer separation and catalyst recovery happen in situ, to dispense a pure cyclic polymer after bulk ring-expansion metathesis polymerization of cyclopentene. It is enabled by introducing silica-supported ruthenium catalysts and newly designed glassware. Different depolymerization kinetics of the cyclic polymer from its linear analogue are also discussed. This process minimizes manual labour, maximizes the security of vulnerable catalysts and guarantees the purity of cyclic polymers, thereby showcasing a prototype of a scalable access to cyclic polymers with increased turnovers (≥415,000) of precious catalysts. Cyclic polymers are topologically interesting and envisioned as a lubricant material, but methods for the scalable synthesis of pure cyclic polymers are currently elusive. Now, a scalable process has been developed by leveraging heterogeneity of the catalysts with the help of compartmentalized custom glassware, namely, a cyclic polymer dispenser.},

  abstract     = {The high efficiency of widely applied Noyori-type hydrogenation catalysts arises from the N–H moiety coordinated to a metal centre, which stabilizes rate-determining transition states through hydrogen-bonding interactions. It was proposed that a higher efficiency could be achieved by substituting an N–M′ group (M′ = alkali metals) for the N–H moiety using a large excess of metal alkoxides (M′OR); however, such a metal-hydride amidate intermediate has not yet been isolated. Here we present the synthesis, isolation and reactivity of a metal-hydride amidate complex (HMn–NLi). Kinetic studies show that the rate of hydride transfer from HMn–NLi to a ketone is 24-fold higher than that of the corresponding amino metal-hydride complex (HMn–NH). Moreover, the hydrogenation of N-alkyl-substituted aldimines was realized using HMn–NLi as the active catalyst, whereas HMn–NH is much less effective. These results highlight the superiority of M/NM′ bifunctional catalysis over the classic M/NH bifunctional catalysis for hydrogenation reactions. Noyori-type hydrogenation catalysts consist of an N–H moiety coordinated to a metal centre. Now, a metal-hydride amidate complex (HMn–NLi) has been isolated and found to have superior reactivity and catalytic performance compared with the corresponding HMn–NH complex, highlighting the superiority of M/NM′ bifunctional catalysis over the classic M/NH bifunctional catalysis for hydrogenation reactions.},

  abstract     = {Engineered far-from-equilibrium synthetic chemical networks that pulse or switch states in response to environmental signals could precisely regulate the kinetics of chemical synthesis or self-assembly. Currently, such networks must be extensively tuned to compensate for the different activities of and unintended reactions between a network’s various chemical components. Modular elements with standardized performance could be used to rapidly construct networks with designed functions. Here we develop standardized excitable chemical regulatory elements, termed genelets, and use them to construct complex in vitro transcriptional networks. We develop a protocol for identifying &amp;gt;15 interchangeable genelet elements with uniform performance and minimal crosstalk. These elements can be combined to engineer feedforward and feedback modules whose dynamics match those predicted by a simple kinetic model. Modules can then be rationally integrated and organized into networks that produce tunable temporal pulses and act as multistate switchable memories. Standardized genelet elements, and the workflow to identify more, should make engineering complex far-from-equilibrium chemical dynamics routine. Synthetic chemical networks with far-from-equilibrium dynamics akin to genetic regulatory networks in living cells could precisely regulate the kinetics of chemical synthesis or self-assembly. Now standardized excitable chemical regulatory elements, termed genelets, that enable predictive bottom-up construction of in vitro networks with designed temporal and multistable behaviour have been developed.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen has the highest gravimetric energy density of any energy carrier and produces water as the only oxidation product, making it extremely attractive for both transportation and stationary power applications. However, its low volumetric energy density causes considerable difficulties, inspiring intense efforts to develop chemical-based storage using metal hydrides, liquid organic hydrogen carriers and sorbents. The controlled uptake and release of hydrogen by these materials can be described as a series of challenges: optimal properties fall within a narrow range, can only be found in few materials and often involve important trade-offs. In addition, a greater understanding of the complex kinetics, mass transport and microstructural phenomena associated with hydrogen uptake and release is needed. The goal of this Perspective is to delineate potential use cases, define key challenges and show that solutions will involve a nexus of several subdisciplines of chemistry, including catalysis, data science, nanoscience, interfacial phenomena and dynamic or phase-change materials. Hydrogen, which possesses the highest gravimetric energy density of any energy carrier, is attractive for both mobile and stationary power, but its low volumetric energy density poses major storage and transport challenges. This Perspective delineates potential use cases and defines the challenges facing the development of materials for efficient hydrogen storage.},

A recently identified example is the plant-root-associated marine bacterium Gynuella sunshinyii of the chemically underexplored order Oceanospirillales. Its genome contains at least 22 biosynthetic gene clusters, suggesting a rich and mostly uncharacterized specialized metabolism. Here, in silico chemical prediction of a non-canonical polyketide synthase cluster has led to the discovery of janustatins, structurally unprecedented polyketide alkaloids with potent cytotoxicity that are produced in minute quantities. A combination of MS and two-dimensional NMR experiments, density functional theory calculations of 13C chemical shifts and semiquantitative interpretation of transverse rotating-frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy data were conducted to determine the relative configuration, which enabled the total synthesis of both enantiomers and assignment of the absolute configuration. Janustatins feature a previously unknown pyridodihydropyranone heterocycle and an unusual biological activity consisting of delayed, synchronized cell death at subnanomolar concentrations. In silico chemical prediction of a polyketide synthase gene cluster in the bacterium Gynuella sunshinyii has led to the discovery of a class of natural products called janustatins. The absolute configuration of the stereocentres in these compounds was determined by a combination of techniques including DFT calculations and 2D NMR experiments—and finally confirmed by total synthesis.

Here an efficient palladium-catalysed coupling protocol involving propargylic compounds has been developed, providing a solid and versatile strategy for the rapid assembly of symmetric butafulvene derivatives. Based on mechanistic studies, two complementary mechanisms, both involving palladium catalysis, have been confirmed. With the mechanism unveiled, the synthesis of non-symmetric butafulvenes has also been achieved. Advantages of this strategy include tolerance to a wide range of propargylic molecules, mild reaction conditions, simple catalytic systems and easy scalability.

Here we disclose a metal-free, energy-transfer enabled highly regioselective intermolecular aminocarboxylation reaction for the single-step installation of both amine and ester functionalities into alkenes or (hetero)arenes. A bifunctional oxime oxalate ester was developed to simultaneously generate C-centred ester and N-centred iminyl radicals. This mild method features a remarkably broad substrate scope (up to 140 examples) and excellent tolerance of sensitive functional groups, and substrates that range from the simplest ethylene to complex (hetero)arenes can participate in the reaction, thus offering a general and practical access to β-amino acid derivatives.

  abstract     = {Co-translational folding is crucial to ensure the production of biologically active proteins. The ribosome can alter the folding pathways of nascent polypeptide chains, yet a structural understanding remains largely inaccessible experimentally. We have developed site-specific labelling of nascent chains to detect and measure, using 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, multiple states accessed by an immunoglobulin-like domain within a tandem repeat protein during biosynthesis. By examining ribosomes arrested at different stages during translation of this common structural motif, we observe highly broadened NMR resonances attributable to two previously unidentified intermediates, which are stably populated across a wide folding transition. Using molecular dynamics simulations and corroborated by cryo-electron microscopy, we obtain models of these partially folded states, enabling experimental verification of a ribosome-binding site that contributes to their high stabilities. We thus demonstrate a mechanism by which the ribosome could thermodynamically regulate folding and other co-translational processes. Most proteins must fold co-translationally on the ribosome to adopt biologically active conformations, yet structural, mechanistic descriptions are lacking. Using 19F NMR spectroscopy to study a nascent multi-domain protein has now enabled the identification of two co-translational folding intermediates that are significantly more stable than intermediates formed off the ribosome, suggesting that the ribosome may thermodynamically regulate folding.},

To date, experimental investigations of intermolecular charge transport in molecular materials and electronic devices have been restricted to conjugated systems in which π–π stacking interactions are involved. Herein we demonstrate that the σ–σ stacking interactions between neighbouring non-conjugated molecules offer an efficient pathway for charge transport through supramolecular junctions. The conductance of σ–σ stacked molecular junctions formed between two non-conjugated cyclohexanethiol or single-anchored adamantane molecules is comparable to that of π–π stacked molecular junctions formed between π-conjugated benzene rings. The current–voltage characteristics and flicker noise analysis demonstrate the existence of stacked molecular junctions formed between the electrode pairs and exhibit the characteristics of through-space charge transport. Density functional theory calculations combined with the non-equilibrium Green’s function method reveal that efficient charge transport occurs between two molecules configured with σ–σ stacking interactions. Supramolecular interactions play an essential role in organic electronic materials and biological systems. Now, it has been demonstrated that the σ–σ stacking interactions between neighbouring non-conjugated molecules can offer an efficient pathway for charge transport through supramolecular junctions, which provides a new guideline for the design and fabrication of organic materials and devices.},

  abstract     = {Low-valent aluminium compounds are very reactive main-group species and have therefore been widely investigated. Since the isolation of a stable molecular Al(I) compound in 1991, [(AlCp*)4] (Cp* = [C5Me5]–), a variety of highly reactive neutral or anionic low-valent aluminium complexes have been developed. By contrast, their cationic counterparts have remained difficult to access. Here, we report the synthesis of [Al(AlCp*)3]+[Al(ORF)4]– (RF = C(CF3)3) through a simple metathesis reaction between [(AlCp*)4] and Li[Al(ORF)4]. Unexpectedly, the [Al(AlCp*)3]+ salt forms a dimer in the solid state and concentrated solutions. Addition of Lewis bases results in monomerization and coordination to the unique formal Al+ atom, giving [(L)xAl(AlCp*)3]+ salts where L is hexaphenylcarbodiphosphorane (x = 1), tetramethylethylenediamine (x = 1) or 4-dimethylaminopyridine (x = 3). The Al+–AlCp* bonds in the resulting [(L)xAl(AlCp*)3]+ cluster cations can be finely tuned between very strong (with no ligand L) to very weak and approaching isolated [Al(L)3]+ ions (when L is dimethylaminopyridine). Although neutral and anionic low-valent aluminium complexes are widespread, their cationic counterparts have remained rare. Now, a salt of [Al(AlCp*)3]+ featuring a formal low-valent Al+ cation has been isolated that dimerizes in concentrated solutions and the solid state, and also forms Al4 clusters on coordinating with Lewis bases.},

  abstract     = {The Strecker reaction of aldehydes is the pre-eminent pathway to explain the prebiotic origins of α-amino acids. However, biology employs transamination of α-ketoacids to synthesize amino acids which are then transformed to nucleobases, implying an evolutionary switch—abiotically or biotically—of a prebiotic pathway involving the Strecker reaction into today’s biosynthetic pathways. Here we show that α-ketoacids react with cyanide and ammonia sources to form the corresponding α-amino acids through the Bucherer–Bergs pathway. An efficient prebiotic transformation of oxaloacetate to aspartate via N-carbamoyl aspartate enables the simultaneous formation of dihydroorotate, paralleling the biochemical synthesis of orotate as the precursor to pyrimidine nucleobases. Glyoxylate forms both glycine and orotate and reacts with malonate and urea to form aspartate and dihydroorotate. These results, along with the previously demonstrated protometabolic analogues of the Krebs cycle, suggest that there can be a natural emergence of congruent forerunners of biological pathways with the potential for seamless transition from prebiotic chemistry to modern metabolism. The apparent disconnect between prebiotic aldehyde-based Strecker synthesis of amino acids and the α-ketoacid-based metabolism of extant biochemistry necessitates an evolutionary switch between these disparate chemistries. Now it has been shown that Bucherer–Bergs reactions of α-ketoacids produce α-amino acids and dihydroorotate, paralleling the biochemical synthesis of orotate and suggesting a more congruent evolutionary pathway from cyanide-based chemistries.},

  abstract     = {Recent high-pressure NMR results indicate that the preactive conformation of the β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) harbours completely empty cavities of ~100 Å3 volume, which disappear in the active conformation of the receptor. Here we have localized these cavities using X-ray crystallography of xenon-derivatized β1AR crystals. One of the cavities is in direct contact with the cholesterol-binding pocket. Solution NMR shows that addition of the cholesterol analogue cholesteryl hemisuccinate impedes the formation of the active conformation of detergent-solubilized β1AR by blocking conserved G protein-coupled receptor microswitches, concomitant with an affinity reduction of both isoprenaline and G protein-mimicking nanobody Nb80 for β1AR detected by isothermal titration calorimetry. This wedge-like action explains the function of cholesterol as a negative allosteric modulator of β1AR. A detailed understanding of G protein-coupled receptor regulation by cholesterol by filling of a dry void and the easy scouting for such voids by xenon may provide new routes for the development of allosteric drugs. The β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) contains empty cavities in its preactive conformation, which disappear in the active one. Now, using X-ray crystallography of xenon-derivatized β1AR crystals, a cavity has been shown to be in contact with the cholesterol-binding pocket. Monitoring the binding of a cholesterol analogue in solution has explained the function of cholesterol as a negative allosteric modulator of β1AR.},

  abstract     = {Directly contrasting ultrafast excited-state dynamics in the gas and liquid phases is crucial to understanding the influence of complex environments. Previous studies have often relied on different spectroscopic observables, rendering direct comparisons challenging. Here, we apply extreme-ultraviolet time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy to both gaseous and liquid cis-stilbene, revealing the coupled electronic and nuclear dynamics that underlie its isomerization. Our measurements track the excited-state wave packets from excitation along the complete reaction path to the final products. We observe coherent excited-state vibrational dynamics in both phases of matter that persist to the final products, enabling the characterization of the branching space of the S1–S0 conical intersection. We observe a systematic lengthening of the relaxation timescales in the liquid phase and a red shift of the measured excited-state frequencies that is most pronounced for the complex reaction coordinate. These results characterize in detail the influence of the liquid environment on both electronic and structural dynamics during a complete photochemical transformation. The influence that liquid environments have on the ultrafast excited-state dynamics of molecules is poorly understood. Using time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, the dynamics of the photoisomerization of stilbene in the gas and liquid phases have now been shown to be qualitatively similar—including the observation of vibrational coherences—but the timescales are significantly longer in the liquid phase.},

  abstract     = {Amines are prominent in natural products, pharmaceutical agents and agrochemicals. Moreover, they are synthetically valuable building blocks for the construction of complex organic molecules and functional materials. However, amines, especially aliphatic and aromatic amines with free N–H bonds, tend to coordinate with transition metals and deactivate the catalyst, posing a tremendous challenge to applying Lewis basic amines in the amination of olefins. Here we present an example of oxidative amination of simple olefins with various Lewis basic amines. The combination of a palladium catalyst, 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone and a phosphorous ligand leads to the efficient synthesis of alkyl and aryl allylamines. A series of allylamines were obtained with good yields and excellent regio- and stereoselectivities. Intramolecular amination to synthesize tetrahydropyrrole and piperidine derivatives was also realized. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction undergoes allylic C(sp3)–H activation and subsequent functionalization. Given the importance of amine compounds, methods for their synthesis continue to be in high demand. Now, a palladium-catalysed strategy has been developed for the selective oxidative amination of unactivated olefins with Lewis basic amines, via C(sp3)–H activation, forming architecturally versatile and functionally diverse allylamines in a single step.},

Some membraneless organelles host two or more compartments serving different putative biochemical roles. The mechanisms for, and functional consequences of, this subcompartmentalization are not yet well understood. Here we show that adjacent phases of decapeptide-based multiphase model membraneless organelles differ markedly in their interactions with RNA. Single- and double-stranded RNAs preferentially accumulate in different phases within the same droplet, and one phase is more destabilizing for RNA duplexes than the other. Single-phase peptide droplets did not capture this behaviour. Phase coexistence introduces new thermodynamic equilibria that alter RNA duplex stability and RNA sorting by hybridization state. These effects require neither biospecific RNA-binding sites nor full-length proteins. As such, they are more general and point to primitive versions of mechanisms operating in extant biology that could aid understanding and enable the design of functional artificial membraneless organelles. The biochemical roles and mechanisms of multiphase membraneless organelles are not yet well understood. Now, multiphase peptide droplets have been shown to sort RNA based on whether it is single- or double-stranded, as well as impact RNA duplexation through in-droplet thermodynamic equilibria. This work provides insight into possible primitive mechanisms for multicompartment intracellular condensates and can aid in the design of functional artificial membraneless organelles.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous organic redox flow batteries offer a safe and potentially inexpensive solution to the problem of storing massive amounts of electricity produced from intermittent renewables. However, molecular decomposition represents a major barrier to commercialization—and although structural modifications can improve stability, it comes at the expense of synthetic cost and molecular weight. Now, utilizing 2,6-dihydroxy-anthraquinone (DHAQ) without further structural modification, we demonstrate that the regeneration of the original molecule after decomposition represents a viable route to achieve low-cost, long-lifetime aqueous organic redox flow batteries. We used in situ (online) NMR and electron paramagnetic resonance, and complementary electrochemical analyses to show that the decomposition compound 2,6-dihydroxy-anthrone (DHA) and its tautomer, 2,6-dihydroxy-anthranol (DHAL) can be recomposed to DHAQ electrochemically through two steps: oxidation of DHA(L)2− to the dimer (DHA)24− by one-electron transfer followed by oxidation of (DHA)24− to DHAQ2− by three-electron transfer per DHAQ molecule. This electrochemical regeneration process also rejuvenates the positive electrolyte—rebalancing the states of charge of both electrolytes without introducing extra ions. Aqueous organic redox flow batteries offer a safe and inexpensive solution to the problem of storing electricity produced from intermittent renewables. However, decomposition of the redox-active organic molecules that they rely on limits their lifetimes, preventing commercialization. Now it has been shown that these redox molecules can be electro-recomposed in situ, rejuvenating their function.},

ICD is efficient when intermolecular interactions are active and consequently it is observed only in weakly bound systems, such as clusters and hydrogen-bonded systems. Here we report an efficient ICD between unbound molecules excited at ambient-light intensities. On the photoexcitation of gas-phase pyridine monomers, well below the ionization threshold and at low laser intensities, we detected the parent and heavier-than-parent cations. The isotropic emission of slow electrons revealed ICD as the underlying process. π–π* excitation in unbounded pyridine monomers triggered an associative interaction between them, which leads to an efficient three-centre ICD. The cation resulting from the molecular association of the three pyridine centres relaxed through fragmentation. This below-threshold ionization under ambient light has implications for the understanding of radiation damage and astrochemistry. Intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD) is a process whereby a photoexcited molecule relaxes while ionizing a neighbouring molecule. ICD is efficient when intermolecular interactions are active and consequently it is usually observed in weakly bound systems.

  abstract     = {Bioorthogonal cycloaddition reactions between tetrazines and strained dienophiles are widely used for protein, lipid and glycan labelling because of their extremely rapid kinetics. However, controlling this chemistry in the presence of living mammalian cells with a high degree of spatial and temporal precision remains a challenge. Here we demonstrate a versatile approach to light-activated formation of tetrazines from photocaged dihydrotetrazines. Photouncaging, followed by spontaneous transformation to reactive tetrazine, enables live-cell spatiotemporal control of rapid bioorthogonal cycloaddition with dienophiles such as trans-cyclooctenes. Photocaged dihydrotetrazines are stable in conditions that normally degrade tetrazines, enabling efficient early-stage incorporation of bioorthogonal handles into biomolecules such as peptides. Photocaged dihydrotetrazines allow the use of non-toxic light to trigger tetrazine ligations on living mammalian cells. By tagging reactive phospholipids with fluorophores, we demonstrate modification of HeLa cell membranes with single-cell spatial resolution. Finally, we show that photo-triggered therapy is possible by coupling tetrazine photoactivation with strategies that release prodrugs in response to tetrazine ligation. Developing stimuli-responsive bioorthogonal tetrazine ligations remains highly challenging, but a versatile approach that uses photocaged dihydrotetrazines has now been developed. Photouncaging results in the spontaneous formation of reactive tetrazines that rapidly react with dienophiles such as trans-cyclooctenes. As a demonstration, the method was used for live-cell labelling with single-cell precision and light-triggered drug delivery.},

  abstract     = {Strained bicyclic substructures are increasingly relevant in medicinal chemistry discovery research because of their role as bioisosteres. Over the last decade, the successful use of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) as a para-disubstituted benzene replacement has made it a highly valuable pharmacophore. However, various challenges, including limited and lengthy access to useful BCP building blocks, are hampering early discovery research. Here we report a single-step transition-metal-free multi-component approach to synthetically versatile BCP boronates. Radicals derived from commonly available carboxylic acids and organohalides perform additions onto [1.1.1]propellane to afford BCP radicals, which then engage in polarity-matched borylation. A wide array of alkyl-, aryl- and alkenyl-functionalized BCP boronates were easily prepared. Late-stage functionalization performed on natural products and approved drugs proceeded with good efficiency to generate the corresponding BCP conjugates. Various photoredox transformations forging C–C and C–N bonds were demonstrated by taking advantage of BCP trifluoroborate salts derived from the BCP boronates. Methods to access bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane building blocks are limited, with current routes requiring multiple steps. Now, a diverse array of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane boronates can be accessed via a multi-component reaction in a single step. Alkyl, aryl and alkenyl substructures can be installed onto bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane boronates by the use of carboxylic acids and organohalides.},

  abstract     = {Single-molecule topological insulators are promising candidates as conducting wires over nanometre length scales. A key advantage is their ability to exhibit quasi-metallic transport, in contrast to conjugated molecular wires which typically exhibit a low conductance that decays as the wire length increases. Here, we study a family of oligophenylene-bridged bis(triarylamines) with tunable and stable mono- or di-radicaloid character. These wires can undergo one- and two-electron chemical oxidations to the corresponding mono-cation and di-cation, respectively. We show that the oxidized wires exhibit reversed conductance decay with increasing length, consistent with the expectation for Su–Schrieffer–Heeger-type one-dimensional topological insulators. The 2.6-nm-long di-cation reported here displays a conductance greater than 0.1G0, where G0 is the conductance quantum, a factor of 5,400 greater than the neutral form. The observed conductance–length relationship is similar between the mono-cation and di-cation series. Density functional theory calculations elucidate how the frontier orbitals and delocalization of radicals facilitate the observed non-classical quasi-metallic behaviour. Designing long and highly conducting molecular wires has been a great challenge for decades. It has now been shown that a singly oxidized 2.6-nm-long oligophenylene-bridged bis(triarylamine) can show a single-molecule junction conductance over 0.1G0.},

  abstract     = {One of the primary objectives in chemistry research is to observe atomic motions during reactions in real time. Although X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) have facilitated the capture of reaction intermediates using time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography (TR-SFX), only a few natural photoactive proteins have been investigated using this method, mostly due to the lack of suitable phototriggers. Here we report the genetic encoding of a xanthone amino acid (FXO), as an efficient phototrigger, into a rationally designed human liver fatty-acid binding protein mutant (termed XOM), which undergoes photo-induced C–H bond transformation with high selectivity and quantum efficiency. We solved the structures of XOM before and 10–300 ns after flash illumination, at 1.55–1.70 Å resolutions, and captured the elusive excited-state intermediates responsible for precise C–H bond activation. We expect that most redox enzymes can now be investigated by TR-SFX, using our method, to reveal reaction intermediates key for their efficiency and selectivity. A genetically encoded phototrigger based on a xanthone amino acid can expand the scope of time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography beyond naturally photoactive proteins. This approach has been used to uncover metastable reaction intermediates that occur prior to C–H bond activation in a human liver fatty-acid-binding protein mutant.},

Here we report a method to capture amyloid-containing aggregates in human biofluids in an unbiased way, a process we name amyloid precipitation. We use a structure-specific chemical dimer, a Y-shaped, bio-inspired small molecule with two capture groups, for amyloid precipitation to increase affinity. Our capture molecule for amyloid precipitation (CAP-1) consists of a derivative of Pittsburgh Compound B (dimer) to target the cross β-sheets of amyloids and a biotin moiety for surface immobilization. By coupling CAP-1 to magnetic beads, we demonstrate that we can target the amyloid structure of all protein aggregates present in human cerebrospinal fluid, isolate them for analysis and then characterize them using single-molecule fluorescence imaging and mass spectrometry. Amyloid precipitation enables unbiased determination of the molecular composition and structural features of the in vivo aggregates formed in neurodegenerative diseases. The composition of toxic protein aggregates associated with neurodegenerative diseases is difficult to determine. Now, a method has been developed that can capture amyloid-containing aggregates in human biofluids using a structure-specific chemical dimer.

  abstract     = {Chirality typically arises in molecules because of a rigidly chiral arrangement of covalently bonded atoms. Less generally appreciated is that chirality can arise when molecules are threaded through one another to create a mechanical bond. For example, when two macrocycles with chemically distinct faces are joined to form a catenane, the structure is chiral, although the rings themselves are not. However, enantiopure mechanically axially chiral catenanes in which the mechanical bond provides the sole source of stereochemistry have not been reported. Here we re-examine the symmetry properties of these molecules and in doing so identify a straightforward route to access them from simple chiral building blocks. Our analysis also led us to identify an analogous but previously unremarked upon rotaxane stereogenic unit, which also yielded to our co-conformational auxiliary approach. With methods to access mechanically axially chiral molecules in hand, their properties and applications can now be explored. Despite mechanically axially chiral (MAC) catenanes being recognized in 1961, their stereoselective synthesis had not been disclosed until now. Closer inspection of the MAC stereogenic unit has also led to the identification of an analogous, but unremarked upon, form of rotaxane stereochemistry and the conceptualization of a general approach to prepare MAC molecules stereoselectively.},

  abstract     = {The solvation of ions changes the physical, chemical and thermodynamic properties of water, and the microscopic origin of this behaviour is believed to be ion-induced perturbation of water’s hydrogen-bonding network. Here we provide microscopic insights into this process by monitoring the dissipation of energy in salt solutions using time-resolved terahertz–Raman spectroscopy. We resonantly drive the low-frequency rotational dynamics of water molecules using intense terahertz pulses and probe the Raman response of their intermolecular translational motions. We find that the intermolecular rotational-to-translational energy transfer is enhanced by highly charged cations and is drastically reduced by highly charged anions, scaling with the ion surface charge density and ion concentration. Our molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the water–water hydrogen-bond strength between the first and second solvation shells of cations increases, while it decreases around anions. The opposite effects of cations and anions on the intermolecular interactions of water resemble the effects of ions on the stabilization and denaturation of proteins. Ions in salt solutions perturb the hydrogen bonding between the surrounding water molecules, altering the properties of water, but how ion polarity affects this is not fully understood. By monitoring the dissipation of terahertz energy in salt solutions, it has now been shown that intermolecular rotational-to-translational energy transfer is enhanced by highly charged cations and reduced by highly charged anions.},

  abstract     = {The progression of neurodegenerative disorders can lead to impaired neurotransmission; however, the role of pathogenic factors associated with these diseases and their impact on the structures and functions of neurotransmitters have not been clearly established. Here we report the discovery that conformational and functional changes of a native neuropeptide, somatostatin (SST), occur in the presence of copper ions, metal-free amyloid-β (Aβ) and metal-bound Aβ (metal–Aβ) found as pathological factors in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. These pathological elements induce the self-assembly of SST and, consequently, prevent it from binding to the receptor. In the reverse direction, SST notably modifies the aggregation profiles of Aβ species in the presence of metal ions, attenuating their cytotoxicity and interactions with cell membranes. Our work demonstrates a loss of normal function of SST as a neurotransmitter and a gain of its modulative function against metal–Aβ under pathological conditions. Metal-free amyloid-β (Aβ) and metal-bound Aβ (metal–Aβ) are found in the brain of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Now, it has been shown that the conformation of a native neuropeptide, somatostatin, is changed in the presence of copper ions, Aβ and metal–Aβ. The conformational change results in a loss of function of somatostatin as a neurotransmitter and a gain of function as a modulator against metal–Aβ.},

Photoactivatable dyes offer substantial improvements to many of these techniques, but often rely on photolabile protecting groups that limit their applications. Here we describe a general method to transform 3,6-diaminoxanthones into caging-group-free photoactivatable fluorophores. These photoactivatable xanthones (PaX) assemble rapidly and cleanly into highly fluorescent, photo- and chemically stable pyronine dyes upon irradiation with light. The strategy is extendable to carbon- and silicon-bridged xanthone analogues, yielding a family of photoactivatable labels spanning much of the visible spectrum. Our results demonstrate the versatility and utility of PaX dyes in fixed and live-cell labelling for conventional microscopy, as well as the coordinate-stochastic and deterministic nanoscopies STED, PALM and MINFLUX. The design of photoactivatable fluorophores—which are required for some super-resolution fluorescence microscopy methods—usually relies on light-sensitive protecting groups imparting lipophilicity and generating reactive by-products. Now, it has been shown that by exploiting a unique intramolecular photocyclization, bright and highly photostable fluorophores can be rapidly generated in situ from appropriately substituted 1-alkenyl-3,6-diaminoxanthone precursors.},

Accomplishing this task by thermally hydrogenating acetylene requires a high temperature, an external feed of H2 gas and noble-metal catalysts. It is not only expensive and energy-intensive, but also prone to overhydrogenating to ethane. Here we report a photocatalytic system that reduces acetylene to ethylene with ≥99% selectivity under both non-competitive (no ethylene co-feed) and competitive (ethylene co-feed) conditions, and near 100% conversion under the latter industrially relevant conditions. Our system uses a molecular catalyst based on earth-abundant cobalt operating under ambient conditions and sensitized by either [Ru(bpy)3]2+ or an inexpensive organic semiconductor (metal-free mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride) under visible light. These features and the use of water as a proton source offer advantages over current hydrogenation technologies with respect to selectivity and sustainability. The acetylene contaminant present in ethylene feeds used to produce polymers is typically removed by thermal hydrogenation. Now, it has been shown that the conversion of acetylene to ethylene at room temperature can be achieved in a visible-light-driven process using an earth-abundant metal (cobalt) catalyst and a water proton source.},

  abstract     = {Modification of polyketides with fluorine offers a promising approach to develop new pharmaceuticals. While synthetic chemical methods for site-selective incorporation of fluorine in complex molecules have improved in recent years, approaches for the biosynthetic incorporation of fluorine in natural compounds are still rare. Here, we report a strategy to introduce fluorine into complex polyketides during biosynthesis. We exchanged the native acyltransferase domain of a polyketide synthase, which acts as the gatekeeper for the selection of extender units, with an evolutionarily related but substrate tolerant domain from metazoan type I fatty acid synthase. The resulting polyketide-synthase/fatty-acid-synthase hybrid can utilize fluoromalonyl coenzyme A and fluoromethylmalonyl coenzyme A for polyketide chain extension, introducing fluorine or fluoro-methyl units in polyketide scaffolds. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in the chemoenzymatic synthesis of fluorinated 12- and 14-membered macrolactones and fluorinated derivatives of the macrolide antibiotics YC-17 and methymycin. The introduction of fluorine into a drug molecule can alter the biological responses to it, including modulating bioavailability, pharmacokinetics and selectivity. Now, a hybrid polyketide/fatty acid synthase multienzyme has been designed to incorporate fluorinated precursors during polyketide biosynthesis in an approach that provides new chemoenzymatic access to fluorinated natural compounds.},

  abstract     = {Molecular design principles provide guidelines for augmenting a molecule with a smaller group of atoms to realize a desired property or function. We demonstrate that these concepts can be used to create an optical cycling centre, the Ca(I)–O unit, that can be attached to a number of aromatic ligands, enabling the scattering of many photons from the resulting molecules without changing the molecular vibrational state. Such capability plays a central role in quantum state preparation and measurement, as well as laser cooling and trapping, and is therefore a prerequisite for many quantum science and technology applications. We provide further molecular design principles that indicate the ability to optimize and expand this work to an even broader class of molecules. This represents a great step towards a quantum functional group, which may serve as a generic qubit moiety that can be attached to a wide range of molecular structures and surfaces. Laser cooling of molecules with more than six atoms is challenging, mainly due to vibrational loss to dark states. Now, taking a step towards the development of a ‘quantum functional group’, it has been shown that such vibrational loss in molecules like phenol can be greatly restricted by functionalizing with a Ca(I)–O unit, which may serve as a generic qubit moiety.},

  abstract     = {Enzymes achieve high substrate and product selectivities by orientating and activating the substrate(s) appropriately inside a confined and finely optimized binding pocket. Although some basic aspects of enzymes have already been mimicked successfully with man-made catalysts, substrate activation by proton wires inside enzyme pockets has not been recreated with man-made catalysts so far. A proton wire facilitates the dual activation of a nucleophile and an electrophile via a reciprocal proton transfer, enabling highly stereoselective reactions under mild conditions. Here we present evidence for such an activation mode inside the supramolecular resorcin[4]arene capsule and demonstrate that it enables catalytic and highly β-selective glycosylation reactions—still a major challenge in glycosylation chemistry. Extensive control experiments provide very strong evidence that the reactions take place inside the molecular container. We show that this activation strategy is compatible with a broad scope of glycoside donors and nucleophiles, and is only limited by the cavity size. Proton wires in enzyme active sites enable stereoselective reactions under mild conditions by facilitating dual activation of a nucleophile and an electrophile through reciprocal proton transfer. Now it has been shown that such an activation mode can be mimicked inside a supramolecular capsule, enabling a general approach to β-glycosides.},

Here we demonstrate the direct transformation of the hemicellulosic fraction of non-edible biomass into a tricyclic diester plastic precursor at 83% yield (95% from commercial xylose) during integrated plant fractionation with glyoxylic acid. Melt polycondensation of the resulting diester with a range of aliphatic diols led to amorphous polyesters (Mn = 30–60 kDa) with high glass transition temperatures (72–100 °C), tough mechanical properties (ultimate tensile strengths of 63–77 MPa, tensile moduli of 2,000–2,500 MPa and elongations at break of 50–80%) and strong gas barriers (oxygen transmission rates (100 µm) of 11–24 cc m−2 day−1 bar−1 and water vapour transmission rates (100 µm) of 25–36 g m−2 day−1) that could be processed by injection moulding, thermoforming, twin-screw extrusion and three-dimensional printing. Although standardized biodegradation studies still need to be performed, the inherently degradable nature of these materials facilitated their chemical recycling via methanolysis at 64 °C, and eventual depolymerization in room-temperature water. Functionalizing an intact carbohydrate core with acetals allows for the dramatically simplified production of a plastic precursor directly during the initial fractionation of non-edible biomass. When polymerized, the rigid and polar carbohydrate core also leads to bioplastics with competitive material and end-of life properties.},

Building synthetic cytoskeletons that mimic key features of their natural counterparts delineates a crucial step towards synthetic cells assembled from the bottom up. To this end, DNA nanotechnology represents one of the most promising routes, given the inherent sequence specificity, addressability and programmability of DNA. Here we demonstrate functional DNA-based cytoskeletons operating in microfluidic cell-sized compartments. The synthetic cytoskeletons consist of DNA tiles self-assembled into filament networks. These filaments can be rationally designed and controlled to imitate features of natural cytoskeletons, including reversible assembly and ATP-triggered polymerization, and we also explore their potential for guided vesicle transport in cell-sized confinement. Also, they possess engineerable characteristics, including assembly and disassembly powered by DNA hybridization or aptamer–target interactions and autonomous transport of gold nanoparticles. This work underpins DNA nanotechnology as a key player in building synthetic cells. Cytoskeletons are essential components of cells that perform a variety of tasks, and artificial cytoskeletons that perform these functions are required for the bottom-up assembly of synthetic cells. Now, a multi-functional cytoskeleton mimic has been engineered from DNA, consisting of confined DNA filaments that are capable of reversible self-assembly and transport of gold nanoparticles and vesicular cargo.},

Here we demonstrate a general copper-catalysed enantioconvergent C(sp3)–C(sp) cross-coupling of diverse racemic tertiary alkyl halides with terminal alkynes (87 examples).

However, moving beyond simple binary responses necessitates the introduction of new elements that control the chemistry of the photoswitching process at the molecular scale. To achieve this goal, we designed, synthesized and developed a single photochrome, based on a modified donor–acceptor Stenhouse adduct (DASA), capable of independently addressing multiple molecular states. The multi-stage photoswitch enables complex switching phenomena. To demonstrate this, we show spatial control of the transformation of a three-stage photoswitch by tuning the population of intermediates along the multi-step reaction pathway of the DASAs without interfering with either the first or final stage. This allows for a photonic three-stage logic gate where the secondary wavelength solely negates the input of the primary wavelength. These results provide a new strategy to move beyond traditional on/off binary photochromic systems and enable the design of future molecular logic systems. Moving beyond binary responses in photoswitches necessitates the introduction of new elements along their switching pathway. Now, a modified donor–acceptor Stenhouse adduct (DASA) capable of independently addressing multiple molecular states has been developed.

Distinct from catalytic atoms spatially separated but immobile in a solid matrix, here we demonstrate that a trace amount of platinum naturally dissolved in liquid gallium can drive a range of catalytic reactions with enhanced kinetics at low temperature (318 to 343 K). Molecular simulations provide evidence that the platinum atoms remain in a liquid state in the gallium matrix without atomic segregation and activate the surrounding gallium atoms for catalysis. When used for electrochemical methanol oxidation, the surface platinum atoms in the gallium–platinum system exhibit an activity of $${\sim {2.8} \times {10^7}\,{{{\mathrm{mA}}}}\,{{{{\mathrm{mg}}}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pt}}}}}^{ - 1}}},$$ three orders of magnitude higher than existing solid platinum catalysts. Such a liquid catalyst system, with a dynamic interface, sets a foundation for future exploration of high-throughput catalysis. The cost-effective use of platinum as a catalyst has led to an evolving set of systems ranging from nanoparticles to single atoms on a variety of solid supports. It has now been shown that the dissolution of platinum atoms in a liquid gallium matrix generates a liquid catalyst that functions at low temperature with high activity.},

  abstract     = {Phosphorus mononitride (PN) only has a fleeting existence on Earth, and molecular precursors for the release of this molecule under mild conditions in solution have remained elusive. Here we report the synthesis of an anthracene-based precursor—an anthracene moiety featuring an azidophosphine bridge across its central ring—that dissociates into dinitrogen, anthracene and P≡N in solution with a first-order half-life of roughly 30 min at room temperature. Heated under reduced pressure, this azidophosphine–anthracene precursor decomposes in an explosive fashion at around 42 °C, as demonstrated in a molecular-beam mass spectrometry study. The precursor is also shown to serve as a PN transfer reagent in the synthesis of an Fe–NP coordination complex, through ligand exchange with its Fe–N2 counterpart. The terminal N-bonded complex was found to be energetically preferred, compared to its P-bonded linkage isomer, owing to a significant covalent Fe–pnictogen bond character and an associated less unfavourable Pauli repulsion in the metal–ligand interaction. Precursors for the release of phosphorus mononitride in solution under mild conditions have remained elusive. Now, an explosive anthracene-stabilized azidophosphine has shown PN transfer reactivity in the synthesis of an Fe–NP complex. The PN ligand is N-bonded, as the Fe–N interaction shows significant covalent character and a less unfavourable Pauli repulsion than its Fe–P counterpart.},

  abstract     = {Chiral hydroxylamines are vital substances in bioscience and versatile subunits in the preparation of a variety of functional molecules. However, asymmetric and non-asymmetric synthetic approaches to these compounds are far from satisfactory. Although atom-economic metal-catalysed asymmetric hydrogenations have been studied for over 50 years, the asymmetric hydrogenation of oximes to the corresponding chiral hydroxylamines remains challenging because of the labile N–O bond and inert C=N bond. Here we report an environmentally friendly, earth-abundant, transition-metal nickel-catalysed asymmetric hydrogenation of oximes, affording the corresponding chiral hydroxylamines with up to 99% yield, 99% e.e. and with a substrate/catalyst ratio of 1,000. Computational results indicate that the weak interactions between the catalyst and substrate play crucial roles not only in the transition states, but also during the approach of the substrate to the catalyst, by selectively reducing the reaction barriers and thus improving the reaction efficiency and securing the generation of chirality. The asymmetric hydrogenation of oximes to chiral hydroxylamines is a long-standing challenge because of the labile N–O bond and inert C=N bond. Now, it has been shown that this reaction can be catalysed with a chiral nickel complex, and the weak interactions between catalyst and substrate are found to play a crucial role.},

To prevent photodamage, molecules relax from electronic excited states to the ground state faster than the harmful reactions can occur; however, such photochemistry is not fully understood, in part because theoretical simulations of such systems are extremely expensive—with only smaller chromophores accessible. Here, we study the excited-state dynamics of tyrosine using a method based on deep neural networks that leverages the physics underlying quantum chemical data and combines different levels of theory. We reveal unconventional and dynamically controlled ‘roaming’ dynamics in excited tyrosine that are beyond chemical intuition and compete with other ultrafast deactivation mechanisms. Our findings suggest that the roaming atoms are radicals that can lead to photodamage, offering a new perspective on the photostability and photodamage of biological systems. Amino acids are one of the major building blocks of life, but the ways in which they respond to light excitation are not fully understood. Now, the photochemistry of tyrosine has been studied using physically inspired deep neural networks, leading to the observation of unconventional dynamically controlled reactivity that involves ‘roaming’ radicals that can cause photodamage.},

  abstract     = {The translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) is a fundamental process in gene expression, and control of translation is important to regulate protein synthesis in cells. The primary hallmark of eukaryotic mRNAs is their 5′ cap, whose molecular contacts to the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E govern the initiation of translation. Here we report 5′ cap analogues with photo-cleavable groups (FlashCaps) that prohibit binding to eIF4E and resist cleavage by decapping enzymes. These compounds are compatible with the general and efficient production of mRNAs by in vitro transcription. In FlashCap-mRNAs, the single photocaging group abrogates translation in vitro and in mammalian cells without increasing immunogenicity. Irradiation restores the native cap, triggering efficient translation. FlashCaps overcome the problem of remaining sequence or structure changes in mRNA after irradiation that limited previous designs. Together, these results demonstrate that FlashCaps offer a route to regulate the expression of any given mRNA and to dose mRNA therapeutics with spatio-temporal control. Analogues of mRNA 5′ caps containing a photo-cleavable group have now been developed. These so-called FlashCaps can be used for routine in vitro transcription to make long mRNAs containing a cap. In cells, the capped mRNAs are translationally muted; however, upon irradiation by light, the photo-cleavable group is removed without leaving any remaining modification and mRNA is then translated into the corresponding protein.},

Similar intermolecular cyclization reactions, however, are scarcer for nitrogen building blocks, including N-centred radicals, and divergent and modular versions are not established. Here we report the use of sulfilimines as bifunctional N-radical precursors for cyclization reactions with alkenes to produce N-unprotected heterocycles in a single step through photoredox catalysis. Structurally diverse sulfilimines can be synthesized in a single step, and subsequently engage with alkenes to afford synthetically valuable five-, six- and seven-membered heterocycles. The broad and diverse scope is achievable by a radical-polar crossover annulation enabled by the bifunctional character of the reagents, which distinguishes itself from all other N-centred-radical-based reactions. The modular synthesis of the sulfilimines allows for larger structural diversity of N-heterocycle products than is currently achievable with other single cyclization methods. Intermolecular cyclization reactions using nitrogen-containing building blocks are scarce. Now, bifunctional sulfilimines have been shown to enable the modular construction of a diverse range of N-heterocycles by reacting with alkenes in a single photocatalysed step. Both sulfilimines and alkenes are easily accessible, providing access to a wide range of N-heterocycles with different ring types, ring sizes and substituents on the skeleton.},

Understanding and designing new catalysts for electrostatic catalysis thus requires methods to measure the electric field orientation and magnitude at the molecular scale. We demonstrate that electric field orientations can be extracted using a two-directional vibrational probe by exploiting the vibrational Stark effect of both the C=O and C–D stretches of a deuterated aldehyde. Combining spectroscopy with molecular dynamics and electronic structure partitioning methods, we demonstrate that, despite distinct polarities, solvents act similarly in their preference for electrostatically stabilizing large bond dipoles at the expense of destabilizing small ones. In contrast, we find that for an active-site aldehyde inhibitor of liver alcohol dehydrogenase, the electric field orientation deviates markedly from that found in solvents, which provides direct evidence for the fundamental difference between the electrostatic environment of solvents and that of a preorganized enzyme active site. Preorganized electric fields may be essential for the extraordinary catalytic power of enzymes. Now, it has been demonstrated how electric field strengths can be monitored along two directions using a vibrational Stark probe, enabling the observation of distinct electric field orientations in an enzyme active site compared with those in simple solvents.},

  abstract     = {Bacteria of the Burkholderia pseudomallei (BP) group pose a global health threat, causing the infectious diseases melioidosis, a common cause of pneumonia and sepsis, and glanders, a contagious zoonosis. A trait of BP bacteria is a conserved gene cluster coding for the biosynthesis of polyketides (malleicyprols) with a reactive cyclopropanol unit that is critical for virulence. Enzymes building this warhead represent ideal targets for antivirulence strategies but the biochemical basis of cyclopropanol formation is unknown. Here we describe the formation of the malleicyprol warhead. We show that BurG, an unusual NAD+-dependent member of the ketol-acid reductoisomerase family, constructs the strained cyclopropanol ring. Biochemical assays and a suite of eight crystal structures of native and mutated BurG with bound analogues and inhibitors provide snapshots of each step of the complex reaction mechanism, involving a concealed oxidoreduction and a C–S bond cleavage. Our findings illustrate a remarkable case of neofunctionalisation, where a biocatalyst from central metabolism has been evolutionarily repurposed for warhead production in pathogens. Burkholderia pseudomallei is a species of bacteria that poses a global health threat and, more generally, bacteria of the Burkholderia pseudomallei group cause severe diseases that are recalcitrant to treatment with antibiotics. Now, it has been shown how these infamous pathogens repurpose the widespread enzyme BurG to produce a reactive cyclopropanol head group found in the virulence-promoting malleicyprol toxins. Interrupting the synthesis of the cyclopropanol warhead is a potential route for developing antivirulence treatments.},

  abstract     = {Carbon dioxide is inexpensive and abundant, and its prevalence as waste makes it attractive as a sustainable chemical feedstock. Although there are examples of copolymerizations of CO2 with high-energy monomers, the direct copolymerization of CO2 with olefins has not been reported. Here an alternative route to functionalizable, recyclable polyesters derived from CO2, butadiene and hydrogen via an intermediary lactone, 3-ethyl-6-vinyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is described. Catalytic ring-opening polymerization of the lactone by 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene yields polyesters with molar masses up to 13.6 kg mol−1 and pendent vinyl side chains that can undergo post-polymerization functionalization. The polymer has a low ceiling temperature of 138 °C, allowing for facile chemical recycling, and is inherently biodegradable under aerobic aqueous conditions (OECD-301B protocol). These results show that a well-defined polyester can be derived from CO2, olefins and hydrogen, expanding access to new polymer feedstocks that were once considered unfeasible. The direct copolymerization of carbon dioxide and commodity olefins has been a long-standing challenge in polymer science. Now, an indirect approach has been developed in which hydrogenated disubstituted valerolactones derived from telomerization of CO2 and butadiene can undergo ring-opening polymerization, yielding chemically recyclable and degradable aliphatic polyesters with high CO2 content.},

However, their strained topology prevents the π-extension of CPPs to convert them either into armchair nanobelts or planarized CPP macrocycles. Here we successfully tackle this long-standing challenge and present the bottom-up synthesis and characterization of atomically precise in-plane π-extended [12]CPP on Au(111) by low-temperature scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy combined with density functional theory. The planar π-extended CPP is a nanographene with an all-armchair edge topology. The exclusive para-conjugation at the periphery yields delocalized electronic states and the planarization maximizes the overlap of p orbitals, which both reduce the bandgap compared to conventional CPPs. Calculations predict ring currents and global aromaticity in the doubly charged system. The intriguing planar ring topology and unique electronic properties make planar π-extended CPPs promising quantum materials. The strained topology of [n]paracyclophenylenes ([n]CPPs) typically prevents their π sysytem from being extended, but now the formation of a planar π-extended CPP has been achieved through a bottom-up on-surface synthesis approach. The planar π-extended [12]CPP produced by this method is a nanographene featuring an all-armchair edge, which leads to delocalized electronic states around the entire ring.},

In this Perspective, we discuss recent work in the field that is starting to showcase the potential of these model membranes to enable the quantification of membrane processes, such as the behaviour of protein transporters and the prediction of in vivo drug movement, and their use as scaffolds for electrophysiological measurements. We also highlight the challenges that remain to enable droplet interface bilayers to achieve their full potential as artificial cells, and as biological analytical platforms to quantify molecular transport. Droplet interface bilayers (DIBs) are a type of artificial bilayer that can act as cell membrane mimics. This Perspective surveys how DIBs can be used to mimic key cellular features (such as bilayer asymmetry) and processes (such as drug movement), and discusses challenges that need to be overcome to enable DIBs to reach their full potential as biomimetic model membranes.},

  abstract     = {Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of SynGAP and PSD-95, two abundant proteins that interact in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of neurons, has been implicated in modulating SynGAP PSD enrichment in excitatory synapses. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here we report that O-GlcNAcylation of SynGAP acts as a suppressor of LLPS of the SynGAP/PSD-95 complex. We identified multiple O-GlcNAc modification sites for the endogenous SynGAP isolated from rat brain and the recombinantly expressed protein. Protein semisynthesis was used to generate site-specifically O-GlcNAcylated forms of SynGAP, and in vitro and cell-based LLPS assays demonstrated that T1306 O-GlcNAc of SynGAP blocks the interaction with PSD-95, thus inhibiting LLPS. Furthermore, O-GlcNAcylation suppresses SynGAP/PSD-95 LLPS in a dominant-negative manner, enabling sub-stoichiometric O-GlcNAcylation to exert effective regulation. We also showed that O-GlcNAc-dependent LLPS is reversibly regulated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). These findings demonstrate that OGT- and OGA-catalysed O-GlcNAc cycling may serve as an LLPS-regulating post-translational modification. SynGAP and PSD-95 are two abundant proteins that form a complex and undergo liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) in the postsynaptic density of neurons. Now, O-GlcNAcylation of SynGAP has been found to suppress LLPS of the SynGAP/PSD-95 complex, and O-GlcNAc-dependent LLPS was also shown to be dynamically regulated by the enzymes O-GlcNAc transferase and O-GlcNAcase.},

  abstract     = {The biological function of phytochromes is triggered by an ultrafast photoisomerization of the tetrapyrrole chromophore biliverdin between two rings denoted C and D. The mechanism by which this process induces extended structural changes of the protein is unclear. Here we report ultrafast proton-coupled photoisomerization upon excitation of the parent state (Pfr) of bacteriophytochrome Agp2. Transient deprotonation of the chromophore’s pyrrole ring D or ring C into a hydrogen-bonded water cluster, revealed by a broad continuum infrared band, is triggered by electronic excitation, coherent oscillations and the sudden electric-field change in the excited state. Subsequently, a dominant fraction of the excited population relaxes back to the Pfr state, while ~35% follows the forward reaction to the photoproduct. A combination of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations and ultrafast visible and infrared spectroscopies demonstrates how proton-coupled dynamics in the excited state of Pfr leads to a restructured hydrogen-bond environment of early Lumi-F, which is interpreted as a trigger for downstream protein structural changes. Phytochromes regulate plant growth by sensing far-red light through the photoisomerization of their protein-bound chromophores. In the phytochrome Agp2, it has now been demonstrated that ultrafast proton-transfer occurs from the chromophore to a protein–water network before photoisomerization, inducing protein changes on the ultrafast timescale. These protein changes develop further on longer timescales, resulting in an activated protein conformation.},

  abstract     = {The safe storage of flammable gases, such as acetylene, is essential for current industrial purposes. However, the narrow pressure (P) and temperature range required for the industrial use of pure acetylene (100 &amp;lt; P &amp;lt; 200 kPa at 298 K) and its explosive behaviour at higher pressures make its storage and release challenging. Flexible metal–organic frameworks that exhibit a gated adsorption/desorption behaviour—in which guest uptake and release occur above threshold pressures, usually accompanied by framework deformations—have shown promise as storage adsorbents. Herein, the pressures for gas uptake and release of a series of zinc-based mixed-ligand catenated metal–organic frameworks were controlled by decorating its ligands with two different functional groups and changing their ratio. This affects the deformation energy of the framework, which in turn controls the gated behaviour. The materials offer good performances for acetylene storage with a usable capacity of ~90 v/v (77% of the overall amount) at 298 K and under a practical pressure range (100–150 kPa). Flexible metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) in which guest uptake and release occur above certain threshold pressures are attractive adsorbents. Now, the gated sorption behaviour of such a zinc-based mixed-ligand MOF has been tuned to match the narrow temperature and pressure range required for safe, efficient acetylene storage by adjusting the ratio of two different functional groups on its benzenedicarboxylate ligands.},

In very cold environments HNC can even appear more abundant than HCN. Here we use a chirped pulse Fourier transform spectrometer to measure the pressure broadening of HCN and HNC, simultaneously formed in situ by laser photolysis and cooled to low temperatures in uniform supersonic flows of helium. Despite the apparent similarity of these systems, we find the HNC–He cross section to be more than twice as big as the HCN–He cross section at 10 K, confirming earlier quantum calculations. Our experimental results are supported by high-level scattering calculations and are also expected to apply with para-H2, demonstrating that HCN and HNC have different collisional excitation properties that strongly influence the derived interstellar abundances. HCN and its isomer HNC are both observed in the interstellar medium and inelastic collisions with helium and other species strongly influence their derived abundances. Now it has been shown experimentally and theoretically that HNC is much more strongly excited than HCN in collisions with helium at the low temperatures of interstellar space.},

  abstract     = {A key goal of chemistry is to develop synthetic systems that mimic biology, such as self-assembling, self-replicating models of minimal life forms. Oscillations are often observed in complex biological networks, but oscillating, self-replicating species are unknown, and how to control autonomous supramolecular-level oscillating systems is also not yet established. Here we show how a population of self-assembling self-replicators can autonomously oscillate, so that simple micellar species repeatedly appear and disappear in time. The interplay of molecular and supramolecular events is key to observing oscillations: the repeated formation and disappearance of compartments is connected to a reaction network where molecular-level species are formed and broken down. The dynamic behaviour of our system across different length scales offers the opportunities for mass transport, as we demonstrate via reversible dye uptake. We believe these findings will inspire new biomimetic systems and may unlock nanotechnology systems such as (supra)molecular pumps, where compartment formation is controlled in time and space. Oscillations are widespread throughout the natural world and a number of fascinating inorganic oscillating reactions are known—but the formation and control of oscillating, self-replicating synthetic systems has remained challenging. Now, it has been shown that chemically fuelled oscillations within a network of organic replicators can drive supramolecular assembly and disassembly.},

  abstract     = {The σ-alkane complexes of transition metals, which contain an essentially intact alkane molecule weakly bound to the metal, have been well established as crucial intermediates in the activation of the strong C–H σ-bonds found in alkanes. Methane, the simplest alkane, binds even more weakly than larger alkanes. Here we report an example of a long-lived methane complex formed by directly binding methane as an incoming ligand to a reactive organometallic complex. Photo-ejection of carbon monoxide from a cationic osmium–carbonyl complex dissolved in an inert hydrofluorocarbon solvent saturated with methane at −90 °C affords an osmium(II) complex, [η5-CpOs(CO)2(CH4)]+, containing methane bound to the metal centre. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy confirms the identity of the σ-methane complex and shows that the four protons of the metal-bound methane are in rapid exchange with each other. The methane ligand has a characteristically shielded 1H NMR resonance (δ –2.16), and the highly shielded carbon resonance (δ –56.3) shows coupling to the four attached protons (1JC–H = 127 Hz). The methane complex has an effective half-life of about 13 hours at –90 °C. Catalytic transformations of methane frequently involve the formation of a metal–methane complex, but these compounds are challenging to observe. Now, a relatively long-lived osmium–methane complex has been characterized using NMR spectroscopy and forms from the direct binding of methane to a photolytically generated, coordinatively unsaturated cationic osmium–carbonyl complex dissolved in an inert hydrofluorocarbon solvent at –90 °C.},

  abstract     = {Polynitrogen molecules are attractive for high-energy-density materials due to energy stored in nitrogen–nitrogen bonds; however, it remains challenging to find energy-efficient synthetic routes and stabilization mechanisms for these compounds. Direct synthesis from molecular dinitrogen requires overcoming large activation barriers and the reaction products are prone to inherent inhomogeneity. Here we report the synthesis of planar N62− hexazine dianions, stabilized in K2N6, from potassium azide (KN3) on laser heating in a diamond anvil cell at pressures above 45 GPa. The resulting K2N6, which exhibits a metallic lustre, remains metastable down to 20 GPa. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy were used to identify this material, through good agreement with the theoretically predicted structural, vibrational and electronic properties for K2N6. The N62− rings characterized here are likely to be present in other high-energy-density materials stabilized by pressure. Under 30 GPa, an unusual N20.75−-containing compound with the formula K3(N2)4 was formed instead. The planar hexazine dianion ring (N62–), which had previously been predicted to exist, has now been synthesized from potassium azide (KN3) under laser heating in a diamond anvil cell above 45 GPa; it remains metastable down to 20 GPa. By contrast, at 30 GPa an unusual N2-containing compound with the formula K3(N2)4 was produced.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the photophysics and photochemistry of molecular π-stacked chromophores is important for utilizing them as functional photonic materials. However, these investigations have been mostly limited to covalent molecular dimers, which can only approximate the electronic and vibronic interactions present in the higher oligomers typical of functional organic materials. Here we show that a comparison of the excited-state dynamics of a covalent slip-stacked perylenediimide dimer (2) and trimer (3) provides fundamental insights into electronic state mixing and symmetry-breaking charge separation (SB-CS) beyond the dimer limit. We find that coherent vibronic coupling to high-frequency modes facilitates ultrafast state mixing between the Frenkel exciton (FE) and charge-transfer (CT) states. Subsequently, solvent fluctuations and interchromophore low-frequency vibrations promote CT character in the coherent FE/CT mixed state. The coherent FE/CT mixed state persists in 2, but, in 3, low-frequency vibronic coupling collapses the coherence, resulting in ultrafast SB-CS between the distal perylenediimide units. Molecular π-stacked chromophores are promising photonic materials, but much of our understanding is limited to covalent dimers. Now it has been shown that, in a slip-stacked perylenediimide trimer, coherent vibronic coupling to high-frequency modes facilitates ultrafast state mixing between the Frenkel exciton and charge-transfer states, which then collapses by solvent fluctuations and low-frequency vibronic coupling, resulting in ultrafast symmetry-breaking charge separation.},

  abstract     = {Although it is known that RNA undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation, the interplay between the molecular driving forces and the emergent features of the condensates, such as their morphologies and dynamic properties, is not well understood. We introduce a coarse-grained model to simulate phase separation of trinucleotide repeat RNAs, which are implicated in neurological disorders. After establishing that the simulations reproduce key experimental findings, we show that once recruited inside the liquid droplets, the monomers transition from hairpin-like structures to extended states. Interactions between the monomers in the condensates result in the formation of an intricate and dense intermolecular network, which severely restrains the fluctuations and mobilities of the RNAs inside large droplets. In the largest densely packed high-viscosity droplets, the mobility of RNA chains is best characterized by reptation, reminiscent of the dynamics in polymer melts. Our work provides a microscopic framework for understanding liquid–liquid phase separation in RNA, which is not easily discernible in current experiments. The molecular driving forces underlying the liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of RNA are not well understood. Now simulations show that low-complexity RNA sequences undergo LLPS at high RNA concentrations, driven by the formation of Watson–Crick base pairs between distinct RNA polymers. LLPS occurs by merger of small droplets into larger ones and RNA chains in the large droplets exhibit reptation dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Nucleosides are essential to the emergence of life, and so their synthesis is a key challenge for prebiotic chemistry. Although amino-nucleosides have enhanced reactivity in water compared with ribonucleosides, they are assumed to be prebiotically irrelevant due to perceived difficulties with their selective formation. Here we demonstrate that 3′-amino-TNA nucleosides (TNA, threose nucleic acid) are formed diastereoselectively and regiospecifically from prebiotic feedstocks in four high-yielding steps. Phosphate provides an unexpected resolution, leading to spontaneous purification of the genetically relevant threo-isomer. Furthermore, 3′-amino-TNA nucleosides are shown to be phosphorylated directly in water, under mild conditions with cyclic trimetaphosphate, forming a nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) in a manner not feasible for canonical nucleosides. Our results suggest 3′-amino-TNA nucleosides may have been present on the early Earth, and the ease with which these NTPs form, alongside the inherent selectivity for the Watson–Crick base-pairing threo-monomer, warrants further study of the role they could play during the emergence of life. Nucleotides are essential to the origins of life, and their synthesis is a key challenge for prebiotic chemistry. Contrary to prior expectation, non-canonical 3′-amino-TNA nucleosides are shown to be synthesized diastereoselectively and regiospecifically under prebiotically plausible conditions. The enhanced reactivity of 3′-amino-TNAs also promotes their selective non-enzymatic triphosphorylation in water.},

  abstract     = {Natural products that contain ortho-quinones show great potential as anticancer agents but have been largely discarded from clinical development because their redox-cycling behaviour results in general systemic toxicity. Here we report conjugation of ortho-quinones to a carrier, which simultaneously masks their underlying redox activity. C-benzylation at a quinone carbonyl forms a redox-inactive benzyl ketol. Upon a specific enzymatic trigger, an acid-promoted, self-immolative C–C bond-cleaving 1,6-elimination mechanism releases the redox-active hydroquinone inside cells. By using a 5-lipoxygenase modulator, β-lapachone, we created cathepsin-B-cleavable quinone prodrugs. We applied the strategy for intracellular release of β-lapachone upon antibody-mediated delivery. Conjugation of protected β-lapachone to Gem-IgG1 antibodies, which contain the variable region of gemtuzumab, results in homogeneous, systemically non-toxic and conditionally stable CD33+-specific antibody–drug conjugates with in vivo efficacy against a xenograft murine model of acute myeloid leukaemia. This protection strategy could allow the use of previously overlooked natural products as anticancer agents, thus extending the range of drugs available for next-generation targeted therapeutics. A strategy for protecting redox-active ortho-quinones, which show promise as anticancer agents but suffer from redox-cycling behaviour and systemic toxicity, has been developed. The ortho-quinones are derivatized to redox-inactive para-aminobenzyl ketols. Upon amine deprotection, an acid-promoted, self-immolative C–C bond-cleaving 1,6-elimination releases the redox-active hydroquinone. The strategy also enables conjugation to a carrier for targeted delivery of ortho-quinone species.},

  abstract     = {Cyclometalated and polypyridyl complexes of d6 metals are promising photoredox catalysts, using light to drive reactions with high kinetic or thermodynamic barriers via the generation of reactive radical intermediates. However, while tuning of their redox potentials, absorption energy, excited-state lifetime and quantum yield are well-known criteria for modifying activity, other factors could be important. Here we show that dynamic ion-pair reorganization controls the reactivity of a photoredox catalyst, [Ir[dF(CF3)ppy]2(dtbpy)]X. Time-resolved dielectric-loss experiments show how counter-ion identity influences excited-state charge distribution, evincing large differences in both the ground- and excited-state dipole moment depending on whether X is a small associating anion (PF6−) that forms a contact-ion pair versus a large one that either dissociates or forms a solvent-separated pair (BArF4−). These differences correlate with the reactivity of the photocatalyst toward both reductive and oxidative electron transfer, amounting to a 4-fold change in selectivity toward oxidation versus reduction. These results suggest that ion pairing could be an underappreciated factor that modulates reactivity in ionic photoredox catalysts. Ion pairing is ubiquitous in low-dielectric-constant solvents, but whether it influences the reactivity of common cationic photoredox catalysts has been unclear. However, it has now been shown that ion pairing is responsible for a 4-fold modulation in reactivity in a prototypical Ir(III) complex and is explained by excited-state ion-pair reorganization.},

  abstract     = {Iron-based spin-crossover complexes hold tremendous promise as multifunctional switches in molecular devices. However, real-world technological applications require the excited high-spin state to be kinetically stable—a feature that has been achieved only at cryogenic temperatures. Here we demonstrate high-spin-state trapping by controlling the chiral configuration of the prototypical iron(II)tris(4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine) in solution, associated for stereocontrol with the enantiopure Δ- or Λ-enantiomer of tris(3,4,5,6-tetrachlorobenzene-1,2-diolato-κ2O1,O2)phosphorus(V) (P(O2C6Cl4)3– or TRISPHAT) anions. We characterize the high-spin-state relaxation using broadband ultrafast circular dichroism spectroscopy in the deep ultraviolet in combination with transient absorption and anisotropy measurements. We find that the high-spin-state decay is accompanied by ultrafast changes of its optical activity, reflecting the coupling to a symmetry-breaking torsional twisting mode, contrary to the commonly assumed picture. The diastereoselective ion pairing suppresses the vibrational population of the identified reaction coordinate, thereby achieving a fourfold increase of the high-spin-state lifetime. More generally, our results motivate the synthetic control of the torsional modes of iron(II) complexes as a complementary route to manipulate their spin-crossover dynamics. Despite much research, the high-spin-state relaxation mechanism of Fe(II) spin-crossover complexes is unresolved. Using ultrafast circular dichroism spectroscopy it has now been revealed that the spin relaxation is driven by a torsional twisting mode, which breaks the chiral symmetry of a prototypical Fe(II) compound. Stereocontrolling the configuration of the complex can thus be used to slow down the spin relaxation.},

  abstract     = {Chemical reaction networks that transform out-of-equilibrium ‘fuel’ to ‘waste’ are the engines that power the biomolecular machinery of the cell. Inspired by such systems, autonomous artificial molecular machinery is being developed that functions by catalysing the decomposition of chemical fuels, exploiting kinetic asymmetry to harness energy released from the fuel-to-waste reaction to drive non-equilibrium structures and dynamics. Different aspects of chemical fuels profoundly influence their ability to power molecular machines. Here we consider the structure and properties of the fuels that biology has evolved and compare their features with those of the rudimentary synthetic chemical fuels that have so far been used to drive autonomous non-equilibrium molecular-level dynamics. We identify desirable, but context-specific, traits for chemical fuels together with challenges and opportunities for the design and invention of new chemical fuels to power synthetic molecular machinery and other dissipative nanoscale processes. Chemically fuelled synthetic molecular machines are capable of driving and sustaining non-equilibrium motion, analogous to the biomachinery that underpins life. This Review discusses the chemical and physical features of biological and synthetic chemical fuels and highlights potential challenges and opportunities for the development of synthetic chemically fuelled machinery.},

However, a lack of systematic analysis of the XP biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) has limited the understanding of how natural products affect interactions between the organisms. Here we combine pangenome and sequence similarity networks to analyse BGCs from 45 XP strains that cover all sequenced strains in our collection and represent almost all XP taxonomy. The identified 1,000 BGCs belong to 176 families. The most conserved families are denoted by 11 BGC classes. We homologously (over)express the ubiquitous and unique BGCs and identify compounds featuring unusual architectures. The bioactivity evaluation demonstrates that the prevalent compounds are eukaryotic proteasome inhibitors, virulence factors against insects, metallophores and insect immunosuppressants. These findings explain the functional basis of bacterial natural products in this tripartite relationship. Entomopathogenic nematodes carrying Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus bacteria prey on insect larvae in the soil. Now, a comprehensive analysis of the bacterial genome has revealed ubiquitous and unique families of biosynthetic gene clusters. Evaluation of the bioactivity of the natural products expressed by the most prevalent cluster families explains the functional basis of bacterial natural products involved in bacteria–nematode–insect interactions.},

  abstract     = {The most widespread method for the synthesis of 2D–2D heterostructures is the direct growth of one material on top of the other. Alternatively, flakes of different materials can be manually stacked on top of each other. Both methods typically involve stacking 2D layers through van der Waals forces—such that these materials are often referred to as van der Waals heterostructures—and are stacked one crystal or one device at a time. Here we describe the covalent grafting of 2H-MoS2 flakes onto graphene monolayers embedded in field-effect transistors. A bifunctional molecule featuring a maleimide and a diazonium functional group was used, known to connect to sulfide- and carbon-based materials, respectively. MoS2 flakes were exfoliated, functionalized by reaction with the maleimide moieties and then anchored to graphene by the diazonium groups. This approach enabled the simultaneous functionalization of several devices. The electronic properties of the resulting heterostructure are shown to be dominated by the MoS2–graphene interface. 2D–2D heterostructures are typically held together by van der Waals interactions. Now, an on-device MoS2–graphene heterostructure has been prepared that is covalently linked through a bifunctional molecule featuring a maleimide and a diazonium group. The electronic properties of the resulting heterostructure are shown to be dominated by the molecular interface.},

  abstract     = {The chemistry of carbohydrates has a history of over 100 years, but simple, stereoselective and efficient glycosylation methods remain highly needed to facilitate the studies of sugars in various disciplines. Here we report a strategy for 1,2-cis-glycosylation without using metals, strong (Lewis) acids, elaborate catalysts or labile substrates. Our method operates by a unique mechanism: it activates glycosyl donors through a radical cascade rather than the conventional acid-promoted, ionic process. As elucidated by computational and experimental studies, the allyl glycosyl sulfones (as donors) form halogen bond complexes with perfluoroalkyl iodides, which—merely by visible light irradiation—fragment via radical intermediates to give the electrophilic glycosyl iodides. In situ trapping by various nucleophiles affords, in a stereoconvergent manner, the challenging 1,2-cis-glycosides. This metal- and acid-free reaction shows remarkable tolerance to functional groups. The high stereoselectivity holds for a broad array of donors. This study suggests that the simple C2-alkoxy group can serve as an effective directing group for building 1,2-cis-glycosidic bonds. Most chemical glycosylation methods operate by acid-promoted, ionic activation of donors. Now, by exploiting the formation of a halogen-bond complex, the activation of glycosyl donors was achieved via a visible light-promoted radical cascade process, resulting in a general, simple and mild way to build challenging 1,2-cis-glycosidic bonds.},

  abstract     = {Flavin coenzymes are universally found in biological redox reactions. DNA photolyases, with their flavin chromophore (FAD), utilize blue light for DNA repair and photoreduction. The latter process involves two single-electron transfers to FAD with an intermittent protonation step to prime the enzyme active for DNA repair. Here we use time-resolved serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography to describe how light-driven electron transfers trigger subsequent nanosecond-to-microsecond entanglement between FAD and its Asn/Arg-Asp redox sensor triad. We found that this key feature within the photolyase-cryptochrome family regulates FAD re-hybridization and protonation. After first electron transfer, the FAD•− isoalloxazine ring twists strongly when the arginine closes in to stabilize the negative charge. Subsequent breakage of the arginine–aspartate salt bridge allows proton transfer from arginine to FAD•−. Our molecular videos demonstrate how the protein environment of redox cofactors organizes multiple electron/proton transfer events in an ordered fashion, which could be applicable to other redox systems such as photosynthesis. A reduction reaction is usually equated with an electron transfer reaction. Now, ultrafast time-resolved serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography has enabled the visualization of the stepwise structural changes that occur after electron transfers have been observed in the light-triggered reduction of flavin adenine dinucleotide catalysed by DNA photolyase.},

  abstract     = {One of the major challenges for harnessing the true potential of functional nano-machinery is integrating and transmitting motion with great precision. Molecular gearing systems enable the integration of multiple motions in a correlated fashion to translate motions from one locality to another and to change their speed and direction. However, currently no powerful methods exist to implement active driving of gearing motions at the molecular scale. Here we present a light-fuelled molecular gearing system and demonstrate its superiority over passive thermally activated gearing. Translation of a 180° rotation into a 120° rotation is achieved while at the same time the direction of the rotation axis is shifted by 120°. Within such photogearing processes, precise motions at the nanoscale can be changed in direction and decelerated in a manner similar to macroscopic bevel-gear operations in an energy consuming way—a necessary prerequisite to employ gearing as an active component in future mechanical nano-systems. In a similar fashion to its macroscopic counterpart, molecular gearing is a correlated motion of intermeshed molecular fragments against one another. Now it has been shown that photogearing can be used to actively fuel molecular gearing motions with light and concomitantly shift the axis of rotation.},

  abstract     = {For molecular collisions, the deflection of a molecule’s trajectory provides one of the most sensitive probes of the interaction potential and there are general rules of thumb that relate the direction of deflection to precollision conditions. Following intuition, forward scattering results from glancing collisions, whereas near head-on collisions result in back scattering. Here we present the observation of forward scattering in inelastic processes that defies this common wisdom. For deeply inelastic collisions between NO radicals and CO or HD molecules, we observed forward scattering in fully resolved pair-correlated differential cross-sections, despite the low impact parameters that are needed to induce a sufficient energy transfer. We rationalized these findings by extending the textbook model of hard-sphere scattering—taking inelastic energy transfer into account—and attribute the forward scattering to glory-type trajectories caused by attractive forces. This phenomenon, which we refer to as hard-collision glory scattering, is predicted to be ubiquitous. We derive under which conditions hard-collision glory scattering occurs and retrospectively identify such behaviour in previously studied systems. Molecular energy transfer is thought to follow a simple rule of thumb: high energy transfer requires hard collisions that result in backscattering. However, now it has been observed that an unexpected forward scattering occurs in NO–CO and NO–HD collisions even for high energy transfer. This is attributed to ‘hard-collision glory scattering’, a mechanism that appears to be ubiquitous in molecule–molecule collisions.},

The collision temperature is manipulated by combining the gating action of laser state preparation and detection with the velocity dispersion of the molecular beam. When the bond axes of both molecules are aligned parallel to the collision velocity, the scattering rate drops by a factor of 3.5 as collision energies &amp;gt;2.1 K are removed, suggesting a geometry-dependent resonance. Partial-wave analysis of the measured angular distribution supports a shape resonance within the centrifugal barrier of the l = 2 incoming orbital. Our experiment illustrates the strong anisotropy of the quadrupole–quadrupole interaction that controls the dynamics of resonant scattering.

The components of the neurons are nanolitre aqueous droplets and hydrogel fibres, connected through lipid bilayers. Transmission is powered at these interfaces by light-driven proton pumps and mediated by ion-conducting protein pores. By bundling multiple neurons into a synthetic nerve, we have shown that distinct signals can propagate simultaneously along parallel axons, thereby transmitting spatiotemporal information. Synthetic nerves might play roles in next-generation implants, soft machines and computing devices.

A possible solution would entail catalytic macrocyclic ring-closing metathesis, but these transformations require high catalyst loading, conformationally rigid precursors and are often low yielding and/or non-stereoselective. Here we introduce a ring-closing metathesis strategy for synthesis of trisubstituted macrocyclic olefins in either stereoisomeric form, regardless of the level of entropic assistance. The goal was achieved by addressing several unexpected difficulties, including complications arising from pre-ring-closing metathesis alkene isomerization. The power of the method is highlighted by two examples. The first is the near-complete reversal of substrate-controlled selectivity in the formation of a macrolactam related to an antifungal natural product. The other is a late-stage stereoselective generation of an E-trisubstituted alkene in a 24-membered ring, en route to the cytotoxic natural product dolabelide C. Many bioactive compounds are trisubstituted macrocyclic alkenes, but use of current methods often results in poor yields and low stereoselectivity. Now, a ring-closing metathesis strategy has been developed that enables these compounds to be prepared efficiently and in either stereoisomeric form: an approach that may prove useful in the late stages of total syntheses, for skeletal editing and in drug discovery.},

  abstract     = {The controlled isomerization and functionalization of alkenes is a cornerstone achievement in organometallic catalysis that is now widely used throughout industry. In particular, the addition of CO and H2 to an alkene, also known as the oxo-process, is used in the production of linear aldehydes from crude alkene feedstocks. In these catalytic reactions, isomerization is governed by thermodynamics, giving rise to functionalization at the most stable alkylmetal species. Despite the ubiquitous industrial applications of tandem alkene isomerization/functionalization reactions, selective functionalization at internal positions has remained largely unexplored. Here we report that the simple W(0) precatalyst W(CO)6 catalyses the isomerization of alkenes to unactivated internal positions and subsequent hydrocarbonylation with CO. The six- to seven-coordinate geometry changes that are characteristic of the W(0)/W(II) redox cycle and the conformationally flexible directing group are key factors in allowing isomerization to take place over multiple positions and stop at a defined unactivated internal site that is primed for in situ functionalization. The regioselectivity of tandem isomerization/hydrocarbonylation reactions is typically dictated by thermodynamics and there are limitations on the isomerization of internal alkenes. Now, it has been shown that a low-valent-tungsten catalyst controls the isomerization of alkenes to classically challenging unactivated internal positions and, with the aid of a directing group, enables subsequent addition of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.},

Elaborate prebiotically relevant synthetic routes to the building blocks of life have been established. However, it is still unclear how functional chemical systems evolved with direction using only the interaction between inherent molecular chemical reactivity and the abiotic environment. Here we demonstrate how complex systems of chemical reactions exhibit well-defined self-organization in response to varying environmental conditions. This self-organization allows the compositional complexity of the reaction products to be controlled as a function of factors such as feedstock and catalyst availability. We observe how Breslow’s cycle contributes to the reaction composition by feeding C2 building blocks into the network, alongside reaction pathways dominated by formaldehyde-driven chain growth. The emergence of organized systems of chemical reactions in response to changes in the environment offers a potential mechanism for a chemical evolution process that bridges the gap between prebiotic chemical building blocks and the origin of life. The process by which life arose using information from the prebiotic environment and inherent molecular reactivity is unclear.

Here we probe the solid-state synthesis of LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 in real time to better understand the structural and/or morphological changes during phase evolution. Multi-length-scale observations—using aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, in situ heating transmission electron microscopy and in situ X-ray diffraction—reveal that the overall synthesis is governed by the kinetic competition between the intrinsic thermal decomposition of the precursor at the core and the topotactic lithiation near the interface, which results in spatially heterogeneous intermediates. The thermal decomposition leads to the formation of intergranular voids and intragranular nanopores that are detrimental to cycling stability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that promoting topotactic lithiation during synthesis can mitigate the generation of defective structures and effectively suppress the chemo-mechanical failures. Nickel-rich layered oxides, such as NCM622, are promising cathode materials for lithium batteries, but chemo-mechanical failures hinder their practical application. Now the solid-state synthesis of NCM622 has been studied using multiscale in situ techniques, and kinetic competition between precursor decomposition and lithiation has been observed to lead to spatially heterogeneous intermediates and the formation of defects that are detrimental to cycling.},

  abstract     = {DNA nanotechnology has emerged as a powerful tool to precisely design and control molecular circuits, machines and nanostructures. A major goal in this field is to build devices with life-like properties, such as directional motion, transport, communication and adaptation. Here we provide an overview of the nascent field of dissipative DNA nanotechnology, which aims at developing life-like systems by combining programmable nucleic-acid reactions with energy-dissipating processes. We first delineate the notions, terminology and characteristic features of dissipative DNA-based systems and then we survey DNA-based circuits, devices and materials whose functions are controlled by chemical fuels. We emphasize how energy consumption enables these systems to perform work and cyclical tasks, in contrast with DNA devices that operate without dissipative processes. The ability to take advantage of chemical fuel molecules brings dissipative DNA systems closer to the active molecular devices that exist in nature. The emerging field of dissipative DNA nanotechnology aims at developing synthetic devices and nanomaterials with life-like properties such as directional motion, transport, communication or adaptation. This Review surveys how dissipative DNA systems combine the programmability of nucleic-acid reactions with the consumption of energy stored in chemical fuel molecules to perform work and cyclical tasks.},

Here, we report halogen-bonded co-crystals of a fluorinated azobenzene derivative with a volatile component—either dioxane or pyrazine—that can be cut, carved or engraved with low-power visible light. This cold photo-carving process is enabled by the co-crystallization of a light-absorbing azo dye with a volatile component, which gives rise to materials that can be selectively disassembled with micrometre precision using low-power, non-burning laser irradiation or a commercial confocal microscope. The ability to shape co-crystals in three dimensions using laser powers of 0.5–20 mW—substantially lower than those used for metals, ceramics or polymers—is rationalized by photo-carving that targets the disruption of weak supramolecular interactions, rather than the covalent bonds or ionic structures targeted by conventional laser beam or focused ion beam machining processes. Halogen-bonded co-crystals of a fluorinated azobenzene derivative and a volatile co-former can be cut, carved or engraved with micrometre-scale precision using low-power visible light. The proposed mechanism involves the local evaporation of the volatile component followed by recrystallization of the azobenzene co-former near the edge of the irradiation area.},

In both industry and academia, the incorporation of unnatural amino acids is often desirable for modulating chemical, physical and pharmaceutical properties. Here we report a protocol for the economical and practical synthesis of optically active α-amino acids based on an unprecedented stereocontrolled 1,3-nitrogen shift. Our method employs abundant and easily accessible carboxylic acids as starting materials, which are first connected to a nitrogenation reagent, followed by a highly regio- and enantioselective ruthenium- or iron-catalysed C(sp3)–H amination. This straightforward method displays a very broad scope, providing rapid access to optically active α-amino acids with aryl, allyl, propargyl and alkyl side chains, and also permits stereocontrolled late-stage amination of carboxylic-acid-containing drugs and natural products. A straightforward method for synthesizing optically active α-amino acids from abundant carboxylic acids has been developed. Based on a nitrene-mediated stereocontrolled 1,3-nitrogen shift, this approach provides access to a large variety of unnatural α-amino acids with aryl, allyl, propargyl and alkyl side chains and enables late-stage amination of carboxylic-acid-containing drugs.},

We here present a single-particle combinatorial multiplexed liposome fusion mediated by DNA for parallelized multistep and non-deterministic fusion of individual subattolitre nanocontainers. We observed directly the efficient (&amp;gt;93%) and leakage free stochastic fusion sequences for arrays of surface-tethered target liposomes with six freely diffusing populations of cargo liposomes, each functionalized with individual lipidated single-stranded DNA and fluorescently barcoded by a distinct ratio of chromophores. The stochastic fusion resulted in a distinct permutation of fusion sequences for each autonomous nanocontainer. Real-time total internal reflection imaging allowed the direct observation of &amp;gt;16,000 fusions and 566 distinct fusion sequences accurately classified using machine learning. The high-density arrays of surface-tethered target nanocontainers (~42,000 containers per mm2) offers entire combinatorial multiplex screens using only picograms of material. Combinatorial high-throughput methodologies can accelerate screening and discovery in biochemistry and biomedical sciences, but they often rely on large-scale analyses, making them time-consuming and expensive.

  abstract     = {Square-planar cobalt(II) systems have emerged as powerful carbene transfer catalysts for the synthesis of numerous (hetero)cyclic compounds via cobalt(III)–carbene radical intermediates. Spectroscopic detection and characterization of reactive carbene radical intermediates is limited to a few scattered experiments, centered around monosubstituted carbenes. Here, we reveal the formation of disubstituted cobalt(III)–carbene radicals derived from a cobalt(II)–tetraphenylporphyrin complex and acceptor–acceptor λ3-iodaneylidenes (iodonium ylides) as carbene precursors and their catalytic application. Iodonium ylides generate biscarbenoid species via reversible ligand modification of the paramagnetic cobalt(II)–tetraphenylporphyrin complex catalyst. Two interconnected catalytic cycles are involved in the overall mechanism, with a monocarbene radical and an N-enolate–carbene radical intermediate at the heart of each respective cycle. Notably, N-enolate formation is not a deactivation pathway but a reversible process, enabling transfer of two carbene moieties from a single N-enolate–carbene radical intermediate. The findings are supported by extensive experimental and computational studies. Although cobalt–carbene radicals have proved to be highly versatile intermediates for homogeneous catalysis, their spectroscopic detection and characterization have been limited. Now, by using hypervalent iodonium ylides, the formation and spectroscopic detection of a biscarbenoid N-enolate–carbene radical—which undergoes a complex catalytic pathway involving reversible N-enolate formation—has been demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Mode selectivity is a well-established concept in chemical dynamics. A polyatomic molecule possesses multiple vibrational modes and the mechanical couplings between them can result in complicated anharmonic motions that defy a simple oscillatory description. A prototypical example of this is Fermi-coupled vibration, in which an energy-split eigenstate executes coherent nuclear motion that is comprised of the constituent normal modes with distinctive phases. Will this vibrational phase affect chemical reactivity? How can this phase effect be disentangled from more classical amplitude effects? Here, to address these questions, we study the reaction of Cl with a pair of Fermi states of CH3D(v1-I and v1-II). We find that the reactivity ratio of (v1-I)/(v1-II) in forming the CH2D(v = 0) + HCl(v) products deviates significantly from that permitted by the conventional reactivity-borrowing framework. Based on a proposed metric, this discrepancy can only be explained when the scattering interferences mediated by the CH3D vibrational phases are explicitly considered, which expands the concept of vibrational control of chemical reactivity into the quantum regime. Influencing the products of a reaction through controlling the state of the reactants is a notable goal for chemists. It has now been shown that the reactivity of a pair of Fermi-coupled vibrational states of CH3D(v1-I and v1-II) with a chlorine atom depends not only on the constituent basis modes, but also on the relative phase of the two modes in their wave-functions.},

  abstract     = {One of the most important parameters in a collision is the ‘miss distance’ or impact parameter, which in quantum mechanics is described by quantized partial waves. Usually, the collision outcome is the result of unavoidable averaging over many partial waves. Here we present a study of low-energy NO–He collisions that enables us to probe how individual partial waves evolve during the collision. By tuning the collision energies to scattering resonances between 0.4 and 6 cm−1, the initial conditions are characterized by a limited set of partial waves. By preparing NO in a rotationally excited state before the collision and by studying rotational de-excitation collisions, we were able to add one quantum of angular momentum to the system and trace how it evolves. Distinct fingerprints in the differential cross-sections yield a comprehensive picture of the partial wave dynamics during the scattering process. Exploiting the principle of detailed balance, we show that rotational de-excitation collisions probe time-reversed excitation processes with superior energy and angular resolution. Low-energy NO–He collisions have been studied and scattering resonances observed. By rotationally exciting NO before the collision, a controlled amount of angular momentum was added and its release in de-excitation collisions was monitored—additional quantum waves were imprinted in the angular distributions of the scattering products.},

  abstract     = {Information is physical, a realization that has transformed the physics of measurement and communication. However, the flow between information, energy and mechanics in chemical systems remains largely unexplored. Here we analyse a minimalist autonomous chemically driven molecular motor in terms of information thermodynamics, a framework that quantitatively relates information to other thermodynamic parameters. The treatment reveals how directional motion is generated by free energy transfer from chemical to mechanical (conformational and/or co-conformational) processes by ‘energy flow’ and ‘information flow’. It provides a thermodynamic level of understanding of molecular motors that is general, complements previous analyses based on kinetics and has practical implications for machine design. In line with kinetic analysis, we find that power strokes do not affect the directionality of chemically driven machines. However, we find that power strokes can modulate motor velocity, the efficiency of free energy transfer and the number of fuel molecules consumed per cycle. This may help explain the role of such (co-)conformational changes in biomachines and illustrates the interplay between energy and information in chemical systems. Information is physical, but the flow between information, energy and mechanics in chemical systems remains largely unexplored. Now, an autonomous molecular motor has been analysed with information thermodynamics, which relates information to other thermodynamic parameters. This treatment provides a general thermodynamic understanding of molecular motors, with practical implications for machine design.},

  abstract     = {Intermetallic compounds offer unique opportunities for atom-by-atom manipulation of catalytic ensembles through precise stoichiometric control. The (Pd, M, Zn) γ-brass phase enables the controlled synthesis of Pd–M–Pd catalytic sites (M = Zn, Pd, Cu, Ag and Au) isolated in an inert Zn matrix. These multi-atom heteronuclear active sites are catalytically distinct from Pd single atoms and fully coordinated Pd. Here we quantify the unexpectedly large effect that active-site composition (that is, identity of the M atom in Pd–M–Pd sites) has on ethylene selectivity during acetylene semihydrogenation. Subtle stoichiometric control demonstrates that Pd–Pd–Pd sites are active for ethylene hydrogenation, whereas Pd–Zn–Pd sites show no measurable ethylene-to-ethane conversion. Agreement between experimental and density-functional-theory-predicted activities and selectivities demonstrates precise control of Pd–M–Pd active-site composition. This work demonstrates that the diversity and well-defined structure of intermetallics can be used to design active sites assembled with atomic-level precision. Advances in the design of heterogeneous catalysts are limited by our ability to synthesize atomically precise active-site ensembles. Now, the controlled synthesis of Pd–M–Pd catalytic sites (M = Zn, Pd, Cu, Ag and Au) has been demonstrated. Stoichiometric control identifies that Pd–Pd–Pd sites are active for ethylene hydrogenation, whereas Pd–Zn–Pd sites are not.},

  abstract     = {To enhance the performance of charge-detection mass spectrometry, we investigated the behaviour of macromolecular single ions on their paths towards and within the Orbitrap analyser. Ions with a mass beyond one megadalton reach a plateau of stability and can be successfully trapped for seconds, travelling a path length of multiple kilometres, thereby enabling precise mass analysis with an effective resolution of greater than 100,000 at a mass-to-charge ratio of 35,000. Through monitoring the frequency of individual ions, we show that these high-mass ions, rather than being lost from the trap, can gradually lose residual solvent molecules and, in rare cases, a single elementary charge. We also demonstrate that the frequency drift of single ions due to desolvation and charge stripping can be corrected, which improves the effective ion sampling 23-fold and gives a twofold improvement in mass precision and resolution. The mass precision and resolution in charge-detection mass spectrometry can be improved by correcting frequency drifts of single ions. Now, chasing these individual ions for seconds in an Orbitrap mass spectrometer has revealed the exceptional stability of ultra-high-mass ions, culminating in an effective resolution of greater than 100,000 at m/z = 35,000.},

  abstract     = {Carbon nanotubes, and synthetic organic nanotubes more generally, have in recent decades been widely explored for application in electronic devices, energy storage, catalysis and biosensors. Despite noteworthy progress made in the synthesis of nanotubular architectures with well-defined lengths and diameters, purely covalently bonded organic nanotubes have remained somewhat challenging to prepare. Here we report the synthesis of covalently bonded porous organic nanotubes (CONTs) by Schiff base reaction between a tetratopic amine-functionalized triptycene and a linear dialdehyde. The spatial orientation of the functional groups promotes the growth of the framework in one dimension, and the strong covalent bonds between carbon, nitrogen and oxygen impart the resulting CONTs with high thermal and chemical stability. Upon ultrasonication, the CONTs form intertwined structures that go on to coil and form toroidal superstructures. Computational studies give some insight into the effect of the solvent in this assembly process. A wide variety of covalent organic cages and two- and three-dimensional covalent organic frameworks have been obtained through dynamic covalent chemistry, yet the synthesis of their one-dimensional counterparts has remained challenging. Porous covalent organic nanotubes have now been prepared through reversible aldehyde–amine condensation and it has been shown that these can further assemble into toroidal architectures.},

  abstract     = {The molecular apparatus behind biological photosynthesis retains its long-term functionality through enzymatic repair. However, bioinspired molecular devices designed for artificial photosynthesis, consisting of a photocentre, a bridging ligand and a catalytic centre, can become unstable and break down when their individual modules are structurally compromised, halting their overall functionality and operation. Here we report the active repair of such an artificial photosynthetic molecular device, leading to complete recovery of catalytic activity. We have identified the hydrogenation of the bridging ligand, which inhibits the light-driven electron transfer between the photocentre and catalytic centre, as the deactivation mechanism. As a means of repair, we used the light-driven generation of singlet oxygen, catalysed by the photocentre, to enable the oxidative dehydrogenation of the bridging unit, which leads to the restoration of photocatalytic hydrogen formation. Molecular catalysts for artificial photosynthesis can break down during operation and stop working, whereas biological photosynthesis uses an enzymatic repair strategy to maintain function. Now, the degradation pathway of a hydrogen-evolving RuPt photocatalyst has been identified, enabling the development of an active repair strategy involving the use of 1O2 to reoxidize the deactivated bridging ligand.},

  abstract     = {Enzyme cascades are a powerful technology to develop environmentally friendly and cost-effective synthetic processes to manufacture drugs, as they couple different biotransformations in sequential reactions to synthesize the product. These biocatalytic tools can address two key parameters for the pharmaceutical industry: an improved selectivity of synthetic reactions and a reduction of potential hazards by using biocompatible catalysts, which can be produced from sustainable sources, which are biodegradable and, generally, non-toxic. Here we outline a broad variety of enzyme cascades used either in vivo (whole cells) or in vitro (purified enzymes) to specifically target pharmaceutically relevant molecules, from simple building blocks to complex drugs. We also discuss the advantages and requirements of multistep enzyme cascades and their combination with chemical catalysts through a series of reported examples. Finally, we examine the efficiency of enzyme cascades and how they can be further improved by enzyme engineering, process intensification in flow reactors and/or enzyme immobilization to meet all the industrial requirements. Enzymes, either purified or as whole-cell biocatalysts, can be concatenated into catalytic cascades and used to produce pharmaceutically relevant molecules. This Review discusses the advantages and requirements of multistep enzyme cascades and also highlights how they can be harnessed to achieve highly sustainable and cost-efficient syntheses.},

  abstract     = {Trisubstituted alkenyl fluorides are important compounds for drug discovery, agrochemical development and materials science. Despite notable progress, however, many stereochemically defined trisubstituted fluoroalkenes either cannot be prepared efficiently or can only be accessed in one isomeric form. Here we outline a general solution to this problem by first unveiling a practical, widely applicable and catalytic strategy for stereodivergent synthesis of olefins bearing a fluoro-chloro terminus. This has been accomplished by cross-metathesis between two trisubstituted olefins, one of which is a purchasable but scarcely utilized trihaloalkene. Subsequent cross-coupling can then be used to generate an assortment of trisubstituted alkenyl fluorides. The importance of the advance is highlighted by syntheses of, among others, a fluoronematic liquid-crystal component, peptide analogues bearing an E- or a Z-amide bond mimic, and all four stereoisomers of difluororumenic ester (an anti-cancer compound). Stereochemically defined trisubstituted alkenyl fluorides are important compounds for drug discovery, agrochemical development and materials science, but their preparation is challenging. Now, a practical and widely applicable catalytic strategy enables access to a large assortment of olefins bearing a fluoro-chloro terminus. Subsequent cross-coupling generates the corresponding trisubstituted alkenyl fluorides.},

Here we show the assembly of a C64 nanographene derivative (comprising a planar core decorated with four meta-terphenyl–imide moieties at its periphery) into multilayer stacks with smaller PAHs ranging from naphthalene to ovalene and hexabenzocoronene. The functionalized C64 nanographene serves as a ditopic host that can accommodate a smaller PAH on either side of its planar core, in cavities delimited by its bulky imide substituents. Bilayers and trilayers (that is, complexes with 1:1 and 1:2 host:guest ratios, respectively) were observed in solution, and dimers of these complexes as well as multilayer compounds were isolated in the solid state. Quantum-chemical calculations indicate that dispersion forces are the main stabilizing factor for these complexes. Nanometre-sized polyaromatic hydrocarbons (nanographenes) have been largely explored as single-layer systems. Now a C64 nanographene comprising a planar core decorated with four terphenyl–imide moieties at its periphery has been shown to assemble with coronene to form bi- and trilayer host–guest complexes in solution, as well as tetra-, hexa- and multilayer stacks in the crystalline state.},

  abstract     = {Natural product total synthesis inspires the development of synthesis strategies to access important classes of molecules. In the 1960s, Corey and coworkers demonstrated a visionary preparation of the terpenoid longifolene, using ‘strategic bond analysis’ to craft a synthesis route. This approach proposes that efficient synthesis routes to bridged, polycyclic structures should be formulated to introduce the bulk of the target’s topological complexity at a late stage. Subsequently, similar strategies have proved general for the syntheses of a wide variety of bridged, polycyclic molecules. Here, we demonstrate that an orthogonal strategy where topological complexity is introduced at the outset leads to the short synthesis of the longifolene-related terpenoid longiborneol. To implement this strategy, we access a bicyclo[2.2.1] starting material through scaffold remodelling of readily available (S)-carvone. We also employ a variety of late-stage C–H functionalization tactics in divergent syntheses of many longiborneol congeners. Our strategy may prove effective for the preparation of other topologically complex natural products that contain the bicyclo[2.2.1] framework. Generating strategies that use modern synthetic methods to access privileged chemical space is a central goal of total synthesis. Now, a strategy that is orthogonal to classic approaches, coupled with C–H functionalization methods, leads to the shortest synthesis of the sesquiterpenoid longiborneol and divergent syntheses of oxygenated longiborneol congeners.},

  abstract     = {The activation of rhodopsin, the light-sensitive G-protein-coupled receptor responsible for dim-light vision in vertebrates, is driven by an ultrafast excited-state double-bond isomerization with a quantum efficiency of almost 70%. The origin of such light sensitivity is not understood and a key question is whether in-phase nuclear motion controls the quantum efficiency value. In this study we used hundreds of quantum–classical trajectories to show that, 15 fs after light absorption, a degeneracy between the reactive excited state and a neighbouring state causes the splitting of the rhodopsin population into subpopulations. These subpopulations propagate with different velocities and lead to distinct contributions to the quantum efficiency. We also show here that such splitting is modulated by protein electrostatics, thus linking amino acid sequence variations to quantum efficiency modulation. Finally, we discuss how such a linkage that in principle could be exploited to achieve higher quantum efficiencies would simultaneously increase the receptor thermal noise leading to a trade-off that may have played a role in rhodopsin evolution. Rhodopsin activation is driven by an ultrafast double-bond isomerization, but questions remain about the origin of its sensitivity. Now, quantum–classical simulations show that, 15 fs after light absorption, a degeneracy between the reactive excited state and a neighbouring state causes the splitting of the rhodopsin population into subpopulations, which propagate with different velocities, leading to distinct contributions to the quantum efficiency.},

Because of their isotropic structure, however, clusters tend to assemble into 3D architectures. Here we report the assembly of polyoxometalate clusters into layered structures that feature uniform hexagonal pores and in-plane electron delocalization properties. Because these structures are 2D and visually reminiscent of graphene, they are referred to as ‘clusterphenes’. A series of multilayer and monolayer clusterphenes have been constructed with 13 types of polyoxometalate cluster. The resulting clusterphenes were shown to exhibit substantially improved stability and catalytic efficiency towards olefin epoxidation reactions, with a turnover frequency of 4.16 h−1, which is 76.5 times that of the unassembled clusters. The catalytic activity of the clusterphenes derives from the electron delocalization between identical clusters within the 2D layer, which efficiently reduces the activation energy of the catalytic reaction. Polyoxometalate clusters have been assembled into two-dimensional ‘clusterphene’ layers that are held together by coordination to lanthanide ions and electrostatic interactions with quaternary ammonium cations. The resulting materials resemble graphene sheets on account of their uniform hexagonal pores and are shown to catalyse epoxidation reactions due to their in-plane electron delocalization.},

  abstract     = {Primary alkyl halides have broad utility as fine chemicals in organic synthesis. The direct halogenation of alkenes is one of the most efficient approaches for the synthesis of these halides. Internal alkenes, in particular mixtures of isomers from refineries, constitute readily available and inexpensive feedstock and are the most attractive starting materials for this synthesis. However, the hydrohalogenation of alkenes generally affords branched alkyl halides; there are no catalytic methods to prepare linear alkyl halides directly from internal alkenes, let alone from a mixture of alkene isomers. Here we report the remote oxidative halogenation of alkenes under palladium catalysis via which both terminal and internal alkenes yield primary alkyl halides efficiently. Engineering pyridine-oxazoline ligands by introducing a hydroxyl group is essential for achieving excellent chemo- and regioselectivity. The catalytic system is also good for the mixture of alkene isomers generated from dehydrogenation of alkanes, providing a window to investigate the high-value utilization of inexpensive alkanes. The hydrohalogenation of alkenes generally forms branched alkyl halides. Now, a palladium-catalysed method has been developed for the remote hydrohalogenation of internal and terminal alkenes, enabling the efficient synthesis of linear alkyl halides. The method uses an engineered Pyox ligand with a hydroxy group, which is essential for accelerating the oxidative halogenation.},

  abstract     = {The performance of heterogeneous catalysts for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction suffers from unwanted side reactions and kinetic inefficiencies at the required large overpotential. However, immobilized CO2 reduction enzymes—such as formate dehydrogenase—can operate with high turnover and selectivity at a minimal overpotential and are therefore ‘ideal’ model catalysts. Here, through the co-immobilization of carbonic anhydrase, we study the effect of CO2 hydration on the local environment and performance of a range of disparate CO2 reduction systems from enzymatic (formate dehydrogenase) to heterogeneous systems. We show that the co-immobilization of carbonic anhydrase increases the kinetics of CO2 hydration at the electrode. This benefits enzymatic CO2 reduction—despite the decrease in CO2 concentration—due to a reduction in local pH change, whereas it is detrimental to heterogeneous catalysis (on Au) because the system is unable to suppress the H2 evolution side reaction. Understanding the role of CO2 hydration kinetics within the local environment on the performance of electrocatalyst systems provides important insights for the development of next-generation synthetic CO2 reduction catalysts. Carbonic anhydrase enzymatically catalyses CO2 hydration, and its effect on enzymatic and heterogeneous CO2 reduction has now been studied. Through the co-immobilization of carbonic anhydrase, it has been shown that faster CO2 hydration kinetics are beneficial for enzymatic catalysis (using formate dehydrogenase) but detrimental for heterogeneous catalysts, such as gold.},

However, we know very little about the properties of coacervates formed from simple peptides, their compatibility with ribozymes or their functional significance. Here we assess the conditions under which functional ribozymes form coacervates with simple peptides. We find coacervation to be most robust when transitioning from long homopeptides to shorter, more pre-biologically plausible heteropeptides. We mechanistically show that these RNA–peptide coacervates display peptide-dependent material properties and cofactor concentrations. We find that the interspacing of cationic and neutral amino acids increases RNA mobility, and we use isothermal calorimetry to reveal sequence-dependent Mg2+ partitioning, two critical factors that together enable ribozyme activity. Our results establish how peptides of limited length, homogeneity and charge density facilitate the compartmentalization of active ribozymes into non-gelating, magnesium-rich coacervates, a scenario that could be applicable to cellular precursors with peptide-dependent functional phenotypes. Phase-separated compartments have long been proposed as precursors to cellular life. Now, it has been shown that RNA–peptide protocells are more robust when formed using shorter (rather than longer) peptides, and that peptide sequence determines the functional materials properties of these compartments.},

Observing reversible transition metal-catalysed reactions, particularly those that include the cleavage of C–C bonds, is more challenging.

Using these substrates, an extensive study investigating the reversibility of C–C bond formation using a simple palladium catalyst was undertaken. Herein we report a comprehensive investigation of reversible C–C bond formation using palladium catalysis employing diastereomeric neopentyl iodides as the starting point. It was shown that both diastereomers could be converted to a common product under identical catalytic conditions. A combination of experimental and computational studies were used to probe the operative mechanism. A variety of concepts key to understanding the process of reversible C–C bond formations were investigated, including the effect of electronic and steric parameters on the C–C bond-cleavage step. Although carbometallation reactions have been thoroughly investigated, understanding the factors responsible for the reverse reaction (β-carbon elimination) is an emerging area of research. Now, a series of substrates has been investigated to study the key factors that promote β-carbon elimination under palladium catalysis.},

Here we report the observation of one of the largest hyperfine interactions for a molecular system, Aiso = 3,467 ± 50 MHz, as well as a very large associated clock transition. This is achieved through chemical control of the degree of s-orbital mixing into the spin-bearing d orbital associated with a series of spin-½ La(II) and Lu(II) complexes. Increased s-orbital character reduces spin–orbit coupling and enhances the electron–nuclear Fermi contact interaction. Both outcomes are advantageous for quantum applications. The former reduces spin–lattice relaxation, and the latter maximizes the hyperfine interaction, which, in turn, generates a 9-GHz clock transition, leading to an increase in phase memory time from 1.0 ± 0.4 to 12 ± 1 μs for one of the Lu(II) complexes. These findings suggest strategies for the development of molecular quantum technologies, akin to trapped ion systems. The s-orbital mixing into the spin-bearing d orbital associated with a molecular Lu(II) complex is shown to both reduce spin–orbit coupling and increase electron–nuclear hyperfine interactions, which substantially improves electron spin coherence. Combined with the potential to tune interactions through coordination chemistry, it makes this system attractive for quantum information applications.},

Owing to its high reactivity, syntheses based on PCl3 are often accompanied by product mixtures and laborious work-up procedures, so an alternative process to form a viable P(III) transfer reagent is desirable. Our concept of oxidative onioation, where white phosphorus is selectively converted into triflate salts of versatile P1 transfer reagents such as [P(LN)3][OTf]3 (LN is a cationic, N-based substituent; that is, 4-dimethylaminopyridinio), provides a convenient alternative for the implementation of P–O, P–N and P–C bonds while circumventing the use of PCl3. We use p-block element compounds of type RnE (for example, Ph3As or PhI) to access weak adducts between nitrogen Lewis bases LN and the corresponding dications [RnELN]2+. The proposed equilibrium between [RnELN]2+ + LN and [RnE(LN)2]2+ allows for the complete oxidative onioation of all six P–P bonds in P4 to yield highly reactive and versatile trications [P(LN)3]3+. White phosphorus (P4) is selectively transformed by oxidative onioation into salts of P1-transfer reagents that feature reactive P–N bonds. These P1 compounds can be used in P–N, P–O and P–C bond-forming reactions to form value-added phosphorus chemicals, representing a viable alternative to the most relevant, yet problematic, P(III) precursor, namely PCl3.},

  abstract     = {Borophene, a crystalline monolayer boron sheet, has been predicted to adopt a variety of structures—owing to its high polymorphism—that may possess physical properties that could serve in flexible electronics, energy storage and catalysis. Several borophene polymorphs have been synthesized on noble metal surfaces but for device fabrication larger single-crystal domains are typically needed with, ideally, weak borophene–substrate interactions. Here we report the synthesis of borophene on a square-lattice Cu(100) surface and show that incommensurate coordination reduces the borophene–substrate interactions and also leads to a borophene polymorph different from those previous reported. Micrometre-scale single-crystal domains formed as isolated faceted islands or merged together to achieve full monolayer coverage. The crystal structure of this phase has ten boron atoms and two hexagonal vacancies in its unit cell. First-principles calculations indicate that charge transfer, rather than covalent bonding, binds this two-dimensional boron to the Cu(100) surface. The electronic band structure of this material features multiple anisotropic tilted Dirac cones. Borophene, a two-dimensional boron sheet, can adopt a variety of polymorphic structures that are predicted to possess interesting and potentially useful electronic properties. Micrometre-scale single-crystal borophene domains have now been grown on a square-lattice Cu(100) surface. The resulting boron sheets feature a rectangular unit cell, intrinsic stripe modulations and an unusual electron band structure.},

Chemical research is still largely centred around paper-based lab notebooks, and the publication of data is often more an afterthought than an integral part of the process. Here we argue that a modular open-science platform for chemistry would be beneficial not only for data-mining studies but also, well beyond that, for the entire chemistry community. Much progress has been made over the past few years in developing technologies such as electronic lab notebooks that aim to address data-management concerns. This will help make chemical data reusable, however it is only one step. We highlight the importance of centring open-science initiatives around open, machine-actionable data and emphasize that most of the required technologies already exist—we only need to connect, polish and embrace them. A substantial proportion of the data generated in chemistry research is captured non-digitally and reported in ways that non-accessible to both humans and computers.

Here we report the in vitro selection of RNA-cleaving threose nucleic acid enzymes. One such enzyme, Tz1, catalyses a site-specific RNA-cleavage reaction with an observed pseudo first-order rate constant (kobs) of 0.016 min−1. The catalytic activity of Tz1 is maximal at 8 mM Mg2+ and remains relatively constant from pH 5.3 to 9.0. Tz1 preferentially cleaves a mutant epidermal growth factor receptor RNA substrate with a single point substitution, while leaving the wild-type intact. We demonstrate that Tz1 mediates selective gene silencing of the mutant epidermal growth factor receptor in eukaryotic cells. The identification of catalytic threose nucleic acids provides further experimental support for threose nucleic acid as an ancestral genetic and functional material. The demonstration of Tz1 mediating selective knockdown of intracellular RNA suggests that functional threose nucleic acids could be developed for future biomedical applications. Threose nucleic acid (TNA) is a potential RNA evolutionary progenitor and a nuclease-resistant synthetic genetic polymer. Now, a TNA catalyst that cleaves RNA has been identified in vitro. The TNA catalyst shows strong sequence selectivity towards a mutant RNA substrate involved in drug resistance, resulting in selective gene silencing in eukaryotic cells.},

Most neptunium chemistry involves the neptunyl di(oxo)-motif, and transuranic compounds with one metal–ligand multiple bond are rare, being found only in extended-structure oxide, fluoride or oxyhalide materials. These combinations stabilize the required high oxidation states, which are otherwise challenging to realize for transuranic ions. Here we report the synthesis, isolation and characterization of a stable molecular neptunium(V)–mono(oxo) triamidoamine complex.

This work demonstrates that molecular high-oxidation-state transuranic complexes with a single metal–ligand bond can be stabilized and studied in isolation. Neptunium was the first actinide to be artificially synthesized, yet its chemistry has remained relatively unexplored. Most neptunium chemistry involves the neptunyl di(oxo) motif, and transuranic compounds with only one metal–ligand multiple bond are generally rare.

For this purpose, many efficient methodologies have been developed that allow for the small-scale synthesis of selectively deuterated compounds. Due to the development of deuterated compounds as active drug ingredients, there is a growing interest in scalable methods for deuteration. The development of methodologies for large-scale deuterium labelling in industrial settings requires technologies that are reliable, robust and scalable. Here we show that a nanostructured iron catalyst, prepared by combining cellulose with abundant iron salts, permits the selective deuteration of (hetero)arenes including anilines, phenols, indoles and other heterocycles, using inexpensive D2O under hydrogen pressure. This methodology represents an easily scalable deuteration (demonstrated by the synthesis of deuterium-containing products on the kilogram scale) and the air- and water-stable catalyst enables efficient labelling in a straightforward manner with high quality control. A method for the selective deuteration of anilines, indoles, phenols and heterocyclic compounds, including natural products and other bioactive molecules, has been developed. The nanostructured iron catalyst that underpins this process is prepared by combining cellulose with iron salts and has been used for the preparation of deuterated compounds on up to a kilogram scale.},

In the case of antiferromagnetically coupled iron centres, stabilization of the high-spin S = 9/2 ground state is also feasible through a Heisenberg double-exchange interaction, B, which lifts the degeneracy of the Heisenberg spin states. This theorem also predicts intermediate spin states for mixed-valent dimers, but those have so far remained elusive. Herein, we describe the structural, electron paramagnetic resonance and Mössbauer spectroscopic, and magnetic characterization of a series of mixed-valent complexes featuring [Fe2Q2]+ (Q = S2–, Se2–, Te2–), where the Se and Te complexes favour S = 3/2 spin states. The incorporation of heavier chalcogenides in this series reveals a delicate balance of antiferromagnetic coupling, Heisenberg double-exchange and vibronic coupling. Despite extensive investigations of mixed-valence complexes, molecules with intermediate spin states have remained elusive. Now, selenium- and tellurium-bridged mixed-valent iron dimers have been prepared in which a balance of Heisenberg exchange and double-exchange coupling of the unpaired electron, combined with moderate vibronic contributions, stabilizes S = 3/2 ground spin states.},

Here, we report a fully integrated photochemical molecular dyad composed of a ruthenium-complex photosensitizer covalently linked to a Dawson polyoxometalate that acts as an electron-storage site and hydrogen-evolving catalyst. Visible-light irradiation of the system in solution leads to charge separation and electron storage on the polyoxometalate, effectively resulting in a liquid fuel. In contrast to related, earlier dyads, this system enables the harvesting, storage and delayed release of solar energy. On-demand hydrogen release is possible by adding a proton donor to the dyad solution. The system is a minimal molecular model for artificial photosynthesis and enables the spatial and temporal separation of light absorption, fuel storage and hydrogen release. Decoupling the processes of light harvesting and catalytic hydrogen evolution could be a potentially important step in storing solar energy. This has now been achieved with a single molecular unit: a light-harvesting ruthenium complex–polyoxometalate dyad that absorbs light, separates and stores charge and then generates hydrogen on demand following the addition of a proton donor.},

  abstract     = {The combination of computational design and directed evolution could offer a general strategy to create enzymes with new functions. So far, this approach has delivered enzymes for a handful of model reactions. Here we show that new catalytic mechanisms can be engineered into proteins to accelerate more challenging chemical transformations. Evolutionary optimization of a primitive design afforded an efficient and enantioselective enzyme (BH32.14) for the Morita–Baylis–Hillman (MBH) reaction. BH32.14 is suitable for preparative-scale transformations, accepts a broad range of aldehyde and enone coupling partners and is able to promote selective monofunctionalizations of dialdehydes. Crystallographic, biochemical and computational studies reveal that BH32.14 operates via a sophisticated catalytic mechanism comprising a His23 nucleophile paired with a judiciously positioned Arg124. This catalytic arginine shuttles between conformational states to stabilize multiple oxyanion intermediates and serves as a genetically encoded surrogate of privileged bidentate hydrogen-bonding catalysts (for example, thioureas). This study demonstrates that elaborate catalytic devices can be built from scratch to promote demanding multi-step processes not observed in nature. Directed evolution of a primitive computationally designed enzyme has produced an efficient and enantioselective biocatalyst for the Morita–Baylis–Hillman reaction. The engineered enzyme uses a designed histidine nucleophile operating in synergy with a catalytic arginine that emerged during evolution and serves as a genetically encoded surrogate of privileged bidentate hydrogen-bonding catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Controlling monomer sequence and dispersity in synthetic macromolecules is a major goal in polymer science as both parameters determine materials’ properties and functions. However, synthetic approaches that can simultaneously control both sequence and dispersity remain experimentally unattainable. Here we report a simple, one pot and rapid synthesis of sequence-controlled multiblocks with on-demand control over dispersity while maintaining a high livingness, and good agreement between theoretical and experimental molecular weights and quantitative yields. Key to our approach is the regulation in the activity of the chain transfer agent during a controlled radical polymerization that enables the preparation of multiblocks with gradually ascending (Ɖ = 1.16 → 1.60), descending (Ɖ = 1.66 → 1.22), alternating low and high dispersity values (Ɖ = 1.17 → 1.61 → 1.24 → 1.70 → 1.26) or any combination thereof. We further demonstrate the potential of our methodology through the synthesis of highly ordered pentablock, octablock and decablock copolymers, which yield multiblocks with concurrent control over both sequence and dispersity. Synthetic approaches that can simultaneously control both polymer sequence and dispersity are difficult to achieve. Now, a switchable RAFT agent that regulates chain transfer activity during controlled radical polymerization has been shown to enable the one-pot synthesis of sequence-controlled multiblocks with on-demand control over dispersity while maintaining high livingness.},

  abstract     = {The development of sustainable polymers that possess useful material properties competitive with existing petroleum-derived polymers is a crucial goal but remains a formidable challenge for polymer science. Here we demonstrate that irreversible ring-opening polymerization (IROP) of biomass-derived five-membered thionolactones is an effective and robust strategy for the polymerization of non-strained five-membered rings—these polymerizations are commonly thermodynamically forbidden under ambient conditions, at industrially relevant temperatures of 80–100 °C. Computational studies reveal that the selective IROP of these thionolactones is thermodynamically driven by S/O isomerization during the ring-opening process. IROP of γ-thionobutyrolactone, a representative non-strained thionolactone, affords a sustainable polymer from renewable resources that possesses external-stimuli-triggered degradability. This poly(thiolactone) also exhibits high performance, with its key thermal and mechanical properties comparing well to those of commercial petroleum-based low-density polyethylene. This IROP strategy will enable conversion of five-membered lactones, generally unachievable by other polymerization methods, into sustainable polymers with a range of potential applications. Five-membered lactones are common in nature and are produced in large quantities from biomass, but a lack of ring strain means that ring-opening polymerization is usually thermodynamically unfavourable at ambient conditions. Now, an irreversible ring-opening polymerization of biomass-derived five-membered thionolactones—driven by S/O isomerization—has been developed, enabling their conversion into sustainable polymers at industrially relevant temperatures.},

  abstract     = {The intracellular environment hosts a large number of cancer- and other disease-relevant human proteins. Targeting these with internalized antibodies would allow therapeutic modulation of hitherto undruggable pathways, such as those mediated by protein–protein interactions. However, one of the major obstacles in intracellular targeting is the entrapment of biomacromolecules in the endosome. Here we report an approach to delivering antibodies and antibody fragments into the cytosol and nucleus of cells using trimeric cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). Four trimers, based on linear and cyclic sequences of the archetypal CPP Tat, are significantly more potent than monomers and can be tuned to function by direct interaction with the plasma membrane or escape from vesicle-like bodies. These studies identify a tricyclic Tat construct that enables intracellular delivery of functional immunoglobulin-G antibodies and Fab fragments that bind intracellular targets in the cytosol and nuclei of live cells at effective concentrations as low as 1 μM. Reliable intracellular delivery of antibodies is one of the grand challenges in biomedical research, with the potential to address unmet clinical needs or to enable basic research. Now, it has been shown that tricyclic peptide complexes can transport functional antibodies into the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells to specifically target intracellular proteins.},

  abstract     = {Biomacromolecules are highly promising therapeutic modalities to treat various diseases. However, they suffer from poor cellular membrane permeability, limiting their access to intracellular targets. Strategies to overcome this challenge often employ nanoscale carriers that can get trapped in endosomal compartments. Here we report conjugated peptides that form pH- and redox-responsive coacervate microdroplets by liquid–liquid phase separation that readily cross the cell membrane. A wide range of macromolecules can be quickly recruited within the microdroplets, including small peptides, enzymes as large as 430 kDa and messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The therapeutic-loaded coacervates bypass classical endocytic pathways to enter the cytosol, where they undergo glutathione-mediated release of payload, the bioactivity of which is retained in the cell, while mRNAs exhibit a high transfection efficiency. These peptide coacervates represent a promising platform for the intracellular delivery of a large palette of macromolecular therapeutics that have potential for treating various pathologies (for example, cancers and metabolic diseases) or as carriers for mRNA-based vaccines. Coacervate microdroplets formed from pH- and redox-responsive peptides and self-assembled by liquid–liquid phase separation have been shown to quickly recruit macromolecular therapeutics—such as peptides, large proteins and mRNAs—and directly enter the cytosol of cells via a non-endocytic pathway. The subsequent release of therapeutic cargo is mediated by endogenic glutathione.},

  abstract     = {Tailoring electron transfer dynamics across solid–liquid interfaces is fundamental to the interconversion of electrical and chemical energy. Stacking atomically thin layers with a small azimuthal misorientation to produce moiré superlattices enables the controlled engineering of electronic band structures and the formation of extremely flat electronic bands. Here, we report a strong twist-angle dependence of heterogeneous charge transfer kinetics at twisted bilayer graphene electrodes with the greatest enhancement observed near the ‘magic angle’ (~1.1°). This effect is driven by the angle-dependent tuning of moiré-derived flat bands that modulate electron transfer processes with the solution-phase redox couple. Combined experimental and computational analysis reveals that the variation in electrochemical activity with moiré angle is controlled by a structural relaxation of the moiré superlattice at twist angles of &amp;lt;2°, and ‘topological defect’ AA stacking regions, where flat bands are localized, produce a large anomalous local electrochemical enhancement that cannot be accounted for by the elevated local density of states alone. Controlling the crystallographic registry of layered materials through interlayer twist angles has introduced a distinctive degree of freedom for tuning their electronic behaviour. Now, the interfacial electrochemical kinetics of solution-phase redox complexes at twisted bilayer graphene electrodes have been modulated by the angle-dependent tuning of moiré-derived flat bands.},

Although many aspects of these processes have been well investigated, the key roles played by iron–sulfur [FeS] clusters, which are among the oldest classes of bio-inorganic cofactors, have barely been considered. Here we discuss how several [FeS] cluster-containing proteins activate, support and modulate the innate immune response to restrict viral infections, and how some of these proteins simultaneously support the replication of viruses. We also propose models of function of some proteins in the innate immune response and argue that [FeS] clusters in many of these proteins act as biological ‘fuses’ to control the response. We hope this overview helps to inspire future research in the emerging field of bio-inorganic virology/immunology and that such studies may reveal new molecular insight into the links between viral infections and diseases like cancer and neurodegeneration. Viruses use the cellular machinery of their host organism to reproduce. This Review discusses how [FeS] cluster-containing proteins activate, support and modulate the innate immune response to restrict viral infections as well as highlighting how some of these proteins simultaneously support the replication of viruses.},

  abstract     = {Non-covalently bound aromatic systems are ubiquitous and govern the physicochemical properties of various organic materials. They are important to many phenomena of biological and technological relevance, such as protein folding, base-pair stacking in nucleic acids, molecular recognition and self-assembly, DNA–drug interactions, crystal engineering and organic electronics. Nevertheless, their molecular dynamics and chemical reactivity, particularly in electronic excited states, are not fully understood. Here, we observe intermolecular Coulombic decay in benzene dimers, (C6H6)2—the simplest prototypes of noncovalent π–π interactions between aromatic systems. Intermolecular Coulombic decay is initiated by a carbon 2s vacancy state produced by electron-impact ionization and proceeds through ultrafast energy transfer between the benzene molecules. As a result, the dimer relaxes with the emission of a further low-energy electron (&amp;lt;10 eV) and a pair of C6H6+ cations undergoing Coulomb explosion. Coincident fragment-ion and electron momentum spectroscopy, accompanied by ab initio calculations, enables us to elucidate the dynamical details of this ultrafast relaxation process. Aromatic systems that interact non-covalently are important in many settings, such as base-pair stacking and DNA–drug interactions; however, their excited-state molecular dynamics are not fully understood.

  abstract     = {Highly charged intrinsically disordered proteins are essential regulators of chromatin structure and transcriptional activity. Here we identify a surprising mechanism of molecular competition that relies on the pronounced dynamical disorder present in these polyelectrolytes and their complexes. The highly positively charged human linker histone H1.0 (H1) binds to nucleosomes with ultrahigh affinity, implying residence times incompatible with efficient biological regulation. However, we show that the disordered regions of H1 retain their large-amplitude dynamics when bound to the nucleosome, which enables the highly negatively charged and disordered histone chaperone prothymosin α to efficiently invade the H1–nucleosome complex and displace H1 via a competitive substitution mechanism, vastly accelerating H1 dissociation. By integrating experiments and simulations, we establish a molecular model that rationalizes the remarkable kinetics of this process structurally and dynamically. Given the abundance of polyelectrolyte sequences in the nuclear proteome, this mechanism is likely to be widespread in cellular regulation. Histone H1 binds to nucleosomes with ultrahigh affinity, implying residence times incompatible with efficient biological regulation. Now it has been shown that the disordered regions of H1 retain their large-amplitude dynamics on the nucleosome, which enables a charged disordered histone chaperone to invade the H1–nucleosome complex and vastly accelerate H1 dissociation.},

  abstract     = {Positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful imaging technology that can visualize and measure metabolic processes in vivo and/or obtain unique information about drug candidates. The identification of new and improved molecular probes plays a critical role in PET, but its progress is somewhat limited due to the lack of efficient and simple labelling methods to modify biologically active small molecules and/or drugs. Current methods to radiofluorinate unactivated arenes are still relatively limited, especially in a simple and site-selective way. Here we disclose a method for constructing C–18F bonds through direct halide/18F conversion in electron-rich halo(hetero)arenes. [18F]F− is introduced into a broad spectrum of readily available aryl halide precursors in a site-selective manner under mild photoredox conditions. Notably, our direct 19F/18F exchange method enables rapid PET probe diversification through the preparation and evaluation of an [18F]-labelled O-methyl tyrosine library. This strategy also results in the high-yielding synthesis of the widely used PET agent l-[18F]FDOPA from a readily available l-FDOPA analogue. A photoredox-mediated SNAr reaction has now been developed for the direct radiofluorination of unactivated aryl halides. A series of arenes can be radiofluorinated in a site-selective manner from readily available aryl halide precursors under mild conditions. This strategy allows efficient 19F/18F isotopic exchange, enabling rapid PET probe diversification and clinical tracer preparation.},

We change the sign of the contact angle of a coacervate sac containing an aqueous phase or of a hydrogel droplet hanging from the surface by controlling the normal force acting on the sac or droplet. The cyclic buoyancy-induced cargo shuttling occurs continuously, as long as the supply of reactants diffusing to the sac or droplet from the surrounding aqueous phase is not exhausted. These findings may lead to potential applications in autonomously driven reaction or delivery systems and micro-/milli-robotics.

  abstract     = {Prion-like low-complexity domains (PLCDs) have distinctive sequence grammars that determine their driving forces for phase separation. Here we uncover the physicochemical underpinnings of how evolutionarily conserved compositional biases influence the phase behaviour of PLCDs. We interpret our results in the context of the stickers-and-spacers model for the phase separation of associative polymers. We find that tyrosine is a stronger sticker than phenylalanine, whereas arginine is a context-dependent auxiliary sticker. In contrast, lysine weakens sticker–sticker interactions. Increasing the net charge per residue destabilizes phase separation while also weakening the strong coupling between single-chain contraction in dilute phases and multichain interactions that give rise to phase separation. Finally, glycine and serine residues act as non-equivalent spacers, and thus make the glycine versus serine contents an important determinant of the driving forces for phase separation. The totality of our results leads to a set of rules that enable comparative estimates of composition-specific driving forces for PLCD phase separation. The complex link between protein sequence and phase behaviour for a family of prion-like low-complexity domains (PLCDs) has now been revealed. The results have uncovered a set of rules—which are interpreted using a stickers-and-spacers model—that govern the sequence-encoded phase behaviour of such PLCDs and enable physicochemical rationalizations that are connected to the underlying sequence composition.},

Here we describe a directing-group-free, nickel-catalysed strategy that couples a broad array of unactivated and activated olefins with aryl-substituted triflates and organometallic nucleophiles to afford diarylation adducts in either regioisomeric form, in up to 93% yield and &amp;gt;98% site selectivity. By switching the reagents involved, the present strategy may be extended to other classes of dicarbofunctionalization reactions. Mechanistic and computational investigations offer insights into the origin of the observed regiochemical outcome and the utility of the method is highlighted through the concise syntheses of biologically active molecules. The catalyst control principles reported are expected to advance efforts towards the development of general site-selective alkene functionalizations, removing the requirement for neighbouring activating groups. Without directing auxiliaries, the addition of carbogenic groups to unactivated alkenes is typically inefficient and suffers from poor regioselectivity. Now, a directing-group-free, nickel catalyst-controlled strategy has been developed, enabling the site-selective dicarbofunctionalization of a broad array of activated and unactivated alkenes.},

However, the synthesis of such molecules remains challenging. We have discovered a combination of reaction partners that function as a chiral interlocking auxiliary to both orientate a macrocycle and, effectively, load it onto a new axle. Here we use these substrates to demonstrate the potential of a chiral interlocking auxiliary strategy for the synthesis of mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes by producing a range of examples with high enantiopurity (93–99% e.e.), including so-called ‘impossible’ rotaxanes whose axles lack any functional groups that would allow their direct synthesis by other means. Intriguingly, by varying the order of bond-forming steps, we can effectively choose which end of an axle the macrocycle is loaded onto, enabling the synthesis of both hands of a single target using the same reactions and building blocks. The synthesis of chiral interlocked molecules in which the mechanical bond provides the only source of stereochemistry remains challenging. Now, a chiral interlocked auxiliary approach to mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes has been developed and its potential demonstrated through the synthesis of a range of difficult targets with high enantioselectivity.},

  abstract     = {Investigation of prebiotic metabolic pathways is predominantly based on abiotically replicating the reductive citric acid cycle. While attractive from a parsimony point of view, attempts using metal/mineral-mediated reductions have produced complex mixtures with inefficient and uncontrolled reactions. Here we show that cyanide acts as a mild and efficient reducing agent mediating abiotic transformations of tricarboxylic acid intermediates and derivatives. The hydrolysis of the cyanide adducts followed by their decarboxylation enables the reduction of oxaloacetate to malate and of fumarate to succinate, whereas pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate themselves are not reduced. In the presence of glyoxylate, malonate and malononitrile, alternative pathways emerge that bypass the challenging reductive carboxylation steps to produce metabolic intermediates and compounds found in meteorites. These results suggest a simpler prebiotic forerunner of today’s metabolism, involving a reductive glyoxylate pathway without oxaloacetate and α-ketoglutarate—implying that the extant metabolic reductive carboxylation chemistries are an evolutionary invention mediated by complex metalloproteins. It’s unclear how protometabolic reactions emerged and evolved into extant metabolic pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Now, it has been shown that cyanide acts as a mild and efficient reducing agent, mediating abiotic transformations of tricarboxylic acid intermediates and derivatives.},

Aryl oxetane amines offer exciting potential as bioisosteres for benzamides—extremely common pharmacophores—but are rarely examined due to the lack of available synthetic methods. Here we describe a class of reactions for sulfonyl fluorides to form amino-oxetanes by an alternative pathway to the established SuFEx (sulfonyl–fluoride exchange) click reactivity. A defluorosulfonylation forms planar oxetane carbocations simply on warming. This disconnection, comparable to a typical amidation, will allow the application of vast existing amine libraries. The reaction is tolerant to a wide range of polar functionalities and is suitable for array formats. Ten oxetane analogues of bioactive benzamides and marketed drugs are prepared. Kinetic and computational studies support the formation of an oxetane carbocation as the rate-determining step, followed by a chemoselective nucleophile coupling step. Sulfonyl fluorides typically react with nucleophiles exclusively at sulfur, leading to the substitution of fluoride, as is the case in SuFEx reactions. Now, an alternative defluorosulfonylative reaction has been developed, coupling 3-aryloxetane sulfonyl fluorides with amines to generate amino-oxetanes. The mild conditions and high functional group tolerance enable the preparation of oxetane analogues of benzamide drugs via oxetane carbocation intermediates.},

Absorbed photoenergy transfers through a network of chromophores positioned within protein scaffolds, which fluctuate due to thermal motion. The resultant variation in the individual energy transfer steps has not yet been measured, and so how the efficiency is robust to this variation has not been determined. Here, we describe single-molecule pump–probe spectroscopy with facile spectral tuning and its application to the ultrafast dynamics of single allophycocyanin, a light-harvesting protein from cyanobacteria. We disentangled the energy transfer and energetic relaxation from nuclear motion using the spectral dependence of the dynamics. We observed an asymmetric distribution of timescales for energy transfer and a slower and more heterogeneous distribution of timescales for energetic relaxation, which was due to the impact of the protein environment. Collectively, these results suggest that energy transfer is robust to protein fluctuations, a prerequisite for efficient light harvesting. In photosynthesis, photoenergy transfers through chromophore-containing proteins, which exhibit thermal fluctuations that change the positions of the chromophores. Now the ultrafast dynamics in allophycocyanin—a cyanobacterial light-harvesting protein—have been measured using single-molecule pump–probe spectroscopy. The data show that energy transfer precedes protein-induced photophysical heterogeneity, ensuring that light harvesting is robust to the heterogeneity.},

Here we report a simple strategy to rapidly assemble libraries of conformationally constrained peptides that are paired in a combinatorial fashion (suprabodies). We demonstrate that the pairing can be shuffled after each amplification cycle in a process similar to DNA shuffling or mating to regenerate diversity. Using simulations, we show the benefits of this recombination in yielding a more accurate correlation of selection fitness with affinity after multiple rounds of selection, particularly if the starting library is heterogeneous in the concentration of its members. The method was validated with selections against streptavidin and applied to the discovery of PD-L1 binders. We further demonstrate that the binding of self-assembled suprabodies can be recapitulated by smaller (∼7 kDa) synthetic products that maintain the conformational constraint of the peptides. DNA-encoded libraries facilitate the discovery of ligands that interact with biomolecules but such technologies do not take full advantage of the principles of Darwinian selection. Now, libraries of conformationally constrained peptides (Dsuprabodies) have been assembled using a strategy that allows for iterative cycles of selection, amplification and diversification.

As this native electrospray metabolomics approach is suited to the use of any liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry system to explore the binding of any metal, this method has the potential to become an essential strategy for elucidating metal-binding molecules in biology. The systemic discovery of metal–small-molecule complexes from biological samples is a difficult challenge.

  abstract     = {Reactions that enable carbon–nitrogen, carbon–oxygen and carbon–carbon bond formation lie at the heart of synthetic chemistry. However, substrate prefunctionalization is often needed to effect such transformations without forcing reaction conditions. The development of direct coupling methods for abundant feedstock chemicals is therefore highly desirable for the rapid construction of complex molecular scaffolds. Here we report a copper-mediated, net-oxidative decarboxylative coupling of carboxylic acids with diverse nucleophiles under visible-light irradiation. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the relevant chromophore in this reaction is a Cu(ii) carboxylate species assembled in situ. We propose that visible-light excitation to a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) state results in a radical decarboxylation process that initiates the oxidative cross-coupling. The reaction is applicable to a wide variety of coupling partners, including complex drug molecules, suggesting that this strategy for cross-nucleophile coupling would facilitate rapid compound library synthesis for the discovery of new pharmaceutical agents. Direct coupling methods, which do not require substrate prefunctionalization, are highly desirable for the construction of complex molecular scaffolds. Now, a photochemical method has been developed for the direct decarboxylative coupling of carboxylic acids with diverse nitrogen, oxygen and carbon nucleophiles, taking advantage of the photochemistry of copper(II) carboxylate complexes assembled in situ.},

  abstract     = {Chirality and molecular conformation are central components of life: biological systems rely on stereospecific interactions between discrete (macro)molecular conformers, and the impacts of stereochemistry and rigidity on the properties of small molecules and biomacromolecules have been intensively studied. Nevertheless, how these features affect the properties of synthetic macromolecules has received comparably little attention. Here we leverage iterative exponential growth and ring-opening metathesis polymerization to produce water-soluble, chiral bottlebrush polymers (CBPs) from two enantiomeric pairs of macromonomers of differing rigidity. Remarkably, CBPs with conformationally flexible, mirror image side chains show several-fold differences in cytotoxicity, cell uptake, blood pharmacokinetics and liver clearance; CBPs with comparably rigid, mirror image side chains show no differences. These observations are rationalized with a simple model that correlates greater conformational freedom with enhanced chiral recognition. Altogether, this work provides routes to the synthesis of chiral nanostructured polymers and suggests key roles for stereochemistry and conformational rigidity in the design of future biomaterials. The contributions of chirality and conformation as contributing factors to the biological properties of synthetic nanomaterials remain underexplored. A synthesis of bottlebrush polymers with mirror-image side chains has now been developed and it has been revealed that an interplay between side-chain absolute configuration and flexibility influences the biological properties of these polymers both in vitro and in vivo.},

Inspired by the selectivity of deaminases in nature, herein we present a simple methodology that enables the NH2 groups in aminoheterocycles to be conceived as masked modification handles. With the aid of a simple pyrylium reagent and a cheap chloride source, C(sp2)‒NH2 can be converted into C(sp2)‒Cl bonds. The method is characterized by its wide functional group tolerance and substrate scope, allowing the modification of &amp;gt;20 different classes of heteroaromatic motifs (five- and six-membered heterocycles), bearing numerous sensitive motifs. The facile conversion of NH2 into Cl in a late-stage fashion enables practitioners to apply Sandmeyer- and Vilsmeier-type transforms without the burden of explosive and unsafe diazonium salts, stoichiometric transition metals or highly oxidizing and unselective chlorinating agents. Strategies for the selective modification of heteroatom-containing aromatic compounds are in high demand. Using a simple pyrylium reagent and a cheap chloride source, a method has now been developed that can selectively replace NH2 groups attached to heteroaromatic rings with a chlorine atom to give heteroaryl chlorides.},

  abstract     = {Aromatic amines in nature are typically installed with Glu or Gln as the nitrogen donor. Here we report a pathway that features glycyl-tRNA instead. During the biosynthesis of pyrroloiminoquinone-type natural products such as ammosamides, peptide-aminoacyl tRNA ligases append amino acids to the C-terminus of a ribosomally synthesized peptide. First, $${\mathrm{Amm}}{{{\mathrm{B}}}}_{{{\mathrm{C}}}}^{{{{\mathrm{Trp}}}}}$$ adds Trp in a Trp-tRNA-dependent reaction and the flavoprotein AmmC1 then carries out three hydroxylations of the indole ring of Trp. After oxidation to the corresponding ortho-hydroxy para-quinone, $${\mathrm{Amm}}{{{\mathrm{B}}}}_{{{\mathrm{D}}}}^{{{{\mathrm{Gly}}}}}$$ attaches Gly to the indole ring in a Gly-tRNA dependent fashion. Subsequent decarboxylation and hydrolysis results in an amino-substituted indole. Similar transformations are catalysed by orthologous enzymes from Bacillus halodurans. This pathway features three previously unknown biochemical processes using a ribosomally synthesized peptide as scaffold for non-ribosomal peptide extension and chemical modification to generate an amino acid-derived natural product. Biosynthesis of aromatic amines typically uses glutamic acid or glutamine as the nitrogen donor. Now, a biosynthetic pathway to aromatic amines has been reported that uses glycyl-tRNA as the nitrogen donor. The myosin-targeting ammosamide is made via a pathway that involves the post-translational modification of a tryptophan, which is added to the end of a peptide in a tryptophanyl-tRNA-dependent step.},

Here we report a visible-light-mediated and transition metal-free conjunctive olefination that uses an alkene ‘linchpin’ with a defined geometry to cross-couple complex molecular scaffolds that contain carboxylic acids and aldehydes. The chemistry merges two cornerstones of organic synthesis—namely, the Wittig reaction and photoredox catalysis—in a catalytic cycle that couples a radical addition process with the redox generation of a phosphonium ylide. The methodology allows the rapid structural diversification of bioactive molecules and natural products in a native form, with a high functional group tolerance, and also forges a new alkene functional group with a programmable E–Z stereochemistry. A conjunctive olefination between aldehydes and carboxylic acids has been developed by merging photoredox catalysis with the Wittig reaction. The process uses a readily available phosphonium salt to join together complex molecular fragments with high functional group tolerance and minimal use of protecting groups, enabling access to coupling products with user-defined geometries.},

  abstract     = {Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy is a crucial tool, through spin labelling, in investigations of the chemical structure of materials and of the electronic structure of materials associated with unpaired spins. ESR spectra measured in molecular systems, however, are established on large ensembles of spins and usually require a complicated structural analysis. Recently, the combination of scanning tunnelling microscopy with ESR has proved to be a powerful tool to image and coherently control individual atomic spins on surfaces. Here we extend this technique to single coordination complexes—iron phthalocyanines (FePc)—and investigate the magnetic interactions between their molecular spin with either another molecular spin (in FePc–FePc dimers) or an atomic spin (in FePc–Ti pairs). We show that the molecular spin density of FePc is both localized at the central Fe atom and also distributed to the ligands (Pc), which yields a strongly molecular-geometry-dependent exchange coupling. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy has traditionally been used to study large ensembles of spins, but its combination with scanning tunnelling microscopy recently enabled measurements on single adatoms. Now, individual iron phthalocyanine complexes adsorbed on a surface have been probed. Their spin distribution partially extends on the phthalocyanine, leading to a strong geometry-dependent exchange coupling interaction.},

  abstract     = {Norbornene derivatives (NBEs) are common monomers for living ring-opening metathesis polymerization and yield polymers with low dispersities and diverse functionalities. However, the all-carbon backbone of poly-NBEs is non-degradable. Here we report a method to synthesize degradable polymers by copolymerizing 2,3-dihydrofuran with NBEs. 2,3-Dihydrofuran rapidly reacts with Grubbs catalyst to form a thermodynamically stable Ru Fischer carbene—the only detectable active Ru species during copolymerization—and the addition of NBEs becomes rate determining. This reactivity attenuates the NBE homoaddition and allows uniform incorporation of acid-degradable enol ether linkages throughout the copolymers, which enables complete polymer degradation while maintaining the favourable characteristics of living ring-opening metathesis polymerization. Copolymerization of 2,3-dihydrofuran with NBEs gives low dispersity polymers with tunable solubility, glass transition temperature and mechanical properties. These polymers can be fully degraded into small molecule or oligomeric species under mildly acidic conditions. This method can be readily adapted to traditional ring-opening metathesis polymerization of widely used NBEs to synthesize easily degradable polymers with tunable properties for various applications and for environmental sustainability. Degradable polymers are important for technological applications and sustainability, but they remain difficult to access via ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). Now, commercial 2,3-dihydrofuran is shown to be an effective ROMP comonomer for various norbornenes. This copolymerization generates new acid-degradable polymers with controlled molecular weights, different functionalities and tunable properties.},

  abstract     = {Iron nitrides are key intermediates in biological nitrogen fixation and the industrial Haber–Bosch process, used to form ammonia from dinitrogen. However, the proposed successive conversion of nitride to ammonia remains elusive. In this regard, the search for well-described multi-iron nitrido model complexes and investigations on controlling their reactivity towards ammonia formation have long been of great challenge and importance. Here we report a well-defined thiolate-bridged FeIVFeIV μ-nitrido complex featuring an uncommon bent Fe–N–Fe moiety. Remarkably, this complex shows excellent reactivity toward hydrogenation with H2 at ambient conditions, forming ammonia in high yield. Combined experimental and computational studies demonstrate that a thiolate-bridged FeIIIFeIII μ-amido complex is a key intermediate, which is generated through an unusual two-electron oxidation of H2. Moreover, ammonia production was also realized by treating this diiron μ-nitride with electrons and water as a proton source. Multi-iron nitrides are implicated as potential key intermediates in biological nitrogen fixation and the industrial Haber–Bosch process, but well-described functional model systems are rare. Now, a well-defined thiolate-bridged FeIVFeIV μ-nitrido complex has been found to show excellent reactivity toward hydrogenation with H2 through a stepwise pathway to form ammonia in high yield.},

  abstract     = {Weakly hydrated anions help to solubilize hydrophobic macromolecules in aqueous solutions, but small molecules comprising the same chemical constituents precipitate out when exposed to these ions. Here, this apparent contradiction is resolved by systematically investigating the interactions of NaSCN with polyethylene oxide oligomers and polymers of varying molecular weight. A combination of spectroscopic and computational results reveals that SCN− accumulates near the surface of polymers, but is excluded from monomers. This occurs because SCN− preferentially binds to the centre of macromolecular chains, where the local water hydrogen-bonding network is disrupted. These findings suggest a link between ion-specific effects and theories addressing how hydrophobic hydration is modulated by the size and shape of a hydrophobic entity. Weakly hydrated anions solubilize macromolecules but cause small molecules that are made from identical chemical constituents to precipitate out of aqueous solutions. Now, this phenomenon has been understood by demonstrating that the binding of anions to polymers is regulated by molecular curvature and interfacial water structure.},

Compartmentalization spatially localizes biomolecules from a dilute pool and an evolving cell, which, as it grows and divides, permits mixing and propagation of information to daughter cells. Complex coacervate microdroplets are excellent candidates as primordial cells with the ability to partition and concentrate molecules into their core and support primitive and complex biochemical reactions. However, the evolution of coacervate protocells by fusion, growth and fission has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, a primordial environment initiated the evolution of coacervate-based protocells. Gas bubbles inside heated rock pores perturb the coacervate protocell distribution and drive the growth, fusion, division and selection of coacervate microdroplets. Our findings provide a compelling scenario for the evolution of membrane-free coacervate microdroplets on the early Earth, induced by common gas bubbles within heated rock pores. Complex coacervate microdroplets have been proposed as primordial cells, but their ability to evolve by fusion, growth and fission has not yet been demonstrated. Now, it has been shown that gas bubbles inside heated rock pores can drive the growth, fusion, division and selection of coacervate microdroplets.},

  abstract     = {As the nearest-neighbour element to carbon, boron is theoretically predicted to have a planar two-dimensional form, named borophene, with novel properties, such as Dirac fermions and superconductivity. Several polymorphs of monolayer borophene have been grown on metal surfaces, yet thicker bilayer and few-layer nanosheets remain elusive. Here we report the synthesis of large-size, single-crystalline bilayer borophene on the Cu(111) surface by molecular beam epitaxy. Combining scanning tunnelling microscopy and first-principles calculations, we show that bilayer borophene consists of two stacked monolayers that are held together by covalent interlayer boron–boron bonding, and each monolayer has β12-like structures with zigzag rows. The formation of a bilayer is associated with a large transfer and redistribution of charge in the first boron layer on Cu(111), which provides additional electrons for the bonding of additional boron atoms, enabling the growth of the second layer. The bilayer borophene is shown to possess metallic character, and be less prone to being oxidized than its monolayer counterparts. Several polymorphs of borophene have been synthesized on metal substrates, but typically as monolayers. Now large-size, single-crystalline bilayer borophene has been grown on Cu(111)—a sufficient electron provider to enable the bonding of the second boron layer. The resulting bilayer possesses a metallic character and is less susceptible to oxidation than its monolayer counterpart.},

  abstract     = {Carbapenems are vital antibiotics, but their efficacy is increasingly compromised by metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs). Here we report the discovery and optimization of potent broad-spectrum MBL inhibitors. A high-throughput screen for NDM-1 inhibitors identified indole-2-carboxylates (InCs) as potential β-lactamase stable β-lactam mimics. Subsequent structure–activity relationship studies revealed InCs as a new class of potent MBL inhibitor, active against all MBL classes of major clinical relevance. Crystallographic studies revealed a binding mode of the InCs to MBLs that, in some regards, mimics that predicted for intact carbapenems, including with respect to maintenance of the Zn(II)-bound hydroxyl, and in other regards mimics binding observed in MBL–carbapenem product complexes. InCs restore carbapenem activity against multiple drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria and have a low frequency of resistance. InCs also have a good in vivo safety profile, and when combined with meropenem show a strong in vivo efficacy in peritonitis and thigh mouse infection models. The efficacy of carbapenem antibiotics can be compromised by metallo-β-lactamases, but a high-throughput screen followed by optimization has now enabled the discovery of indole-2-carboxylates (InCs) as potent broad-spectrum metallo-β-lactamase inhibitors. The results highlight the potential of InC–carbapenem combinations for clinical use as well as mechanism-guided approaches to combatting globally disseminated antibiotic resistant mechanisms.},
