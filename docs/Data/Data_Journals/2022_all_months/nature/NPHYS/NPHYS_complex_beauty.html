  abstract     = {Palpation utilizes the fact that solid breast tumours are stiffer than the surrounding tissue. However, cancer cells tend to soften, which may enhance their ability to squeeze through dense tissue. This apparent paradox proposes two contradicting hypotheses: either softness emerges from adaptation to the tumour’s microenvironment or soft cancer cells are already present inside a rigid primary tumour mass giving rise to cancer cell motility. We investigate primary tumour explants from patients with breast and cervix carcinomas on multiple length scales. We find that primary tumours are highly heterogeneous in their mechanical properties on all scales from the tissue level down to individual cells. This results in a broad rigidity distribution—from very stiff cells to cells softer than those found in healthy tissue—that is shifted towards a higher fraction of softer cells. Atomic-force-microscopy-based tissue rheology reveals that islands of rigid cells are surrounded by soft cells. The tracking of vital cells confirms the coexistence of jammed and unjammed areas in tumour explants. Despite the absence of a percolated backbone of stiff cells and a large fraction of unjammed, motile cells, cancer cell clusters show a heterogeneous solid behaviour with a finite elastic modulus providing mechanical stability. Cervix and breast carcinomas are highly heterogeneous in their mechanical properties across scales. This heterogeneity provides the tumour with stability and room for cell motility.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the evolution and role of nanoscale polar structures during polarization rotation in relaxor ferroelectrics is a long-standing challenge in materials science and condensed-matter physics. These nanoscale polar structures are characterized by polar nanodomains, which are believed to play a key role in enabling the large susceptibilities of relaxors. Using epitaxial strain, we stabilize the intermediate step during polarization rotation in epitaxial films of a prototypical relaxor and study the co-evolution of polarization and polar nanodomains. Our multimodal approach allows for a detailed examination of correlations between polarization and polar nanodomains; illuminates the effect of local chemistry, strain and electric field on their co-evolution; and reveals the underappreciated role of strain in enabling the large electromechanical coupling in relaxors. As the strain increases, the competition between chemistry-driven disorder and strain-driven order of the polar units intensifies, which is manifested in the coexistence of inclined and elongated polar nanodomains in the intermediate step of polarization rotation. Our findings establish that structural transitions between polar nanodomain configurations underpins the polarization rotation and large electromechanical coupling of relaxors. Properties of relaxor ferroelectrics are governed by polar nanodomains. Polarization rotation facilitated by these domains investigated by means of epitaxial strain reveals a competition between chemistry-driven disorder and strain-driven order.},

  abstract     = {Flocking behaviour is often presented as an example of a self-organized process, where individuals continuously negotiate on the direction of travel and compromise by moving along a local average velocity until the group reaches a consensus. Such a collective behaviour does not take advantage of the benefits of hierarchical organizational strategies that confer the leader of the group full control over it with a reduced information flow overhead. Here we study the spontaneous behaviour of small sheep flocks and find that sheep exhibit a collective behaviour that consists of a series of collective motion episodes interrupted by grazing phases. Each motion episode has a temporal leader that guides the group in line formation. Combining experiments and a data-driven model, we provide evidence that group coordination in these episodes results from the propagation of positional information of the temporal leader to all group members through a strongly hierarchical, directed interaction network. Furthermore, we show that group members alternate the role of leader and follower by a random process, which is independent of the navigation mechanism that regulates collective motion episodes. Our analysis suggests that it is possible to conceive intermittent collective strategies that take advantage of both hierarchical and democratic organizational schemes. Collective and self-organized behaviour of sheep consists of intermittent episodes in which the animals follow a temporal leader—a role that is switched between various members of the group.},

  abstract     = {Embryo development requires biochemical signalling to generate patterns of cell fates and active mechanical forces to drive tissue shape changes. However, how these processes are coordinated, and how tissue patterning is preserved despite the cellular flows occurring during morphogenesis, remains poorly understood. Gastrulation is a crucial embryonic stage that involves both patterning and internalization of the mesendoderm germ layer tissue. Here we show that, in zebrafish embryos, a gradient in Nodal signalling orchestrates pattern-preserving internalization movements by triggering a motility-driven unjamming transition. In addition to its role as a morphogen determining embryo patterning, graded Nodal signalling mechanically subdivides the mesendoderm into a small fraction of highly protrusive leader cells, able to autonomously internalize via local unjamming, and less protrusive followers, which need to be pulled inwards by the leaders. The Nodal gradient further enforces a code of preferential adhesion coupling leaders to their immediate followers, resulting in a collective and ordered mode of internalization that preserves mesendoderm patterning. Integrating this dual mechanical role of Nodal signalling into minimal active particle simulations quantitatively predicts both physiological and experimentally perturbed internalization movements. This provides a quantitative framework for how a morphogen-encoded unjamming transition can bidirectionally couple tissue mechanics with patterning during complex three-dimensional morphogenesis. Embryo patterning relies on morphogen gradients. Now, a morphogen gradient also encodes an unjamming transition, enabling collective cellular flows that re-shape embryos while preserving patterning.},

  abstract     = {The fractional charge of quasiparticles is a fundamental feature of quantum Hall effect states. The charge—important in characterizing the state and in interference experiments—has long been measured via shot noise at moderate temperatures, with the Fano factor revealing the charge of the quasiparticles. However, at sufficiently low temperatures of ~10 mK, we previously found that the Fano factor is instead equal to the bulk filling factor. Noise with this pattern was also observed on intermediate conductance plateaux in the transmission of the quantum point contact, where shot noise is not expected. Here, we extend this low-temperature behaviour of the Fano factor to a situation where the edge modes do not sit at the physical edge of the device but instead reside in an artificially constructed interface at the boundary between two adjoining quantum Hall effect states: the tested state and a different state. We attribute the unexpected shot noise behaviour to upstream neutral modes that proliferate at the lowest spinless Landau level. We present a theoretical approach based on an interplay between charge and neutral modes that hints at the origin of the universal Fano factor. Shot noise has traditionally been used to measure the charge of quasiparticles in a variety of mesoscopic systems. However, at sufficiently low temperatures, this usual notion tends to break down for fractional quantum Hall effect states.},

  abstract     = {The kagome lattice provides a fascinating playground to study geometrical frustration, topology and strong correlations. The newly discovered kagome metals AV3Sb5 (where A can refer to K, Rb or Cs) exhibit phenomena including topological band structure, symmetry-breaking charge-density waves and superconductivity. Nevertheless, the nature of the symmetry breaking in the charge-density wave phase is not yet clear, despite the fact that it is crucial in order to understand whether the superconductivity is unconventional. In this work, we perform scanning birefringence microscopy on all three members of this family and find that six-fold rotation symmetry is broken at the onset of the charge-density wave transition in all these compounds. We show that the three nematic domains are oriented at 120° to each other and propose that staggered charge-density wave orders with a relative π phase shift between layers is a possibility that can explain these observations. We also perform magneto-optical Kerr effect and circular dichroism measurements. The onset of both signals is at the transition temperature, indicating broken time-reversal symmetry and the existence of the long-sought loop currents in that phase. The interplay between superconductivity that might break time-reversal symmetry and charge order is a key issue in kagome materials. Now, optical measurements show that spatial and time-reversal symmetries are broken at the onset of charge order.},

  abstract     = {Full manipulation of a quantum system requires controlled evolution generated by nonlinear interactions, which is coherent when the rate of nonlinearity is large compared with the rate of decoherence. As a result, engineered quantum systems typically rely on a bare nonlinearity much stronger than decoherence rates, and this hierarchy is usually assumed to be necessary. Here we challenge this assumption by demonstrating the universal control of a quantum system where the rate of bare nonlinear interaction is comparable to the fastest rate of decoherence. We introduce a noise-resilient protocol for the universal quantum control of a nearly harmonic oscillator that takes advantage of an in situ enhanced nonlinearity instead of harnessing a bare nonlinearity. Our experiment consists of a high-quality-factor microwave cavity with weak dispersive coupling to a superconducting qubit with much lower quality. By using strong drives to temporarily excite the oscillator, we realize an amplified three-wave-mixing interaction, achieving typical operation speeds over an order of magnitude faster than expected from the bare dispersive coupling. Our demonstrations include the preparation of a single-photon state with high fidelity, the generation of squeezed vacuum with large intracavity squeezing and measurement-free preparation of logical states for the binomial and Gottesman–Kitaev–Preskill quantum error-correcting codes. A noise-resilient protocol implemented in a cavity resonator coupled to a qubit demonstrates that large nonlinear couplings are not a necessary requirement for the fast universal control and state preparation of engineered quantum systems.},

We reveal the structure of one massive and two massless emerging modes—a consequence of explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking, respectively. Our experiments allow us to observe the thermalization of an easy-plane ferromagnetic Bose gas. The relevant momentum-resolved observables are in agreement with a thermal prediction obtained from an underlying microscopic model within the Bogoliubov approximation. Our methods and results are a step towards a quantitative understanding of condensation dynamics in large magnetic spin systems and the study of the role of entanglement and topological excitations for their thermalization.

Here we exploit the anisotropic nature of the dipole–dipole interaction of a dysprosium Bose–Einstein condensate to induce angular symmetry breaking in an otherwise cylindrically symmetric pancake-shaped trap. Tilting the magnetic field towards the radial plane deforms the cloud into an ellipsoid, which is then set into rotation. At stirring frequencies approaching the radial trap frequency, we observe the generation of dynamically unstable surface excitations, which cause angular momentum to be pumped into the system through vortices. Under continuous rotation, the vortices arrange into a stripe configuration along the field, in close agreement with numerical simulations. Ultracold gases composed of lanthanide atoms are characterized by long-range dipolar interactions. These have now been exploited to observe quantized vortices in a dipolar condensate through the manipulation of the atoms by rotating external magnetic fields.},

We show that small variations in external driving lead to a large variation in the population of Rydberg states around criticality and to a notable change in the optical transmission signal. For continuous optical transmission at the critical point, we quantify the enhanced sensitivity extracting the Fisher information, which shows a three orders of magnitude increase due to many-body effects compared with single-particle systems. These results demonstrate that critical properties of many-body systems are promising resources for sensing and metrology applications.

  abstract     = {In special relativity, four-vectors, such as space–time, energy–momentum and electromagnetic potential vectors, follow the Lorentz transformation. The transformations of space–time and energy–momentum vectors have been tested by time dilation and rest mass energy experiments, respectively. However, the Lorentz transformation of electromagnetic potentials has never been directly demonstrated in experiments due to the limitations of the diagnostics. Here we show the spatiotemporal electric-field profiles around a highly energetic electron beam with a subpicosecond temporal resolution obtained by a terahertz technique based on electro-optic sampling. We observe the Coulomb field contraction in the propagation direction of the beam under the Lorentz transformation. After passing the beam through a metallic plate, we investigate the birth of the Coulomb field around it and follow the spatiotemporal evolution of the spherical wavefront, which is derived by the Liénard–Wiechert potentials. The measured electric-field profile in the far propagation distance is experimentally confirmed to coincide with the calculation of the Liénard–Wiechert potentials and the Lorentz transformation. Our ultrafast measurement of a spatiotemporal relativistic electric field provides both additional experimental evidence of special relativity and a platform for detailed experimental research of energetic charged particle beams and electromagnetic radiation physics. The Lorentz transformation of electromagnetic potentials is confirmed in experiments with a highly energetic electron beam. This provides another test of the predictions of special relativity.},

  abstract     = {Pressure reduction in liquids may result in vaporization and bubble formation—a process known as cavitation. It is commonly observed in hydraulic machinery, ship propellers and even in the context of medical therapy within the human body. Although cavitation may be beneficial for the removal of malign tissue, in many cases it is unwanted due to its ability to erode nearly any material in close contact. The current understanding is that the origins of heterogeneous cavitation are nucleation sites where stable gas cavities reside, for example, on contaminant particles, submerged surfaces or shell-stabilized microscopic bubbles1,2. Here we present the discovery of an atomically smooth interface between two immiscible liquids acting as a nucleation site. The non-polar liquid has a higher gas solubility and, upon pressure reduction, it acts as a gas reservoir as gas accumulates at the interface. We describe experiments that reveal the formation of cavitation on non-polar droplets in contact with water, and elucidate the working mechanism that leads to the nucleation of gas pockets through simulations. Cavitation refers to the emergence of bubbles from liquids undergoing pressure reduction. A hitherto unknown cavitation scenario is now reported, with bubbles originating from the atomically smooth interface between two immiscible liquids.},

  abstract     = {Reducing the dimensionality of layered materials can result in properties distinct from their bulk crystals1–3. However, the emergent properties in atomically thin samples, in particular in metallic monolayer flakes, are often obtained at the expense of other important properties. For example, while Ising superconductivity—where the pairing of electrons with opposite out-of-plane spins from K and K′ valleys leads to an in-plane upper critical field exceeding the Pauli limit—does not occur in bulk NbSe2, it was observed in two-dimensional monolayer flakes4. However, the critical temperature was reduced as compared to bulk crystals4–13. Here we take a different route to control the superconducting properties of NbSe2 by intercalating bulk crystals with cations from ionic liquids. This produces Ising superconductivity with a similar critical temperature to the non-intercalated bulk and is more stable than in a monolayer flake. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal the effectively two-dimensional electronic structure, and a comparison of the experimental electronic structures between intercalated bulk NbSe2 and monolayer NbSe2 film reveals that the intercalant induces electron doping. This suggests ionic liquid cation intercalation is an effective technique for controlling both the dimensionality and the carrier concentration, allowing tailored properties exceeding both bulk crystals and monolayer samples. The superconducting critical temperature of monolayer materials is often lower than their bulk counterparts. Now, intercalation is shown to induce two-dimensional superconducting properties while maintaining the bulk critical temperature.},

  abstract     = {In various so-called strange metals, electrons undergo Planckian dissipation1,2, a strong and anomalous scattering that grows linearly with temperature3, in contrast to the quadratic temperature dependence expected from the standard theory of metals. In some cuprates4,5 and pnictides6, a linear dependence of resistivity on a magnetic field has also been considered anomalous—possibly an additional facet of Planckian dissipation. Here we show that the resistivity of the cuprate strange metals Nd0.4La1.6−xSrxCuO4 (ref. 7) and La2−xSrxCuO4 (ref. 8) is quantitatively consistent with the standard Boltzmann theory of electron motion in a magnetic field, in all aspects—field strength, field direction, temperature and disorder level. The linear field dependence is found to be simply the consequence of scattering rate anisotropy. We conclude that Planckian dissipation is anomalous in its temperature dependence, but not in its field dependence. The scattering rate in these cuprates does not depend on field, which means that their Planckian dissipation is robust against fields up to at least 85 T. Electrons in the non-superconducting state of cuprates can exhibit unusual transport behaviour. Now, analysis of experimental data shows that the magnetoresistance in this state is conventional, but influenced by an anisotropic scattering rate.},

  abstract     = {The spontaneous reduction of rotational symmetry in a crystalline solid driven by an electronic mechanism is referred to as electronic nematicity. This phenomenon—initially thought to be rare—has now been observed in an increasing number of strongly interacting systems. In particular, the ubiquitous presence of nematicity in a number of unconventional superconductors suggests its importance in developing a unified understanding of their intricate phase diagrams and superconducting pairing. In this regard, the iron-based superconductors present an ideal material platform to study electronic nematicity. Their nematic transition is pronounced, it can be studied with a wide range of experimental techniques, it is easily tunable, and high-quality samples are widely available. Signatures of nematic quantum criticality near optimal dopings have been reported in almost all families of iron-based superconductors. Here we highlight how the nematic phase in this class of materials can be addressed in its full complexity, encompassing momentum-, time-, energy- and material-dependences. We also discuss a number of important open questions that pertain to how nematicity affects the superconducting pairing and normal-state properties, and intriguing quantum-critical behaviour near the nematic transition. Recent experiments utilizing strain have shed light on the role of electronic nematicity in determining the properties of unconventional superconductors. This Perspective reviews these developments and discusses open questions.},

  abstract     = {Collective cell migration is an essential process throughout the lives of multicellular organisms, for example in embryonic development, wound healing and tumour metastasis. Substrates or interfaces associated with these processes are typically curved, with radii of curvature comparable to many cell lengths. Using both artificial geometries and lung alveolospheres derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, here we show that cells sense multicellular-scale curvature and that it plays a role in regulating collective cell migration. As the curvature of a monolayer increases, cells reduce their collectivity and the multicellular flow field becomes more dynamic. Furthermore, hexagonally shaped cells tend to aggregate in solid-like clusters surrounded by non-hexagonal cells that act as a background fluid. We propose that cells naturally form hexagonally organized clusters to minimize free energy, and the size of these clusters is limited by a bending energy penalty. We observe that cluster size grows linearly as sphere radius increases, which further stabilizes the multicellular flow field and increases cell collectivity. As a result, increasing curvature tends to promote the fluidity in multicellular monolayer. Together, these findings highlight the potential for a fundamental role of curvature in regulating both spatial and temporal characteristics of three-dimensional multicellular systems. Many important cellular structures in the body are curved at the scale of multiple cell lengths. Cells respond collectively to this curvature, and it influences their migration during development and growth.},

  abstract     = {The physical properties of a quantum many-body system in thermal equilibrium are determined by its partition function and free energy. Here we study the computational complexity of approximating these quantities for n-qubit local Hamiltonians. First, we report a classical algorithm with poly(n) runtime, which approximates the free energy of a given 2-local Hamiltonian provided that it satisfies a certain denseness condition. Our algorithm contributes to a body of work investigating the hardness of approximation for difficult optimization problems. Specifically, this extends existing efficient approximation algorithms for dense instances of the ground energy of 2-local quantum Hamiltonians and the free energy of classical Ising models. Second, we establish polynomial-time equivalence between the problem of approximating the free energy of local Hamiltonians and several other natural tasks ubiquitous in condensed-matter physics and quantum computing, such as the problem of approximating the number of input states accepted by a polynomial-size quantum circuit. These results suggest that the simulation of quantum many-body systems in thermal equilibrium may precisely capture the complexity of a broad family of computational problems that have yet to be defined or characterized in terms of known complexity classes. Finally, we summarize state-of-the-art classical and quantum algorithms for approximating the free energy and show how to improve their runtime and memory footprint. A quantum many-body system’s equilibrium behaviour is described by its partition function, which is hard to compute. Now it has been shown that the easier task of finding an approximation could define a distinct class of computational problems.},

  abstract     = {Ground-state entanglement governs various properties of quantum many-body systems at low temperatures and is the key to understanding gapped quantum phases of matter. Here we identify a structural property of entanglement in the ground state of gapped local Hamiltonians. This property is captured using a quantum information quantity known as the entanglement spread, which measures the difference between Rényi entanglement entropies. Our main result shows that gapped ground states possess limited entanglement spread across any partition of the system, exhibiting an area-law scaling. Our result applies to systems with interactions described by any graph, but we obtain an improved bound for the special case of lattices. These interaction graphs include cases where entanglement entropy is known not to satisfy an area law. We achieve our results first by connecting the ground-state entanglement to the communication complexity of testing bipartite entangled states and then devising a communication scheme for testing ground states using recently developed quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation. Entanglement entropy between two parts of a quantum state generally grows with volume, but for one-dimensional and some two-dimensional ground states, it scales with area. An area law has now been proven for a related metric in any dimension or geometry.},

  abstract     = {Mott insulators are paradigmatic examples of strongly correlated physics from which many phases of quantum matter with hard-to-explain properties emerge. Extending the typical SU(2) spin symmetry of Mott insulators to SU(N) is predicted to produce exotic quantum magnetism at low temperatures. In this work, we experimentally observe nearest-neighbour spin correlations in a SU(6) Hubbard model realized by ytterbium atoms in optical lattices. We study one-dimensional, two-dimensional square and three-dimensional cubic lattice geometries. The measured SU(6) spin correlations are enhanced compared with the SU(2) correlations, owing to strong Pomeranchuk cooling. The experimental data for a one-dimensional lattice agree qualitatively with our theoretical calculations, with an error of at most 30\%, without any fitting parameters. Detailed comparison between theory and experiment allows us to infer the temperature to be the lowest achieved for a cold-atom Fermi–Hubbard model. For three-dimensional lattices, the experiments reach entropies below the regime where our calculations converge, highlighting the importance of these experiments as quantum simulations. A cold-atom simulator has realized a popular many-body model of quantum magnetism in regimes that cannot be easily studied theoretically, achieving the record-coldest fermions ever seen.},

  abstract     = {Charging of dielectrics on contact and separation has puzzled scientists and engineers for centuries. In a conventional view, the charges emerging on the two surfaces derive from the properties of the contacting materials, are of opposite polarities and are distributed approximately uniformly. However, a body of evidence has been mounting that contact electrification can also produce heterogeneous charge distributions in the form of (+/-) charge mosaics on each of the surfaces—yet, despite many attempts, no predictive model explaining the formation of mosaics at different length scales has been proposed; the main line of thinking has been that they must reflect some spatial heterogeneity present in the contacting materials. Here we describe experiments and theoretical models that prove a fundamentally different origin of mosaic formation: namely, not due to the properties of the contacting materials but due to electrostatic discharges between the separating surfaces. In particular, as the gap between the contact-charging surfaces grows, the threshold of the electric-field magnitude required for electrostatic discharge by Paschen’s law decreases, and eventually becomes lower than the electric field created in the gap by surface charges. Once a discharge starts, it continues not only until neutralizing but also locally inverting the surface charges. It is then the cycles of such discharges along the delamination front that give rise to the bipolar charge mosaics. Under certain conditions, contact electrification can lead to heterogeneous surface charge distributions—charge mosaics. Experiments and theory now show that these arise from electrostatic discharges between disjoining surfaces.},

  abstract     = {Electron correlations amplify quantum fluctuations and, as such, are recognized as the origin of many quantum phases. However, whether strong correlations can lead to gapless topological states is an outstanding question, in part because many of the ideas in topological condensed-matter physics rely on the analysis of an effectively non-interacting band structure. Therefore, a framework that allows the identification of strongly correlated topological materials is needed. Here we suggest a general approach in which strong correlations cooperate with crystalline symmetry to drive gapless topological states. We test this materials design principle by exploring Kondo lattice models and materials whose space-group symmetries promote different kinds of electronic degeneracies. This approach allows us to identify Weyl–Kondo nodal-line semimetals with nodes pinned to the Fermi energy, demonstrating that it can be applied to discover strongly correlated topological semimetals. We identify three heavy-fermion compounds as material candidates, provide direct experimental evidence for our prediction in Ce2Au3In5 and discuss how our approach may lead to many more. Our findings illustrate the potential of this materials design principle to guide the search for new topological metals in a broad range of strongly correlated systems. Strongly correlated topological materials are hard to identify. Now a design principle suggests a method for producing many topological metals where strong electron–electron interactions are a driving force.},

  abstract     = {Quantum spin liquids are highly entangled, disordered magnetic states that are expected to arise in frustrated Mott insulators and to exhibit exotic fractional excitations such as spinons and chargons. Despite being electrical insulators, some quantum spin liquids are predicted to exhibit gapless itinerant spinons that yield metallic behaviour in the charge-neutral spin channel. We deposited isolated magnetic atoms onto single-layer 1T-TaSe2, a candidate gapless spin liquid, to probe how itinerant spinons couple to impurity spin centres. Using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, we observe the emergence of new, impurity-induced resonance peaks at the 1T-TaSe2 Hubbard band edges when cobalt adatoms are positioned to have maximal spatial overlap with the local charge distribution. These resonance peaks disappear when the spatial overlap is reduced or when the magnetic impurities are replaced with nonmagnetic impurities. Theoretical simulations of a modified Anderson impurity model show that the observed peaks are consistent with a Kondo resonance induced by spinons combined with spin-charge binding effects that arise due to fluctuations of an emergent gauge field. Unconventional quasiparticles carrying spin but not electric charge emerge in quantum spin liquid phases. The Kondo interaction of these spinon quasiparticles with magnetic impurities may now have been observed.},

  abstract     = {Since the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, detailed studies of its properties have been ongoing. Besides its mass, its width—related to its lifetime—is an important parameter. One way to determine this quantity is to measure its off-shell production, where the Higgs boson mass is far away from its nominal value, and relating it to its on-shell production, where the mass is close to the nominal value. Here we report evidence for such off-shell contributions to the production cross-section of two Z bosons with data from the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. We constrain the total rate of the off-shell Higgs boson contribution beyond the Z boson pair production threshold, relative to its standard model expectation, to the interval [0.0061, 2.0] at the 95\% confidence level. The scenario with no off-shell contribution is excluded at a p-value of 0.0003 (3.6 standard deviations). We measure the width of the Higgs boson as $${{{\varGamma }}}_{{{{{{\rm{H}}}}}}}={3.2}_{-1.7}^{+2.4}\,{{{{{\rm{MeV}}}}}}$$ , in agreement with the standard model expectation of 4.1 MeV. In addition, we set constraints on anomalous Higgs boson couplings to W and Z boson pairs. The CMS Collaboration reports evidence for off-shell Higgs boson contributions in the production of Z boson pairs, and measures the width of the Higgs boson, which is inversely related to its lifetime.},

  abstract     = {Quantum simulation has emerged as a valuable arena for demonstrating and understanding the capabilities of near-term quantum computers1–3. Quantum annealing4,5 has been successfully used in simulating a range of open quantum systems, both at equilibrium6–8 and out of equilibrium9–11. However, in all previous experiments, annealing has been too slow to coherently simulate a closed quantum system, due to the onset of thermal effects from the environment. Here we demonstrate coherent evolution through a quantum phase transition in the paradigmatic setting of a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising chain, using up to 2,000 superconducting flux qubits in a programmable quantum annealer. In large systems, we observe the quantum Kibble–Zurek mechanism with theoretically predicted kink statistics, as well as characteristic positive kink–kink correlations, independent of temperature. In small chains, excitation statistics validate the picture of a Landau–Zener transition at a minimum gap. In both cases, the results are in quantitative agreement with analytical solutions to the closed-system quantum model. For slower anneals, we observe anti-Kibble–Zurek scaling in a crossover to the open quantum regime. The coherent dynamics of large-scale quantum annealers demonstrated here can be exploited to perform approximate quantum optimization, machine learning and simulation tasks. The coherent dynamics of the transverse-field Ising model driven through a quantum phase transition can be accurately simulated using a large-scale quantum annealer.},

  abstract     = {The performance of qubit-based technologies can be strongly limited by environmental sources of noise and disorder that cause decoherence. Qubits used in quantum sensing are usually very close to the host surface to enhance their coupling to external targets. This leaves them vulnerable to the effects of the surrounding noisy electron spin bath near the surface, which is very challenging to eliminate. Here we developed an efficient method to engineer the immediate electrostatic environment of nitrogen vacancy centre qubits located several nanometres beneath the diamond surface. We adopt a ‘pull-and-push’ strategy for near-surface charge manipulation using the strong local electric field of an atomic force microscope tip. Our technique is particularly effective for extremely shallow nitrogen vacancy centres, increasing their spin echo time by up to 20 fold. This corresponds to an 80-fold enhancement in the potential sensitivity for detecting individual external proton spins. Our work not only represents a step towards overcoming a fundamental restriction to applications of shallow nitrogen vacancy centres for quantum sensing but may also provide a general route for enhancing the coherence of solid-state qubits. Nitrogen vacancy centres close to the surface of diamonds are a key component of quantum sensing technologies. Using an atomic force microscope to manipulate the surface electrostatic environment can significantly improve the sensing performance.},

  abstract     = {Lasing typically starts from fluorescence, and the laser wavelength is therefore limited to the fluorescence spectrum of the gain material. Accessing wavelengths beyond this intrinsic emission spectrum requires emission assisted by multiphonon processes. However, this is much weaker than the fluorescence originating from direct transitions between electronic energy levels, which only involve a small number of phonons. Here, we present the realization of lasers far beyond the fluorescence spectrum in Yb-doped YCa4O(BO3)3 crystals. We selectively amplify three- to eight-phonon processes and suppress all the fewer-phonon ones, which we attribute to constructive interactions of vibrational modes from free oxygen sites. We obtain an overall spectral tuneability of 1,110–1,465 nm in five segments, each with its own configuration, corresponding to the three- to seven-phonon cases. The longest (eight-phonon) lasing wavelength can reach 1,518 nm, over 400 nm beyond the fluorescence spectrum. Our results shed light on strengthening the original weak electron–phonon–photon interaction and give rise to a search for on-demand lasers operating outside the fluorescence spectrum. As laser action emerges from fluorescence, its emission wavelength lies within the fluorescence spectrum. Exploiting multiphonon processes can take the laser emission far beyond the spectral limits defined by a material’s intrinsic fluorescence.},

  abstract     = {Investigating how solid matter behaves at enormous pressures, such as those found in the deep interiors of giant planets, is a great experimental challenge. Over the past decade, computational predictions have revealed that compression to terapascal pressures may bring about counter-intuitive changes in the structure and bonding of solids as quantum mechanical forces grow in influence1–6. Although this behaviour has been observed at modest pressures in the highly compressible light alkali metals7,8, it has not been established whether it is commonplace among high-pressure solids more broadly. We used shaped laser pulses at the National Ignition Facility to compress elemental Mg up to 1.3 TPa, which is approximately four times the pressure at the Earth’s core. By directly probing the crystal structure using nanosecond-duration X-ray diffraction, we found that Mg changes its crystal structure several times with non-close-packed phases emerging at the highest pressures. Our results demonstrate that phase transformations of extremely condensed matter, previously only accessible through theoretical calculations, can now be experimentally explored. Numerical studies have predicted that solids at extremely high pressures should exhibit changes in structure driven by quantum mechanical effects. These predictions have now been verified in magnesium.},

Here we report the experimental realization of a kicked quantum rotor ensemble with tunable interactions using a Bose–Einstein condensate in a pulsed optical lattice. We observe a clear breakdown of dynamical localization due to interactions, but the resulting dynamics do not restore classical chaotic behaviour, instead displaying sublinear anomalous diffusion. Moreover, echo-type time-reversal experiments establish the role of interactions in destroying reversibility. These results quantitatively elucidate the dynamical transition to many-body quantum chaos and advance our understanding of quantum anomalous diffusion, with implications on the protection of quantum information in interacting driven systems. Periodic kicking of a quantum system leads to dynamical localization and to the failure of thermalization.

Here we study the contribution of the electron–spin-fluctuation coupling to the superconducting state of the two-dimensional Hubbard model within dynamical cluster approximation4 using a numerically exact continuous-time Monte Carlo solver5. We show that only about half of the superconductivity can be attributed to a pairing mechanism arising from treating spin fluctuations as a pairing boson in the standard one-loop theory. The rest of the pairing interaction must come from as-yet unidentified higher-energy processes. Fluctuations arising from proximity to an antiferromagnetic state may be a mechanism for electron pairing in high-temperature superconductors. Now numerics show that only about half of the pairing interaction can be attributed to spin fluctuations considered in spin fluctuation theory.},

Effects of quantum gravity4 are expected to appear at the Planck energy scale. Such a high-energy universe would have existed only immediately after the Big Bang and is inaccessible by human technologies. On the other hand, quantum gravity effects may exist in our low-energy vacuum5–8, but are suppressed by inverse powers of the Planck energy. Measuring the coupling of particles to such small effects is difficult via kinematic observables, but could be observable through flavour conversions. Here we report a search with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, using astrophysical neutrino flavours9,10 to search for new space–time structure. We did not find any evidence of anomalous flavour conversion in the IceCube astrophysical neutrino flavour data. We apply the most stringent limits of any known technologies, down to 10−42 GeV−2 with Bayes factor greater than 10 on the dimension-six operators that parameterize the space–time defects. We thus unambiguously reach the parameter space of quantum-gravity-motivated physics.

  abstract     = {The first-order phase transition between two tetrahedral networks of different density—introduced as a hypothesis to account for the anomalous behaviour of certain thermodynamic properties of deeply supercooled water—has received strong support from a growing body of work in recent years. Here we show that this liquid–liquid phase transition in tetrahedral networks can be described as a transition between an unentangled, low-density liquid and an entangled, high-density liquid, the latter containing an ensemble of topologically complex motifs. We first reveal this distinction in a rationally designed colloidal analogue of water. We show that this colloidal water model displays the well-known water thermodynamic anomalies as well as a liquid–liquid critical point. We then investigate water, employing two widely used molecular models, to demonstrate that there is also a clear topological distinction between its two supercooled liquid networks, thereby establishing the generality of this observation, which might have far-reaching implications for understanding liquid–liquid phase transitions in tetrahedral liquids. Supercooled water undergoes a liquid–liquid phase transition. The authors show that the two phases have distinct hydrogen-bond networks, differing in their degree of entanglement, and thus the transition can be described by the topological changes of the network.},

This type of self-organized active matter raises the question of the coordination mechanism between molecular motor activity and cytoskeletal filament bending. Here we show that in the presence of myosin motors, polymerizing actin filaments self-assemble into polar bundles that exhibit wave-like beating. Importantly, filament beating is associated with myosin density waves initiated at twice the frequency of the actin-bending waves. A theoretical description based on curvature control of motor binding to the filaments and of motor activity explains our observations in a regime of high internal friction. Overall, our results indicate that the binding of myosin to actin depends on the actin bundle shape, providing a feedback mechanism between the myosin activity and filament deformations for the self-organization of large motor filament assemblies. Cilia are composed of cytoskeletal filaments and molecular motors and are characterized by a wave-like motion. Here the authors show that this motion is reconstituted in vitro from the self-assembly of polymerizing actin filaments and myosin motors.},

  abstract     = {Active solids consist of elastically coupled out-of-equilibrium units performing work1–13. They are central to autonomous processes, such as locomotion, self-oscillations and rectification, in biological systems14–25, designer materials26 and robotics27–31. Yet, the feedback mechanism between elastic and active forces as well as the possible emergence of collective behaviours in a mechanically stable elastic solid remains elusive. Here we introduce a minimal realization of an active elastic solid in which we characterize the emergence of selective and collective actuation resulting from the interplay between activity and elasticity. Polar active agents exert forces on the nodes of a two-dimensional elastic lattice. The resulting displacement field nonlinearly reorients the active agents. For a large-enough coupling, a collective oscillation of the lattice nodes around their equilibrium position emerges. Only a few elastic modes are actuated and crucially, they are not necessarily the lowest energy ones. By combining experiments with the numerical and theoretical analyses of an agent’s model, we unveil the bifurcation scenario and selection mechanism by which the collective actuation takes place. Our findings may provide a new mechanism for oscillatory dynamics in biological systems14,19,21,24 and the opportunity for bona fide autonomy in metamaterials32,33. In active solids, work is performed by elastically coupled units. By studying a minimal experimental model of an active solid, actuation mechanisms resulting in a collectively oscillating displacement field that drives work cycles are now identified.},

  abstract     = {Cooper pairs in non-centrosymmetric superconductors can acquire finite centre-of-mass momentum in the presence of an external magnetic field. Recent theory predicts that such finite-momentum pairing can lead to an asymmetric critical current, where a dissipationless supercurrent can flow along one direction but not in the opposite one. Here we report the discovery of a giant Josephson diode effect in Josephson junctions formed from a type-II Dirac semimetal, NiTe2. A distinguishing feature is that the asymmetry in the critical current depends sensitively on the magnitude and direction of an applied magnetic field and achieves its maximum value when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the current and is of the order of just 10 mT. Moreover, the asymmetry changes sign several times with an increasing field. These characteristic features are accounted for by a model based on finite-momentum Cooper pairing that largely originates from the Zeeman shift of spin-helical topological surface states. The finite pairing momentum is further established, and its value determined, from the evolution of the interference pattern under an in-plane magnetic field. The observed giant magnitude of the asymmetry in critical current and the clear exposition of its underlying mechanism paves the way to build novel superconducting computing devices using the Josephson diode effect. A diode effect—asymmetric transport depending on its direction—is shown in the proximity-induced superconducting state of a Dirac semimetal.},

  abstract     = {The critical current of a superconductor can be different for opposite directions of current flow when both time-reversal and inversion symmetry are broken. Such non-reciprocal behaviour creates a superconducting diode and has recently been experimentally demonstrated by breaking these symmetries with an applied magnetic field or by the construction of a magnetic tunnel junction. Here we report an intrinsic superconducting diode effect that is present at zero external magnetic field in mirror-symmetric twisted trilayer graphene. Such non-reciprocal behaviour, with sign that can be reversed through training with an out-of-plane magnetic field, provides direct evidence of the microscopic coexistence between superconductivity and time-reversal symmetry breaking. In addition to the magnetic-field trainability, we show that the zero-field diode effect can be controlled by varying the carrier density or twist angle. A natural interpretation for the origin of the intrinsic diode effect is an imbalance in the valley occupation of the underlying Fermi surface, which probably leads to finite-momentum Cooper pairing and nematicity in the superconducting phase. A superconducting diode effect is observed at zero magnetic field in twisted trilayer graphene. This suggests that time-reversal symmetry is intrinsically broken and leads to pairing between electrons with non-zero centre-of-mass momentum.},

  abstract     = {Moiré superlattices in van der Waals heterostructures have emerged as a powerful tool for engineering quantum phenomena. Here we report the observation of a correlated interlayer exciton insulator in a double-layer heterostructure composed of a WSe2 monolayer and a WS2/WSe2 moiré bilayer that are separated by ultrathin hexagonal boron nitride. The moiré WS2/WSe2 bilayer features a Mott insulator state when the density of holes is one per moiré lattice site. When electrons are added to the Mott insulator in the WS2/WSe2 moiré bilayer and an equal number of holes are injected into the WSe2 monolayer, a new interlayer exciton insulator emerges with the holes in the WSe2 monolayer and the electrons in the doped Mott insulator bound together through interlayer Coulomb interactions. The interlayer exciton insulator is stable up to a critical hole density in the WSe2 monolayer, beyond which the interlayer exciton dissociates. Our study highlights the opportunities for realizing quantum phases in double-layer moiré systems due to the interplay between the moiré flat band and strong interlayer electron interactions. When independent layers of electrons and holes are in close proximity to each other, their Coulomb interaction allows them to pair into neutral bosons and form an insulating state. This phenomenon is reported in a heterostructure of 2D materials.},

Here we report the observation of charge migration in neutral silane (SiH4) in 690 as, its decoherence within 15 fs and its revival after 40–50 fs, using X-ray attosecond transient-absorption spectroscopy. We observe the migration of charge as pairs of quantum beats with a characteristic spectral phase in the transient spectrum, in agreement with theory. The decay and revival of the degree of electronic coherence is found to be a result of both adiabatic and non-adiabatic dynamics in the populated Rydberg and valence states. The experimental results are supported by fully quantum-mechanical ab initio calculations that include both electronic and nuclear dynamics, which additionally support the experimental evidence that conical intersections can mediate the transfer of electronic coherence from an initial superposition state to another one involving a different lower-lying state. X-ray ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy captures the charge migration in neutral silane molecules, which shows in the spectra as pairs of quantum beats.},

In a system with multiple orbitals, an orbital-selective Mott insulator can form, where electrons in some orbitals are predicted to localize while others remain itinerant. Here we demonstrate a more general version of this phenomenon by observing flavour-selective localization in an atom-based quantum simulator. Our experiment realizes Fermi–Hubbard models with an SU(3) symmetry that can be broken using a tunable coupling between flavours. We observe an enhancement of the localization associated with a selective Mott transition and the emergence of flavour-dependent correlations. Our realization of flavour-selective Mott physics demonstrates the potential of cold atoms to simulate interacting multicomponent materials such as superconductors and topological insulators. A Mott insulator forms when strong interactions between particles cause them to become localized. A cold atom simulator has now been used to realize a selective Mott insulator in which atoms are localized or propagating depending on their spin state.},

This links atomic nuclei to properties of neutron stars, thereby relating objects that differ in size by orders of magnitude. The nucleus 208Pb is of particular interest because it exhibits a simple structure and is experimentally accessible. However, computing such a heavy nucleus has been out of reach for ab initio theory. By combining advances in quantum many-body methods, statistical tools and emulator technology, we make quantitative predictions for the properties of 208Pb starting from nuclear forces that are consistent with symmetries of low-energy quantum chromodynamics. We explore 109 different nuclear force parameterizations via history matching, confront them with data in select light nuclei and arrive at an importance-weighted ensemble of interactions. We accurately reproduce bulk properties of 208Pb and determine the neutron skin thickness, which is smaller and more precise than a recent extraction from parity-violating electron scattering but in agreement with other experimental probes. This work demonstrates how realistic two- and three-nucleon forces act in a heavy nucleus and allows us to make quantitative predictions across the nuclear landscape. Predictions of the properties of 208Pb from first principles augmented by statistical learning techniques reproduce those seen in experiments but rule out very thick neutron skins.},

We demonstrate the control of a photon using a second photon mediated by the quantum emitter. The dynamical response of the two-photon interaction is experimentally unravelled and reveals quantum correlations controlled by the pulse duration. Further development of this platform work, which constitutes a new research frontier in quantum optics6, will enable the tailoring of complex photonic quantum resource states.

Such waves can develop in numerous ways, from classic Langmuir oscillations carried by electron thermal motion4, to the waves excited by an external force and travelling with a driver5. In plasma-based particle accelerators3,6, a strong laser or relativistic particle beam launches plasma waves with field amplitude that follows the driver strength up to the wavebreaking limit5,7, which is the maximum wave amplitude that a plasma can sustain. In this limit, plasma electrons gain sufficient energy from the wave to outrun it and to get trapped inside the wave bucket8. Theory and numerical simulations predict multi-dimensional wavebreaking, which is crucial in the electron self-injection process that determines the accelerator performances9,10. Here we present a real-time experimental visualization of the laser-driven nonlinear relativistic plasma waves by probing them with a femtosecond high-energy electron bunch from another laser-plasma accelerator coupled to the same laser system. This single-shot electron deflectometry allows us to characterize nonlinear plasma wakefield with femtosecond temporal and micrometre spatial resolutions revealing features of the plasma waves at the breaking point. In a plasma-based accelerator, the amplitude of the plasma wave is constrained by the wavebreaking limit. Experiments reveal features of the plasma waves at the point at which wavebreaking occurs.},

Despite substantial efforts in astrophysical observations and laboratory experiments, previous tests are not sufficiently accurate to provide decisive conclusions as to the validity of these theories. One particularly compelling idea—the so-called chameleon theory—describes an ultra-light scalar field that couples to normal-matter fields and leaves measurable effects that are not explained by the four fundamental interactions, a so-called fifth force. Here, using a diamagnetically levitated force sensor, we extend previous tests by nearly two orders of magnitude, covering the entire physically plausible parameter space of cosmologically viable chameleon models. We find no evidence for the fifth force predicted by chameleon models. Our results decisively rule out the basic chameleon model as a candidate for dark energy and demonstrate the robustness of laboratory experiments for unveiling the nature of dark energy in the future. The methodology developed here could be further applied to study a broad range of fundamental physics. In experiments with a levitated force sensor, no signatures of a fifth force are detected. This rules out the basic chameleon model, which is a popular theory providing an explanation for dark energy.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional moiré superlattices provide a highly tunable platform to study strongly correlated physics. In particular, the moiré superlattices of two-dimensional semiconductor heterojunctions have been shown to host tunable correlated electronic states such as a Mott insulator and generalized Wigner crystals1–4. Here we report the observation of an excitonic insulator5–7, a correlated state with strongly bound electrons and holes, in an angle-aligned monolayer WS2/bilayer WSe2 moiré superlattice. The moiré coupling induces a flat miniband on the valence-band side only in the first WSe2 layer interfacing WS2. The electrostatically introduced holes first fill this miniband and form a Mott insulator when the carrier density corresponds to one hole per moiré supercell. By applying a vertical electric field, we tune the valence band in the second WSe2 layer to overlap with the moiré miniband in the first WSe2 layer, realizing the coexistence of electrons and holes at equilibrium, which are bound as excitons due to a strong Coulomb interaction. We show that this new bound state is an excitonic insulator with a transition temperature as high as 90 K. Our study demonstrates a moiré system for the study of correlated many-body physics in two dimensions. Stacking monolayer WS2 on top of bilayer WSe2 creates conditions where electrons and holes can coexist in the structure. Their Coulomb interaction allows them to form bound pairs and hence an excitonic insulator state.},

  abstract     = {The under-attribution of women’s contributions to scientific scholarship is well known and well studied. One measure of this under-attribution is the citation gap between men and women: the under-citation of papers authored by women relative to expected rates coupled with an over-citation of papers authored by men relative to expected rates. Here we explore this citation gap in contemporary physics. We find a global bias wherein papers authored by women are significantly under-cited, and papers authored by men are significantly over-cited. Moreover, we find that citation behaviour varies along several dimensions, such that imbalances differ according to who is citing, where they are citing and what they are citing. Specifically, citation imbalance in favour of man-authored papers is highest for papers authored by men, papers published in general physics journals and papers for which citing authors probably have less domain or author familiarity. Our results suggest that although deciding which papers to cite is an individual choice, the cumulative effects of these choices needlessly harm a subset of scholars. We discuss several strategies for the mitigation of these effects, including conscious behavioural changes at the individual, journal and community levels. The under-citation of woman authors in physics is quantified and measures that could overcome this inequity are presented.},

  abstract     = {The development of high-resolution imaging methods such as electron and scanning probe microscopy and atomic probe tomography have provided a wealth of information on the atomic structure and functionalities of solids. The availability of this data in turn necessitates the development of approaches to derive quantitative physical information, akin to how the development of scattering techniques provided insights into the atomic-level structure of a vast array of materials in the twentieth century. Here we argue that the endeavour to understand local imaging data requires the adaptation of classical macroscopic definitions. For example, the notion of symmetry can be introduced locally only in a probabilistic sense that must balance our knowledge of the material’s physics and other experimental data points with the imaging data at hand. At the same time, this wealth of local data can enable fundamentally new approaches for the description of solids, based on the construction of statistical and physical models that can ‘generate’ the observed structures. Finally, we note that the availability of observational data opens pathways towards exploring causal mechanisms underpinning solid structure and functionality. High-resolution imaging methods have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the structure of materials. To move microscopy and tomography methods forwards, approaches to reassess macroscopic concepts such as symmetry are needed.},

  abstract     = {Studies of electric effects in biological systems, from the work on action potential to studies on limb regeneration or wound healing, commonly focus on transitory behaviour and not on addressing the question of homeostasis. Here we use a microfluidic device to study how the homeostasis of confluent epithelial tissues is modified when a transepithelial potential difference that is different from the natural one is imposed on an epithelial layer. When the field direction matches the natural one, we can restore perfect confluence in an epithelial layer turned defective either by E-cadherin knockout or by weakening the cell–substrate adhesion; additionally, the tissue pushes on the substrate with kilopascal stress, inducing active-cell response such as death and differentiation. When the field is opposite, the tissue pulls with similar strengths, whereas homeostasis is destroyed by the perturbation of junctional actin and cell shapes, increased cell division rate and formation of mounds. Most of these observations can be quantitatively explained by an electrohydrodynamic theory involving local cytoplasmic electro-osmotic flows. We expect this work to motivate further studies on the long-time effects of electromechanical pathways with important tissue engineering applications. Epithelial tissues such as those in the gut or skin are strongly polar, generating electric fields that play a role in wound healing and nutrient transport. Changing the field direction in a layer of tissue disrupts its homeostatic stability.},

  abstract     = {Cell behaviour is affected by the physical forces and mechanical properties of cells and their microenvironment. The viscosity of extracellular fluid—a component of the cellular microenvironment—can vary by orders of magnitude, but its effect on cell behaviour remains largely unexplored. Using biocompatible polymers to increase the viscosity of the culture medium, we characterize how viscosity affects cell behaviour. We find that multiple types of adherent cell respond in an unexpected but similar manner to elevated viscosity. In a highly viscous medium, cells double their spread area, exhibit increased focal adhesion formation and turnover, generate significantly greater traction forces and migrate nearly two times faster. We observe that when cells are immersed in a regular medium, these viscosity-dependent responses require an actively ruffling lamellipodium—a dynamic membrane structure at the front of the cell. We present evidence that cells utilize membrane ruffling to sense changes in extracellular fluid viscosity and to trigger adaptive responses. Living cells change their behaviour in response to the viscosity of the medium surrounding them. An in vitro study shows that cells spread wider and move faster in a highly viscous medium, provided they have an actively ruffling lamellipodium.},

Here we demonstrate flow-driven rotary motion of a self-organized DNA nanostructure that is docked onto a nanopore in a thin solid-state membrane. An elastic DNA bundle self-assembles into a chiral conformation upon phoretic docking onto the solid-state nanopore, and subsequently displays a sustained unidirectional rotary motion of up to 20 rev s−1. The rotors harness energy from a nanoscale water and ion flow that is generated by a static chemical or electrochemical potential gradient in the nanopore, which are established through a salt gradient or applied voltage, respectively. These artificial nanoengines self-organize and operate autonomously in physiological conditions, suggesting ways to constructing energy-transducing motors at nanoscale interfaces. A self-assembled DNA structure is coupled to a nanopore and exhibits continuous rotation in the presence of nanoscale flows driven by electric fields or ionic gradients.},

Wrinkling by confinement to an incompatible substrate is an attractive way of generating reconfigurable patterned topographies, but controlling the often asymmetric and apparently stochastic wrinkles that result remains an elusive goal. Here, we describe a new approach to understanding the wrinkles of confined elastic shells, using a Lagrange multiplier in place of stress. Our theory reveals a simple set of geometric rules predicting the emergence and layout of orderly wrinkles, and explaining a surprisingly generic co-existence of ordered and disordered wrinkle domains. The results agree with numerous test cases across simulation and experiment and represent an elementary geometric toolkit for designing complex wrinkle patterns. Wrinkling happens because of mechanical instabilities arising from length mismatches. A theory now describes wrinkling in confined elastic shells and is expected to be relevant for the controlled design of complex wrinkle patterns.},

  abstract     = {Snow slab avalanches, characterized by a distinct, broad fracture line, are released following anticrack propagation in highly porous weak snow layers buried below cohesive slabs. The anticrack mechanism is driven by the volumetric collapse of the weak layer, which leads to the closure of crack faces and to the onset of frictional contact. Here, on the basis of snow fracture experiments, full-scale avalanche measurements and numerical simulations, we report the existence of a transition from sub-Rayleigh anticrack to supershear crack propagation. This transition follows the Burridge–Andrews mechanism, in which a supershear daughter crack nucleates ahead of the main fracture front and eventually propagates faster than the shear wave speed. Furthermore, we show that the supershear propagation regime can exist even if the shear-to-normal stress ratio is lower than the static friction coefficient as a result of the loss of frictional resistance during collapse. This finding shows that snow slab avalanches have fundamental similarities with strike-slip earthquakes. Avalanches can occur when a porous snow layer lies beneath a dense cohesive snow slab. Field experiments and simulations now reveal different crack-propagation regimes in slab avalanches, similar to rupture propagation following an earthquake.},

However, unlike magnetostriction, which couples magnetization quadratically to strain, it enables bidirectional control of a net magnetic moment. If this effect becomes large at room temperature, it may be technologically relevant, similar to its electric analogue, piezoelectricity. However, current studies of the piezomagnetic effect have been primarily restricted to antiferromagnetic insulators at cryogenic temperatures. Here we report the observation of large piezomagnetism in the antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Mn3Sn at room temperature. This material is known for its nearly magnetization-free anomalous Hall effect. We find that a small uniaxial strain on the order of 0.1\% can control both the sign and size of the anomalous Hall effect. Our experiment and theory show that the piezomagnetism can control the anomalous Hall effect, which will be useful for spintronics applications. Control of magnetization is important for applications in spintronics. Now, the piezomagnetic effect allows strain to control the anomalous Hall effect in a metal at room temperature by rotating its antiferromagnetic order.},

The resulting non-Abelian gauge fields and associated non-commutative operations would be promising for applications related to unitary matrices, such as photonic quantum logic. Here we propose the experimental realization of non-Abelian Thouless pumping in an on-chip photonic platform. By modulating the coupling coefficients within photonic waveguides with degenerate flat bands, we observe non-Abelian Thouless pumping in a three-step pumping device where the outcomes depend on the sequence of the pumping operations. We anticipate our versatile platform to reveal more complex non-Abelian topological physics and realize on-chip non-Abelian photonic devices in the future.

Yet, quantum computational advantage has only been demonstrated for artificial tasks such as random circuit sampling, and hardware limitations and noise have limited experiments to qualitative studies of small-scale systems. Quantum processors capable of high-fidelity measurements and qubit reuse enable a recently proposed holographic technique that employs quantum tensor-network states, a class of states that efficiently compress quantum data, to simulate the evolution of infinitely long, entangled initial states using a small number of qubits. Here we benchmark this holographic technique in a trapped-ion quantum processor using 11 qubits to simulate the dynamics of an infinite entangled state. We observe the hallmarks of quantum chaos and light-cone propagation of correlations, and find excellent quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions for the infinite-size limit of the implemented model with minimal post-processing or error mitigation. These results show that quantum tensor-network methods, paired with state-of-the-art quantum processor capabilities, offer a viable route to practical quantum computational advantage on problems of direct interest to science and technology in the near term. The simulation of quantum dynamics is a challenging task to solve with classical resources.

Arrays of neutral atoms, where Rydberg-based interactions may generate entanglement between individually controlled and resolved atoms, constitute a promising quantum platform to achieve this. Here we leverage the programmable state preparation afforded by optical tweezers and the efficient strong confinement of a three-dimensional optical lattice to prepare an ensemble of strontium-atom pairs in their motional ground state. We engineer global single-qubit gates on the optical clock transition and two-qubit entangling gates via adiabatic Rydberg dressing, enabling the generation of Bell states with a state-preparation-and-measurement-corrected fidelity of 92.8(2.0)\% (87.1(1.6)\% without state-preparation-and-measurement correction). For use in quantum metrology, it is furthermore critical that the resulting entanglement be long lived; we find that the coherence of the Bell state has a lifetime of 4.2(6) s via parity correlations and simultaneous comparisons between entangled and unentangled ensembles. Such long-lived Bell states can be useful for enhancing metrological stability and bandwidth. In the future, atomic rearrangement will enable the implementation of many-qubit gates and cluster state generation, as well as explorations of the transverse field Ising model. Long-lived entanglement is a key resource for quantum metrology with optical clocks.

Here we observe the Hanbury Brown–Twiss effect—the emergence of bunching correlations of indistinguishable particles collected by separate detectors—in a gas of bosonic 23Na87Rb Feshbach molecules, enabled by the realization of a molecular quantum gas microscope. We detect the characteristic bunching correlations in the density fluctuations of a two-dimensional molecular gas released from and subsequently recaptured in an optical lattice. The quantum gas microscope allows us to extract the positions of individual molecules with single-site resolution. As a result, we obtain a two-molecule interference pattern with high visibility. Although these measured correlations purely arise from the quantum statistics of the molecules, the demonstrated imaging capabilities open the way for site-resolved studies of interacting molecular gases in optical lattices. The study of statistical correlations is central to the description of complex quantum objects.

  abstract     = {Trapped ions constitute one of the most promising systems for implementing quantum computing and networking1,2. For large-scale ion-trap-based quantum computers and networks, it is critical to have two types of qubit: one for computation and storage, and another for auxiliary operations such as qubit detection3, sympathetic cooling4–7 and entanglement generation through photon links8,9. Although the two qubit types can be implemented using two different ion species3,10–13, this approach introduces substantial complexity into creating and controlling each qubit type14,15. Here we resolve these challenges by implementing two coherently convertible qubit types using one ion species. We encode the qubits into two pairs of clock states of the 171Yb+ ions, and achieve microsecond-level conversion rates between the two types with one-way fidelities of 99.5\%. We further demonstrate that operations on one qubit type, including sympathetic laser cooling, single-qubit gates and qubit detection, have crosstalk errors less than 0.06\% on the other type, which is below the best-known error threshold of ~1\% for fault-tolerant quantum computing using the surface code1,16. Our work establishes the feasibility and advantages of using coherently convertible dual-type qubits with the same ion species for large-scale quantum computing and networking. Quantum computing with trapped ions requires qubits that can store and manipulate quantum information, and others that can be used for destructive incoherent operations. Different states of ytterbium-171 ions can be used to realize both qubit types},

  abstract     = {Cavity quantum electrodynamics, which explores the granularity of light by coupling a resonator to a nonlinear emitter1, has played a foundational role in the development of modern quantum information science and technology. In parallel, the field of condensed matter physics has been revolutionized by the discovery of underlying topological2–4, often arising from the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, as in the case of the quantum Hall effect. In this work, we explore the cavity quantum electrodynamics of a transmon qubit in a topologically nontrivial Harper–Hofstadter lattice5. We assemble the lattice of niobium superconducting resonators6 and break time-reversal symmetry by introducing ferrimagnets7 before coupling the system to a transmon qubit. We spectroscopically resolve the individual bulk and edge modes of the lattice, detect Rabi oscillations between the excited transmon and each mode and measure the synthetic-vacuum-induced Lamb shift of the transmon. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to employ the transmon to count individual photons8 within each mode of the topological band structure. This work opens the field of experimental chiral quantum optics9, enabling topological many-body physics with microwave photons 10,11 and providing a route to backscatter-resilient quantum communication. Edge modes in chiral topological systems can carry quantum information without backscattering. A topological lattice of superconducting resonators has been coupled to a qubit, providing a platform for chiral quantum electrodynamics and communication.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of superconductivity in Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 (ref. 1) introduced a new family of layered nickelate superconductors that has now been extended to include a range of strontium doping2,3, praseodymium or lanthanum in place of neodymium4–7, and the five-layer compound Nd6Ni5O12 (ref. 8). A number of studies have indicated that electron correlations are strong in these materials9–15, a feature that often leads to the emergence of magnetism. Here we report muon spin rotation/relaxation studies of a series of superconducting infinite-layer nickelates. Regardless of the rare earth ion or doping, we observe an intrinsic magnetic ground state arising from local moments on the nickel sublattice. The coexistence of magnetism—which is likely to be antiferromagnetic and short-range ordered—with superconductivity is reminiscent of some iron pnictides16 and heavy fermion compounds17, and qualitatively distinct from the doped cuprates18. Measurements of four different infinite-layer nickelates show that magnetic behaviour coexists with superconductivity. This is different from what is seen in cuprates, giving a strong distinction between the two classes of oxide superconductors.},

  abstract     = {Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) displays a variety of symmetry-broken phases, correlated Chern insulators, orbital magnetism and superconductivity1–8. In particular, the anomalous Hall effect has been observed when the bands are filled with an odd number of electrons per moiré unit cell5,6,9, indicating the emergence of a zero-field orbital magnetic state with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry10–12. Here we present measurements of two tBLG devices with twist angles slightly away from the magic angle and report the observation of the anomalous Hall effect at half filling of both the electron and hole moiré bands. We suggest that two factors—the increased band dispersion away from the magic angle, and substrate potentials from the encapsulating boron nitride—probably play critical roles in stabilizing a valley-polarized ground state at half filling. Our findings further expand the rich correlated phase diagram of tBLG, and indicate the need to develop a more complete understanding of its manifold of closely competing symmetry-breaking orders. The anomalous Hall effect can signify that a material has a spontaneous magnetic order. Now, twisted bilayer graphene shows this effect at half filling, suggesting that the ground state is valley-polarized.},

  abstract     = {Linear multimode optical systems have enabled clean experimental observations and the applications of numerous phenomena that continually extend the boundaries of wave physics. The infrastructure that has enabled these studies facilitates the study of an even richer world of nonlinear multimode optical systems. Multimode nonlinear optical physics is full of emergent phenomena, including robust spatial attractors, multimode wave instabilities, and conservative and dissipative multimode solitons. Many of these effects push the limits of existing theoretical techniques, demanding new insights and approaches that could emerge from other fields, such as statistical mechanics, physics-informed machine learning, network science and beyond. Here we provide an overview of recent investigations of wave propagation in highly multimode nonlinear systems, principally multimode fibre waveguides and laser cavities. These systems, with their multifaceted control, low cost, scalability and ultrahigh bandwidth, are ideal physical platforms for exploring—and ultimately applying—high-dimensional nonlinear physics, from orderly but elusive objects like spatiotemporal solitons to dynamical complexity itself, both near and far from equilibrium. Nonlinearities allow the large number of modes in a multimode fibre to interact and create emergent phenomena. This Review presents the breadth of the high-dimensional nonlinear physics that can be studied in this platform.},

  abstract     = {Imaging can take many forms—from optical microscopes and telescopes through ultrasonography to X-ray tomography. However, regardless of the imaging modality, the presence of a complex heterogeneous structure between the imaging system and the scene of interest limits the quality of the images that can be conventionally obtained. In this Review we outline recently introduced strategies to overcome the detrimental effects of scattering in optical imaging. In particular, we focus on approaches that either physically correct scattering using computer-controlled devices or employ computational inversion based on intrinsic correlations of light scattering. Despite focusing on optical techniques, this Review emphasizes the fundamental equivalence of the effects of scattering in different fields of imaging, using the scattering matrix formalism as a bridge that allows techniques developed in one field to be translated to another. Seeing—and consequently imaging—through turbid media such as fog is a difficult task, as multiple scattering scrambles the visual information. This Review summarizes techniques that physically or computationally reconstruct the images.},

  abstract     = {The main obstacle for optical imaging or for sending information through turbid media such as paint, clouds and biological tissue is the random scattering of light. Owing to its immense complexity, the process of multiple scattering has long been described by the diffusion equation, which ignores the interference of scattered light. Recent developments in optical wavefront shaping and phase recording techniques have enabled the breaking of the diffusion limit and the control of coherent light transport in complex media, including strongly scattering tissues and multimode optical fibres with random mode mixing. Great advances have been made in focusing and controlling the transmission of light through such complex systems and in performing various tasks behind them, such as optical micro-manipulation. Here, we summarize the amazing power and the fundamental limits of controlling multiple light scattering, which lay the physical foundation to harness multiply-scattered light for imaging and communication purposes. Connections to practical applications are illustrated, in particular in those areas covered in the companion articles in this issue. Multiple scattering fundamentally complicates the task of sending light through turbid media, as many applications require. This Review summarizes the theoretical framework and experimental techniques to understand and control these processes.},

  abstract     = {Photons are often referred to as flying quantum bits, a phrase that emphasizes both their quantum character and their ability to carry quantum information between two distant points. To what extent this holds for complex disordered media, such as the turbulent atmosphere or multimode optical fibres, is an active avenue of research. Over the past few decades physicists have discovered fascinating transport properties of classical light in complex media and developed incredibly powerful tools for controlling it. Recently, these findings have been extended to the quantum realm, demonstrating that quantum properties of light can also be controlled while traversing a complex scattering medium. In this Perspective we highlight some of the main developments in this endeavour, as well as their relevance to applications in quantum key distribution, quantum authentication and Boson sampling. It is not immediately obvious whether photons retain the information they carry when they traverse a disordered or multimodal medium. This Perspective discusses the extent to which the quantum properties of light can be preserved and controlled.},

Although this scattering process seems to mix and completely destroy all information, thus preventing imaging or communication, a different approach has emerged — exploiting this apparently detrimental effect to one’s advantage by processing information carried by waves. This Perspective discusses how this powerful concept has recently triggered a wealth of advances in imaging and computing.

  abstract     = {To date, there have been few dynamic measurements of gravitation in the laboratory, and fully controlled quantitative experiments have been limited to frequencies in the millihertz regime. Here we introduce a fully characterized experiment at frequencies in the hertz regime, which allows a quantitative determination of the dynamic gravitational interaction between two parallel beams vibrating at 42 Hz in bending motion. A large amplitude vibration of the transmitter beam produces a gravitationally induced motion of the high-quality-factor resonant detector beam with amplitudes up to 10−11 m. The sub-picometre-resolution measurement is made possible by a setup that combines acoustical, mechanical and electrical isolation; a temperature-stable environment; heterodyne laser interferometry; and lock-in detection. The interaction is quantitatively modelled based on Newton’s law of gravitation. Amplitude measurements at varying beam distances follow an inverse square law and agree with theoretical predictions to within approximately three percent. Furthermore, we extract the value of the gravitational constant G and near-field gravitational energy flow. We expect our experiment to enable progress in directions where current experimental evidence for dynamic gravitation is limited, such as the dynamic determination of G, inverse square law and gravitational shielding. Measurements of the gravitational interaction between two parallel beams vibrating in bending motion enable the quantitative investigation of dynamic gravitation in the hertz regime and allow the determination of the gravitational constant.},

  abstract     = {The variation associated with different observable characteristics—phenotypes—at the cellular scale underpins homeostasis and the fitness of living systems. However, if and how these noisy phenotypic traits shape properties at the population level remains poorly understood. Here we report that phenotypic noise self-regulates with growth and coordinates collective structural organization, the kinetics of topological defects and the emergence of active transport around confluent colonies. We do this by cataloguing key phenotypic traits in bacteria growing under diverse conditions. Our results reveal a statistically precise critical time for the transition from a monolayer biofilm to a multilayer biofilm, despite the strong noise in the cell geometry and the colony area at the onset of the transition. This reveals a mitigation mechanism between the noise in the cell geometry and the growth rate that dictates the narrow critical time window. By uncovering how rectification of phenotypic noise homogenizes correlated collective properties across colonies, our work points at an emergent strategy that confluent systems employ to tune active transport, buffering inherent heterogeneities associated with natural cellular environment settings. The first step of biofilm formation is a transition from a single layer of bacteria to multiple layers. Now, there is evidence that this transition is determined by the phenotypic noise associated with cell geometry and growth rate.},

The integration of similar features in photonic materials remains challenging but is desirable to manufacture active, adaptive and autonomous photonic devices. Here we show the self-organization of programmable random lasers from the reversible out-of-equilibrium self-assembly of colloids. The random lasing originates from the optical amplification of light undergoing multiple scattering within the dissipative colloidal assemblies and therefore depends crucially on their self-organization behaviour. Under external light stimuli, these dynamic random lasers are responsive and present a continuously tuneable laser threshold. They can therefore reconfigure and cooperate by emulating the ever-evolving spatiotemporal relationship between structure and functionality that is typical of many non-equilibrium assemblies. Experiments inspired by the behaviour of active matter show that an external optical stimulus can spatially reconfigure colloidal random lasers and continuously tune their lasing threshold.},

To this end, uncovering the structures involving the prominent nodes in a network is an effective approach. In temporal networks, the simultaneity of connections is crucial for temporally stable structures to arise. Here, we propose a measure to quantitatively investigate the tendency of well-connected nodes to form simultaneous and stable structures in a temporal network. We refer to this tendency as the temporal rich club phenomenon, characterized by a coefficient defined as the maximal value of the density of links between nodes with a minimal required degree, which remain stable for a certain duration. We illustrate the use of this concept by analysing diverse data sets and their temporal properties, from the role of cohesive structures in relation to processes unfolding on top of the network to the study of specific moments of interest in the evolution of the network. Uncovering structures in temporal networks requires different tools than in their static counterparts. A metric now quantifies whether the nodes with a large number of connections also tend to stay simultaneously connected for longer times.},

  abstract     = {Linear quantum measurements with independent particles are bounded by the standard quantum limit, which limits the precision achievable in estimating unknown phase parameters. The standard quantum limit can be overcome by entangling the particles, but the sensitivity is often limited by the final state readout, especially for complex entangled many-body states with non-Gaussian probability distributions. Here, by implementing an effective time-reversal protocol in an optically engineered many-body spin Hamiltonian, we demonstrate a quantum measurement with non-Gaussian states with performance beyond the limit of the readout scheme. This signal amplification through a time-reversed interaction achieves the greatest phase sensitivity improvement beyond the standard quantum limit demonstrated to date in any full Ramsey interferometer. These results open the field of robust time-reversal-based measurement protocols offering precision not too far from the Heisenberg limit. Potential applications include quantum sensors that operate at finite bandwidth, and the principle we demonstrate may also advance areas such as quantum engineering, quantum measurements and the search for new physics using optical-transition atomic clocks. The standard quantum limit bounds the precision of quantum measurements. Now, a protocol based on time-reversal operations with cold atoms overcomes that limit and achieves the greatest phase sensitivity improvement in any full Ramsey interferometer.},

  abstract     = {Existing experimental demonstrations of quantum computational advantage have had the limitation that verifying the correctness of the quantum device requires exponentially costly classical computations. Here we propose and analyse an interactive protocol for demonstrating quantum computational advantage, which is efficiently classically verifiable. Our protocol relies on a class of cryptographic tools called trapdoor claw-free functions. Although this type of function has been applied to quantum advantage protocols before, our protocol employs a surprising connection to Bell’s inequality to avoid the need for a demanding cryptographic property called the adaptive hardcore bit, while maintaining essentially no increase in the quantum circuit complexity and no extra assumptions. Leveraging the relaxed cryptographic requirements of the protocol, we present two trapdoor claw-free function constructions, based on Rabin’s function and the Diffie–Hellman problem, which have not been used in this context before. We also present two independent innovations that improve the efficiency of our implementation and can be applied to other quantum cryptographic protocols. First, we give a scheme to discard so-called garbage bits, removing the need for reversibility in the quantum circuits. Second, we show a natural way of performing postselection that reduces the fidelity needed to demonstrate quantum advantage. Combining these results, we describe a blueprint for implementing our protocol on Rydberg atom-based quantum devices, using hardware-native operations that have already been demonstrated experimentally. Interactive protocols can verify that a quantum computer exhibits a computational speedup using only classical analysis of its output. Exploiting a connection to Bell’s theorem gives a simpler protocol that is much less demanding for experiments.},

  abstract     = {Hydrodynamics is a universal effective theory that describes the thermalization of chaotic many-body systems, and depends only on the symmetries of the underlying theory. Although the Navier–Stokes equations can describe classical liquids and gases, quantum fluids of ultracold atoms or quark–gluon plasma, they cannot yet describe the phases of matter where particle motion is kinematically constrained. Here we present the nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics of models with simultaneous charge/mass, dipole/centre of mass and momentum conservation. This hydrodynamic effective theory is unstable below four spatial dimensions: dipole-conserving fluids at rest are unstable to fluctuations, which drive the system to a dynamical universality class with qualitatively distinct features from conventional fluids. In one spatial dimension, our construction is reminiscent of the well-established renormalization group flow of the stochastic Navier–Stokes equations; however, the fixed point we find possesses subdiffusive scaling rather than the superdiffusive scaling of the Kardar–Parisi–Zhang universality class. We numerically simulate many-body classical dynamics in one- and two-dimensional models with dipole and momentum conservation, and find evidence for the predicted breakdown of hydrodynamics. Our theory provides a controlled example of how kinematic constraints lead to a rich landscape of dynamical universality classes in high-dimensional models. Fractons are particles that can only move in tandem, which substantially affects their thermalization. Below four spatial dimensions, an unconventional dynamical universality class can emerge as thermal fluctuations destroy hydrodynamic behaviour.},

  abstract     = {At finite temperatures, fluctuations invariably introduce disorder and are responsible for ultimately destroying ordered phases. Here we present an unusual magnetic transition in elemental neodymium where, with increasing temperature, long-range multiply periodic ‘multi-Q’ magnetic order emerges from a self-induced spin glass. Using temperature-dependent spin-polarized scanning tunnelling microscopy, we characterize the local order of a previously reported spin glass phase, and quantify the emergence of long-range multi-Q order with increasing temperature. We develop two analysis tools that allow us to determine the glass transition temperature from measurements of the spatially dependent magnetization. We compare these observations with atomistic spin dynamics simulations, which reproduce the qualitative observation of a phase transition from a low-temperature spin glass phase to an intermediate ordered multi-Q phase. These simulations trace the origin of the unexpected high-temperature order in weakened frustration driven by temperature-dependent sublattice correlations. These findings constitute an example of order from disorder, and provide a platform to study the rich magnetization dynamics of a self-induced spin glass. Thermal fluctuations associated with higher temperatures normally destroy long-range order, but in some circumstances they can stabilize new ordered phases. This ‘order by disorder’ phenomenon has now been observed in the magnetic phases of neodymium.},

  abstract     = {Exact solutions for quantum many-body systems are rare but provide valuable insights for the description of universal phenomena such as the non-equilibrium dynamics of strongly interacting systems and the characterization of new forms of quantum matter. Recently, specific solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations for integrable spin models were found. They are dubbed phantom Bethe states and can carry macroscopic momentum yet no energy. Here, we show experimentally that there exist special helical spin patterns in anisotropic Heisenberg chains which are long-lived, relaxing only very slowly in dynamics, as a consequence of such states. We use these phantom spin-helix states to directly measure the interaction anisotropy, which has a major contribution from short-range off-site interactions. We also generalize the theoretical description to higher dimensions and other non-integrable systems and find analogous stable spin helices, which should show non-thermalizing dynamics associated with so-called quantum many-body scars. These results have implications for the quantum simulation of spin physics, as well as many-body dynamics. In generic quantum many-body systems, initial configurations far from equilibrium are expected to undergo general thermalization. An experiment with ultracold atoms now shows evidence of a class of spin-helix states that evade such behaviour.},

  abstract     = {A single spin in a Josephson junction can reverse the flow of the supercurrent by changing the sign of the superconducting phase difference across it. At mesoscopic length scales, these π-junctions are employed in various applications, such as finding the pairing symmetry of the underlying superconductor, as well as quantum computing. At the atomic scale, the counterpart of a single spin in a superconducting tunnel junction is known as a Yu–Shiba–Rusinov state. Observation of the supercurrent reversal in that setting has so far remained elusive. Here we demonstrate such a 0 to π transition of a Josephson junction through a Yu–Shiba–Rusinov state as we continuously change the impurity–superconductor coupling. We detect the sign change in the critical current by exploiting a second transport channel as reference in analogy to a superconducting quantum interference device, which provides our scanning tunnelling microscope with the required phase sensitivity. The measured change in the Josephson current is a signature of the quantum phase transition and allows its characterization with high resolution. Continuously changing the coupling between a magnetic impurity and a superconductor allows the observation of the reversal of supercurrent flow at the atomic scale.},

  abstract     = {Charge carriers in magic-angle graphene come in eight flavours described by a combination of their spin, valley and sublattice polarizations. When inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken, this ‘flavour’ degeneracy can be lifted, and their corresponding bands can be sequentially filled. Due to their non-trivial band topology and Berry curvature, each band is classified by a topological Chern number C, leading to quantum anomalous Hall and Chern insulator states. Using a scanning superconducting quantum interference device on a tip, we image the nanoscale equilibrium orbital magnetism induced by the Berry curvature, the polarity of which is governed by C, and detect its two constituent components associated with the drift and self-rotation of the electronic wavepackets. At integer filling v = 1, we observe a zero-field Chern insulator, which—rather than being described by a global topologically invariant C—forms a mosaic of microscopic patches of C = −1, 0 or 1. On further filling, we find a first-order phase transition due to the recondensation of electrons from valley K to K′, leading to irreversible flips of the local Chern number and magnetization, as well as to the formation of valley domain walls, giving rise to hysteretic anomalous Hall resistance. Topological states characterized by Chern numbers are usually considered to be the global properties of a material. Now a spatial patchwork of different Chern insulator states is imaged in twisted bilayer graphene.},

  abstract     = {Interactions are essential for the creation of correlated quantum many-body states. Although two-body interactions underlie most natural phenomena, three- and four-body interactions are important for the physics of nuclei1, exotic few-body states in ultracold quantum gases2, the fractional quantum Hall effect3, quantum error correction4 and holography5,6. Recently, a number of artificial quantum systems have emerged as simulators for many-body physics, featuring the ability to engineer strong interactions. However, the interactions in these systems have largely been limited to the two-body paradigm and require building up multibody interactions by combining two-body forces. Here we implement a scheme to create a higher-order interaction between photons stored in multiple electromagnetic modes of a microwave cavity. The system is dressed such that there is collectively no interaction until a target total photon number is reached across multiple distinct modes, at which point the photons interact strongly. In our demonstration, we create interactions involving up to three bodies and across up to five modes. We harness the interaction to prepare single-mode Fock states and multimode W states, which we verify by introducing a multimode Wigner tomography method. A method to engineer higher-order interactions between photons provides a route to create non-classical and entangled states across multiple modes.},

  abstract     = {Since the discovery of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in solids1–3, much effort has been devoted to understand its generation mechanism and both inter- and intraband transitions are known to be essential1–10. However, intraband transitions are affected by the electronic structure of a solid, and how they contribute to nonlinear carrier generation and HHG remains an open question. Here we use mid-infrared laser pulses to study HHG in CdSe and CdS quantum dots, where quantum confinement can be used to control the intraband transitions. We find that both HHG intensity per excited volume and generated carrier density increase when the average quantum dot size is increased from about 2 to 3 nm. We show that the reduction in sub-bandgap energy in larger quantum dots enhances intraband transitions, and this—in turn—increases the rate of photocarrier injection by coupling with interband transitions, resulting in enhanced HHG. Both inter- and intraband transitions contribute to high-harmonic generation in solids, but their exact roles are not fully understood. Experiments with quantum dots show that enhanced intraband transitions lead to increased carrier injection and thus enhanced harmonic generation.},

  abstract     = {A defining signature of strongly correlated electronic systems is a rich phase diagram, which consists of multiple broken symmetries, such as magnetism, superconductivity and charge order1,2. In the recently discovered nickelate superconductors3–10, a large antiferromagnetic exchange energy has been reported, which implies the existence of strong electronic correlations11. However, signatures of a broken-symmetry state other than superconductivity have not yet been observed. Here we observe charge ordering in infinite-layer nickelates La1−xSrxNiO2 using resonant X-ray scattering. The parent compound orders along the Ni–O bond direction with an incommensurate wavevector, distinct from the stripe order observed in other nickelates12–14 that propagates along a direction 45° to the Ni–O bond. The resonance profile we measure indicates that ordering originates from the nickelate layers and induces a parasitic charge modulation of lanthanum electrons. Upon doping, the charge order diminishes and its wavevector shifts towards commensurate, hinting that strong electronic correlations are likely to be responsible for the ordered state. Our results suggest that the existence of charge order and its potential interplay with antiferromagnetic fluctuations and superconductivity are important themes in nickel-based superconductors. Unconventional superconductivity is often associated with the presence of other kinds of electronic order. Observations of charge order in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors show that they fit this pattern.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental property of particles and antiparticles (such as electrons and positrons, respectively) is their ability to annihilate one another. A similar behaviour is predicted for magnetic solitons1—localized spin textures that can be distinguished by their topological index Q. Theoretically, magnetic topological solitons with opposite values of Q, such as skyrmions2 and their antiparticles (namely, antiskyrmions), are expected to be able to continuously merge and annihilate3. However, experimental verification of such particle–antiparticle pair production and annihilation processes has been lacking. Here we report the creation and annihilation of skyrmion–antiskyrmion pairs in an exceptionally thin film of the cubic chiral magnet of B20-type FeGe observed using transmission electron microscopy. Our observations are highly reproducible and are fully consistent with micromagnetic simulations. Our findings provide a new platform for the fundamental studies of particles and antiparticles based on magnetic solids and open new perspectives for practical applications of thin films of isotropic chiral magnets. Magnetic skyrmions—a type of localized spin texture—have been theoretically predicted to annihilate with counterparts known as antiskyrmions.

  abstract     = {Checkpoints arrest biological processes, allowing time for error correction. The phenomenon of checkpoint override during cellular self-replication is biologically critical, but it currently lacks a quantitative, functional or system-level understanding. To uncover fundamental laws governing error correction systems, we derived a general theory of optimal checkpoint strategies, balancing the trade-off between risk and self-replication speed. Mathematically, the problem maps onto the optimization of an absorbing boundary for a random walk. We applied the theory to the DNA damage checkpoint in budding yeast, an intensively researched model checkpoint. Using novel reporters for double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs), we first quantified the probability distribution of DSB repair in time including rare events; second, we determined the survival probability after override. With these inputs, the optimal theory remarkably accurately predicted override times as a function of DSB numbers, which we precisely measured for the first time. Thus, a first-principles calculation revealed undiscovered patterns underlying highly noisy override processes. Our multi-DSB measurements revise well-known past results and show that override is more general than previously thought. Cells have built-in mechanisms for checking for errors during replication, but these checkpoints can slow down reproduction. A theory accounting for optimal checkpoint strategies is presented and tested against observations in budding yeast.},

  abstract     = {In magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, the moiré superlattice potential gives rise to narrow electronic bands that support a multitude of many-body quantum phases. Further richness arises in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field, where the interplay between moiré and magnetic length scales leads to fractal Hofstadter subbands. In this strongly correlated Hofstadter platform, multiple experiments have identified gapped topological and correlated states, but little is known about the phase transitions between them in the intervening compressible regimes. Here we simultaneously unveil sequences of broken-symmetry Chern insulators and resolve sharp phase transitions between competing states with different topological quantum numbers and different occupations of the spin-valley flavour. Our measurements determine the energy spectrum of interacting Hofstadter subbands in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene and map out the phase diagram of flavour occupancy. In addition, we observe full lifting of the degeneracy of the zeroth Landau levels together with level crossings, indicating moiré valley splitting. We propose a unified flavour polarization mechanism to understand the intricate interplay of topology, interactions and symmetry breaking as a function of density and applied magnetic field in this system. In graphene, the spin and valley degrees of freedom combine into a higher-order isospin. Now, a full map of the phase diagram of this isospin is measured in the moiré bands of twisted bilayer graphene.},

  abstract     = {In an idealized infinite crystal, the material properties are constrained by the symmetries of the unit cell. The point-group symmetry is broken by the sample shape of any finite crystal, but this is commonly unobservable in macroscopic metals. To sense the shape-induced symmetry lowering in such metals, long-lived bulk states originating from an anisotropic Fermi surface are needed. Here we show how a strongly facetted Fermi surface and the long quasiparticle mean free path present in microstructures of PdCoO2 yield an in-plane resistivity anisotropy that is forbidden by symmetry on an infinite hexagonal lattice. We fabricate bar-shaped transport devices narrower than the mean free path from single crystals using focused ion beam milling, such that the ballistic charge carriers at low temperatures frequently collide with both of the side walls that define the channel. Two symmetry-forbidden transport signatures appear: the in-plane resistivity anisotropy exceeds a factor of 2, and a transverse voltage appears in zero magnetic field. Using ballistic Monte Carlo simulations and a numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation, we identify the orientation of the narrow channel as the source of symmetry breaking. Electrons in PdCoO2 can travel a long way before being scattered, and their band structure is such that they can travel in only one of three directions. As a result, the current flow through this nanoscale conductor can be very efficient.},

  abstract     = {The crystal symmetry of a material dictates the type of topological band structure it may host, and therefore, symmetry is the guiding principle to find topological materials. Here we introduce an alternative guiding principle, which we call ‘quasi-symmetry’. This is the situation where a Hamiltonian has exact symmetry at a lower order that is broken by higher-order perturbation terms. This enforces finite but parametrically small gaps at some low-symmetry points in momentum space. Untethered from the restraints of symmetry, quasi-symmetries eliminate the need for fine tuning as they enforce that sources of large Berry curvature occur at arbitrary chemical potentials. We demonstrate that quasi-symmetry in the semi-metal CoSi stabilizes gaps below 2 meV over a large near-degenerate plane that can be measured in the quantum oscillation spectrum. The application of in-plane strain breaks the crystal symmetry and gaps the degenerate point, observable by new magnetic breakdown orbits. The quasi-symmetry, however, does not depend on spatial symmetries and hence transmission remains fully coherent. These results demonstrate a class of topological materials with increased resilience to perturbations such as strain-induced crystalline symmetry breaking, which may lead to robust topological applications as well as unexpected topology beyond the usual space group classifications. The concept of quasi-symmetry—a perturbatively small deviation from exact symmetry—is introduced and leads to topological materials with strong resilience to perturbations.},

  abstract     = {The origin of the electronic nematicity in FeSe is one of the most important unresolved puzzles in the study of iron-based superconductors. In both spin- and orbital-nematic models, the intrinsic magnetic excitations at Q1 = (1, 0) and Q2 = (0, 1) of twin-free FeSe are expected to provide decisive criteria for clarifying this issue. Although a spin-fluctuation anisotropy below 10 meV between Q1 and Q2 has been observed by inelastic neutron scattering at low temperature, it remains unclear whether such an anisotropy also persists at higher energies and associates with the nematic transition Ts. Here we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to probe the high-energy magnetic excitations of detwinned FeSe. A prominent anisotropy between the magnetic excitations along the H and K directions is found to persist to E ≈ 200 meV, which decreases gradually with increasing temperature and finally vanishes at a temperature around Ts. The measured high-energy spin excitations are dispersive and underdamped, which can be understood from a local-moment perspective.Taking together the large energy scale far beyond the dxz/dyz orbital splitting, we suggest that the nematicity in FeSe is probably spin-driven. The mechanism that drives nematic behaviour in iron-based superconductors is still unclear. Now, nematicity and anisotropy in spin excitations are shown to disappear at the same temperature, indicating that the transition is primarily spin-driven.},

Control of their magnetization and readout of their magnetic state are essential for these applications but remain challenging. Here we report the electrical detection of room-temperature magnetization switching in the canted antiferromagnetic insulator LaFeO3, capped with a Pt or W overlayer. The observation of a large magneto-thermovoltage with an in-plane temperature gradient suggests that the mechanism is the swapping of spin currents in the antiferromagnet. This effect provides a sensitive electrical probe of the tiny net magnetization in the insulator, which can be manipulated by a magnetic field on the order of 10 mT. Our results highlight a new material class of insulating canted antiferromagnets for spintronics and spin caloritronics and suggests a method for the electrical readout of magnetic signals in an antiferromagnetic insulator. Electrical readout of the state of an antiferromagnet is an important goal for spintronic applications. Now, detection of the electrical voltage created by a thermal gradient in a canted antiferromagnet suggests a route for achieving this goal.},

A large number of proposals for using them to store, process and transduce quantum information motivates the development of increasingly sophisticated techniques for controlling mechanical motion in the quantum regime. By interfacing mechanical resonators with superconducting circuits, circuit quantum acoustodynamics can make a variety of important tools available for manipulating and measuring motional quantum states. Here we demonstrate the direct measurements of phonon number distribution and parity of non-classical mechanical states. We do this by operating our system in the strong dispersive regime, where a superconducting qubit can be used to spectroscopically resolve the phonon Fock states. These measurements are some of the basic building blocks for constructing acoustic quantum memories and processors. Furthermore, our results open the door for performing even more complex quantum algorithms using mechanical systems, such as quantum error correction and multimode operations. Mechanical resonators combined with superconducting circuits are a promising platform for controlling non-classical mechanical states. Here this platform is used to directly measure the parity of a motional quantum state.},

  abstract     = {The ability to create, manipulate and detect non-classical states of light has been key for many recent achievements in quantum physics and for developing quantum technologies. Achieving the same level of control over phonons, the quanta of vibrations, could have a similar impact, in particular on the fields of quantum sensing and quantum information processing. Here we present a crucial step towards this level of control and realize a single-mode waveguide for individual phonons in a suspended silicon microstructure. We use a cavity–waveguide architecture, where the cavity is used as a source and detector for the mechanical excitations while the waveguide has a free-standing end to reflect the phonons. This enables us to observe multiple round trips of phonons between the source and the reflector. The long mechanical lifetime of almost 100 μs demonstrates the possibility of nearly lossless transmission of single phonons over, in principle, tens of centimetres. Our experiment demonstrates full on-chip control over travelling single phonons strongly confined in the directions transverse to the propagation axis, potentially enabling a time-encoded multimode quantum memory at telecommunications wavelength and advanced quantum acoustics experiments. Non-classical vibrations are generated and transmitted along a mechanical waveguide, providing a platform for distributing quantum information and realizing hybrid quantum devices using phonons in a solid-state system.},

  abstract     = {The development of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices has extended the scope of executable quantum circuits with high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates. Equipping these devices with three-qubit gates will enable the realization of more complex quantum algorithms and efficient quantum error correction protocols with reduced circuit depth. Several three-qubit gates have been implemented for superconducting qubits, but their use in gate synthesis has been limited owing to their low fidelity. Here, using fixed-frequency superconducting qubits, we demonstrate a high-fidelity iToffoli gate based on two-qubit interactions, the so-called cross-resonance effect. As with the Toffoli gate, this three-qubit gate can be used to perform universal quantum computation. The iToffoli gate is implemented by simultaneously applying microwave pulses to a linear chain of three qubits, revealing a process fidelity as high as 98.26(2)\%. Moreover, we numerically show that our gate scheme can produce additional three-qubit gates that provide more efficient gate synthesis than the Toffoli and iToffoli gates. Our work not only brings a high-fidelity iToffoli gate to current superconducting quantum processors but also opens a pathway for developing multi-qubit gates based on two-qubit interactions. The efficiency of running quantum algorithms can be improved by expanding the hardware operations that a quantum computer can perform. A high-fidelity three-qubit iToffoli gate has now been demonstrated using superconducting qubits.},

Instead of heating fuel ions, most of the energy of alpha particles is transferred to electrons in the plasma. Furthermore, alpha particles can also excite Alfvénic instabilities, which were previously considered to be detrimental to the performance of the fusion device. Here we report improved thermal ion confinement in the presence of megaelectronvolts ions and strong fast ion-driven Alfvénic instabilities in recent experiments on the Joint European Torus. Detailed transport analysis of these experiments reveals turbulence suppression through a complex multi-scale mechanism that generates large-scale zonal flows. This holds promise for more economical operation of fusion reactors with dominant alpha particle heating and ultimately cheaper fusion electricity. Experiments at the Joint European Torus tokamak show improved thermal ion confinement in the presence of highly energetic ions and Alfvénic instabilities in the plasma.},

  abstract     = {Emergent phenomena arising from the collective behaviour of electrons is expected when Coulomb interactions dominate over the kinetic energy, and one way to create this situation is to reduce the electronic bandwidth. Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene intrinsically supports saddle points in the band structure that are predicted to host a variety of spontaneous symmetry-broken states1–7. Here we show that bilayer graphene displays a cascade of symmetry-broken states with spontaneous spin and valley isospin ordering at zero magnetic field. We independently tune the carrier density and electric displacement field to explore the phase space of isospin order. Itinerant ferromagnetic states emerge near the conduction and valence band edges with complete spin and valley polarization. At larger hole densities, twofold degenerate quantum oscillations manifest in an additional symmetry-broken state that is enhanced by the application of an in-plane magnetic field. Both symmetry-broken states display enhanced layer polarization, suggesting a coupling to the layer degree of freedom1,7. These states occur in the absence of a moiré superlattice and are intrinsic to natural graphene bilayers. Therefore, we demonstrate that bilayer graphene represents a related but distinct approach to produce collective behaviour from flat dispersion, complementary to engineered moiré structures. The flat portions of the band structure in bilayer graphene are shown to support interaction-driven symmetry-broken states, similar to moiré heterostructures.},

  abstract     = {Topological aspects of the electron wave function—including the Berry curvature and Chern number—play a crucial role in determining the physical properties of materials. Although the Berry curvature and its effects in materials have been studied1,2, detecting changes in the Chern number can be challenging, particularly changes in the valley Chern type. In this regard, twisted double bilayer graphene3–7 has emerged as a promising platform to gain electrical control over the Berry curvature hotspots8 and the valley Chern numbers of topological flat bands9,10. In addition, strain-induced breaking of the threefold rotation symmetry leads to a non-zero first moment of Berry curvature (called the Berry curvature dipole)11. Here we show that a sign change in the Berry curvature dipole detects topological transitions in the bands. In twisted double bilayer graphene, the perpendicular electric field simultaneously tunes the valley Chern number and Berry curvature dipole, providing a tunable system to probe the topological transitions. Furthermore, we find hysteresis in the transport response that is caused by switching of the electric polarization. This holds promise for next-generation Berry-curvature-based memory devices. Our technique can be emulated in three-dimensional topological systems to probe topological transitions governed by parameters such as pressure or anisotropic strain. Transport experiments highlight a technique to detect transitions in the topological state of two-dimensional materials, with possible applications in memory devices.},

Quantum circuits composed of random unitary gates with interspersed projective measurements represent a minimal model to study the balance between unitary dynamics and measurement processes3–5. As the measurement rate is varied, a purification phase transition is predicted to emerge at a critical point akin to a fault-tolerant threshold6. Here we explore this purification transition with random quantum circuits implemented on a trapped-ion quantum computer. We probe the pure phase, where the system is rapidly projected to a pure state conditioned on the measurement outcomes, and the mixed or coding phase, where the initial state becomes partially encoded into a quantum error correcting codespace that keeps the memory of initial conditions for long times6,7. We find experimental evidence of the two phases and show numerically that, with modest system scaling, critical properties of the transition emerge. Many-body open quantum systems are predicted to undergo a phase transition towards a pure state through frequent projective measurements. The phases separated by this transition have now been observed with random circuits on a trapped-ion computer.},

Here we present an experimental protocol with Rydberg atoms to determine the maximum independent set of graphs9, defined as an independent set of vertices of maximal size. Our proposal is based on a Rydberg quantum wire scheme, which exploits auxiliary atoms to engineer long-ranged networks of qubits. We experimentally test the protocol on three-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays, overcoming the intrinsic limitations of two-dimensional arrays for tackling combinatorial problems and encode high-degree vertices. We find the maximum independent set solutions with our programmable quantum-wired Rydberg simulator for Kuratowski subgraphs10 and a six-degree graph, which are paradigmatic examples of non-planar and high-degree graphs, respectively. Our protocol provides a way to engineer the complex connections of high-degree graphs through many-body entanglement, taking a step towards the demonstration of quantum advantage in combinatorial optimization. Combinatorial optimization is one of the areas for which quantum computing promises to overcome classical devices. An experiment with arrays of Rydberg atoms now shows how to solve combinatorial graph problems with auxiliary atomic wires.},

  abstract     = {In nuclear fusion reactors, plasmas are heated to very high temperatures of more than 100 million kelvin and, in so-called tokamaks, they are confined by magnetic fields in the shape of a torus. Light nuclei, such as deuterium and tritium, undergo a fusion reaction that releases energy, making fusion a promising option for a sustainable and clean energy source. Tokamak plasmas, however, are prone to disruptions as a result of a sudden collapse of the system terminating the fusion reactions. As disruptions lead to an abrupt loss of confinement, they can cause irreversible damage to present-day fusion devices and are expected to have a more devastating effect in future devices. Disruptions expected in the next-generation tokamak, ITER, for example, could cause electromagnetic forces larger than the weight of an Airbus A380. Furthermore, the thermal loads in such an event could exceed the melting threshold of the most resistant state-of-the-art materials by more than an order of magnitude. To prevent disruptions or at least mitigate their detrimental effects, empirical models obtained with artificial intelligence methods, of which an overview is given here, are commonly employed to predict their occurrence—and ideally give enough time to introduce counteracting measures. Tokamak plasmas are prone to sudden collapses that terminate the nuclear fusion reactions. This perspective discusses the prediction of these so-called disruptions with artificial intelligence techniques.},

  abstract     = {Water drops moving on surfaces are not only an everyday phenomenon seen on windows but also form an essential part of many industrial processes. Previous understanding is that drop motion is dictated by viscous dissipation and activated dynamics at the contact line. Here we demonstrate that these two effects cannot fully explain the complex paths of sliding or impacting drops. To accurately determine the forces experienced by moving drops, we imaged their trajectory when sliding down a tilted surface, and applied the relevant equations of motion. We found that drop motion on low-permittivity substrates is substantially influenced by electrostatic forces. Our findings confirm that electrostatics must be taken into consideration for the description of the motion of water, aqueous electrolytes and ethylene glycol on hydrophobic surfaces. Our results are relevant for improving the control of drop motion in many applications, including printing, microfluidics, water management and triboelectric nanogenerators. The sliding of a water drop on a surface is traditionally described by taking flow within the drop and contact-line friction into account. Now, evidence shows that electric forces can also substantially affect water-on-surface sliding dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Long-range ordering is typically associated with a decrease in entropy. Yet, it can also be driven by increasing entropy in certain special cases. Here we demonstrate that artificial spin-ice arrays of single-domain nanomagnets can be designed to produce such entropy-driven order. We focus on the tetris artificial spin-ice structure, a highly frustrated array geometry with a zero-point Pauling entropy, which is formed by selectively creating regular vacancies on the canonical square ice lattice. We probe thermally active tetris artificial spin ice both experimentally and through simulations, measuring the magnetic moments of the individual nanomagnets. We find two-dimensional magnetic ordering in one subset of these moments, which we demonstrate to be induced by disorder (that is, increased entropy) in another subset of the moments. In contrast with other entropy-driven systems, the discrete degrees of freedom in tetris artificial spin ice are binary and are both designable and directly observable at the microscale, and the entropy of the system is precisely calculable in simulations. This example, in which the system’s interactions and ground-state entropy are well defined, expands the experimental landscape for the study of entropy-driven ordering. Long-range order is normally related to an entropy decrease. Yet, an increase in entropy in one part of a system can induce long-range order in another. A new form of such entropy-driven order is now demonstrated in an artificial spin-ice system.},

  abstract     = {In frustrated spin systems, magnetic phase transitions underpin the formation of exotic, frustration-driven magnetic phases. Of great importance is the ability to manipulate these transitions to access specific phases, which in turn provides a means to discover and control novel phenomena. Artificial spin systems incorporating lithographically fabricated arrays of dipolar-coupled nanomagnets that enable real-space observation of the magnetic configurations provide such an opportunity. In particular, the kagome spin ice is predicted to exhibit two phase transitions, one of which is to a low-temperature phase whose long-range ground-state order has not been observed experimentally. To achieve this ordered state, we change the global symmetry of the artificial kagome system by selectively tuning the near-field nanomagnet interactions through nanoscale bridges at the lattice vertices. By precisely tuning the interactions, we are able to quantify the influence of frustration on the phase transition, finding that the driving force for spin and charge ordering depends on the degeneracy strength at the vertex. Artificial spin ice formed of nanomagnets arranged on a lattice mimics frustrated magnetism seen in condensed matter. By controlling magnetic interactions, theoretically predicted phase transitions are now observed in artificial kagome-lattice spin ice.},

  abstract     = {Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene has proved to be a fascinating platform to realize and study emergent quantum phases arising from the strong correlations in its flat bands. Thermal transport phenomena, such as thermopower, are sensitive to the particle–hole asymmetry, making them a crucial tool to probe the underlying electronic structure of this material. Here we have carried out thermopower measurements of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene as a function of carrier density, temperature and magnetic field. We report the observation of an unusually large thermopower reaching a value of the order of 100 μV K−1 at a low temperature of 1 K. The thermopower exhibits peak-like features that violate the Mott formula in close correspondence to the resistance peaks appearing around the integer filling of the moiré bands, including the Dirac point. We show that the large thermopower peaks and their associated behaviour arise from the emergent highly particle–hole-asymmetric electronic structure, due to the sequential filling of the moiré flat bands and the associated recovery of Dirac-like physics. Furthermore, the thermopower shows an anomalous peak around the superconducting transition, which points towards the possible role of superconducting fluctuations in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Thermal transport measurements provide a complementary view of the electronic structure of a material to electronic transport. This technique is applied to twisted bilayer graphene, and highlights the particle–hole asymmetry of its band structure.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear multimode optical systems support a host of intriguing effects that are impossible in single-mode settings. Although nonlinearity can provide a rich environment where the chaotic power exchange among thousands of modes can lead to novel behaviours, understanding and harnessing these processes to our advantage is challenging. Over the years, statistical models have been developed to macroscopically describe the response of these complex systems. One of the cornerstones of these theoretical formalisms is the prediction of a photon–photon-mediated thermalization process that leads to a Rayleigh–Jeans distribution of mode occupations. Here we report the use of mode-resolved measurement techniques to directly observe the thermalization to a Rayleigh–Jeans power distribution in a multimode optical fibre. We experimentally demonstrate that the underlying system Hamiltonian remains invariant during propagation, whereas power equipartition takes place among degenerate groups of modes—all in full accordance with theoretical predictions. Our results may pave the way towards a new generation of high-power optical sources whose brightness and modal content can be controlled using principles from thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Optical nonlinearities in multimodal systems lead to a complex behaviour that can be described as a thermalization process, which is expected to lead to a Rayleigh–Jeans distribution. This process has now been observed in graded-index fibres.},

Interactions can trigger topological phase transitions, induce symmetry protection and robustness properties for the many-body system. Here, we report the nonlinear response of a polariton lattice that implements a driven-dissipative version of the Su–Schrieffer–Heeger model. We first demonstrate the formation of topological gap solitons bifurcating from a linear topological edge state. We then focus on the formation of gap solitons in the bulk of the lattice and show that they exhibit robust nonlinear properties against defects, owing to the underlying sublattice symmetry. Leveraging the driven-dissipative nature of the system, we discover a class of bulk gap solitons with high sublattice polarization. We show that these solitons provide an all-optical way to create a non-trivial interface for Bogoliubov excitations. Our results show that coherent driving can be exploited to stabilize new nonlinear phases and establish dissipatively stabilized solitons as a powerful resource for topological photonics. Drive engineering in optical systems can be used to stabilize new nonlinear phases in topological systems. Dissipatively stabilized gap solitons in a polariton lattice establish drive engineering as a resource for nonlinear topological photonics.},

Here we study the microscopic origin of the boson peak through numerical investigations of the dynamic structure factor of two-dimensional model glasses over a wide frequency–wavenumber range. We show that the boson peak originates from quasi-localized vibrations of string-like dynamical defects. Furthermore, we reveal that these dynamical defects provide a common structural origin for the three most fundamental dynamic modes of glassy systems: the boson peak, fast β relaxation and slow structural relaxation. The relation between physical properties and structure in amorphous materials is poorly understood. Simulations now show that vibrations of string-like dynamical defects likely govern the low-temperature dynamics in these systems.},

  abstract     = {Studies of the dynamics of open quantum systems are limited by the large Hilbert space of typical environments, which is too large to be treated exactly. In some cases, approximate descriptions of the system are possible, for example, when the environment has a short memory time or only interacts weakly with the system. Accurate numerical methods exist, but these are typically restricted to baths with Gaussian correlations, such as non-interacting bosons. Here we present a method for simulating open quantum systems with arbitrary environments that consist of a set of independent degrees of freedom. Our approach automatically reduces the large number of environmental degrees of freedom to those which are most relevant. Specifically, we show how the process tensor describing the effect of the environment can be iteratively constructed and compressed using matrix product state techniques. We demonstrate the power of this method by applying it to a range of open quantum systems, including bosonic, fermionic and spin environments. The versatility and efficiency of our automated compression of environments method provides a practical general-purpose tool for open quantum systems. It is difficult to analyse open quantum systems because an accurate description of their environments becomes intractably large. A method that automatically identifies an efficient representation provides a flexible approach to numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {The polariton—a quasiparticle formed by the strong coupling of a photon to a matter excitation—is a fundamental ingredient of emergent photonic quantum systems ranging from semiconductor nanophotonics to circuit quantum electrodynamics. Exploiting the interaction between polaritons has led to the realization of superfluids of light as well as of strongly correlated phases in the microwave domain, with similar efforts underway for microcavity excitons–polaritons. Here we develop an ultracold-atom analogue of an exciton–polariton system in which interacting polaritonic phases can be studied with full tunability and in the absence of dissipation. In our optical lattice system, the exciton is replaced by an atomic excitation, whereas an atomic matter wave is substituted for the photon under a strong dynamical coupling between the two constituents that hybridizes the two dispersion relations. We spectroscopically access the band structure of the matter-wave polariton by coupling the upper and lower polariton branches, as well as explore polaritonic transport in the superfluid and Mott-insulating regimes, finding quantitative agreement with our theoretical expectations. Our work sheds light on fundamental polariton properties and related many-body phenomena, and opens up novel possibilities for studies of polaritonic quantum matter. Polaritons are quasiparticles created through the coupling of matter excitations and light. A cold-atom experiment using matter waves instead of photons reports the observation of analogues of polaritons with tunable properties and no dissipation.},

  abstract     = {Interacting many-body systems in reduced-dimensional settings, such as ladders and few-layer systems, are characterized by enhanced quantum fluctuations. Recently, two-dimensional bilayer systems have sparked considerable interest because they can host unusual phases, including unconventional superconductivity. Here we present a theoretical proposal for realizing high-temperature pairing of fermions in a class of bilayer Hubbard models. We introduce a general and highly efficient pairing mechanism for mobile charge carriers in doped antiferromagnetic Mott insulators. The pairing is caused by the energy that one charge gains when it follows the path created by another charge. We show that this mechanism leads to the formation of highly mobile but tightly bound pairs in the case of mixed-dimensional Fermi–Hubbard bilayer systems. This setting is closely related to the Fermi–Hubbard model believed to capture the physics of copper oxides, and can be realized in currently available ultracold atom experiments. Studies of unconventional pairing mechanisms in cold atoms require ultralow temperatures. Large-scale numerics show that certain bilayer models allow for deeply bound and highly mobile pairs of charges at more accessible temperatures.},

In quantum solids, the response of the Bloch electron states to the magnetic field also exhibits the Zeeman effect, with an effective g factor that was theoretically predicted to depend on the momentum1–3, and which may be particularly strong in topological and magnetic systems. However, the momentum dependence of the g factor is difficult to extract and it has not been directly measured. Here we report the experimental discovery of a momentum-dependent g factor in the kagome magnet YMn6Sn6. We map the evolution of a massive Dirac band in the vicinity of the Fermi level as a function of the magnetic field. We find that electronic states at different lattice momenta exhibit different Zeeman energy shifts, giving rise to an anomalous g factor that peaks around the Dirac point. Our work provides a momentum-resolved visualization of Dirac band curvature manipulated by a magnetic field, which will be relevant to other topological kagome magnets. The change in a band structure when a magnetic field is applied should depend on the momentum of the electronic state, but this is hard to measure. Now, this effect is demonstrated in a topological magnet.},

  abstract     = {The dominance of Coulomb interactions over the kinetic energy of electrons in flat moiré bands of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) gives rise to a variety of correlated phases, including correlated insulators1–3, superconductivity2,4,5, orbital ferromagnetism2,6, Chern insulators7–10 and nematicity11. Most of these phases occur when the carrier density is at or near an integer number of carriers per moiré unit cell. However, the demonstration of ordered states at fractional moiré band fillings at zero applied magnetic field is more challenging. Here we report the observation of states near half-integer band fillings 0.5 and ±3.5 at near-zero magnetic field in TBG proximitized by tungsten diselenide. Furthermore, at a band filling near −0.5, a symmetry-broken Chern insulator emerges at high magnetic field that is compatible with the band structure calculations within a translational symmetry-broken supercell with twice the area of the original TBG moiré cell. Our results are consistent with a spin or charge density wave ground state in TBG in the zero-magnetic-field limit. Correlated insulating states are common in twisted bilayer graphene when the density of carriers is close to an integer per moiré unit cell. Now, such states emerge at half-integer fillings and show signs of being spin or charge density waves.},

  abstract     = {The flat bands1 of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) host strongly correlated electronic phases such as correlated insulators2–6, superconductors7–11 and a strange metal state12. The strange metal state, believed to be key for understanding the electronic properties of MATBG, is obscured by various phase transitions and so it could not be unequivocally differentiated from a metal undergoing frequent electron–phonon collisions13. Here we report transport measurements in superconducting MATBG in which the correlated insulator states are suppressed by screening. The uninterrupted metallic ground state shows resistivity that is linear in temperature over three orders of magnitude and spans a broad range of doping, including that where a correlation-driven Fermi surface reconstruction occurs. This strange metal behaviour is distinguished by Planckian scattering rates and a linear magnetoresistivity. By contrast, near charge neutrality or a fully filled flat band, as well as for devices twisted away from the magic angle, we observe the archetypal Fermi-liquid behaviour. Our measurements demonstrate the existence of a quantum-critical phase whose fluctuations dominate the metallic ground state throughout a continuum of doping. Further, we observe a transition to the strange metal upon suppression of the superconducting order, suggesting a relationship between quantum fluctuations and superconductivity in MATBG. The presence or absence of a strange metal phase in twisted bilayer graphene has been controversial. Now, measurements over a wide range of temperature and doping give much stronger evidence for its existence.},

  abstract     = {Superconductors are excellent thermal insulators at low temperatures owing to the presence of an energy gap in their density of states1. Through the so-called proximity effect2, superconductors can influence the density of states of nearby metallic or superconducting wires. In this way, the local density of states of a wire can be tuned by controlling the phase bias (φ) imposed across it3. Here we demonstrate a thermal superconducting quantum interference proximity transistor (T-SQUIPT) that enables the phase control of heat currents by exploiting the superconducting proximity effect. Our T-SQUIPT device comprises a quasi-one-dimensional aluminium nanowire forming the weak link embedded in a superconducting ring4,5. Controlling the phase bias by changing the magnetic flux through the ring shows temperature modulations of up to 16 mK, yielding a temperature-to-flux transfer function that reaches approximately 60 mK Φ0–1. We also demonstrate a hysteretic dependence of the local density of states of T-SQUIPTs on the applied magnetic field due to phase-slip transitions. This allows the T-SQUIPT device to operate as a phase-tunable thermal memory6,7, where the information is encoded in the temperature of the metallic mesoscopic island. Heat transport in electronic systems is influenced by nearby superconductors due to the so-called proximity effect. Combining this with the manipulation of superconductivity using magnetic fields enables the control of nanoscale thermal transport.},

This is true classically1, but also in any future quantum-equipped communications infrastructure2. We show in this work that minimal quantum resources, in the form of a single qubit, combined with classical communication are sufficient to thwart quantum adversaries that pretend to be at a specific position and have the ability to coordinate their action with entanglement. More precisely, we show that adversaries using an increasing amount of entanglement can be combatted solely by increasing the number of classical bits used in the protocol. The presented protocols are noise-robust and within reach of current quantum technology. Unless you are nearby, it is difficult to verify where someone is. Access to a single qubit and classical computation and communication makes it possible to securely check someone’s position as long as adversaries’ quantum resources are limited.},

At any given time, it is estimated that about 3 million spicules are present on the Sun. We find an intriguing parallel between the simulated spicular forest in a solar-like atmosphere and the numerous jets of polymeric fluids when both are subjected to harmonic forcing. In a radiative magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulation with sub-surface convection, solar global surface oscillations are excited similarly to those harmonic vibrations. The jets thus produced match remarkably well with the forests of spicules detected in observations of the Sun. Taken together, the numerical simulations of the Sun and the laboratory fluid dynamics experiments provide insights into the mechanism underlying the ubiquity of jets. The non-linear focusing of quasi-periodic waves in anisotropic media of magnetized plasma as well as polymeric fluids under gravity is sufficient to generate a forest of jets. A combination of numerical simulations and fluid dynamics experiments provides insights into the generation of a forest of solar plasma jets on the Sun.},

  abstract     = {Plasmodium sporozoites are the crescent-shaped forms of malaria parasites injected from the salivary glands of mosquitoes into the skins of their vertebrate hosts. To proceed towards the liver of the host, sporozoites individually migrate at very high speeds and with relatively few adhesive interactions. By contrast, in the mosquito sporozoites often exist as collectives. Here we study their motion in collectives extracted from salivary glands, a situation in which dozens of sporozoites form rotating vortices. Complementing our experiments with quantitative image analysis and agent-based computer simulations, we find that, owing to their mechanical flexibility, single sporozoites are sorted according to their curvatures and speeds, and that these effects increase with vortex size. We also find that the vortices undergo oscillatory breathing because the thrust from the motility force of the single sporozoites can be stored in their elastic energy. Our findings suggest that the malaria parasite has evolved flexibility as an essential means to adapt to its mechanical environment and to ensure efficient transmission. In general, our work demonstrates how single-particle shape and mechanics can determine the dynamics of large, active collectives. The collective motion of malaria parasites is analyzed as a model system for active elastic matter and suggests that mechanical flexibility is favourable for parasite transmission.},

  abstract     = {Dew is a common form of water that deposits from saturated air on colder surfaces. Although presumably common on primordial Earth, its potential involvement in the origin of life in early replication has not been investigated in detail. Here we report that it can drive the first stages of Darwinian evolution for DNA and RNA, first by periodically denaturing their structures at low temperatures and second by promoting the replication of long strands over short, faster replicating ones. Our experiments mimicked a partially water-filled primordial rock pore in the probable CO2 atmosphere of Hadean Earth. Under heat flow, water continuously evaporated and recondensed as acidic dew droplets that created the humidity, salt and pH cycles that match many prebiotic replication chemistries. In low-salt and low-pH regimes, the strands melted at 30 K below the bulk melting temperature, whereas longer sequences preferentially accumulated at the droplet interface. Under an enzymatic replication to mimic a sped-up RNA world, long sequences of more than 1,000 nucleotides emerged. The replication was biased by the melting conditions of the dew and the initial short ATGC strands evolved into long AT-rich sequences with repetitive and structured nucleotide composition. Detailed microfluidics experiments and numerical simulations are used to analyse the role played by dew in the origin of life, and demonstrate that it can drive the first stages of Darwinian evolution for DNA and RNA.},

  abstract     = {Many membraneless organelles are liquid-like domains that form inside the active, viscoelastic environment of living cells through phase separation. To investigate the potential coupling of phase separation with the cytoskeleton, we quantify the structural correlations of membraneless organelles (stress granules) and cytoskeletal filaments (microtubules) in a human-derived epithelial cell line. We find that microtubule networks are substantially denser in the vicinity of stress granules. When microtubules are depolymerized, the sub-units localize near the surface of the stress granules. We interpret these data using a thermodynamic model of partitioning of particles to the surface and bulk of the droplets. In this framework, our data are consistent with a weak (≲kBT) affinity of the microtubule sub-units for stress granule interfaces. As microtubules polymerize, their interfacial affinity increases, providing sufficient adhesion to deform droplets and/or the network. Our work suggests that proteins and other objects in the cell have a non-specific affinity for droplet interfaces that increases with the contact area and becomes most apparent when they have no preference for the interior of a droplet over the rest of the cytoplasm. We validate this basic physical phenomenon in vitro through the interaction of a simple protein–RNA condensate with microtubules. Many organelles in the cell are not encapsulated in a membrane—they are liquid-like domains formed through phase separation. The liquid-like nature of such domains leads to adhesive interactions between the cytoskeleton filaments and organelles.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental challenge regarding disordered solids is predicting macroscopic yield—the point at which elastic behaviour changes to plastic behaviour—from the microscopic arrangements of constituent particles. Yield is accompanied by a sudden and large increase in energy dissipation due to the onset of plastic rearrangements. This suggests that one path to understanding bulk rheology is to map particle configurations to their mode of deformation. Here, we subject two-dimensional dense colloidal systems to oscillatory shear, measure the particle trajectories and bulk rheology, and quantify particle microstructure using excess entropy. Our results reveal a direct relation between excess entropy and energy dissipation that is insensitive to the nature of interactions amongst particles. We use this relation to build a physically informed model that connects rheology to microstructure. Our findings suggest a framework for tailoring the rheological response of disordered materials by tuning microstructural properties. Whether and when a material deforms elastically or plastically depends on its microstructure. Experiments on two-dimensional colloidal systems show that in disordered materials, packing density, stress and a microstructure-related entropy govern deformations.},

  abstract     = {The nature of the pseudogap phase remains a major puzzle in our understanding of cuprate high-temperature superconductivity. Whether or not this metallic phase is defined by any of the reported broken symmetries, the topology of its Fermi surface remains a fundamental open question. Here we use angle-dependent magnetoresistance (ADMR) to measure the Fermi surface of the La1.6–xNd0.4SrxCuO4 cuprate. Outside the pseudogap phase, we fit the ADMR data and extract a Fermi surface geometry that is in excellent agreement with angle-resolved photoemission data. Within the pseudogap phase, the ADMR is qualitatively different, revealing a transformation of the Fermi surface. We can rule out changes in the quasiparticle lifetime as the sole cause of this transformation. We find that our data are most consistent with a pseudogap Fermi surface that consists of small, nodal hole pockets, thereby accounting for the drop in carrier density across the pseudogap transition found in several cuprates. Transport measurements suggest that the Fermi surface of a cuprate superconductor changes its form when the pseudogap is present. This can help to explain the low carrier density in the pseudogap regime.},

  abstract     = {As doping increases in cuprate superconductors, the superconducting transition temperature increases to a maximum at the so-called optimal doping, and then decreases in the overdoped regime. In the past few decades, research has primarily focused on the underdoped and optimally doped regions of the phase diagram. Here, phenomena such as the pseudogap and strange metal non-superconducting states make it difficult to determine the superconducting pairing mechanism. More recently, experiments have shown unconventional behaviour in strongly overdoped cuprates, in both the normal and superconducting states. However, a real-space investigation of the unconventional superconductivity in the absence of the pseudogap is lacking, and the superconductor-to-metal phase transition in the overdoped regime remains controversial. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to investigate the atomic-scale electronic structure of overdoped Bi2Sr2Can − 1CunO2n + 4 + δ cuprates. We show that, at low energies, the spectroscopic maps are well described by dispersive d-wave quasiparticle interference patterns. However, as the bias increases to the superconducting coherence peak energy, a periodic and non-dispersive pattern emerges. The position of the coherence peaks exhibits particle–hole asymmetry that modulates with the same period. We propose that this behaviour is due to quasiparticle interference caused by pair-breaking scattering between flat antinodal Bogoliubov bands. Cuprates that are doped beyond the point that optimizes the critical temperature were thought to be understood. Now, a careful real-space investigation shows unconventional behaviour in the superconducting state caused by pair-breaking scattering.},

  abstract     = {MXenes are emerging layered materials that are promising for electrochemical energy storage and (opto-)electronic applications. A fundamental understanding of charge transport in MXenes is essential for such applications, but has remained under debate. While theoretical studies pointed to efficient band transport, device measurements have revealed thermally activated, hopping-type transport. Here we present a unifying picture of charge transport in two model MXenes by combining ultrafast terahertz and static electrical transport measurements to distinguish the short- and long-range transport characteristics. We find that band-like transport dominates short-range, intra-flake charge conduction in MXenes, whereas long-range, inter-flake transport occurs through thermally activated hopping, and limits charge percolation across the MXene flakes. Our analysis of the intra-flake charge carrier scattering rate shows that it is dominated by scattering from longitudinal optical phonons with a small coupling constant (α ≈ 1), for both semiconducting and metallic MXenes. This indicates the formation of large polarons in MXenes. Our work therefore provides insight into the polaronic nature of free charges in MXenes, and unveils intra- and inter-flake transport mechanisms in the MXene materials, which are relevant for both fundamental studies and applications. The charge transport mechanism in MXenes—an emerging class of layered materials—is not yet fully understood. A combination of terahertz spectroscopy and transport measurements shows that the formation of large polarons play a crucial role.},

  abstract     = {Superconducting qubits in a waveguide have long-range interactions mediated by photons that cause the emergence of collective states. Destructive interference between the qubits decouples the collective dark states from the waveguide environment. Their inability to emit photons into the waveguide render dark states a valuable resource for preparing long-lived quantum many-body states and realizing quantum information protocols in open quantum systems. However, they also decouple from fields that drive the waveguide, making manipulation a challenge. Here we show the coherent control of a collective dark state that is realized by controlling the interactions between four superconducting transmon qubits and local drives. The dark state’s protection against decoherence results in decay times that exceed those of the waveguide-limited single qubits by more than two orders of magnitude. Moreover, we perform a phase-sensitive spectroscopy of the two-excitation manifold and reveal bosonic many-body statistics in the transmon array. Our dark-state qubit provides a starting point for implementing quantum information protocols with collective states. Dark states of quantum systems do not absorb or emit light, removing a major source of decoherence. Four superconducting qubits in a waveguide can be combined to make a coherently controlled dark-state qubit with a long lifetime.},

We measure the inelastic release of hyperfine energy in a collision between an ultracold rubidium atom and isotopes of singly ionized strontium that we do not have experimental control over. We detect the collision outcome and measure the inelastic rate of the chemistry ion by reading the motional state of a logic ion qubit in a single shot. Our work extends the toolbox for studying elastic, inelastic and reactive chemical processes with existing experimental tools, especially for atomic and molecular ions for which direct laser cooling and state detection are unavailable. The study of single-atom collisions in ultracold gases has so far been limited to certain atomic and molecular species.

  abstract     = {The complexity of quantum states has become a key quantity of interest across various subfields of physics, from quantum computing to the theory of black holes. The evolution of generic quantum systems can be modelled by considering a collection of qubits subjected to sequences of random unitary gates. Here we investigate how the complexity of these random quantum circuits increases by considering how to construct a unitary operation from Haar-random two-qubit quantum gates. Implementing the unitary operation exactly requires a minimal number of gates—this is the operation’s exact circuit complexity. We prove a conjecture that this complexity grows linearly, before saturating when the number of applied gates reaches a threshold that grows exponentially with the number of qubits. Our proof overcomes difficulties in establishing lower bounds for the exact circuit complexity by combining differential topology and elementary algebraic geometry with an inductive construction of Clifford circuits. The dynamics of quantum states underlies the emergence of thermodynamics and even recent theories of quantum gravity. Now it has been proven that the quantum complexity of states evolving under random operations grows linearly in time.},

Here we integrate magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene into a double-layer structure to study the superconducting phase. Using proximity screening from the adjacent metallic layer, we examine the stability of superconductivity and demonstrate that Coulomb repulsion competes with the mechanism underlying Cooper pairing. Furthermore, we use a combination of transport and thermodynamic measurements to probe the ground-state order4–6, which points towards a spin-polarized and valley-unpolarized configuration at half moiré filling and for the Fermi surface at doping levels close to that point. Our findings provide important constraints for theoretical models aiming to understand the nature of superconductivity. A possible scenario is that electron–phonon coupling stabilizes a superconducting phase with a spin-triplet, valley-singlet order parameter7–13. How electrons in moiré graphene populate valleys and carry spin has consequences for understanding its superconductivity. Now, evidence suggests that twisted trilayer graphene has a spin-polarized, valley-unpolarized configuration.},

Theoretical models describing spin glasses are broadly used in other complex systems, such as those describing brain function3,4, error-correcting codes5 or stock-market dynamics6. This wide interest in spin glasses provides strong motivation to generate an artificial spin glass within the framework of artificial spin ice systems7–9. Here we present the experimental realization of an artificial spin glass consisting of dipolar coupled single-domain Ising-type nanomagnets arranged onto an interaction network that replicates the aspects of a Hopfield neural network10. Using cryogenic X-ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM), we performed temperature-dependent imaging of thermally driven moment fluctuations within these networks and observed characteristic features of a two-dimensional Ising spin glass. Specifically, the temperature dependence of the spin glass correlation function follows a power-law trend predicted from theoretical models on two-dimensional spin glasses11. Furthermore, we observe clear signatures of the hard-to-observe rugged spin glass free energy1 in the form of sub-aging, out-of-equilibrium autocorrelations12 and a transition from stable to unstable dynamics1,13. A spin glass is a disordered system with randomized competing magnetic interactions. Now, a metamaterial artificial spin glass based on nanomagnets is reported, with rudimentary features of a neural network.},

  abstract     = {Because Fermi liquids are inherently non-interacting states of matter, all electronic levels below the chemical potential are doubly occupied. Consequently, the simplest way of breaking the Fermi-liquid theory is to engineer a model in which some of those states are singly occupied, keeping time-reversal invariance intact. We show that breaking an overlooked1 local-in-momentum space $${{\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}$$ symmetry of a Fermi liquid does precisely this. As a result, although the Mott transition from a Fermi liquid is correctly believed to arise without breaking any continuous symmetry, a discrete symmetry is broken. This symmetry breaking serves as an organizing principle for Mott physics whether it arises from the tractable Hatsugai–Kohmoto model or the intractable Hubbard model. Through a renormalization-group analysis, we establish that both are controlled by the same fixed point. An experimental manifestation of this fixed point is the onset of particle–hole asymmetry, a widely observed2–10 phenomenon in strongly correlated systems. Theoretically, the singly occupied region of the spectrum gives rise to a surface of zeros of the single-particle Green function, denoted as the Luttinger surface. Using K-homology, we show that the Bott topological invariant guarantees the stability of this surface to local perturbations. Our proof demonstrates that the strongly coupled fixed point only corresponds to those Luttinger surfaces with co-dimension p + 1 with odd p. We conclude that both Hubbard and Hatsugai–Kohmoto models lie in the same high-temperature universality class and are controlled by a quartic fixed point with broken $${{\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}$$ symmetry. The Mott metal-to-insulator transition plays a key role in theoretical studies of high-temperature superconductors. A mathematical analysis of the theory of metals identifies a renormalization-group fixed point describing Mott physics.},

The coupling emerges from the coherent accumulation of stochastic spin-exchange collisions. We obtain a coupling strength ten times higher than the decay rate, observe the coherent and periodic exchange of spin excitations between the two gases and demonstrate active control over the coupling by an external magnetic field. This approach could be developed into a fast and efficient interface for noble-gas spins, enabling applications in quantum sensing and information5,6.

Long-lived circular Rydberg states6,7 may provide a solution. However, the detection of circular states involves either destructive6 or complex7 measurement techniques. Moreover, so far, alkali circular states have been manipulated only by microwave fields, which are unable to address individual atoms. The use of circular states of a different group of atoms, the alkaline-earth metals, which have an optically active second valence electron, can circumvent these problems. Here we show how to use the electrostatic coupling between the two valence electrons of strontium to coherently manipulate a circular Rydberg state with optical pulses. We also exploit this coupling to map the state of the Rydberg electron onto that of the ionic core. This experiment opens the way to a state-selective spatially resolved non-destructive detection of circular states and to the realization of a hybrid optical–microwave platform for quantum technology. The capabilities of optically accessible Rydberg levels are limited by their lifetime.

  abstract     = {Glass formation is encountered in diverse materials. Experiments have revealed that the dynamic relaxation spectra of supercooled liquids generically become asymmetric near the glass transition temperature Tg, where an extended power law emerges at high frequencies. The microscopic origin of this ‘wing’ remains unknown, and has so far been inaccessible to simulations. Here we develop a novel computational approach and study the equilibrium dynamics of model supercooled liquids near Tg. We demonstrate the emergence of a power-law wing in the numerical spectra, which originates from relaxation at rare, localized regions over broadly distributed timescales. We rationalize the asymmetric shape of the relaxation spectra by constructing an empirical model associating heterogeneous activated dynamics with dynamic facilitation, which are the two minimal physical ingredients revealed by our simulations. Our work offers a glimpse into the molecular motion responsible for glass formation at relevant experimental conditions. The dynamic relaxation spectrum of a supercooled liquid is asymmetric near the glass transition. Overcoming the difficulty of accessing low temperatures and long timescales, simulations now attribute this feature to dynamic facilitation.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional electron systems subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field absorb electromagnetic radiation via cyclotron resonance (CR). Here we report a qualitative deviation from this well-known behaviour in graphene. Our measurements of the terahertz photoresponse reveal a resonant burst at the main overtone of the CR that exceeds the signal detected at the position of the ordinary CR. The dependencies of photoresponse on the magnetic field, doping level and sample geometry suggest that the origin of this anomaly lies in the near-field magnetoabsorption facilitated by the Bernstein modes—ultraslow magnetoplasmonic excitations reshaped by non-local electron dynamics. Close to CR harmonics, these modes are characterized by a flat dispersion and diverging plasmonic density of states that amplify radiation absorption. Besides carrying fundamental interest, our results show that radiation absorption via non-local collective modes can facilitate a strong photoresponse—a behaviour potentially useful for infrared and terahertz technology. Electrons in an external magnetic field absorb electromagnetic radiation via cyclotron resonance. Deviations from this behaviour in the form of overtone resonances due to ultraslow magnetoplasmonic excitations are now reported for graphene.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear phononics relies on the resonant optical excitation of infrared-active lattice vibrations to induce targeted structural deformations in solids. This form of dynamical crystal structure design has been applied to control the functional properties of many complex solids, including magnetic materials, superconductors and ferroelectrics. However, phononics has so far been restricted to protocols in which structural deformations occur within the optically excited volume, sometimes resulting in unwanted heating. Here, we extend nonlinear phononics to propagating polaritons, spatially separating the functional response from the optical drive. We use mid-infrared optical pulses to resonantly drive a phonon at the surface of ferroelectric LiNbO3. Time-resolved stimulated Raman scattering reveals that the ferroelectric polarization is reduced over the entire 50 µm depth of the sample, far beyond the micrometre depth of the evanescent phonon field. We attribute this effect to the anharmonic coupling between the driven mode and a polariton that propagates into the material. For high excitation amplitudes, we reach a regime in which the ferroelectric polarization is reversed, as revealed by a sign change in the Raman tensor coefficients of all the polar modes. Nonlinear phononics is a method for creating transient structural changes in solids, but its effect is limited to the region of optical excitation. Now, coupling to a propagating polariton allows nonlinear phononics to drive a nonlocal response.},

  abstract     = {Topological phases have been studied in photonic, acoustic and phononic metamaterials, promising a range of applications. Such topological modes usually stem from collective resonant effects in periodic lattices. One may, therefore, expect similar features to be forbidden for thermal diffusion that is purely dissipative and mostly incoherent, prohibiting collective resonances. Here we report the discovery of diffusion-based topological states supported by spatiotemporally modulated advections stacked over a fluidic surface. This arrangement imitates a periodic propagating potential in an effective thermal lattice. We observe edge states in topologically non-trivial and bulk states in topologically trivial lattices. Interface states form at boundaries between these two types of lattice, manifesting inhomogeneous thermal properties on the fluidic surface. Our findings establish a framework for topological diffusion and thermal edge or bulk states, and it may allow a distinct mechanism for the flexible manipulation of diffusive phenomena for robust heat and mass transfer. Topological effects have been found in a range of classical-wave systems, but it was unclear if the concept could be extended to diffusion. An approach using spatiotemporal modulations has now implemented them in a diffusive system},

These phases have largely been studied in conservatively coupled systems, in which non-trivial topological invariants arise in the energy or frequency bands of a system. Here we show that, in dissipatively coupled systems, non-trivial topological invariants can emerge purely in a system’s dissipation. Using a highly scalable and easily reconfigurable time-multiplexed photonic resonator network, we experimentally demonstrate one- and two-dimensional lattices that host robust topological edge states with isolated dissipation rates, measure a dissipation spectrum that possesses a non-trivial topological invariant, and demonst rate topological protection of the network’s quality factor. The topologically non-trivial dissipation of our system exposes new opportunities to engineer dissipation in both classical and quantum systems. Moreover, our experimental platform’s straightforward scaling to higher dimensions and its ability to implement inhomogeneous, non-reciprocal and long range couplings may enable future work in the study of synthetic dimensions. Topological phenomena have mostly been studied in conservative systems. Experiments on optical resonator networks now show that topologically non-trivial characteristics can also emerge in dissipation.},

  abstract     = {In strained mechanical resonators, the concurrence of tensile stress and geometric nonlinearity dramatically reduces dissipation. This phenomenon, called dissipation dilution, is employed in mirror suspensions of gravitational-wave interferometers and at the nanoscale, where soft clamping and strain engineering have allowed extremely high quality factors. However, these techniques have so far been applied only to amorphous materials, specifically Si3N4. Crystalline materials exhibit substantially lower intrinsic damping at cryogenic temperatures. Applying dissipation dilution engineering to strained crystalline materials could, therefore, enable extremely low loss nanomechanical resonators, as they combine low internal friction, high intrinsic strain and high yield strength. This potential has not yet been fully exploited. Here we demonstrate that single-crystal strained silicon—a material developed for high-mobility transistors—can be used to realize mechanical resonators with ultralow dissipation. We fabricate strained silicon nanostrings with high aspect ratios supporting megahertz mechanical modes with quality factors exceeding 1010 at 7 K, a tenfold improvement over values reported in Si3N4. We estimate a thermal-noise-limited force sensitivity of (5 ± 2) × 10–20 N Hz–1/2 at 7 K—approaching that of carbon nanotubes—and a heating rate of only 60 quanta per second. The low mass and high quality factors of our nanomechanical resonators make them particularly promising for quantum sensing and transduction. Soft clamping reduces the dissipation of nanomechanical resonators, but this method has been limited to amorphous materials. When applied in crystalline silicon, it enables resonators with quality factors beyond ten billion.},

In the paramagnetic state of α-RuCl3 at high magnetic fields, a half-integer quantization of thermal Hall conductivity has been reported as a signature of edge currents carried by Majorana fermions, but the bulk nature of this state remains unconfirmed. Here, by measuring the heat capacity for different in-plane rotations of an applied magnetic field, we find strongly angle-dependent low-energy excitations in bulk α-RuCl3. The excitation gap has a sextuple node structure, and the gap amplitude increases with the field, as expected for itinerant Majorana fermions in the Kitaev model. Our thermodynamic observations of the opening and closing of the bulk gap according to the magnetic-field direction fully correspond with changes in the edge transport. Moreover, the behaviour at higher magnetic fields where the quantum thermal Hall effect vanishes is consistent with a nematic quantum spin liquid state with two-fold rotational symmetry. α-RuCl has a quantum magnetic phase that may be a spin liquid hosting Majorana fermion excitations. Heat capacity measurements show an anisotropic dependence on magnetic-field direction, consistent with predictions for the putative spin liquid.},

  abstract     = {Following structural dynamics in real time is a fundamental goal towards a better understanding of chemical reactions. Recording snapshots of individual molecules with ultrashort exposure times is a key ingredient towards this goal, as atoms move on femtosecond (10−15 s) timescales. For condensed-phase samples, ultrafast, atomically resolved structure determination has been demonstrated using X-ray and electron diffraction. Pioneering experiments have also started addressing gaseous samples. However, they face the problem of low target densities, low scattering cross sections and random spatial orientation of the molecules. Therefore, obtaining images of entire, isolated molecules capturing all constituents, including hydrogen atoms, remains challenging. Here we demonstrate that intense femtosecond pulses from an X-ray free-electron laser trigger rapid and complete Coulomb explosions of 2-iodopyridine and 2-iodopyrazine molecules. We obtain intriguingly clear momentum images depicting ten or eleven atoms, including all the hydrogens, and thus overcome a so-far impregnable barrier for complete Coulomb explosion imaging—its limitation on molecules consisting of three to five atoms. In combination with state-of-the-art multi-coincidence techniques and elaborate theoretical modelling, this allows tracing ultrafast hydrogen emission and obtaining information on the result of intramolecular electron rearrangement. Our work represents an important step towards imaging femtosecond chemistry via Coulomb explosion. Visualizing the structural dynamics of isolated molecules would help to understand chemical reactions, but this is difficult for complex structures. Intense femtosecond X-ray pulses allow the full imaging of exploding photoionized molecules, in this case, with eleven atoms.},

  abstract     = {Recent measurements of time delays during tunnelling of cold atoms through an optically created potential barrier have fuelled an ongoing debate about possible time delays during light-induced tunnelling of an electron from an atom. Yet, such a delay—whether it is present or not—is only one quantity characterizing the tunnelling wavepacket, whilst the underlying dynamics are richer. Here we show how to complement photo-electron detection in laser-induced tunnelling by measuring the light emitted by the tunnelling electron—the so-called Brunel radiation. Using a combination of single- and two-colour driving fields, we identify the all-optical signatures of the reshaping of the tunnelling wavepacket as it emerges from the tunnelling barrier and moves away from the core. This reshaping includes not only an effective time delay but also the time-reversal asymmetry of the ionization process, which we describe theoretically and observe experimentally. We show how both delay and reshaping are mapped onto the polarization properties of the Brunel radiation, with different harmonics behaving as different hands of a clock moving at different speeds. The all-optical detection may also allow time-resolved measurements of optical tunnelling in condensed matter systems on the attosecond time scale. Whether or not an electron wavepacket accumulates a time delay when tunnelling out of an atom is still under debate. Improved all-optical characterization of the tunnelling dynamics by combining one- and two-colour driving fields may shed light on this question.},

Here we combine microfluidic confinement of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae6 with rheological measurements using genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles7 to reveal that growth-induced pressure is accompanied with an increase in a key cellular physical property: macromolecular crowding. We develop a fully calibrated model that predicts how increased macromolecular crowding hinders protein expression and thus diminishes cell growth. This model is sufficient to explain the coupling of growth rate to pressure without the need for specific molecular sensors or signalling cascades. As molecular crowding is similar across all domains of life, this could be a deeply conserved mechanism of biomechanical feedback that allows environmental sensing originating from the fundamental physical properties of cells. Rheological measurements combined with a fully calibrated model show that growth-induced pressure increases macromolecular crowding, inhibiting protein expression and cell growth.},

Searching for universal links between the superconducting state and its normal metallic state is believed to be an effective approach to elucidate the underlying mechanism of superconductivity. One of the common expectations for copper oxide superconductors is that a metallic phase will appear after the superconductivity is entirely suppressed by chemical doping4–8 or the application of a magnetic field9. Here we report the first observation of a quantum phase transition from a superconducting state to an insulating-like state as a function of pressure in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ (Bi2212) superconductors with two CuO2 planes in a unit cell for doping below, at and above a level that achieves the highest transition temperature. We also find the same phenomenon in related compounds with a single CuO2 plane as well as three CuO2 planes in a unit cell. This apparently universal phenomenon poses a challenge for achieving a unified understanding of the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. Observation of a high-pressure insulating state in cuprate superconductors provides a fresh challenge for understanding the mechanism of superconductivity in these materials.},

  abstract     = {A key feature of quantum spin liquids is the predicted formation of fractionalized excitations. They are expected to produce changes in the physical response, providing a way to observe the quantum spin liquid state1. In the honeycomb magnet α-RuCl3, a quantum spin liquid has been proposed to explain the behaviour observed on applying an in-plane magnetic field H||. Previous work reported that the thermal Hall conductivity took on a half-integer quantized value and suggested this as a signature of a fractionalized Majorana edge mode predicted to exist in Kitaev quantum spin liquids2. However, the temperature and magnetic-field range of the half-quantized signal2–4 and its association with Majorana edge modes are still under debate5,6. Here we present a comprehensive study of the thermal Hall conductivity in α-RuCl3 showing that approximately half-integer quantization exists in an extended region of the phase diagram, particularly across a plateau-like parameter regime for H|| exceeding 10 T and temperature below 6.5 K. At lower fields, the thermal Hall conductivity exhibits correlations with complex anomalies in the longitudinal thermal conductivity and magnetization, and is suppressed by cooling to low temperatures. Our results can be explained by the existence of a topological state in magnetic fields above 10 T. Earlier measurements of quantized heat transport in the spin liquid candidate α-RuCl3 agreed with the predictions of Majorana edge modes. Support for this interpretation now comes from the observations of quantization across a large parameter range.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional moiré materials provide a highly controllable solid-state platform for studies of quantum phenomena1–3. To date, experimental studies have focused on correlated electronic states, whereas correlated bosonic states in moiré materials have received less attention. Here we report the observation of a correlated dipolar excitonic insulator—a charge-insulating state driven by exciton formation4—in a device where a WSe2 monolayer and WSe2/WS2 moiré bilayer are coupled via Coulomb interactions. The system is a Mott insulator when all the holes reside in the moiré layer. Under an out-of-plane electric field, the holes can be continuously transferred to the WSe2 monolayer, but remain strongly bound to the empty moiré sites, effectively forming an interlayer exciton fluid in the moiré lattice. We further observe the emergence of local magnetic moments in the WSe2 monolayer induced by the strong interlayer Coulomb correlation. Our result provides a platform for realizing correlated quantum phenomena described by bosonic lattice models in a solid-state system, complementary to cold-atom setups5. A heterostructure supports the equilibrium bound states of an electron and hole—excitons—that strongly interact with each other. This provides a platform for the quantum simulation of bosonic lattice models.},

  abstract     = {A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator features a 2D surface state consisting of a single linearly dispersive Dirac cone1–3. Under broken time-reversal symmetry, the single Dirac cone is predicted to cause half-integer quantization of Hall conductance, which is a manifestation of the parity anomaly in quantum field theory1–9. However, despite various observations of quantization phenomena10–15, the half-integer quantization has not been observed because most experiments simultaneously measure a pair of equivalent Dirac cones16 on two opposing surfaces. Here we demonstrate the half-integer quantization of Hall conductance in a synthetic heterostructure termed a semi-magnetic topological insulator, where only one surface state is gapped by magnetic doping and the opposite one is non-magnetic and gapless. We observe half-quantized Faraday and Kerr rotations with terahertz magneto-optical spectroscopy and half-quantized Hall conductance in transport at zero magnetic field. Our results suggest a condensed-matter realization of the parity anomaly4–9 and open a way for studying the physics enabled by a single Dirac fermion. An electron with a linear dispersion relation should contribute half of a quantum of Hall conductance and thereby manifest the parity anomaly. This is demonstrated in a heterostructure of topological insulator materials.},

  abstract     = {Spin–orbit coupling is an essential mechanism underlying quantum phenomena such as the spin Hall effect and topological insulators1. It has been widely studied in well-isolated Hermitian systems, but much less is known about the role dissipation plays in spin–orbit-coupled systems2. Here we implement dissipative spin–orbit-coupled bands filled with ultracold fermions, and observe parity-time symmetry breaking as a result of the competition between the spin–orbit coupling and dissipation. Tunable dissipation, introduced by state-selective atom loss, enables us to tune the energy gap and close it at the critical dissipation value, the so-called exceptional point3. In the vicinity of the critical point, the state evolution exhibits a chiral response, which enables us to tune the spin–orbit coupling and dissipation dynamically, revealing topologically robust chiral spin transfer when the quantum state encircles the exceptional point. This demonstrates that we can explore non-Hermitian topological states with spin–orbit coupling. Spin–orbit coupling is an important feature of isolated quantum systems, but less is known about how it responds to dissipation. An experiment in a cold atomic gas now shows how these two effects enable topologically robust spin transfer.},

  abstract     = {We describe a framework for understanding the factors that underpin economic resilience, and identify the basic tools for implementing it. This principally involves examining resilience by design, which promotes endogenous reorganization in the economy, and by intervention, which includes exogenous measures such as bailouts, stockpiles and building buffers. We link these ideas to comparable notions from physics, such as the rich and non-trivial phenomenology that arises in circumstances when a system is dynamic and out of equilibrium. We contend that a more nuanced understanding of the underlying structure of our economic system could lead to more enlightened policy decisions that promote resilience and result in better outcomes in the long run. Drawing on notions from non-equilibrium physics, an interdisciplinary team of economists and scientists describe a framework for understanding the factors that underpin economic resilience, and identify the basic tools for implementing it.},

The Juno spacecraft discovered that Jovian high latitudes host a cluster of large cyclones with diameter of around 5,000 km, each associated with intermediate- (roughly between 500 and 1,600 km) and smaller-scale vortices and filaments of around 100 km. Here, we analyse infrared images from Juno with a high resolution of 10 km. We unveil a dynamical regime associated with a significant energy source of convective origin that peaks at 100 km scales and in which energy gets subsequently transferred upscale to the large circumpolar and polar cyclones. Although this energy route has never been observed on another planet, it is surprisingly consistent with idealized studies of rapidly rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection, lending theoretical support to our analyses. This energy route is expected to enhance the heat transfer from Jupiter’s hot interior to its troposphere and may also be relevant to the Earth’s atmosphere, helping us better understand the dynamics of our own planet. Infrared images of Jupiter taken by the Juno spacecraft reveal an energy transfer driven by moist convection. This mechanism is expected to enhance heat transfer, which might also be relevant to Earth’s atmosphere.},

  abstract     = {In state-of-the-art stellarators, turbulence is a major cause of the degradation of plasma confinement. To maximize confinement, which eventually determines the amount of nuclear fusion reactions, turbulent transport needs to be reduced. Here we report the observation of a confinement regime in a stellarator plasma that is characterized by increased confinement and reduced turbulent fluctuations. The transition to this regime is driven by the injection of submillimetric boron powder grains into the plasma. With the line-averaged electron density being kept constant, we observe a substantial increase of stored energy and electron and ion temperatures. At the same time, the amplitude of the plasma turbulent fluctuations is halved. While lower frequency fluctuations are damped, higher frequency modes in the range between 100 and 200 kHz are excited. We have observed this regime for different heating schemes, namely with both electron and ion cyclotron resonant radio frequencies and neutral beams, for both directions of the magnetic field and both hydrogen and deuterium plasmas. In stellarators, turbulence is detrimental for the confinement of the plasma. In the Large Helical Device, a confinement regime with reduced turbulence and improved confinement is observed.},

  abstract     = {From mass extinction to cell death, complex networked systems often exhibit abrupt dynamic transitions between desirable and undesirable states. These transitions are often caused by topological perturbations (such as node or link removal, or decreasing link strengths). The problem is that reversing the topological damage, namely, retrieving lost nodes or links or reinforcing weakened interactions, does not guarantee spontaneous recovery to the desired functional state. Indeed, many of the relevant systems exhibit a hysteresis phenomenon, remaining in the dysfunctional state, despite reconstructing their damaged topology. To address this challenge, we develop a two-step recovery scheme: first, topological reconstruction to the point where the system can be revived and then dynamic interventions to reignite the system’s lost functionality. By applying this method to a range of nonlinear network dynamics, we identify the recoverable phase of a complex system, a state in which the system can be reignited by microscopic interventions, for instance, controlling just a single node. Mapping the boundaries of this dynamical phase, we obtain guidelines for our two-step recovery. Perturbations and disturbances can bring complex networks into undesirable states in which global functionality is suppressed. Now, a recovery scheme explains how to revive a damaged network by controlling only a small number of nodes.},

  abstract     = {Biological systems are robust to perturbations at both the genetic and environmental levels, although these same perturbations can elicit variation in behaviour. The interplay between functional robustness and behavioural variability is exemplified at the organellar level by the beating of cilia and flagella. Cilia are motile despite wide genetic diversity between and within species, differences in intracellular concentrations of ATP and calcium, and considerable environment fluctuations in temperature and viscosity. At the same time, these perturbations result in a variety of spatio-temporal patterns that span a rich behavioural space. To investigate this behavioural space we analysed the dynamics of isolated cilia from the unicellular algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii under many different environmental and genetic conditions. We found that, despite large changes in beat frequency and amplitude, the space of waveform shapes is low-dimensional in the sense that two features account for 80\% of the observed variation. The geometry of this behavioural space accords with the predictions of a simple mechanochemical model in the low-viscosity regime. This allowed us to associate waveform shape variability with changes in only the curvature response coefficients of the dynein motors. The beating of motile cilia arises from the collective action of hundreds of proteins. A study of the dynamics of cilia under different environmental and genetic conditions shows that the space of beating variations is low-dimensional.},

  abstract     = {The mitotic spindle is a highly dynamic bipolar structure that emerges from the self-organization of microtubules, molecular motors and other proteins. Sustained motor-driven poleward flows of dynamic microtubules play a key role in the bipolar organization of spindles. However, it is not understood how the local activity of motor proteins generates these large-scale coherent poleward flows. Here we show that a gelation transition enables long-range microtubule transport causing the spindles to self-organize into two oppositely polarized microtubule gels. Laser ablation experiments reveal that local active stresses generated at the spindle midplane propagate through the structure, thereby driving global coherent microtubule flows. Simulations show that microtubule gels undergoing rapid turnover can exhibit long stress relaxation times, in agreement with the long-range flows observed in experiments. Finally, our model predicts that in the presence of branching microtubule nucleation, either disrupting such flows or decreasing the network connectivity can lead to a microtubule polarity reversal in spindles. We experimentally confirm this inversion of polarity by abolishing the microtubule transport in spindles. Overall, we uncover a connection between spindle rheology and architecture in spindle self-organization. The activity of molecular motors drives the self-organization of cytoskeleton structures, leading to large-scale active flows. Now, experiments and simulations show how a gelation process enables such long-range transport in spindles.},

Sources capable of providing these ultrahigh dose rates are under investigation. Here we show that a stable, compact laser-driven proton source with energies greater than 60 MeV enables radiobiological in vivo studies. We performed a pilot irradiation study on human tumours in a mouse model, showing the concerted preparation of mice and laser accelerator, dose-controlled, tumour-conform irradiation using a laser-driven as well as a clinical reference proton source, and the radiobiological evaluation of irradiated and unirradiated mice for radiation-induced tumour growth delay. The prescribed homogeneous dose of 4 Gy was precisely delivered at the laser-driven source. The results demonstrate a complete laser-driven proton research platform for diverse user-specific small animal models, able to deliver tunable single-shot doses up to around 20 Gy to millimetre-scale volumes on nanosecond timescales, equivalent to around 109 Gy s–1, spatially homogenized and tailored to the sample. The platform provides a unique infrastructure for translational research with protons at ultrahigh dose rates. A laser–plasma accelerator provides proton beams for the precise irradiation of human tumours in a mouse model.

  abstract     = {Diffusion makes it difficult to predict and control wave transport through a medium. Overcoming wave diffusion to deliver energy into a target region deep inside a diffusive system is an important challenge for applications, but also represents an interesting fundamental question. It is known that coherently controlling the incident wavefront allows diffraction-limited focusing inside a diffusive system, but in many applications, the targets are significantly larger than a focus and the maximum deliverable energy remains unknown. Here we introduce the ‘deposition matrix’, which maps an input wavefront to the internal field distribution, and we theoretically predict the ultimate limit on energy enhancement at any depth. Additionally, we find that the maximum obtainable energy enhancement occurs at three-fourths the thickness of the diffusive system, regardless of its scattering strength. We experimentally verify our predictions by measuring the deposition matrix in two-dimensional diffusive waveguides. The experiment gives direct access to the internal field distribution from the third dimension, and we can excite the eigenstates to enhance or suppress the energy within an extended target region. Our analysis reveals that such enhancement or suppression results from both selective transmission-eigenchannel excitation and constructive or destructive interference among these channels. Optimally depositing optical energy into an extended region of a diffusive medium, such as biological tissue, is a challenging task. A matrix that maps the incoming wavefront to the field distribution inside the material can predict the energy enhancement that occurs at a given depth.},

  abstract     = {The layered vanadium antimonides AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) are a recently discovered family of topological kagome metals that exhibit a range of strongly correlated electronic phases including charge order and superconductivity. However, it is not yet understood how the distinctive electronic structure of the kagome lattice is linked to the observed many-body phenomena. Here we combine angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory to reveal multiple kagome-derived van Hove singularities (vHS) coexisting near the Fermi level of CsV3Sb5 and analyse their contribution to electronic symmetry breaking. The vHS are characterized by two distinct sublattice flavours (p-type and m-type), which originate, respectively, from their pure and mixed sublattice characters. These twofold vHS flavours of the kagome lattice critically determine the pairing symmetry and unconventional ground states emerging in the AV3Sb5 series. We establish that, among the multiple vHS in CsV3Sb5, the m-type vHS of the dxz/dyz kagome band and the p-type vHS of the dxy/dx2–y2 kagome band are located very close to the Fermi level, setting the stage for electronic symmetry breaking. The former band is characterized by pronounced Fermi surface nesting, while the latter exhibits a higher-order vHS. Our work reveals the essential role of kagome-derived vHS for the collective phenomena realized in the AV3Sb5 family. Spectroscopic measurements show how the features of the band structure related to the kagome lattice in CsV3Sb5 contribute to the observed strongly correlated phases.},

Although error-correcting codes implemented using individual physical qubits require many separate systems to be controlled, codes constructed using a quantum oscillator offer the possibility to perform error correction with a single physical entity. One powerful encoding approach for oscillators is the grid state or Gottesman–Kitaev–Preskill (GKP) encoding, which allows small displacement errors to be corrected. Here we introduce and implement a dissipative map designed for physically realistic finite GKP codes, which performs quantum error correction of a logical qubit encoded in the motion of a single trapped ion. The correction cycle involves two rounds, which correct small displacements in position and momentum. We demonstrate an extension in coherence time of logical states by a factor of three using both square and hexagonal GKP codes. The simple dissipative map used for this correction can be viewed as a type of reservoir engineering, which pumps into the manifold of highly non-classical GKP qubit states. Physical systems with continuous degrees of freedom can be used to implement quantum error correction codes. An autonomous correction protocol has now been used to extend the lifetime of a qubit encoded in the motion of a trapped ion.},

However, it has been challenging to relate quantum geometry to resonant optical responses. The main obstacle is that optical transitions involve a pair of states, whereas existing geometrical properties are defined for a single state. As a result, a concrete geometric understanding of optical responses has so far been limited to two-level systems, where the Hilbert space is completely determined by a single state and its orthogonal complement. Here, we construct a general theory of Riemannian geometry for resonant optical processes by identifying transition dipole moment matrix elements as tangent vectors. This theory applies to arbitrarily high-order responses, suggesting that optical responses can generally be thought of as manifestations of the Riemannian geometry of quantum states. We use our theory to show that third-order photovoltaic Hall effects are related to the Riemann curvature tensor and demonstrate an experimentally accessible regime where they dominate the response. The modern understanding of quantum transport relies on geometric concepts such as the Berry phase. The geometric approach has now been extended to the theory of optical transitions.},

Beyond its importance in quantum computing, this result can also be regarded as a statement about the dynamics of systems with local Hamiltonians: although locality puts various constraints on the short-term dynamics, it does not restrict the possible unitary evolutions that a composite system with a general local Hamiltonian can experience after a sufficiently long time. Here we show that this universality does not remain valid in the presence of conservation laws and global continuous symmetries such as U(1) and SU(2). In particular, we show that generic symmetric unitaries cannot be implemented, even approximately, using local symmetric unitaries. Based on this no-go theorem, we propose a method for experimentally probing the locality of interactions in nature. In the context of quantum thermodynamics, our results mean that generic energy-conserving unitary transformations on a composite system cannot be realized solely by combining local energy-conserving unitaries on the components. We show how this can be circumvented via catalysis. In systems with no symmetry, local operations can combine to make any unitary transformation across a whole quantum system, but if symmetries limit the allowed operations, they cannot all be generated using local transformations.},

The theory predicts that the different charged leptons, the electron, muon and tau, have identical electroweak interaction strengths.

This article presents evidence for the breaking of lepton universality in beauty-quark decays, with a significance of 3.1 standard deviations, based on proton–proton collision data collected with the LHCb detector at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider. The measurements are of processes in which a beauty meson transforms into a strange meson with the emission of either an electron and a positron, or a muon and an antimuon. If confirmed by future measurements, this violation of lepton universality would imply physics beyond the standard model, such as a new fundamental interaction between quarks and leptons. The Large Hadron Collider beauty collaboration reports a test of lepton flavour universality in decays of bottom mesons into strange mesons and a charged lepton pair, finding evidence of a violation of this principle postulated in the standard model.},

  abstract     = {Biomolecular condensates are dense assemblies of proteins that form distinct biochemical compartments without being surrounded by a membrane. Some, such as P granules and stress granules, behave as droplets and contain many millions of molecules. Others, such as transcriptional condensates that form on the surface of DNA, are small and contain thousands of molecules. The physics behind the formation of small condensates on DNA surfaces is still under discussion. Here we investigate the nature of transcription factor condensates using the pioneer transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 4 (Klf4). We show that Klf4 can phase separate on its own at high concentrations, but at low concentrations, Klf4 only forms condensates on DNA. Using optical tweezers, we demonstrate that these Klf4 condensates form on DNA as a type of surface condensation. This surface condensation involves a switch-like transition from a thin adsorbed layer to a thick condensed layer, which shows hallmarks of a prewetting transition. The localization of condensates on DNA correlates with sequence, suggesting that the condensate formation of Klf4 on DNA is a sequence-dependent form of surface condensation. Prewetting together with sequence specificity can explain the size and position control of surface condensates. We speculate that a prewetting transition of pioneer transcription factors on DNA underlies the formation and positioning of transcriptional condensates and provides robustness to transcriptional regulation. A DNA-binding protein condenses on DNA via a switch-like transition. Surface condensation occurs at preferential DNA locations suggesting collective sequence readout and enabling sequence-specificity robustness with respect to protein concentration.},

  abstract     = {Recently discovered superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs)1,2 provide a fresh opportunity to study correlation-driven electronic phenomena on a kagome lattice. The observation of an unusual charge density wave (CDW) in the normal state of all the members of the AV3Sb5 family2–10 has prompted a large effort to identify any ‘hidden’ broken symmetries associated with it. We use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunnelling microscopy to reveal pronounced intensity anisotropy between the different directions of hexagonal CDW in KV3Sb5. In particular, we find that one of the CDW directions is distinctly different compared with the other two. This observation points to an intrinsic rotation-symmetry-broken electronic ground state where the symmetry is reduced from sixfold to twofold. Furthermore, in contrast to previous reports3, we find that the CDW phase is insensitive to the magnetic-field direction, regardless of the presence or absence of atomic defects. Our experiments, combined with earlier observations of stripe charge ordering in CsV3Sb5, establish correlation-driven rotation symmetry breaking as a unifying feature of AV3Sb5 kagome superconductors. The precise nature of the charge-density-wave state in kagome superconductors remains unclear. Now, local spectroscopy shows that rotational symmetry in real space is broken, with one direction being distinct from the other two.},

  abstract     = {Discontinuous (first-order) quantum phase transitions and the associated metastability play central roles in diverse areas of physics, ranging from ferromagnetism to the false-vacuum decay in the early Universe1,2; yet, their dynamics are not well understood. Ultracold atoms provide an ideal platform for experimental simulations of quantum phase transitions3,4; so far, however, studies of first-order phase transitions have been limited to systems with weak interactions5–8, where quantum effects are exponentially suppressed. Here we realize a strongly correlated driven many-body system whose transition can be tuned from continuous to discontinuous. Resonant shaking of a one-dimensional optical lattice hybridizes the two lowest Bloch bands9,10, driving a novel transition from a Mott insulator to a superfluid with a staggered phase order. For weak shaking amplitudes, this transition is discontinuous and the system can remain frozen in a metastable state, whereas for strong shaking, it undergoes a continuous transition towards a superfluid. Our observations of this metastability and hysteresis agree with numerical simulations and pave the way for exploring the crucial role of quantum fluctuations in discontinuous transitions. Studies of first-order phase transitions in quantum simulators have so far been restricted to the weakly interacting regime. A tunable discontinuous phase transition has now been realized with strongly correlated atoms in a driven optical lattice.},

  abstract     = {In a burning plasma state1–7, alpha particles from deuterium–tritium fusion reactions redeposit their energy and are the dominant source of heating. This state has recently been achieved at the US National Ignition Facility8 using indirect-drive inertial-confinement fusion. Our experiments use a laser-generated radiation-filled cavity (a hohlraum) to spherically implode capsules containing deuterium and tritium fuel in a central hot spot where the fusion reactions occur. We have developed more efficient hohlraums to implode larger fusion targets compared with previous experiments9,10. This delivered more energy to the hot spot, whereas other parameters were optimized to maintain the high pressures required for inertial-confinement fusion. We also report improvements in implosion symmetry control by moving energy between the laser beams11–16 and designing advanced hohlraum geometry17 that allows for these larger implosions to be driven at the present laser energy and power capability of the National Ignition Facility. These design changes resulted in fusion powers of 1.5 petawatts, greater than the input power of the laser, and 170 kJ of fusion energy18,19. Radiation hydrodynamics simulations20,21 show energy deposition by alpha particles as the dominant term in the hot-spot energy balance, indicative of a burning plasma state. In burning plasma, alpha particles from fusion reactions are the dominant source of heating. The design choices that resulted in reaching this state in experiments at the National Ignition Facility are reported.},

  abstract     = {The superposition principle is the cornerstone of quantum mechanics, leading to a variety of genuinely quantum effects. Whether the principle applies also to macroscopic systems or, instead, there is a progressive breakdown when moving to larger scales is a fundamental and still open question. Spontaneous wavefunction collapse models predict the latter option, thus questioning the universality of quantum mechanics. Technological advances allow to increasingly challenge collapse models and the quantum superposition principle, with a variety of different experiments. Among them, non-interferometric experiments proved to be the most effective in testing these models. We provide an overview of such experiments, including cold atoms, optomechanical systems, X-ray detection, bulk heating and comparisons with cosmological observations. We also discuss avenues for future dedicated experiments, which aim at further testing collapse models and the validity of quantum mechanics. Collapse models predict that the superposition principle of quantum mechanics breaks down at macroscopic scales. This Review discusses constraints on these models from non-interferometric experiments.},

  abstract     = {The competition between thermal fluctuations and potential forces governs the stability of matter in equilibrium, in particular the proliferation and annihilation of topological defects. However, driving matter out of equilibrium allows for a new class of forces that are neither attractive nor repulsive, but rather transverse. The possibility of activating transverse forces raises the question of how they affect basic principles of material self-organization and control. Here we show that transverse forces organize colloidal spinners into odd elastic crystals crisscrossed by motile dislocations. These motile topological defects organize into a polycrystal made of grains with tunable length scale and rotation rate. The self-kneading dynamics drive super-diffusive mass transport, which can be controlled over orders of magnitude by varying the spinning rate. Simulations of both a minimal model and fully resolved hydrodynamics establish the generic nature of this crystal whorl state. Using a continuum theory, we show that both odd and Hall stresses can destabilize odd elastic crystals, giving rise to a generic state of crystalline active matter. Adding rotations to a material’s constituents has far-reaching consequences for continuous control of structures and transport at all scales. The addition of transverse forces to an ensemble of colloidal spinners induces the appearance of odd elastic crystals, featuring self-propelled defects that organize the system into a ‘self-kneading’ crystal whorl state.},

  abstract     = {Catalytic particles are spatially organized in a number of biological systems across different length scales, from enzyme complexes to metabolically coupled cells. Despite operating on different scales, these systems all feature localized reactions involving partially hindered diffusive transport, which is determined by the collective arrangement of the catalysts. Yet it remains largely unexplored how different arrangements affect the interplay between the reaction and transport dynamics, which ultimately determines the flux through the reaction pathway. Here we show that two fundamental trade-offs arise, the first between efficient inter-catalyst transport and the depletion of substrate, and the second between steric confinement of intermediate products and the accessibility of catalysts to substrate. We use a model reaction pathway to characterize the general design principles for the arrangement of catalysts that emerge from the interplay of these trade-offs. We find that the question of optimal catalyst arrangements generalizes the well-known Thomson problem of electrostatics. Comparing ways of arranging catalysts in living systems reveals that the reaction- and diffusion-limited regimes require different strategies. The formalism generalizes the Thomson problem of optimizing the configuration of electrons on a sphere.},

  abstract     = {Graphene moiré superlattices display electronic flat bands. At integer fillings of these flat bands, energy gaps due to strong electron–electron interactions are generally observed. However, the presence of other correlation-driven phases in twisted graphitic systems at non-integer fillings is unclear. Here, we report the existence of three-fold rotational (C3) symmetry breaking in twisted double bilayer graphene. Using spectroscopic imaging over large and uniform areas to characterize the direction and degree of C3 symmetry breaking, we find it to be prominent only at energies corresponding to the flat bands and nearly absent in the remote bands. We demonstrate that the magnitude of the rotational symmetry breaking does not depend on the degree of the heterostrain or the displacement field, being instead a manifestation of an interaction-driven electronic nematic phase. We show that the nematic phase is a primary order that arises from the normal metal state over a wide range of doping away from charge neutrality. Our modelling suggests that the nematic instability is not associated with the local scale of the graphene lattice, but is an emergent phenomenon at the scale of the moiré lattice. Observations of an electronic nematic phase in twisted double bilayer graphene expand the number of moiré materials where this interaction-driven state exists.},

  abstract     = {Cuprates with corner-sharing CuO4 plaquettes have received much attention owing to the discoveries of high-temperature superconductivity and exotic states where spin and charge or spin and orbital degrees of freedom are separated. In these systems spins are strongly coupled antiferromagnetically via superexchange mechanisms, with high nearest-neighbour coupling varying among different compounds. The electronic properties of cuprates are also known to be highly sensitive to the presence, distance and displacement of apical oxygens perpendicular to the CuO2 planes. Here we present ab initio quantum chemistry calculations of the nearest-neighbour superexchange antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling J of two cuprates, Sr2CuO3 and La2CuO4. The former lacks apical oxygens, whilst the latter contain two apical oxygens per CuO2 unit completing a distorted octahedral environment around each Cu atom. Good agreement is obtained with experimental estimates for both systems. Analysis of the correlated wavefunctions together with extended superexchange models shows that there is an important synergetic effect of the Coulomb interaction and the O–Cu hopping, namely a correlated breathing-enhanced hopping mechanism. This is a new ingredient in superexchange models. Suppression of this mechanism leads to drastic reduction in the AF coupling, indicating that it is of primary importance in generating the strong interactions. We also find that J increases substantially as the distance between Cu and apical O is increased. Cuprates exhibit exotic states because of the interplay between spin, charge and orbital degrees of freedom. Ab initio calculations now show that a mechanism called orbital expansion plays a key role in the magnetic properties of cuprates.},

  abstract     = {Exotic phases of matter can emerge from the interplay between strong electron interactions and non-trivial topology. Materials that have non-dispersing bands in their electronic band structure, such as twisted bilayer graphene, are prime candidates for strongly interacting physics. However, existing theoretical models for obtaining these ‘flat bands’ in crystals are often too restrictive for experimental realizations. Here we present a generic theoretical technique for constructing perfectly flat bands from bipartite crystalline lattices. Our prescription encapsulates and generalizes the various flat-band models in the literature and is applicable to systems with any orbital content, with or without spin–orbit coupling. Using topological quantum chemistry, we build a complete topological classification in terms of symmetry eigenvalues of all the gapped and gapless flat bands. We also derive criteria for the existence of symmetry-protected band touching points between the flat and dispersive bands, and identify the gapped flat bands as prime candidates for fragile topological phases. Finally, we show that the set of all perfectly flat bands is finitely generated and construct the corresponding bases for all 1,651 Shubnikov space groups. A general theoretical technique is introduced to identify materials that host flat bands. Applying topological quantum chemistry provides the generating bases for these flat bands in all space groups.},

Its realizations in quantum systems often rely on the dynamic winding of anyons, which can be challenging to obtain. Implementing braiding in a classical system could, therefore, assist the experimental study of non-Abelian physics. Here we present the realization of the non-Abelian braiding of multiple degenerate acoustic waveguide modes. The dynamics of non-Abelian braiding can be captured by the non-Abelian Berry–Wilczek–Zee phase that connects the holonomic adiabatic evolutions of multiple degenerate states. The cyclic evolution of degenerate states induces a non-Abelian geometric phase, manifesting as the exchange of states. The non-Abelian characteristics are revealed by switching the order of two distinct braiding processes involving three modes. Our work demonstrates wave manipulations based on non-Abelian braiding and logic operations. Although it shows promise for applications, non-Abelian braiding is difficult to realize in electronic systems. Its demonstration using acoustic waveguides may provide a useful platform to study non-Abelian physics.},

  abstract     = {Interacting many-body quantum systems show a rich array of physical phenomena and dynamical properties, but are notoriously difficult to study: they are analytically challenging and exponentially hard to simulate on classical computers. Small-scale quantum information processors hold the promise to efficiently emulate these systems, but characterizing their dynamics is experimentally difficult, requiring probes beyond simple correlation functions and multi-body tomographic methods. Here we demonstrate the measurement of out-of-time-ordered correlators—one of the most effective tools for studying quantum system evolution and processes like quantum thermalization. We implement a 3 × 3 two-dimensional hard-core Bose–Hubbard lattice with a superconducting circuit, study its time reversibility by performing a Loschmidt echo, and measure out-of-time-ordered correlators that enable us to observe the propagation of quantum information. A central requirement for our experiments is the ability to coherently reverse time evolution, which was achieved with a digital–analogue simulation scheme. In the presence of frequency disorder, we observe that localization can partially be overcome with more particles present—a possible signature of many-body localization in two dimensions. The complexity of many-body quantum states makes their evolution difficult to simulate with classical computers. Experiments on a 2D nine-qubit device demonstrate that the key properties of quantum lattices can be accessed by measuring out-of-time-ordered correlators.},

  abstract     = {Time-reversed evolution has substantial implications in physics, including applications in refocusing of classical waves or spins and fundamental studies such as quantum information scrambling. In quantum metrology, nonlinear interferometry based on time-reversal protocols supports entanglement-enhanced measurements without requiring low-noise detection. Despite the broad interest in this topic, it remains challenging to reverse the quantum dynamics of an interacting many-body system, which is typically realized by an (effective) sign flip of the system’s Hamiltonian. Here we present an approach that is broadly applicable to cyclic systems for implementing nonlinear interferometry without invoking time reversal. As time-reversed dynamics drives a system back to its starting point, we propose to accomplish the same by forcing the system to travel along a ‘closed loop’ instead of explicitly tracing back its antecedent path. Utilizing the quasiperiodic spin mixing dynamics in a three-mode 87Rb atomic spinor condensate, we implement such a closed-loop nonlinear interferometer and achieve a metrological gain of $$5.0{1}_{-0.76}^{+0.76}$$ decibels over the classical limit for a total of 26,500 atoms. Our approach unlocks the potential of nonlinear interferometry by allowing the dynamics to penetrate into the deep nonlinear regime, which gives rise to highly entangled non-Gaussian states. Nonlinear interferometry based on time reversal enables entanglement-enhanced measurements without the need for low-noise detection. An alternative approach now exploits cyclic dynamics and shows performance beyond the standard quantum limit.},

  abstract     = {Since the discovery of neutrino oscillations, we know that neutrinos have non-zero mass. However, the absolute neutrino-mass scale remains unknown. Here we report the upper limits on effective electron anti-neutrino mass, mν, from the second physics run of the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino experiment. In this experiment, mν is probed via a high-precision measurement of the tritium β-decay spectrum close to its endpoint. This method is independent of any cosmological model and does not rely on assumptions whether the neutrino is a Dirac or Majorana particle. By increasing the source activity and reducing the background with respect to the first physics campaign, we reached a sensitivity on mν of 0.7 eV c–2 at a 90\% confidence level (CL). The best fit to the spectral data yields $${{\mbox{}}}{m}_{\nu }^{2}{{\mbox{}}}$$  = (0.26 ± 0.34) eV2 c–4, resulting in an upper limit of mν &amp;lt; 0.9 eV c–2 at 90\% CL. By combining this result with the first neutrino-mass campaign, we find an upper limit of mν &amp;lt; 0.8 eV c–2 at 90\% CL. In its second measurement campaign, the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino experiment achieved a sub-electronvolt sensitivity on the effective electron anti-neutrino mass.},

In geometrically confined systems, the formation of globally correlated polar states proceeds through the emergence of a macroscopic steadily rotating vortex, which spontaneously selects a clockwise or counterclockwise global chiral state7,8. Here, we reveal that a global vortex formed by colloidal rollers exhibits polar state reversal and that a subsequent formation of the collective states upon re-energizing the system is not random. We combine experiments and simulations to elucidate how a combination of hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions leads to hidden asymmetries in the local particle positional order, reflecting the chiral state of the system. These asymmetries can be exploited to systematically command subsequent polar states of active liquids through temporal control of the activity. Active matter exhibits a plethora of collective phenomena in both biological and artificial systems. In a model system of colloidal rollers, polar states in active liquids can be controlled.},

  abstract     = {In condensed-matter physics, Mott insulators are an important phase involving strongly interacting electrons because of their intricate relationship with high-temperature superconductors1,2. Mott phases were recently observed for both bosonic and fermionic species in atomic systems3–9. However, in the solid state, the fingerprint of a Mott insulator implemented with bosons has yet to be found. Here we demonstrate such signature by exploring the Bose–Hubbard model using semiconductor excitons confined in a two-dimensional lattice. We emphasize the regime where on-site interactions are comparable to the energy separation between lattice-confined states. We then observe that a Mott phase is accessible, with at most two excitons uniformly occupying each lattice site. The technology introduced here allows us to programme the geometry of the lattice that confines the excitons. This versatility, combined with the long-range nature of dipolar interactions between excitons, provides a route to explore many-body phases that spontaneously break the lattice symmetry10,11. A semiconductor platform for experimentally investigating the multiorbital Bose–Hubbard model with long-range interactions is demonstrated. The interactions between the excitons are strong enough to reach the Mott insulator regime.},

  abstract     = {Superconducting devices, based on the Cooper pairing of electrons, play an important role in existing and emergent technologies, ranging from radiation detectors1,2 to quantum computers3. Their performance is limited by spurious quasiparticle excitations formed from broken Cooper pairs4–12. Efforts to achieve ultra-low quasiparticle densities have reached time-averaged numbers of excitations on the order of one in state-of-the-art devices2,12–15. However, the dynamics of the quasiparticle population as well as the timescales for adding and removing individual excitations remain largely unexplored. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a superconductor completely free of quasiparticles for periods lasting up to seconds. We monitor the quasiparticle number on a mesoscopic superconductor in real time by measuring the charge tunnelling to a normal metal contact. Quiet, excitation-free periods are interrupted by random-in-time Cooper pair breaking events, followed by a burst of charge tunnelling within a millisecond. Our results demonstrate the possibility of operating devices without quasiparticles with potentially improved performance. In addition, our experiment probes the origins of nonequilibrium quasiparticles in our device. The decay of the Cooper pair breaking rate over several weeks following the initial cooldown rules out processes arising from cosmic or long-lived radioactive sources16–19. The performance of superconducting devices can be degraded by quasiparticle generation mechanisms that are difficult to identify and eliminate. Now, a small superconducting island can be kept quasiparticle free for seconds at a time.},

In particular, the compounds KV3Sb5, CsV3Sb5 and RbV3Sb5 all feature a kagome net of vanadium atoms. These materials have recently been shown to exhibit superconductivity at low temperature and an unusual charge order at high temperature, revealing a connection to the underlying topological nature of the band structure. We highlight these discoveries, place them in the context of wider research efforts in topological physics and superconductivity, and discuss the open problems for this field.

  abstract     = {With the improving sensitivity of the global network of gravitational-wave detectors, we expect to observe hundreds of transient gravitational-wave events per year. The current methods used to estimate their source parameters employ optimally sensitive but computationally costly Bayesian inference approaches, where typical analyses have taken between 6 h and 6 d. For binary neutron star and neutron star–black hole systems prompt counterpart electromagnetic signatures are expected on timescales between 1 s and 1 min. However, the current fastest method for alerting electromagnetic follow-up observers can provide estimates in of the order of 1 min on a limited range of key source parameters. Here, we show that a conditional variational autoencoder pretrained on binary black hole signals can return Bayesian posterior probability estimates. The training procedure need only be performed once for a given prior parameter space and the resulting trained machine can then generate samples describing the posterior distribution around six orders of magnitude faster than existing techniques. A method for estimating the source properties of gravitational-wave events shows a speed-up of six orders of magnitude over established approaches. This is a promising tool for follow-up observations of electromagnetic counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Scalable quantum computing can become a reality with error correction, provided that coherent qubits can be constructed in large arrays1,2. The key premise is that physical errors can remain both small and sufficiently uncorrelated as devices scale, so that logical error rates can be exponentially suppressed. However, impacts from cosmic rays and latent radioactivity violate these assumptions. An impinging particle can ionize the substrate and induce a burst of quasiparticles that destroys qubit coherence throughout the device. High-energy radiation has been identified as a source of error in pilot superconducting quantum devices3–5, but the effect on large-scale algorithms and error correction remains an open question. Elucidating the physics involved requires operating large numbers of qubits at the same rapid timescales necessary for error correction. Here, we use space- and time-resolved measurements of a large-scale quantum processor to identify bursts of quasiparticles produced by high-energy rays. We track the events from their initial localized impact as they spread, simultaneously and severely limiting the energy coherence of all qubits and causing chip-wide failure. Our results provide direct insights into the impact of these damaging error bursts and highlight the necessity of mitigation to enable quantum computing to scale. Cosmic rays flying through superconducting quantum devices create bursts of excitations that destroy qubit coherence. Rapid, spatially resolved measurements of qubit error rates make it possible to observe the evolution of the bursts across a chip.},

In current network-evolution models, the degree of each node varies or grows arbitrarily, yet there are many networks for which a different description is required. In some networks, node degree saturates, such as the number of active contacts of a person, and in some it is fixed, such as the valence of an atom in a molecule. Here we introduce a family of network growth processes that preserve node degree, resulting in structures substantially different from those reported previously. We demonstrate that, despite it being an NP (non-deterministic polynomial time)-hard problem in general, the exact structure of most real-world networks can be generated from degree-preserving growth. We show that this process can create scale-free networks with arbitrary exponents, however, without preferential attachment. We present applications to epidemics control via network immunization, to viral marketing, to knowledge dissemination and to the design of molecular isomers with desired properties. Network models rarely fix the number of connections of each node during evolution, despite this being needed in real-world applications. Addressing this need, a new approach can grow scale-free networks without preferential attachment.},

  abstract     = {We present evidence that the two-dimensional bulk of monolayer WTe2 contains electrons and holes bound by Coulomb attraction—excitons—that spontaneously form in thermal equilibrium. On cooling from room temperature to 100 K, the conductivity develops a V-shaped dependence on electrostatic doping, while the chemical potential develops a step at the neutral point. These features are much sharper than is possible in an independent-electron picture, but they can be accounted for if electrons and holes interact strongly and are paired in equilibrium. Our calculations from first principles show that the exciton binding energy is larger than 100 meV and the radius as small as 4 nm, explaining their formation at high temperature and doping levels. Below 100 K, more strongly insulating behaviour is seen, suggesting that a charge-ordered state forms. The observed absence of charge density waves in this state is surprising within an excitonic insulator picture, but we show that it can be explained by the symmetries of the exciton wavefunction. Therefore, in addition to being a topological insulator, monolayer WTe2 exhibits strong correlations over a wide temperature range. Exciton condensation has been observed in various three-dimensional (3D) materials. Now, monolayer WTe2—a 2D topological insulator—also shows the phenomenon. Strong electronic interactions allow the excitons to form and condense at high temperature.},

Recent advances have identified monolayer WTe2 as a promising material for doing so in a highly tunable fashion. The ground state of this two-dimensional crystal can be electrostatically tuned from a quantum spin Hall insulator to a superconductor. However, much remains unknown about the gap-opening mechanism of the insulating state. Here we report evidence that the quantum spin Hall insulator is also an excitonic insulator, arising from the spontaneous formation of electron–hole bound states, namely excitons. We reveal the presence of an intrinsic insulating state at the charge neutrality point in clean samples and confirm the correlated nature of this charge-neutral insulator by tunnelling spectroscopy. We provide evidence against alternative scenarios of a band insulator or a localized insulator and support the existence of an excitonic insulator phase in the clean limit. These observations lay the foundation for understanding a new class of correlated insulators with nontrivial topology and identify monolayer WTe2 as a promising candidate for exploring quantum phases of ground-state excitons. Insulating states that are formed because of pairing between electrons and holes are known to exist in engineered bilayer structures in high magnetic fields. Now evidence suggests they can occur in a monolayer crystal at zero field.},

Logical operations include initialization into arbitrary states, measurement in the cardinal bases of the Bloch sphere and a universal set of single-qubit gates. For each type of operation, we observe higher performance for fault-tolerant variants over non-fault-tolerant variants, and quantify the difference. In particular, we demonstrate process tomography of logical gates, using the notion of a logical Pauli transfer matrix. This integration of high-fidelity logical operations with a scalable scheme for repeated stabilization is a milestone on the road to quantum error correction with higher-distance superconducting surface codes. Large-scale quantum computers will manipulate quantum information encoded in error-corrected logical qubits.

These errors can be complicated, making it difficult to accurately predict a processor’s capability. Benchmarks can be used to measure capability directly, but current benchmarks have limited flexibility and scale poorly to many-qubit processors. We show how to construct scalable, efficiently verifiable benchmarks based on any program by using a technique that we call circuit mirroring. With it, we construct two flexible, scalable volumetric benchmarks based on randomized and periodically ordered programs. We use these benchmarks to map out the capabilities of twelve publicly available processors, and to measure the impact of program structure on each one. We find that standard error metrics are poor predictors of whether a program will run successfully on today’s hardware, and that current processors vary widely in their sensitivity to program structure. Evaluations of quantum computers across architectures need reliable benchmarks. A class of benchmarks that can directly reflect the structure of any algorithm shows that different quantum computers have considerable variations in performance.},

  abstract     = {Sources of photons with controllable quantum properties such as entanglement and squeezing are desired for applications in quantum information, metrology and sensing. However, fine-grained control over these properties is hard to achieve, especially for two-photon sources. Here we propose a mechanism for the controlled generation of entangled and squeezed photon pairs using superluminal or accelerating modulations of the refractive index in a medium or both. By leveraging time-changing dielectric media, where quantum vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field can be converted into photon pairs, we show that energy and momentum conservation in multimode systems give rise to frequency and angle correlations of photon pairs controlled by the trajectory of index modulation. In our examples, these radiation effects are two-photon analogues of Cherenkov and synchrotron radiation by moving charged particles such as free electrons. We find that synchrotron-like radiation into photon pairs exhibits frequency correlations that can enable a heralded single-photon frequency comb. These effects are sensitive to the local density of photonic states and can be strongly enhanced using photonic nanostructures. For example, index modulations propagating near the surface of graphene produce entangled pairs of graphene plasmons with high efficiency. Despite their relevance for quantum technology, photon-pair sources are difficult to control. A theoretical proposal shows how photon pairs can be created from vacuum fluctuations in time-dependent systems, potentially enabling heralded single-photon frequency combs.},

This allows us to generate a family of highly complex pulses consisting of several, equally spaced spectral components that are nonlinearly bound and propagate as a single unit. Our theory shows that this leads to an enhancement of the effective nonlinear parameter that increases with the number of frequency components. We experimentally demonstrate an enhancement factor of up to 3.5 in a mode-locked fibre laser that incorporates an intracavity spectral pulse shaper, with scope for achieving even higher enhancements. Our approach enables the generation of low-energy ultrashort pulses that nonetheless exhibit strong nonlinear effects. The nonlinear optical effects underlying many applications are typically weak, but linear dispersion engineering allows the generation of pulses comprising equidistant frequency components, which enhances the effective nonlinearity.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of controlled, two-dimensional moiré materials1–6 has uncovered a new platform for investigating topological physics7–9. Twisted double bilayer graphene has been predicted to host a topologically non-trivial gapped phase with Chern number equal to two at charge neutrality, when half the flat bands are filled8,9. However, it can be difficult to diagnose topological states using a single measurement because it is ideal to probe the bulk and edge properties at the same time. Here we report a combination of chemical potential measurements, transport measurements and theoretical calculations that show that twisted double bilayer graphene can host metallic edge transport in addition to simultaneously being insulating in the bulk. A Landauer–Büttiker analysis of the measurements on multi-terminal samples allows us to quantitatively assess the edge-state scattering. We interpret these results as signatures of the predicted topological phase at charge neutrality, but further characterization of the edge transport is required to be certain. Twisted double bilayer graphene is predicted to be a topological insulator under certain conditions. Simultaneous bulk and edge measurements now show metallic transport with a bulk bandgap, suggestive of this prediction.},

  abstract     = {When a flat band is partially filled with electrons, strong Coulomb interactions between them may lead to the emergence of topological gapped states with quantized Hall conductivity. Such emergent topological states have been found in partially filled Landau levels1 and Hofstadter bands2,3; however, in both cases, a large magnetic field is required to produce the underlying flat band. The recent observation of quantum anomalous Hall effects in narrow-band moiré materials4–7 has led to the theoretical prediction that such phases could be realized at zero magnetic field8–12. Here we report the observation of insulators with Chern number C = 1 in the zero-magnetic-field limit at half-integer filling of the moiré superlattice unit cell in twisted monolayer–bilayer graphene7,13–15. Chern insulators in a half-filled band suggest the spontaneous doubling of the superlattice unit cell2,3,16, and our calculations find a ground state of the topological charge density wave at half-filling of the underlying band. The discovery of these topological phases at fractional superlattice filling enables the further pursuit of zero-magnetic-field phases that have fractional statistics that exist either as elementary excitations or bound to lattice dislocations. Topological states that are created from strong electron–electron interactions at half-integer superlattice fillings are observed at zero magnetic field.},

  abstract     = {Symmetry-broken electronic phases support neutral collective excitations. For example, monolayer graphene in the quantum Hall regime hosts a nearly ideal ferromagnetic phase at specific filling factors that spontaneously breaks the spin-rotation symmetry1–3. This ferromagnet has been shown to support spin-wave excitations known as magnons that can be electrically generated and detected4,5. Although long-distance magnon propagation has been demonstrated via transport measurements, important thermodynamic properties of such magnon populations—including the magnon chemical potential and density—have not been measured. Here we present local measurements of electron compressibility under the influence of magnons, which reveal a reduction in the gap associated with the ν = 1 quantum Hall state by up to 20\%. Combining these measurements with the estimates of temperature, our analysis reveals that the injected magnons bind to electrons and holes to form skyrmions, and it enables the extraction of free magnon density, magnon chemical potential and average skyrmion spin. Our methods provide a means of probing the thermodynamic properties of charge-neutral excitations that are applicable to other symmetry-broken electronic phases. Although magnons in the quantum Hall regime of graphene have been detected, their thermodynamic properties have not yet been measured. Now, a local probe technique enables the detection of the magnon density and chemical potential.},

  abstract     = {Twist engineering—the alignment of two-dimensional (2D) crystalline layers with a specific orientation—has led to tremendous success in controlling the charge degree of freedom, particularly in producing correlated and topological electronic phases in moiré crystals1,2. However, although pioneering theoretical efforts have predicted that non-trivial magnetism3–5 and magnons6,7 can be made by twisting 2D magnets, the experimental realization of engineering the spin degree of freedom by twisting remains elusive. Here we fabricate twisted double bilayers of a 2D magnet, namely, chromium triiodide (CrI3), and demonstrate the successful twist engineering of 2D magnetism in them. We identify signatures of a new magnetic ground state that is distinct from those in natural two-layer (2L) and four-layer (4L) CrI3. We show that for a very small twist angle, this emergent magnetism can be well approximated by a weighted linear superposition of those of 2L and 4L CrI3, whereas for a large twist angle, it mostly resembles that of isolated 2L CrI3. However, at an intermediate twist angle, there is a finite net magnetization that cannot be simply inferred from any homogeneous stacking configuration, but emerges because spin frustrations are introduced by competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange coupling within individual moiré supercells. Stacking and twisting two-dimensional materials has led to the observation of a variety of electronic phenomena. Now, magnetic behaviour that is distinct from anything seen in individual layers is induced by a moiré pattern in double bilayer chromium triiodide.},

  abstract     = {The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE)1–6 is a transport phenomenon where the Hall resistance is quantized to the von Klitzing constant due to the spontaneous magnetization of a ferromagnetic material even at zero magnetic field. Similar to the quantum Hall effect (QHE) under strong magnetic fields, the quantized Hall resistance of QAHE is supposed to be universal, independent of the details in the experimental realization7,8. However, the quantization accuracy of QAHE reported so far9–11 is much poorer than that of QHE. Here we demonstrate a precision of 10 parts per billion of Hall resistance quantization in QAHE. By directly comparing QAHE with QHE, we confirm that the quantization accuracy of QAHE satisfies the required level as a primary standard of electric resistance. We achieve this high accuracy of quantization by using a weak magnetic field supplied by a permanent disc magnet to align the magnetization domains. Our findings establish a milestone for developing a quantum resistance standard without strong magnetic fields. Accurate measurements of the ohm require high magnetic fields to support the quantum Hall effect. Now, high precision is achieved by using the quantum anomalous Hall effect in a low magnetic field, making the measurement much more accessible.},

With experiments routinely reaching the quantum regime, the focus has now turned towards creating and exploiting interesting non-classical states of motion and entanglement in optomechanical systems. Quantumness has also shifted from being the very reason why experiments are constructed to becoming a resource for the investigation of fundamental physics and the creation of quantum technologies. Here, by focusing on opto- and electromechanical platforms we review recent progress in quantum state preparation and entanglement of mechanical systems, together with applications to signal processing and transduction, quantum sensing and topological physics, as well as small-scale thermodynamics. Interaction with light can be used to precisely control motional states.

  abstract     = {Mesons comprising a beauty quark and strange quark can oscillate between particle ( $${B}_{\mathrm{s}}^{0}$$ ) and antiparticle ( $${\overline{B}}_{\mathrm{s}}^{0}$$ ) flavour eigenstates, with a frequency given by the mass difference between heavy and light mass eigenstates, Δms. Here we present a measurement of Δms using $${B}_{\mathrm{s}}^{0}\to {D}_{\mathrm{s}}^{-}$$ π+ decays produced in proton–proton collisions collected with the LHCb detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The oscillation frequency is found to be Δms = 17.7683 ± 0.0051 ± 0.0032 ps−1, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. This measurement improves on the current Δms precision by a factor of two. We combine this result with previous LHCb measurements to determine Δms = 17.7656 ± 0.0057 ps−1, which is the legacy measurement of the original LHCb detector. The LHCb collaboration reports an improved measurement of the oscillation frequency of mesons consisting of a bottom quark and strange quark, which is then combined with previous results.},
