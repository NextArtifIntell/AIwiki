  abstract     = {Mechanically responsive textiles have transformative potential in many areas from fashion to healthcare. Cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers have strong mechanochromic responses that offer attractive opportunities for such applications. Nonetheless, making liquid crystalline elastomer fibres suitable for textiles is challenging since the Plateau–Rayleigh instability tends to break up precursor solutions into droplets. Here, we report a simple approach that balances the viscoelastic properties of the precursor solution to avoid this outcome and achieve long and mechanically robust cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer filaments. These filaments have fast, progressive and reversible mechanochromic responses, from red to blue (wavelength shift of 155 nm), when stretched up to 200%. Moreover, the fibres can be sewed into garments and withstand repeated stretching and regular machine washing. This approach and resulting fibres may be useful for applications in wearable technology and other areas benefiting from autonomous strain sensing or detection of critically strong deformations. Robust cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer fibres with rapid and reversible mechanochromic responses are woven and sewn into garments to create smart clothing.},

The compositionally anisotropic building blocks employed in the assembly process are formed by multicomponent graft block copolymers containing sequence-defined side chains. The judicious design of various structural parameters in the graft block copolymers enables broadly tunable compositions, morphologies and lattice parameters across the nanoscale and mesoscale in the assembled structures. Our strategy introduces advanced design principles for the efficient creation of complex hierarchical structures and provides a facile synthetic platform to access nanomaterials with multiple precisely integrated functionalities.

In the design of block copolymers (BCPs) for directed self-assembly and nanolithography, materials often balance orthogonal properties to meet constraints related to processing, structure and defectivity. Although iterative synthesis strategies deliver BCPs with attractive properties, identifying materials with all the required attributes has been difficult. Here we report a high-throughput synthesis and characterization platform for the discovery and optimization of BCPs with A-block-(B-random-C) architectures for lithographic patterning in semiconductor manufacturing. Starting from a parent BCP and using thiol–epoxy ‘click’ chemistry, we synthesize a library of BCPs that cover a large and complex parameter space. This allows us to readily identify feature-size-dependent BCP chemistries for 8–20-nm-pitch patterns. These blocks have similar surface energies for directed self-assembly, and control over the segregation strength to optimize the structure (favoured at higher segregation strengths) and defectivity (favoured at lower segregation strengths). A discovery-oriented synthesis and characterization platform uses interchangeable polymer components to explore a large and complex parameter space to find possible combinations of components that satisfy the design rules at multiple nanolithography patterns dimensions.},

For example, in a carbon capture process, the heat required to regenerate a solid sorbent is directly related to the heat capacity of the material. However, for most materials suitable for carbon capture applications, the heat capacity is not known, and thus the standard procedure is to assume the same value for all materials. In this work, we developed a machine learning approach, trained on density functional theory simulations, to accurately predict the heat capacity of these materials, that is, zeolites, metal–organic frameworks and covalent–organic frameworks. The accuracy of our prediction is confirmed with experimental data. Finally, for a temperature swing adsorption process that captures carbon from the flue gas of a coal-fired power plant, we show that for some materials, the heat requirement is reduced by as much as a factor of two using the correct heat capacity. Heat capacity of nanoporous materials is important for processes such as carbon capture, as this can affect process design energy requirements. Here, a machine learning approach for heat capacity prediction, trained on density functional theory simulations, is presented and experimentally verified.},

In this study we used different liquid electrolyte chemistries as models for the polymer electrolytes, and evaluated the effect of adding a variety of porous and dense ceramic electrolytes on the conductivity. All the results could be modelled with the effective medium theory, allowing prediction of the conductivity of electrolyte combinations. We unambiguously determined that highly conductive porous particles act as insulators in such systems, whereas dense particles act as conductors, thereby advancing our understanding of composite electrolyte conductivity. Solid-state electrolytes are key to the development of safer and higher-energy-density batteries.

Here, we report a molecule that switches from high to low conductance states with massive negative memristive behaviour that depends on the drive speed and number of past switching events, with all the measurements fully modelled using atomistic and analytical models. This dynamic molecular switch emulates synaptic behavior and Pavlovian learning, all within a 2.4-nm-thick layer that is three orders of magnitude thinner than a neuronal synapse. The dynamic molecular switch provides all the fundamental logic gates necessary for deep learning because of its time-domain and voltage-dependent plasticity. The synapse-mimicking multifunctional dynamic molecular switch represents an adaptable molecular-scale hardware operable in solid-state devices, and opens a pathway to simplify dynamic complex electrical operations encoded within a single ultracompact component. To realize electronic operations beyond the von Neumann bottleneck, a new type of switch that can mimic self-learning is needed. Here, the authors demonstrate all-in-one-place logic and memory operations based on dynamic molecular switch that can emulate brain-like synaptic and Pavlovian response, bringing the field a step closer to molecular-scale hardware.},

However, such interstitial doping inevitably leads to lattice microstrain that impairs the long-range ordering and stability of the crystals, causing a sacrificial trade-off. Here, we unravel the evident influence of the valence states of the interstitial cations on their efficacy to suppress the ion migration. Incorporation of a trivalent neodymium cation (Nd3+) effectively mitigates the ion migration in the perovskite lattice with a reduced dosage (0.08%) compared to a widely used monovalent cation dopant (Na+, 0.45%). The photovoltaic performances and operational stability of the prototypical perovskite solar cells are enhanced with a trace amount of Nd3+ doping while minimizing the sacrificial trade-off. Ion migration has a detrimental effect on the performance and stability of halide perovskite optoelectronics. Here, the authors incorporated a small dosage of high-valence neodymium cation to suppress this, with a minimal impact on the lattice microstrain.},

While lateral transient photoluminescence microscopies have been popularly used to characterize charge diffusion in perovskites, there exists a discrepancy between low diffusion coefficients measured and near-unity charge collection efficiencies achieved in practical solar cells. Here, we reveal hidden microscopic dynamics in halide perovskites through four-dimensional (directions x, y and z and time t) tracking of charge carriers by characterizing out-of-plane diffusion of charge carriers. By combining this approach with confocal microscopy, we discover a strong local heterogeneity of vertical charge diffusivities in a three-dimensional perovskite film, arising from the difference between intragrain and intergrain diffusion. We visualize that most charge carriers are efficiently transported through the direct intragrain pathways or via indirect detours through nearby areas with fast diffusion. The observed anisotropy and heterogeneity of charge carrier diffusion in perovskites rationalize their high performance as shown in real devices. Our work also foresees that further control of polycrystal growth will enable solar cells with micrometres-thick perovskites to achieve both long optical path length and efficient charge collection simultaneously. A discrepancy exists between the low diffusion coefficients and near-unity charge collection efficiencies achieved in practical halide perovskite solar cells. Here, the authors explain this through the discovery of strong heterogeneity in vertical charge diffusivities in a 3D perovskite film.},

Photosensitive and semiconducting two-dimensional (2D) materials can bridge this technology gap by integrating image capture (sense) and image processing (compute) capabilities in a single device. Here, we introduce a 2D APS technology based on a monolayer MoS2 phototransistor array, where each pixel uses a single programmable phototransistor, leading to a substantial reduction in footprint (900 pixels in ∼0.09 cm2) and energy consumption (100s of fJ per pixel). By exploiting gate-tunable persistent photoconductivity, we achieve a responsivity of ∼3.6 × 107 A W−1, specific detectivity of ∼5.6 × 1013 Jones, spectral uniformity, a high dynamic range of ∼80 dB and in-sensor de-noising capabilities. Further, we demonstrate near-ideal yield and uniformity in photoresponse across the 2D APS array. Low-power and compact active pixel sensor (APS) matrices are desired for resource-limited edge devices. Here, the authors report a small-footprint APS matrix based on monolayer MoS2 phototransistors arrays exhibiting spectral uniformity, reconfigurable photoresponsivity and de-noising capabilities at low energy consumption.},

Two-dimensional magnets allow for control of magnetic properties using the electric field, electrostatic doping and strain. In two-dimensional atomically thin magnets, a non-volatile all-optical method would offer the distinct advantage of switching magnetic states without application of an external field. Here, we demonstrate such all-optical magnetization switching in the atomically thin ferromagnetic semiconductor, CrI3, triggered by circularly polarized light pulses. The magnetization switching behaviour strongly depends on the exciting photon energy and polarization, in correspondence with excitonic transitions in CrI3, indicating that the switching process is related to spin angular momentum transfer from photoexcited carriers to local magnetic moments. Such an all-optical magnetization switching should allow for further exploration of magneto-optical interactions and open up applications in high-speed and low-power spintronic devices. The authors use circularly polarized light pulses to trigger all-optical magnetization switching in an atomically thin ferromagnetic semiconductor. The switching process is related to spin angular momentum transfer from photoexcited carriers to local magnetic moments.},

Here we used molecular-beam epitaxy to grow Bi2Se3 films with a controlled thickness on monolayer NbSe2 and performed in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ex situ magnetotransport measurements on these heterostructures. We found that the emergence of Rashba-type bulk quantum-well bands and spin-non-degenerate surface states coincides with a marked suppression of the in-plane upper critical magnetic field of the superconductivity in Bi2Se3/monolayer NbSe2 heterostructures. This is a signature of a crossover from Ising- to Rashba-type superconducting pairings, induced by altering the Bi2Se3 film thickness. Our work opens a route for exploring a robust topological superconducting phase in TI/Ising superconductor heterostructures. Using molecular-beam epitaxy, we synthesize heterostructures of topological insulator Bi2Se3 and the Ising superconductor monolayer NbSe2. By changing the Bi2Se3 thickness, they demonstrate a crossover from Ising- to Rashba-type superconducting pairing.},

  abstract     = {The hygroscopic deformation of pine cones, featured by opening and closing their scales depending on the environmental humidity, is a well-known stimuli-responsive model system for artificial actuators. However, it has not been noted that the deformation of pine cones is an ultra-slow process. Here, we reveal that vascular bundles with unique parallelly arranged spring/square microtubular heterostructures dominate the hygroscopic movement, characterized as ultra-slow motion with the outer sclereids. The spring microtubes give a much larger hygroscopic deformation than that of the square microtubes along the longitudinal axis direction, which bends the vascular bundles and consequently drives the scales to move. The outer sclereids with good water retention enable the vascular-bundle-triggered deformation to proceed ultra-slowly. Drawing inspiration, we developed soft actuators enabling controllable yet unperceivable motion. The motion velocity is almost two orders of magnitude lower than that of the same-class actuators reported, which made the as-developed soft actuators applicable in camouflage and reconnaissance. The ultra-slow reshaping of pine cones is dominated by the unique spring/square heterostructure in their vascular bundles, with the velocity slowed by sclereids. Inspired by this motion, a soft actuator showing unperceivable motion was developed.},

Magnons, the elementary excitations of the magnetic order, flow under the gradient of a magnon chemical potential1–3 in proportion to a magnon (spin) conductivity. The magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet is the material of choice for efficient magnon spin transport. Here we report a giant magnon conductivity in thin yttrium iron garnet films with thicknesses down to 3.7 nm when the number of occupied two-dimensional subbands is reduced from a large number to a few, which corresponds to a transition from three-dimensional to two-dimensional magnon transport. We extract a two-dimensional magnon spin conductivity around 1 S at room temperature, comparable to the (electronic) conductivity of the high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas in GaAs quantum wells at millikelvin temperatures4. Such high conductivities offer opportunities to develop low-dissipation magnon-based spintronic devices. The authors report the observation of an enhanced magnon conductivity close to the two-dimensional transport regime in ultrathin yttrium iron garnet.},

  abstract     = {Embryogenesis, tissue repair and cancer metastasis rely on collective cell migration. In vitro studies propose that cells are stiffer while migrating in stiff substrates, but softer when plated in compliant surfaces which are typically considered as non-permissive for migration. Here we show that cells within clusters from embryonic tissue dynamically decrease their stiffness in response to the temporal stiffening of their native substrate to initiate collective cell migration. Molecular and mechanical perturbations of embryonic tissues reveal that this unexpected mechanical response involves a mechanosensitive pathway relying on Piezo1-mediated microtubule deacetylation. We further show that decreasing microtubule acetylation and consequently cluster stiffness is sufficient to trigger collective cell migration in soft non-permissive substrates. This suggests that reaching an optimal cluster-to-substrate stiffness ratio is essential to trigger the onset of this collective process. Overall, these in vivo findings challenge the current understanding of collective cell migration and its physiological and pathological roles. Collective cell migration in embryonic tissues is triggered by cell softening due to a microtubule deacetylation pathway involving the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1.},

  abstract     = {To rationalize and improve the performance of newly developed high-rate battery electrode materials, it is crucial to understand the ion intercalation and degradation mechanisms occurring during realistic battery operation. Here we apply a laboratory-based operando optical scattering microscopy method to study micrometre-sized rod-like particles of the anode material Nb14W3O44 during high-rate cycling. We directly visualize elongation of the particles, which, by comparison with ensemble X-ray diffraction, allows us to determine changes in the state of charge of individual particles. A continuous change in scattering intensity with state of charge enables the observation of non-equilibrium kinetic phase separations within individual particles. Phase field modelling (informed by pulsed-field-gradient nuclear magnetic resonance and electrochemical experiments) supports the kinetic origin of this separation, which arises from the state-of-charge dependence of the Li-ion diffusion coefficient. The non-equilibrium phase separations lead to particle cracking at high rates of delithiation, particularly in longer particles, with some of the resulting fragments becoming electrically disconnected on subsequent cycling. These results demonstrate the power of optical scattering microscopy to track rapid non-equilibrium processes that would be inaccessible with established characterization techniques. Understanding the ion intercalation and degradation mechanisms occurring during realistic battery operation is crucial to developing high-rate battery electrodes. Operando optical scattering microscopy is now used to study single-particle kinetic state-of-charge heterogeneities and cracking in high-rate Li-ion anode materials.},

Here, we employ a coupled far-field high-energy diffraction microscopy and tomography approach for assessing the chemo-mechanical behaviour for dense, polycrystalline garnet (Li7La3Zr2O12) solid electrolytes with grain-level resolution. In situ monitoring of grain-level stress responses reveals that the failure mechanism is stochastic and affected by local microstructural heterogeneity. Coupling high-energy X-ray diffraction and far-field high-energy diffraction microscopy measurements reveals the presence of phase heterogeneity that can alter local chemo-mechanics within the bulk solid electrolyte. These local regions are proposed to be regions with the presence of a cubic polymorph of LLZO, potentially arising from local dopant concentration variation. The coupled tomography and FF-HEDM experiments are combined with transport and mechanics modelling to illustrate the degradation of polycrystalline garnet solid electrolytes. The results showcase the pathways for processing high-performing solid-state batteries. Understanding and mitigating filament formation, short-circuit and solid electrolyte fracture is necessary for advanced all-solid-state batteries.

  abstract     = {Stable catalysts are essential to address energy and environmental challenges, especially for applications in harsh environments (for example, high temperature, oxidizing atmosphere and steam). In such conditions, supported metal catalysts deactivate due to sintering—a process where initially small nanoparticles grow into larger ones with reduced active surface area—but strategies to stabilize them can lead to decreased performance. Here we report stable catalysts prepared through the encapsulation of platinum nanoparticles inside an alumina framework, which was formed by depositing an alumina precursor within a separately prepared porous organic framework impregnated with platinum nanoparticles. These catalysts do not sinter at 800 °C in the presence of oxygen and steam, conditions in which conventional catalysts sinter to a large extent, while showing similar reaction rates. Extending this approach to Pd–Pt bimetallic catalysts led to the small particle size being maintained at temperatures as high as 1,100 °C in air and 10% steam. This strategy can be broadly applied to other metal and metal oxides for applications where sintering is a major cause of material deactivation. Nanoparticle catalysts can be highly active, but are susceptible to deactivation due to sintering under operational conditions. The Pt and Pd–Pt catalysts synthesized here are stable under demanding reaction conditions with temperatures as high as 1,100 °C.},

  abstract     = {Anisotropic exchange splitting in semiconductor quantum dots results in bright-exciton fine-structure splitting important for quantum information processing. Direct measurement of fine-structure splitting usually requires single/few quantum dots at liquid-helium temperature because of its sensitivity to quantum dot size and shape, whereas measuring and controlling fine-structure splitting at an ensemble level seem to be impossible unless all the dots are made to be nearly identical. Here we report strong bright-exciton fine-structure splitting up to 1.6 meV in solution-processed CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dots, manifested as quantum beats in ensemble-level transient absorption at liquid-nitrogen to room temperature. The splitting is robust to quantum dot size and shape heterogeneity, and increases with decreasing temperature, pointing towards a mechanism associated with orthorhombic distortion of the perovskite lattice. Effective-mass-approximation calculations reveal an intrinsic ‘fine-structure gap’ that agrees well with the observed fine-structure splitting. This gap stems from an avoided crossing of bright excitons confined in orthorhombically distorted quantum dots that are bounded by the pseudocubic {100} family of planes. Halide perovskites feature highly dynamic lattices, but their impact on exciton fine structure remains unexplored. Here, the authors show that these lattices lead to a bright-exciton fine structure gap, enabling observation of quantum beats in a non-uniform ensemble.},

  abstract     = {Triplet-fusion-based photon upconversion holds promise for a wide range of applications, from photovoltaics to bioimaging. The efficiency of triplet fusion, however, is fundamentally limited in conventional molecular and polymeric systems by its spin dependence. Here, we show that the inherent tailorability of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), combined with their highly porous but ordered structure, minimizes intertriplet exchange coupling and engineers effective spin mixing between singlet and quintet triplet–triplet pair states. We demonstrate singlet–quintet coupling in a pyrene-based MOF, NU-1000. An anomalous magnetic field effect is observed from NU-1000 corresponding to an induced resonance between singlet and quintet states that yields an increased fusion rate at room temperature under a relatively low applied magnetic field of 0.14 T. Our results suggest that MOFs offer particular promise for engineering the spin dynamics of multiexcitonic processes and improving their upconversion performance. Triplet-fusion-based photon upconversion is promising for photovoltaic or bioimaging applications, but its efficiency is limited by triplet fusion spin dependence. Here, the authors tailor spin dynamics by engineering the crystal structure with metal–organic frameworks to enable effective spin mixing between singlet and quintet triplet–triplet pair states.},

To realize such quantum electron systems, a key ingredient is dense electrons decoupled from other degrees of freedom. Here, we report the discovery of a pure quantum electron liquid that spreads up to ~3 Å in a vacuum on the surface of an electride crystal. Its extremely high electron density and weak hybridization with buried atomic orbitals show the quantum and pure nature of the electrons, which exhibit a polarized liquid phase, as demonstrated by our spin-dependent measurement. Furthermore, upon enhancing the electron correlation strength, the dynamics of the quantum electrons change to that of a non-Fermi liquid along with an anomalous band deformation, suggestive of a transition to a hexatic liquid crystal phase. Our findings develop the frontier of quantum electron systems and serve as a platform for exploring correlated electronic phases in a pure fashion.

  abstract     = {The production of large-area twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with controllable angles is a prerequisite for proceeding with its massive applications. However, most of the prevailing strategies to fabricate twisted bilayers face great challenges, where the transfer methods are easily stuck by interfacial contamination, and direct growth methods lack the flexibility in twist-angle design. Here we develop an effective strategy to grow centimetre-scale TBG with arbitrary twist angles (accuracy, &amp;lt;1.0°). The success in accurate angle control is realized by an angle replication from two prerotated single-crystal Cu(111) foils to form a Cu/TBG/Cu sandwich structure, from which the TBG can be isolated by a custom-developed equipotential surface etching process. The accuracy and consistency of the twist angles are unambiguously illustrated by comprehensive characterization techniques, namely, optical spectroscopy, electron microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy and photocurrent spectroscopy. Our work opens an accessible avenue for the designed growth of large-scale two-dimensional twisted bilayers and thus lays the material foundation for the future applications of twistronics at the integration level. Angle tunability in twisted bilayer graphene is crucial in promoting its applications of twistronics. Here an angle replication strategy is developed to obtain centimetre-scale bilayer graphene with arbitrary twist angles.},

  abstract     = {Titanium alloys, widely used in the aerospace, automotive and energy sectors, require complex casting and thermomechanical processing to achieve the high strengths required for load-bearing applications. Here we reveal that additive manufacturing can exploit thermal cycling and rapid solidification to create ultrastrong and thermally stable titanium alloys, which may be directly implemented in service. As demonstrated in a commercial titanium alloy, after simple post-heat treatment, adequate elongation and tensile strengths over 1,600 MPa are achieved. The excellent properties are attributed to the unusual formation of dense, stable and internally twinned nanoprecipitates, which are rarely observed in traditionally processed titanium alloys. These nanotwinned precipitates are shown to originate from a high density of dislocations with a dominant screw character and formed from the additive manufacturing process. The work here paves the way to fabricate structural materials with unique microstructures and excellent properties for broad applications. Laser additive manufacturing can be exploited to generate unique internally twinned nanoprecipitates in commercial titanium alloys, paving the way to fabricate ultrastrong metallic materials with intricate shapes for broad applications.},

When the ferroelectric is in a heterostructure, this behaviour yields a voltage amplification in the other elements, which experience a potential difference larger than the one applied, holding promise for low-power electronics3. So far research has focused on verifying this effect and little is known about how to optimize it. Here, we describe an electrostatic theory of ferroelectric/dielectric superlattices, convenient model systems4,5, and show the relationship between the negative permittivity of the ferroelectric layers and the voltage amplification in the dielectric ones. Then, we run simulations of PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices to reveal the factors most strongly affecting the amplification. In particular, we find that giant effects (up to tenfold increases) can be obtained when PbTiO3 is brought close to the so-called ‘incipient ferroelectric’ state. Negative capacitance (NC) is a promising route towards low-power electronics. Here, a theory clarifying the connection between NC and voltage amplification is presented, and it is predicted that incipient ferroelectric states that do not necessarily maximize NC can result in a tenfold voltage amplification.},

Here we demonstrate reversible electric-field control of nanoscale hydrogenation into VO2 with a tunable insulator–metal transition using a scanning probe. The Pt-coated probe serves as an efficient catalyst to split hydrogen molecules, while the positive-biased voltage accelerates hydrogen ions between the tip and sample surface to facilitate their incorporation, leading to non-volatile transformation from insulating VO2 into conducting HxVO2. Remarkably, a negative-biased voltage triggers dehydrogenation to restore the insulating VO2. This work demonstrates a local and reversible electric-field-controlled insulator–metal transition through hydrogen evolution and presents a versatile pathway to exploit multiple functional devices at the nanoscale. The authors realize local and reversible hydrogenation of VO2 using a Pt-coated scanning probe microscope tip and forming gas.},

Extensive studies on the structure and relaxation dynamics of glasses have constructed the current classical picture3–5: glasses consist of some ‘soft zones’ of loosely bound atoms embedded in a tightly bound atomic matrix. Recent experiments have found an additional fast process in the relaxation spectra6–9, but the underlying physics of this process remains unclear. Here, combining extensive dynamic experiments and computer simulations, we reveal that this fast relaxation is associated with string-like diffusion of liquid-like atoms, which are inherited from the high-temperature liquids. Even at room temperature, some atoms in dense-packed metallic glasses can diffuse just as easily as they would in liquid states, with an experimentally determined viscosity as low as 107 Pa·s. This finding extends our current microscopic picture of glass solids and might help establish the dynamics–property relationship of glasses4. The existence of fast dynamics in glass solids at low temperatures is attributed to liquid-like atoms that are inherited from high-temperature liquids and exhibit behaviour similar to that of atoms in liquid states.},

  abstract     = {Growing evidence suggests that the physical properties of the cellular microenvironment influence cell migration. However, it is not currently understood how active physical remodelling by cells affects migration dynamics. Here we report that cell clusters seeded on deformable collagen-I networks display persistent collective migration despite not showing any apparent intrinsic polarity. Clusters generate transient gradients in collagen density and alignment due to viscoelastic relaxation of the collagen networks. Combining theory and experiments, we show that crosslinking collagen networks or reducing cell cluster size results in reduced network deformation, shorter viscoelastic relaxation time and smaller gradients, leading to lower migration persistence. Traction force and Brillouin microscopy reveal asymmetries in force distributions and collagen stiffness during migration, providing evidence of mechanical cross-talk between cells and their substrate during migration. This physical model provides a mechanism for self-generated directional migration on viscoelastic substrates in the absence of internal biochemical polarity cues. Cell clusters mechanically reorganize viscoelastic collagen networks, resulting in transient gradients in collagen density, alignment and stiffness that promote spontaneous persistent migration.},

  abstract     = {Cell reprogramming has wide applications in tissue regeneration, disease modelling and personalized medicine. In addition to biochemical cues, mechanical forces also contribute to the modulation of the epigenetic state and a variety of cell functions through distinct mechanisms that are not fully understood. Here we show that millisecond deformation of the cell nucleus caused by confinement into microfluidic channels results in wrinkling and transient disassembly of the nuclear lamina, local detachment of lamina-associated domains in chromatin and a decrease of histone methylation (histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation) and DNA methylation. These global changes in chromatin at the early stage of cell reprogramming boost the conversion of fibroblasts into neurons and can be partially reproduced by inhibition of histone H3 lysine 9 and DNA methylation. This mechanopriming approach also triggers macrophage reprogramming into neurons and fibroblast conversion into induced pluripotent stem cells, being thus a promising mechanically based epigenetic state modulation method for cell engineering. Mechanical confinement of fibroblasts into micrometre-sized channels deforms the cell nucleus, leading to temporary nuclear lamina destablization and disassembly, loss of lamina-associated domains in chromatin and a decrease in histone and DNA methylation. These mechanically induced alterations in chromatin boost the conversion of fibroblasts into neurons and pluripotent stem cells and thus can be explored for cell engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {The development of membranes that block solutes while allowing rapid water transport is of great importance. The microstructure of the membrane needs to be rationally designed at the molecular level to achieve precise molecular sieving and high water flux simultaneously. We report the design and fabrication of ultrathin, ordered conjugated-polymer-framework (CPF) films with thicknesses down to 1 nm via chemical vapour deposition and their performance as separation membranes. Our CPF membranes inherently have regular rhombic sub-nanometre (10.3 × 3.7 Å) channels, unlike membranes made of carbon nanotubes or graphene, whose separation performance depends on the alignment or stacking of materials. The optimized membrane exhibited a high water/NaCl selectivity of ∼6,900 and water permeance of ∼112 mol m−2 h−1 bar−1, and salt rejection &amp;gt;99.5% in high-salinity mixed-ion separations driven by osmotic pressure. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that water molecules quickly and collectively pass through the membrane by forming a continuous three-dimensional network within the hydrophobic channels. The advent of ordered CPF provides a route towards developing carbon-based membranes for precise molecular separation. Carbon nanomaterials such as graphene show intriguing molecular transport properties, but to achieve regular channels over a large area requires perfect sheet alignment. Here, a large-area two-dimensional conjugated-polymer-framework is grown with regular pore distribution, enabling 99.5% salt rejection by forward osmosis.},

  abstract     = {Polymer electrolytes provide a safe solution for future solid-state high-energy-density batteries. Materials that meet the simultaneous requirement of high ionic conductivity and high transference number remain a challenge, in particular for new battery chemistries beyond lithium such as Na, K and Mg. Herein, we demonstrate the versatility of a polymeric ionic liquid (PolyIL) as a polymer solvent to achieve this goal for both Na and K. Using molecular simulations, we predict and elucidate fast alkali metal ion transport in PolyILs through a structural diffusion mechanism in a polymer-in-salt environment, facilitating a high metal ion transference number simultaneously. Experimental validation of these computationally designed Na and K polymer electrolytes shows good ionic conductivities up to 1.0 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 80 °C and a Na+ transference number of ~0.57. An electrochemical cycling test on a Na∣2:1 NaFSI/PolyIL∣Na symmetric cell also demonstrates an overpotential of 100 mV at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 and stable long-term Na plating/stripping performance of more than 100 hours. PolyIL-based polymer-in-salt strategies for new solid-state electrolytes thus offer an alternative route to design high-performance next-generation sustainable battery chemistries. Polymer electrolytes provide a safe solution for future solid-state high-energy-density batteries, but combining high ionic conductivity and a high transference number is a challenge. A polymeric ionic liquid used as a polymer solvent is now shown to be promising for both sodium and potassium batteries.},

  abstract     = {Reversible anionic redox reactions represent a transformational change for creating advanced high-energy-density positive-electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries. The activation mechanism of these reactions is frequently linked to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) processes, which have not been fully validated experimentally due to the lack of suitable model materials. Here we show that the activation of anionic redox in cation-disordered rock-salt Li1.17Ti0.58Ni0.25O2 involves a long-lived intermediate Ni3+/4+ species, which can fully evolve to Ni2+ during relaxation. Combining electrochemical analysis and spectroscopic techniques, we quantitatively identified that the reduction of this Ni3+/4+ species goes through a dynamic LMCT process (Ni3+/4+–O2− → Ni2+–On−). Our findings provide experimental validation of previous theoretical hypotheses and help to rationalize several peculiarities associated with anionic redox, such as cationic–anionic redox inversion and voltage hysteresis. This work also provides additional guidance for designing high-capacity electrodes by screening appropriate cationic species for mediating LMCT. Understanding reversible anionic redox reactions is key to designing high-energy-density cathodes for lithium-ion batteries. Anionic redox activation in cation-disordered rock-salt Li1.17Ti0.58Ni0.25O2 is shown to involve intermediate Ni3+/4+ species that can evolve to Ni2+ during relaxation.},

  abstract     = {Sliding ferroelectricity is a recently observed polarity existing in two-dimensional materials. However, due to the weak polarization and poor electrical insulation in these materials, existing experimental evidences are indirect and mostly based on nanoscale transport properties or piezoresponse force microscopy. We report the direct observation of sliding ferroelectricity, using a high-quality amphidynamic single crystal (15-crown-5)Cd3Cl6, which possesses a large bandgap and so allows direct measurement of polarization–electric field hysteresis. This coordination polymer is a van der Waals material, which is composed of inorganic stators and organic rotators as determined by X-ray diffraction and NMR characterization. From density functional theory calculations, we find that after freezing the rotators, an electric dipole is generated in each layer driven by the geometric mechanism, while a comparable ferroelectric polarization originates from the interlayer sliding. The net polarization of these two components can be directly measured and manipulated. Our finding provides insight into low-dimensional ferroelectrics, especially control of the synchronous dynamics of rotating molecules and sliding layers in solids. Two-dimensional materials can present ferroelectricity by layer sliding, but electrical confirmation is lacking due to narrow bandgaps. Here, a single-crystal coordination polymer with large bandgap enabling direct electrical measurement of P–E hysteresis is shown to present sliding ferroelectricity.},

  abstract     = {Thermally activated delayed fluorescence enables organic semiconductors with charge transfer-type excitons to convert dark triplet states into bright singlets via reverse intersystem crossing. However, thus far, the contribution from the dielectric environment has received insufficient attention. Here we study the role of the dielectric environment in a range of thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials with varying changes in dipole moment upon optical excitation. In dipolar emitters, we observe how environmental reorganization after excitation triggers the full charge transfer exciton formation, minimizing the singlet–triplet energy gap, with the emergence of two (reactant-inactive) modes acting as a vibrational fingerprint of the charge transfer product. In contrast, the dielectric environment plays a smaller role in less dipolar materials. The analysis of energy–time trajectories and their free-energy functions reveals that the dielectric environment substantially reduces the activation energy for reverse intersystem crossing in dipolar thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters, increasing the reverse intersystem crossing rate by three orders of magnitude versus the isolated molecule. The role of the dielectric environment in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) is not yet fully understood. Here the authors reveal the relevance of environment–emitter interactions in gating the reverse intersystem crossing and its particular relevance in dipolar TADF emitters.},

This attribute ensures that the magnetic layers maintain their intrinsic spin-polarized electronic states and spin-flipping scattering processes at a minimum level, a trait that can expand spintronic device functionalities. Here, using a van der Waals assembly of ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 with non-magnetic hexagonal boron nitride and WSe2 layers, we demonstrate electrically tunable, highly transparent spin injection and detection across the van der Waals interfaces. By varying an electrical bias, the net spin polarization of the injected carriers can be modulated and reversed in polarity, which leads to sign changes of the tunnelling magnetoresistance. We attribute the spin polarization reversals to sizable contributions from high-energy localized spin states in the metallic ferromagnet, so far inaccessible in conventional magnetic junctions. Such tunability of the spin-valve operations opens a promising route for the electronic control of next-generation low-dimensional spintronic device applications. The authors investigate tunnelling magnetoresistance in Fe3GeTe2/hBN(WSe2)/Fe3GeTe2 magnetic tunnel junctions and report strong variations with bias including polarization reversals.},

  abstract     = {Rare earth (RE) addition to steels to produce RE steels has been widely applied when aiming to improve steel properties. However, RE steels have exhibited extremely variable mechanical performances, which has become a bottleneck in the past few decades for their production, utilization and related study. Here in this work, we discovered that the property variation of RE steels stems from the presence of oxygen-based inclusions. We proposed a dual low-oxygen technology, and keeping low levels of oxygen content in steel melts and particularly in the raw RE materials, which have long been ignored, to achieve impressively stable and favourable RE effects. The fatigue life is greatly improved by only parts-per-million-level RE addition, with a 40-fold improvement for the tension–compression fatigue life and a 40% enhancement of the rolling contact fatigue life. We find that RE appears to act by lowering the carbon diffusion rate and by retarding ferrite nucleation at the austenite grain boundaries. Our study reveals that only under very low-oxygen conditions can RE perform a vital role in purifying, modifying and micro-alloying steels, to improve the performance of RE steels. The variation in the properties of rare earth (RE) steels is shown to stem from the presence of oxygen-based inclusions, and only under very-low-oxygen conditions can RE elements perform a vital role in purifying, modifying and micro-alloying steels.},

  abstract     = {Recycling iron and steel is critical for environmental sustainability and essential to close material loops in circular economics. A major challenge is to produce high-value products and to control impurities like carbon in the face of stringent consumer requirements and volatile markets. Here, we develop an electrorefining process that directly decarburizes molten iron by imposing an electromotive force between it and a slag electrolyte. Upon anodic polarization, oxide anions from the slag discharge directly on carbon dissolved in molten iron, evolving gaseous carbon monoxide. In a striking departure from conventional practice that highly relies on reaction with solubilized oxygen, here electrorefining achieves decarburization by direct interfacial reaction. We demonstrate that this technique produces ultra-low-carbon steels and recovers silicon as a by-product at the cathode, requiring a low energy input and no reagents. We expect this process to be scalable and integrable with secondary steel mills. Application of electromotive force between molten iron–carbon and slag is shown to decarburize iron. Electrorefining decarburizes by direct interfacial electrochemical reaction, resulting in low solubilized oxygen in iron, even at low carbon concentration.},

  abstract     = {Graphene oxide (GO) and reduced GO possess robust mechanical, electrical and chemical properties. Their nanocomposites have been extensively explored for applications in diverse fields. However, due to the high flexibility and weak interlayer interactions of GO nanosheets, the flexural mechanical properties of GO-based composites, especially in bulk materials, are largely constrained, which hinders their performance in practical applications. Here, inspired by the amorphous/crystalline feature of the heterophase within nacreous platelets, we present a centimetre-sized, GO-based bulk material consisting of building blocks of GO and amorphous/crystalline leaf-like MnO2 hexagon nanosheets adhered together with polymer-based crosslinkers. These building blocks are stacked and hot-pressed with further crosslinking between the layers to form a GO/MnO2-based layered (GML) bulk material. The resultant GML bulk material exhibits a flexural strength of 231.2 MPa. Moreover, the material exhibits sufficient fracture toughness and strong impact resistance while being light in weight. Experimental and numerical analyses indicate that the ordered heterophase structure and synergetic crosslinking interactions across multiscale interfaces lead to the superior mechanical properties of the material. These results are expected to provide insights into the design of structural materials and potential applications of high-performance GO-based bulk materials in aerospace, biomedicine and electronics. A nacre-inspired, centimetre-sized bulk material is prepared by assembling graphene oxide and microscale amorphous/crystalline heterophase reinforcing platelets adhered together with polymer-based crosslinkers, which shows high flexural strength and fracture toughness.},

  abstract     = {In materials science, much effort has been devoted to the reproduction of superconductivity in chemical compositions, analogous to cuprate superconductors since their discovery over 30 years ago. This approach was recently successful in realising superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates1–6. Although differing from cuprates in electronic and magnetic properties, strong Coulomb interactions suggest that infinite-layer nickelates have a propensity towards various symmetry-breaking orders that populate cuprates7–10. Here we report the observation of charge density waves (CDWs) in infinite-layer NdNiO2 films using Ni L3 resonant X-ray scattering. Remarkably, CDWs form in Nd 5d and Ni 3d orbitals at the same commensurate wavevector (0.333, 0) reciprocal lattice units, with non-negligible out-of-plane dependence and an in-plane correlation length of up to ~60 Å. Spectroscopic studies reveal a strong connection between CDWs and Nd 5d–Ni 3d orbital hybridization. Upon entering the superconducting state at 20% Sr doping, the CDWs disappear. Our work demonstrates the existence of CDWs in infinite-layer nickelates with a multiorbital character distinct from cuprates, which establishes their low-energy physics. The authors present evidence for the formation of commensurate charge order in non-superconducting thin films of infinite-layer nickelates, whereas they find no charge order in a superconducting film.},

  abstract     = {Room-temperature realization of macroscopic quantum phases is one of the major pursuits in fundamental physics1,2. The quantum spin Hall phase3–6 is a topological quantum phase that features a two-dimensional insulating bulk and a helical edge state. Here we use vector magnetic field and variable temperature based scanning tunnelling microscopy to provide micro-spectroscopic evidence for a room-temperature quantum spin Hall edge state on the surface of the higher-order topological insulator Bi4Br4. We find that the atomically resolved lattice exhibits a large insulating gap of over 200 meV, and an atomically sharp monolayer step edge hosts an in-gap gapless state, suggesting topological bulk–boundary correspondence. An external magnetic field can gap the edge state, consistent with the time-reversal symmetry protection inherent in the underlying band topology. We further identify the geometrical hybridization of such edge states, which not only supports the Z2 topology of the quantum spin Hall state but also visualizes the building blocks of the higher-order topological insulator phase. Our results further encourage the exploration of high-temperature transport quantization of the putative topological phase reported here. We show that an insulating bulk state and helical edge state coexist in Bi4Br4 and that this coexistence persists up to room temperature.},

This ‘negative durotaxis’ does not coincide with changes in canonical mechanosensitive signalling or actomyosin contractility. Instead, as predicted by the motor–clutch-based model, migration occurs towards areas of ‘optimal stiffness’, where cells can generate maximal traction. In agreement with this model, negative durotaxis is selectively disrupted and even reversed by the partial inhibition of actomyosin contractility. Conversely, positive durotaxis can be switched to negative by lowering the optimal stiffness by the downregulation of talin—a key clutch component. Our results identify the molecular mechanism driving context-dependent positive or negative durotaxis, determined by a cell’s contractile and adhesive machinery. Directed cell movement known as durotaxis, typically associated with cellular migration in response to a substrate gradient of increasing stiffness, is now shown to also occur in the opposite direction, following a gradient of decreasing stiffness.},

  abstract     = {Electrostatic dielectric capacitors are essential components in advanced electronic and electrical power systems due to their ultrafast charging/discharging speed and high power density. A major challenge, however, is how to improve their energy densities to effectuate the next-generation applications that demand miniaturization and integration. Here, we report a high-entropy stabilized Bi2Ti2O7-based dielectric film that exhibits an energy density as high as 182 J cm−3 with an efficiency of 78% at an electric field of 6.35 MV cm−1. Our results reveal that regulating the atomic configurational entropy introduces favourable and stable microstructural features, including lattice distorted nano-crystalline grains and a disordered amorphous-like phase, which enhances the breakdown strength and reduces the polarization switching hysteresis, thus synergistically contributing to the energy storage performance. This high-entropy approach is expected to be widely applicable for the development of high-performance dielectrics. Electrostatic capacitors can enable ultrafast energy storage and release, but advances in energy density and efficiency need to be made. Here, by doping equimolar Zr, Hf and Sn into Bi4Ti3O12 thin films, a high-entropy stabilized Bi2Ti2O7 pyrochlore phase forms with an energy density of 182 J cm−3 and 78% efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Solid-state ionic conduction is a key enabler of electrochemical energy storage and conversion. The mechanistic connections between material processing, defect chemistry, transport dynamics and practical performance are of considerable importance but remain incomplete. Here, inspired by studies of fluids and biophysical systems, we re-examine anomalous diffusion in the iconic two-dimensional fast-ion conductors, the β- and β″-aluminas. Using large-scale simulations, we reproduce the frequency dependence of alternating-current ionic conductivity data. We show how the distribution of charge-compensating defects, modulated by processing, drives static and dynamic disorder and leads to persistent subdiffusive ion transport at macroscopic timescales. We deconvolute the effects of repulsions between mobile ions, the attraction between the mobile ions and charge-compensating defects, and geometric crowding on ionic conductivity. Finally, our characterization of memory effects in transport connects atomistic defect chemistry to macroscopic performance with minimal assumptions and enables mechanism-driven ‘atoms-to-device’ optimization of fast-ion conductors. Solid-state ionic conduction is a key enabler of electrochemical energy storage and conversion. A quantitative framework for ionic conduction between atomistic and macroscopic timescales in β- and β″-aluminas is now proposed for ‘atoms-to-device’ multiscale modelling and optimization.},

  abstract     = {Rechargeable batteries paired with sodium metal anodes are considered to be one of the most promising high-energy and low-cost energy-storage systems. However, the use of highly reactive sodium metal and the formation of sodium dendrites during battery operation have caused safety concerns, especially when highly flammable liquid electrolytes are used. Here we design and develop solvent-free solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) based on a perfluoropolyether-terminated polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based block copolymer for safe and stable all-solid-state sodium metal batteries. Compared with traditional PEO SPEs, our results suggest that block copolymer design allows for the formation of self-assembled nanostructures leading to high storage modulus at elevated temperatures with the PEO domains providing transport channels even at high salt concentration (ethylene oxide/sodium = 8/2). Moreover, it is demonstrated that the incorporation of perfluoropolyether segments enhances the Na+ transference number of the electrolyte to 0.46 at 80 °C and enables a stable solid electrolyte interface. The new SPE exhibits highly stable symmetric cell-cycling performance at high current density (0.5 mA cm−2 and 1.0 mAh cm−2, up to 1,000 h). Finally, the assembled all-solid-state sodium metal batteries demonstrate outstanding capacity retention, long-term charge/discharge stability (Coulombic efficiency, 99.91%; &amp;gt;900 cycles with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode) and good capability with high loading NaFePO4 cathode (&amp;gt;1 mAh cm−2). Rechargeable batteries with sodium metal anodes are promising as energy-storage systems despite safety concerns related to reactivity and dendrite formation.

However, the growth of lithium dendrites across the solid-state electrolyte layer leads to the premature shorting of cells and limits their practical viability. Here, using solid-state Li half-cells with metallic interlayers between a garnet-based lithium-ion conductor and lithium, we show that interfacial void growth precedes dendrite nucleation and growth. Specifically, void growth was observed at a current density of around two-thirds of the critical current density for dendrite growth. Computational calculations reveal that interlayer materials with higher critical current densities for dendrite growth also have the largest thermodynamic and kinetic barriers for lithium vacancy accumulation at their interfaces with lithium. Our results suggest that interfacial modification with suitable metallic interlayers decreases the tendency for void growth and improves dendrite growth tolerance in solid-state electrolytes, even in the absence of high stack pressures. The growth of lithium dendrites across electrolyte layers limits the practical viability of solid-state Li-ion batteries. A direct correlation between void formation and lithium dendrite growth in solid-state electrolytes with metallic interlayers is now observed.},

  abstract     = {Formation of epitaxial heterostructures via post-growth self-assembly is important in the design and preparation of functional hybrid systems combining unique properties of the constituents. This is particularly attractive for the construction of metal halide perovskite heterostructures, since their conventional solution synthesis usually leads to non-uniformity in composition, crystal phase and dimensionality. Herein, we demonstrate that a series of two-dimensional and three-dimensional perovskites of different composition and crystal phase can form epitaxial heterostructures through a ligand-assisted welding process at room temperature. Using the CsPbBr3/PEA2PbBr4 heterostructure as a demonstration, in addition to the effective charge and energy transfer across the epitaxial interface, localized lattice strain was observed at the interface, which was extended to the top layer of the two-dimensional perovskite, leading to multiple new sub-bandgap emissions at low temperature. Given the versatility of our strategy, unlimited hybrid systems are anticipated, yielding composition-, interface- and/or orientation-dependent properties. Heterostructures combine the unique properties of each constituent, improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite-based optoelectronic devices, yet the films suffer from poor compositional and structural uniformity.

Here we report the potential of disordered optical metasurfaces to harness visual appearance. We develop a multiscale modelling platform for the predictive rendering of macroscopic objects covered by metasurfaces in realistic settings, and show how nanoscale resonances and mesoscale interferences can be used to spectrally and angularly shape reflected light and thus create unusual visual effects at the macroscale. We validate this property with realistic synthetic images of macroscopic objects and centimetre-scale samples observable with the naked eye. This framework opens new perspectives in many branches of fine and applied visual arts.

The exploitation of low-crystal symmetries in emergent quantum materials offers a unique approach to achieve SOTs with unconventional forms. Here we report an experimental realization of field-free deterministic magnetic switching of a perpendicularly polarized van der Waals magnet employing an out-of-plane antidamping SOT generated in layered WTe2, a quantum material with a low-symmetry crystal structure.

Unlike normal (slip) bonds, catch bonds strengthen under tension. The current paradigm is that this feature provides ‘strength on demand3’, thus enabling cells to increase rigidity under stress1,4–6. However, catch bonds are often weaker than slip bonds because they have cryptic binding sites that are usually buried7,8. Here we show that catch bonds render reconstituted cytoskeletal actin networks stronger than slip bonds, even though the individual bonds are weaker. Simulations show that slip bonds remain trapped in stress-free areas, whereas weak binding allows catch bonds to mitigate crack initiation by moving to high-tension areas. This ‘dissociation on demand’ explains how cells combine mechanical strength with the adaptability required for shape change, and is relevant to diseases where catch bonding is compromised7,9, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis10 caused by the α-actinin-4 mutant studied here. We surmise that catch bonds are the key to create life-like materials. Reconstituted cytoskeleton networks linked with catch bonds display increased mechanical strength and crack resistance than those containing slip bonds, and simultaneously being more deformable, which allows for better adaptability to new mechanical environments.},

So far, most of the diode effects observed in non-centrosymmetric polar/superconducting conductors4–7 and Josephson junctions8–10 require external magnetic fields to break the time-reversal symmetry. Here we report zero-field polarity-switchable Josephson supercurrent diodes, in which a proximity-magnetized Pt layer by ferrimagnetic insulating Y3Fe5O12 serves as the Rashba(-type) Josephson barrier. The zero-field diode efficiency of our proximity-engineered device reaches up to ±35% at 2 K, with a clear square-root dependence on temperature. Measuring in-plane field-strength/angle dependences and comparing with Cu-inserted control junctions, we demonstrate that exchange spin-splitting11–13 and Rashba(-type) spin-orbit coupling13–15 at the Pt/Y3Fe5O12 interface are key for the zero-field giant rectification efficiency. Our achievement advances the development of field-free absolute Josephson diodes. A rectified Josephson supercurrent is realized in lateral junctions using a proximitized ferromagnetic Pt barrier, with important implications for practical magnetic field free-superconducting spintronics.},

  abstract     = {Fast development of space technologies poses a strong challenge for elastic materials, which need to be not only lightweight, strong and compliant, but also able to maintain stable elasticity over a wide temperature range1–4. Here we report a lightweight magnesium–scandium strain glass alloy (Mg with 21.3 at.% Sc) that meets this challenge. This alloy is as light (density ~2 g cm–3) and compliant as organic-based materials5–7 like bones and glass fibre reinforced plastics, but in contrast with those materials, it possesses a nearly temperature-independent (or Elinvar-type), ultralow Young’s modulus (~20–23 GPa) over a wide temperature range from room temperature down to 123 K; a higher yield strength of ~200–270 MPa; and a long fatigue life of over one million cycles. As a result, it exhibits a relatively high, temperature-independent elastic energy density of ~0.5 kJ kg–1 among known materials at a moderate stress level of 200 MPa. We show that its exceptional properties stem from a strain glass transition, and the Elinvar-type elasticity originates from its moderate elastic softening effect cancelling out the ever-present elastic hardening. Our findings provide insight into designing materials that possess unconventional and technologically important elastic properties. Temperature-independent (Elinvar) soft elasticity with high strength, which is technologically desired but scientifically challenging, is achieved in a lightweight strain glass Mg alloy.},

  abstract     = {Precisely timed activation of genetically targeted cells is a powerful tool for the study of neural circuits and control of cell-based therapies. Magnetic control of cell activity, or ‘magnetogenetics’, using magnetic nanoparticle heating of temperature-sensitive ion channels enables remote, non-invasive activation of neurons for deep-tissue applications and freely behaving animal studies. However, the in vivo response time of thermal magnetogenetics is currently tens of seconds, which prevents precise temporal modulation of neural activity. Moreover, magnetogenetics has yet to achieve in vivo multiplexed stimulation of different groups of neurons. Here we produce subsecond behavioural responses in Drosophila melanogaster by combining magnetic nanoparticles with a rate-sensitive thermoreceptor (TRPA1-A). Furthermore, by tuning magnetic nanoparticles to respond to different magnetic field strengths and frequencies, we achieve subsecond, multichannel stimulation. These results bring magnetogenetics closer to the temporal resolution and multiplexed stimulation possible with optogenetics while maintaining the minimal invasiveness and deep-tissue stimulation possible only by magnetic control. Here the authors describe a method for remote magnetothermal stimulation of neurons that achieves subsecond behavioural responses in Drosophila fruit flies by combining magnetic nanoparticles with TRPA1-A, a rate-sensitive thermoreceptor. Tuning the properties of magnetic nanoparticles to respond to different magnetic field strengths and frequencies enables multichannel thermal magnetogenetic stimulation.},

  abstract     = {Myelofibrosis is a progressive bone marrow malignancy associated with monocytosis, and is believed to promote the pathological remodelling of the extracellular matrix. Here we show that the mechanical properties of myelofibrosis, namely the liquid-to-solid properties (viscoelasticity) of the bone marrow, contribute to aberrant differentiation of monocytes. Human monocytes cultured in stiff, elastic hydrogels show proinflammatory polarization and differentiation towards dendritic cells, as opposed to those cultured in a viscoelastic matrix. This mechanically induced cell differentiation is blocked by inhibiting a myeloid-specific isoform of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, PI3K-γ. We further show that murine bone marrow with myelofibrosis has a significantly increased stiffness and unveil a positive correlation between myelofibrosis grading and viscoelasticity. Treatment with a PI3K-γ inhibitor in vivo reduced frequencies of monocyte and dendritic cell populations in murine bone marrow with myelofibrosis. Moreover, transcriptional changes driven by viscoelasticity are consistent with transcriptional profiles of myeloid cells in other human fibrotic diseases. These results demonstrate that a fibrotic bone marrow niche can physically promote a proinflammatory microenvironment. Myelofibrosis causes a pathological remodelling of the bone marrow, which becomes stiffer and more elastic, thus promoting the proliferation of proinflammatory monocytes and their differentiation into dendritic cells.},

  abstract     = {Natural gas, consisting mainly of methane (CH4), has a relatively low energy density at ambient conditions (~36 kJ l−1). Partial oxidation of CH4 to methanol (CH3OH) lifts the energy density to ~17 MJ l−1 and drives the production of numerous chemicals. In nature, this is achieved by methane monooxygenase with di-iron sites, which is extremely challenging to mimic in artificial systems due to the high dissociation energy of the C–H bond in CH4 (439 kJ mol−1) and facile over-oxidation of CH3OH to CO and CO2. Here we report the direct photo-oxidation of CH4 over mono-iron hydroxyl sites immobilized within a metal–organic framework, PMOF-RuFe(OH). Under ambient and flow conditions in the presence of H2O and O2, CH4 is converted to CH3OH with 100% selectivity and a time yield of 8.81 ± 0.34 mmol gcat−1 h−1 (versus 5.05 mmol gcat−1 h−1 for methane monooxygenase). By using operando spectroscopic and modelling techniques, we find that confined mono-iron hydroxyl sites bind CH4 by forming an [Fe–OH···CH4] intermediate, thus lowering the barrier for C–H bond activation. The confinement of mono-iron hydroxyl sites in a porous matrix demonstrates a strategy for C–H bond activation in CH4 to drive the direct photosynthesis of CH3OH. The partial oxidation of CH4 to CH3OH is challenging to perform in artificial systems due to ready over-oxidation to CO and CO2. Here by confining mono-iron hydroxyl sites in a metal–organic framework, photo-oxidation of CH4 to CH3OH is achieved with high selectivity and time yield.},

Herein, we reveal that corner-sharing connectivity of the oxide crystal structure framework promotes superionic conductivity, which we rationalize from the distorted lithium environment and reduced interaction between lithium and non-lithium cations. By performing a high-throughput search for materials with this feature, we discover ten new oxide frameworks predicted to exhibit superionic conductivity—from which we experimentally demonstrate LiGa(SeO3)2 with a bulk ionic conductivity of 0.11 mS cm−1 and an activation energy of 0.17 eV. Our findings provide insight into the factors that govern fast lithium mobility in oxide materials and will accelerate the development of new oxide electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries. Superionic lithium conductivity has only been observed in a few classes of materials, mostly in thiophosphates but rarely in oxides. Corner-sharing connectivity in an oxide crystal structure framework is now shown to promote superionic conductivity.},

  abstract     = {In-memory computing provides an opportunity to meet the growing demands of large data-driven applications such as machine learning, by colocating logic operations and data storage. Despite being regarded as the ultimate solution for high-density integration and low-power manipulation, the use of spin or electric dipole at the single-molecule level to realize in-memory logic functions has yet to be realized at room temperature, due to their random orientation. Here, we demonstrate logic-in-memory operations, based on single electric dipole flipping in a two-terminal single-metallofullerene (Sc2C2@Cs(hept)-C88) device at room temperature. By applying a low voltage of ±0.8 V to the single-metallofullerene junction, we found that the digital information recorded among the different dipole states could be reversibly encoded in situ and stored. As a consequence, 14 types of Boolean logic operation were shown from a single-metallofullerene device. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the non-volatile memory behaviour comes from dipole reorientation of the [Sc2C2] group in the fullerene cage. This proof-of-concept represents a major step towards room-temperature electrically manipulated, low-power, two-terminal in-memory logic devices and a direction for in-memory computing using nanoelectronic devices. Single-molecule electronics provide the potential solution for high-density integration and low-power consumption in massive data-driven applications, but have yet to be explored.

  abstract     = {The energy band structure provides crucial information on charge transport behaviour in organic semiconductors, such as effective mass, transfer integrals and electron–phonon coupling. Despite the discovery of the valence (the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)) band structure in the 1990s, the conduction band (the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)) has not been experimentally observed. Here we employ angle-resolved low-energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy to reveal the LUMO band structure of pentacene, a prototypical high-mobility organic semiconductor. The derived transfer integrals and bandwidths from the LUMO are substantially smaller than those predicted by density functional theory calculations. To reproduce this bandwidth reduction, we propose an improved (partially dressed) polaron model that accounts for the electron–intramolecular vibrational interaction with frequency-dependent coupling constants based on Debye relaxation. This model quantitatively reproduces not only the transfer integrals, but also the temperature-dependent HOMO and LUMO bandwidths, and the hole and electron mobilities. The present results demonstrate that electron mobility in high-mobility organic semiconductors is indeed limited by polaron formation. Knowledge of band structure aids in understanding charge transport behaviour, yet it has proved impossible to measure the conduction (LUMO) band of organic semiconductors, in particular due to sample degradation by the electron beam. To address this, the authors developed and used AR-LEIPS to reveal the LUMO band dispersion of pentacene.},

  abstract     = {Ferroelectric HfO2-based materials hold great potential for the widespread integration of ferroelectricity into modern electronics due to their compatibility with existing Si technology. Earlier work indicated that a nanometre grain size was crucial for the stabilization of the ferroelectric phase. This constraint, associated with a high density of structural defects, obscures an insight into the intrinsic ferroelectricity of HfO2-based materials. Here we demonstrate that stable and enhanced polarization can be achieved in epitaxial HfO2 films with a high degree of structural order (crystallinity). An out-of-plane polarization value of 50 μC cm–2 has been observed at room temperature in Y-doped HfO2(111) epitaxial thin films, with an estimated full value of intrinsic polarization of 64 μC cm–2, which is in close agreement with density functional theory calculations. The crystal structure of films reveals the Pca21 orthorhombic phase with small rhombohedral distortion, underlining the role of the structural constraint in stabilizing the ferroelectric phase. Our results suggest that it could be possible to exploit the intrinsic ferroelectricity of HfO2-based materials, optimizing their performance in device applications. Hafnium dioxide is of technological interest as it is compatible with silicon; however, previous work indicates that a nanometre grain size is required to generate ferroelectricity. Here ferroelectric Y-doped HfO2 thin films with high crystallinity are grown with large crystal grain sizes, indicating that ferroelectricity is intrinsic.},

Here, employing cathodoluminescence, we demonstrate on-demand activation and control of colour centre emission at the twisted interface of two hexagonal boron nitride flakes. Further, we show that colour centre emission brightness can be enhanced by two orders of magnitude by tuning the twist angle. Additionally, by applying an external voltage, nearly 100% brightness modulation is achieved. Our ab initio GW and GW plus Bethe–Salpeter equation calculations suggest that the emission is correlated to nitrogen vacancies and that a twist-induced moiré potential facilitates electron–hole recombination. This mechanism is further exploited to draw nanoscale colour centre patterns using electron beams. Colour centre emission from hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) holds promise for quantum technologies but activation and tuning are challenging.

Although large-scale reconstructions have been identified at small twist angles, they have been treated as being rigid at large twist angles. Here, we report that moiré superlattices made from single layers of MoS2 and WSe2 exhibit a pair of torsional strains with opposite chirality irrespective of the twist angle. The whirlpool-shaped periodic lattice distortions introduce fuzziness in the Raman spectra and universal redshifts to the intralayer excitons for all twist angles. We show that both of these modulations become weaker as the twist angle increases but do not disappear, whereas they are turned off when the constituent layers are not tightly coupled, thus establishing an essential structure–property relationship for moiré superlattices. Recent studies have revealed unexpected characteristics in moiré superlattices formed by stacking two-dimensional crystals.

However, despite multitudes of correlated phases observed in moiré systems, robust superconductivity appears the least common, found only in MATBG and more recently in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene. Here we report the experimental realization of superconducting magic-angle twisted four-layer and five-layer graphene, hence establishing alternating twist magic-angle multilayer graphene as a robust family of moiré superconductors. This finding suggests that the flat bands shared by the members play a central role in the superconductivity. Our measurements in parallel magnetic fields, in particular the investigation of Pauli limit violation and spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking, reveal a clear distinction between the N = 2 and N &amp;gt; 2-layer structures, consistent with the difference between their orbital responses to magnetic fields. Our results expand the emergent family of moiré superconductors, providing new insight with potential implications for design of new superconducting materials platforms. Superconductivity is reported in magic-angle twisted four-layer and five-layer graphene systems. While they find that all magic-angle graphene systems fit into a unified hierarchy of systems that share a set of flat bands in their electronic band structures, they also report that there is a key distinction between magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene and the other family members, related to the difference in the way the electrons move between the layers in a magnetic field.},

  abstract     = {Elastic properties of classical bulk materials can hardly be changed or adjusted in operando, while such tunable elasticity is highly desired for robots and smart machinery. Although possible in reconfigurable metamaterials, continuous tunability in existing designs is plagued by issues such as structural instability, weak robustness, plastic failure and slow response. Here we report a metamaterial design paradigm using gears with encoded stiffness gradients as the constituent elements and organizing gear clusters for versatile functionalities. The design enables continuously tunable elastic properties while preserving stability and robust manoeuvrability, even under a heavy load. Such gear-based metamaterials enable excellent properties such as continuous modulation of Young’s modulus by two orders of magnitude, shape morphing between ultrasoft and solid states, and fast response. This allows for metamaterial customization and brings fully programmable materials and adaptive robots within reach. A design paradigm to create robust robotic metamaterials using versatile gear clusters is demonstrated. It enables intriguing programmability of elastic properties and shape while preserving stability for intelligent machines.},

  abstract     = {Photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices have been developed for direct solar fuel production but the limited stability of submerged light absorbers can hamper their commercial prospects.1,2 Here, we demonstrate photocathodes with an operational H2 evolution activity over weeks, by integrating a BiOI light absorber into a robust, oxide-based architecture with a graphite paste conductive encapsulant. In this case, the activity towards proton and CO2 reduction is mainly limited by catalyst degradation. We also introduce multiple-pixel devices as an innovative design principle for PEC systems, displaying superior photocurrents, onset biases and stability over corresponding conventional single-pixel devices. Accordingly, PEC tandem devices comprising multiple-pixel BiOI photocathodes and BiVO4 photoanodes can sustain bias-free water splitting for 240 h, while devices with a Cu92In8 alloy catalyst demonstrate unassisted syngas production from CO2. Photoelectrochemical devices are used for direct solar fuel production, but the stability of light absorbers can hamper their commercial prospects.

  abstract     = {Solid–liquid–gas reactions are ubiquitous and are encountered in both nature and industrial processes1–4. A comprehensive description of gas transport in liquid and following reactions at the solid–liquid–gas interface, which is substantial in regard to achieving enhanced triple-phase reactions, remains unavailable. Here, we report a real-time observation of the accelerated etching of gold nanorods with oxygen nanobubbles in aqueous hydrobromic acid using liquid-cell transmission electron microscopy. Our observations reveal that when an oxygen nanobubble is close to a nanorod below the critical distance (~1 nm), the local etching rate is significantly enhanced by over one order of magnitude. Molecular dynamics simulation results show that the strong attractive van der Waals interaction between the gold nanorod and oxygen molecules facilitates the transport of oxygen through the thin liquid layer to the gold surface and thus plays a crucial role in increasing the etching rate. This result sheds light on the rational design of solid–liquid–gas reactions for enhanced activities. Real-time imaging of accelerated solid–liquid–gas reactions with nanobubbles uncovers the mechanisms of enhanced triple-phase reactions by identifying the critical distance between solid and gas at the nanoscale.},

However, fulfilling its promise needs more research. Here we provide an overview of this emerging research area, from its birth to the current state, reviewing the main achievements in non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and experiments using atomic force microscopes and surface force apparatus. We also present a discussion of the challenges that need to be solved for future applications of electrotunable friction.

This deciphering has been greatly facilitated by optogenetics and its combination with optoelectronic devices to control neural activity with millisecond temporal resolution and cell type specificity. However, targeting small brain volumes causes photoelectric artefacts, in particular when light emission and recording sites are close to each other. We take advantage of the photonic properties of tapered fibres to develop integrated ‘fibertrodes’ able to optically activate small brain volumes with abated photoelectric noise. Electrodes are positioned very close to light emitting points by non-planar microfabrication, with angled light emission allowing the simultaneous optogenetic manipulation and electrical read-out of one to three neurons, with no photoelectric artefacts, in vivo. The unconventional implementation of two-photon polymerization on the curved taper edge enables the fabrication of recoding sites all around the implant, making fibertrodes a promising complement to planar microimplants. Here the authors fabricate a fibre-coupled electrode ‘fibertrode’ that integrates light emission sites and platinum microelectrodes on tapered optical fibre neural implants, for combined stimulation and recording of neural activity over small brain volumes in vivo with reduced photoelectric artefacts.},

Currently, it is unclear how the electrode and biomaterial interface can be designed to meet the complex requirements for high biophotoelectrochemical performance. Here we developed an aerosol jet printing method for generating hierarchical electrode structures using indium tin oxide nanoparticles. We printed libraries of micropillar array electrodes varying in height and submicrometre surface features, and studied the energy/electron transfer processes across the bio-electrode interfaces. When wired to the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, micropillar array electrodes with microbranches exhibited favourable biocatalyst loading, light utilization and electron flux output, ultimately almost doubling the photocurrent of state-of-the-art porous structures of the same height. When the micropillars’ heights were increased to 600 µm, milestone mediated photocurrent densities of 245 µA cm–2 (the closest thus far to theoretical predictions) and external quantum efficiencies of up to 29% could be reached. This study demonstrates how bio-energy from photosynthesis could be more efficiently harnessed in the future and provide new tools for three-dimensional electrode design. Wiring photosynthetic biomachineries to electrodes is promising for sustainable bio-electricity and fuel generation, but designing such interfaces is challenging. Aerosol jet printing is now used to generate hierarchical pillar array electrodes using indium tin oxide nanoparticles for high-performance semi-artificial photosynthesis.},

  abstract     = {The hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) is a promising energy conversion technology but is limited by the need for platinum group metal (PGM) electrocatalysts, especially for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). Here we report a Ni-based HOR catalyst that exhibits an electrochemical surface area-normalized exchange current density of 70 μA cm–2, the highest among PGM-free catalysts. The catalyst comprises Ni nanoparticles embedded in a nitrogen-doped carbon support. According to X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy as well as H2 chemisorption data, the electronic interaction between the Ni nanoparticles and the support leads to balanced hydrogen and hydroxide binding energies, which are the likely origin of the catalyst’s high activity. PGM-free HEMFCs employing this Ni-based HOR catalyst give a peak power density of 488 mW cm–2, up to 6.4 times higher than previous best-performing analogous HEMFCs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of efficient PGM-free HEMFCs. Hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cells are promising as an energy conversion technology, but require platinum group metal electrocatalysts for their application. A Ni-based hydrogen oxidation reaction catalyst is now shown to exhibit unprecedented electrochemical performance.},

  abstract     = {Intercalation-type metal oxides are promising negative electrode materials for safe rechargeable lithium-ion batteries due to the reduced risk of Li plating at low voltages. Nevertheless, their lower energy and power density along with cycling instability remain bottlenecks for their implementation, especially for fast-charging applications. Here, we report a nanostructured rock-salt Nb2O5 electrode formed through an amorphous-to-crystalline transformation during repeated electrochemical cycling with Li+. This electrode can reversibly cycle three lithiums per Nb2O5, corresponding to a capacity of 269 mAh g−1 at 20 mA g−1, and retains a capacity of 191 mAh g−1 at a high rate of 1 A g−1. It exhibits superb cycling stability with a capacity of 225 mAh g−1 at 200 mA g−1 for 400 cycles, and a Coulombic efficiency of 99.93%. We attribute the enhanced performance to the cubic rock-salt framework, which promotes low-energy migration paths. Our work suggests that inducing crystallization of amorphous nanomaterials through electrochemical cycling is a promising avenue for creating unconventional high-performance metal oxide electrode materials. Intercalation-type metal oxides are promising anodes for Li-ion batteries but suffer from low energy and power density together with cycling instability. A nanostructured rock-salt Nb2O5 formed via amorphous-to-crystalline transformation during cycling with Li+ is shown to exhibit enhanced performance.},

  abstract     = {Grain refinement is a widely sought-after feature of many metal production processes and frequently involves a process of recrystallization. Some processing methods use very high strain rates and high strains to refine the grain structure into the nanocrystalline regime. However, grain refinement processes are not clear in these extreme conditions, which are hard to study systematically. Here, we access those extreme conditions of strain and strain rate using single copper microparticle impact events with a laser-induced particle impact tester. Using a combined dictionary-indexing electron backscatter diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy approach for postmortem characterization of impact sites, we systematically explore increasing strain levels and observe a recrystallization process that is facilitated by nanotwinning, which we term nanotwinning-assisted dynamic recrystallization. It achieves much finer grain sizes than established modes of recrystallization and therefore provides a pathway to the finest nanocrystalline grain sizes through extreme straining processes. Extreme mechanical deformation processes can lead to nanograins in many metals, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Nanotwinning-assisted dynamic recrystallization is shown to facilitate grain refinement to the nanoscale at high strains and strain rates.},

  abstract     = {Single crystals of BaTiO3 exhibit small switching fields and energies, but thin-film performance is considerably worse, thus precluding their use in next-generation devices. Here, we demonstrate high-quality BaTiO3 thin films with nearly bulk-like properties. Thickness scaling provides access to the coercive voltages (&amp;lt;100 mV) and fields (&amp;lt;10 kV cm−1) required for future applications and results in a switching energy of &amp;lt;2 J cm−3 (corresponding to &amp;lt;2 aJ per bit in a 10 × 10 × 10 nm3 device). While reduction in film thickness reduces coercive voltage, it does so at the expense of remanent polarization. Depolarization fields impact polar state stability in thicker films but fortunately suppress the coercive field, thus driving a deviation from Janovec–Kay–Dunn scaling and enabling a constant coercive field for films &amp;lt;150 nm in thickness. Switching studies reveal fast speeds (switching times of ~2 ns for 25-nm-thick films with 5-µm-diameter capacitors) and a pathway to subnanosecond switching. Finally, integration of BaTiO3 thin films onto silicon substrates is shown. We also discuss what remains to be demonstrated to enable the use of these materials for next-generation devices. Thin films of BaTiO3 do not possess the same small switching fields and energies as the single-crystal form, hindering applications. Here, thin films are synthesized that enable switching for voltages &amp;lt;100 mV and fields &amp;lt;10 kV cm–1, and a pathway to subnanosecond switching is presented.},

In low-dimensional materials, quantum confinement affects the electronic, and subsequently, optical properties for these correlated states. Here, by combining photoluminescence, optical reflection measurements and ab initio theoretical calculations, we demonstrate an unconventional excitonic state and its bound phonon sideband in layered silicon diphosphide (SiP2), where the bound electron–hole pair is composed of electrons confined within one-dimensional phosphorus–phosphorus chains and holes extended in two-dimensional SiP2 layers. The excitonic state and emergent phonon sideband show linear dichroism and large energy redshifts with increasing temperature. Our ab initio many-body calculations confirm that the observed phonon sideband results from the correlated interaction between excitons and optical phonons. With these results, we propose layered SiP2 as a platform for the study of excitonic physics and many-particle effects. Distinct electronic and optical properties emerge from quantum confinement in low-dimensional materials.

The giant dimension of these excitons results in excitonic interaction enhancements of orders of magnitude. Rydberg exciton–polaritons, formed by the strong coupling of Rydberg excitons to cavity photons, are a promising route to exploit these interactions and achieve a scalable, strongly correlated solid-state platform. However, the strong coupling of these excitons to cavity photons has remained elusive. Here, by embedding a thin Cu2O crystal into a Fabry–Pérot microcavity, we achieve strong coupling of light to Cu2O Rydberg excitons up to n = 6 and demonstrate the formation of Cu2O Rydberg exciton–polaritons. These results pave the way towards realizing strongly interacting exciton–polaritons and exploring strongly correlated phases of matter using light on a chip. Cu2O is a promising platform to host Rydberg exciton–polaritons, where excitons strongly couple to cavity photons, however their realization has been elusive.

However, a room-temperature polaritonic platform on par with the GaAs quantum wells grown by molecular beam epitaxy at low temperatures remains elusive. The operation of such a platform calls for long-lifetime, strongly interacting excitons in a stringent material system with large yet nanoscale-thin geometry and homogeneous properties. Here, we address this challenge by adopting a method based on the solution synthesis of excitonic halide perovskites grown under nanoconfinement. Such nanoconfinement growth facilitates the synthesis of smooth and homogeneous single-crystalline large crystals enabling the demonstration of XY Hamiltonian lattices with sizes up to 10 × 10. With this demonstration, we further establish perovskites as a promising platform for room temperature polaritonic physics and pave the way for the realization of robust mode-disorder-free polaritonic devices at room temperature. The realization of large-scale exciton–polariton platforms operating at room temperature and exhibiting long-lived, strongly interacting excitons has been elusive.

A long-standing challenge has been to realize materials that integrate and connect these two distinct properties. Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer a platform to realize this concept, but known 2D magnetic semiconductors are electrically insulating in their magnetic phase. Here we demonstrate tunable electron transport within the magnetic phase of the 2D semiconductor CrSBr and reveal strong coupling between its magnetic order and charge transport. This provides an opportunity to characterize the layer-dependent magnetic order of CrSBr down to the monolayer via magnetotransport. Exploiting the sensitivity of magnetoresistance to magnetic order, we uncover a second regime characterized by coupling between charge carriers and magnetic defects. The magnetoresistance within this regime can be dynamically and reversibly tuned by varying the carrier concentration using an electrostatic gate, providing a mechanism for controlling charge transport in 2D magnets. A ferromagnetic transition in CrSBr is attributed to ordering of magnetic defects, and can be electrostatically manipulated.},

For example, electron–electron interactions in one-dimensional electron systems have been predicted to induce Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid behaviour. Naturally occurring grain boundaries in single-layer transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit one-dimensional conducting channels that have been proposed to host Tomonaga–Luttinger liquids, but charge density wave physics has also been suggested to explain their behaviour. Clear identification of the electronic ground state of this system has been hampered by an inability to electrostatically gate such boundaries and tune their charge carrier concentration. Here we present a scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy study of gate-tunable mirror twin boundaries in single-layer 1H-MoSe2 devices. Gating enables scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy for different mirror twin boundary electron densities, thus allowing precise characterization of electron–electron interaction effects. Visualization of the resulting mirror twin boundary electronic structure allows unambiguous identification of collective density wave excitations having two velocities, in quantitative agreement with the spin–charge separation predicted by finite-length Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid theory.

Here we demonstrate the wafer-scale synthesis of adlayer-free ultra-flat single-crystal monolayer graphene on sapphire substrates. We converted polycrystalline Cu foil placed on Al2O3(0001) into single-crystal Cu(111) film via annealing, and then achieved epitaxial growth of graphene at the interface between Cu(111) and Al2O3(0001) by multi-cycle plasma etching-assisted–chemical vapour deposition. Immersion in liquid nitrogen followed by rapid heating causes the Cu(111) film to bulge and peel off easily, while the graphene film remains on the sapphire substrate without degradation. Field-effect transistors fabricated on as-grown graphene exhibited good electronic transport properties with high carrier mobilities. This work breaks a bottleneck of synthesizing wafer-scale single-crystal monolayer graphene on insulating substrates and could contribute to next-generation graphene-based nanodevices. High-quality wafer-scale single-crystal monolayer graphene is achieved on sapphire substrate, by epitaxially growing graphene at the Cu(111)/sapphire interface and then detaching Cu film via immersion in liquid nitrogen and rapid heating.},

  abstract     = {Activation of the innate immune STimulator of INterferon Genes (STING) pathway potentiates antitumour immunity, but systemic delivery of STING agonists to tumours is challenging. We conjugated STING-activating cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) to PEGylated lipids (CDN-PEG-lipids; PEG, polyethylene glycol) via a cleavable linker and incorporated them into lipid nanodiscs (LNDs), which are discoid nanoparticles formed by self-assembly. Compared to state-of-the-art liposomes, intravenously administered LNDs carrying CDN-PEG-lipid (LND-CDNs) exhibited more efficient penetration of tumours, exposing the majority of tumour cells to STING agonist. A single dose of LND-CDNs induced rejection of established tumours, coincident with immune memory against tumour rechallenge. Although CDNs were not directly tumoricidal, LND-CDN uptake by cancer cells correlated with robust T-cell activation by promoting CDN and tumour antigen co-localization in dendritic cells. LNDs thus appear promising as a vehicle for robust delivery of compounds throughout solid tumours, which can be exploited for enhanced immunotherapy. Here the authors investigate lipid nanodiscs as drug carriers for antitumour immunotherapy. They demonstrate that flexible lipid nanodiscs functionalized with STING-activating cyclic dinucleotides exhibit superior tumour penetration and tumour cell uptake compared with spherical liposomes, resulting in improved antitumour T-cell priming and tumour regression.},

The use of hierarchical motor assemblies, as realized in sarcomeres, has so far been complicated by the challenges of arranging sufficiently high numbers of motor proteins with nanoscopic precision. Here, we describe an alternative approach based on actomyosin cortex-like force production, allowing low complexity motor arrangements in a contractile meshwork that can be coated onto soft objects and locally activated by ATP. The design is reminiscent of a motorized exoskeleton actuating protein-based robotic structures from the outside. It readily supports the connection and assembly of micro-three-dimensional printed modules into larger structures, thereby scaling up mechanical work. We provide an analytical model of force production in these systems and demonstrate the design flexibility by three-dimensional printed units performing complex mechanical tasks, such as microhands and microarms that can grasp and wave following light activation. Three-dimensional printed protein-based robotic structures are actuated by exoskeleton-like coats of molecular motor assemblies upon the spatially targeted release of chemical fuel, resulting in micrometre-scale shape-morphing activity.},

  abstract     = {Carbon has emerged as a unique material in nanofluidics, with reports of fast water transport, molecular ion separation and efficient osmotic energy conversion. Many of these phenomena still await proper rationalization due to the lack of fundamental understanding of nanoscale ionic transport, which can only be achieved in controlled environments. Here we develop the fabrication of ‘activated’ two-dimensional carbon nanochannels. Compared with nanoconduits with ‘pristine’ graphite walls, this enables the investigation of nanoscale ionic transport in great detail. We show that activated carbon nanochannels outperform pristine channels by orders of magnitude in terms of surface electrification, ionic conductance, streaming current and (epi-)osmotic currents. A detailed theoretical framework enables us to attribute the enhanced ionic transport across activated carbon nanochannels to an optimal combination of high surface charge and low friction. Furthermore, this demonstrates the unique potential of activated carbon for energy harvesting from salinity gradients with single-pore power density across activated carbon nanochannels, reaching hundreds of kilowatts per square metre, surpassing alternative nanomaterials. Slit-like nanochannels of pristine graphite and activated carbon, fabricated by van der Waals assembly of pristine or sculpted graphite crystals, enable comprehensive ionic response measurements and the systematic realization of their ion transport properties. These are attributed to optimal combinations of (mobile) surface charge and slippage effects at the channel wall surface in both pristine and activated nanochannels.},

  abstract     = {In principle, porous physisorbents are attractive candidates for the removal of volatile organic compounds such as benzene by virtue of their low energy for the capture and release of this pollutant. Unfortunately, many physisorbents exhibit weak sorbate–sorbent interactions, resulting in poor selectivity and low uptake when volatile organic compounds are present at trace concentrations. Herein, we report that a family of double-walled metal–dipyrazolate frameworks, BUT-53 to BUT-58, exhibit benzene uptakes at 298 K of 2.47–3.28 mmol g−1 at &amp;lt;10 Pa. Breakthrough experiments revealed that BUT-55, a supramolecular isomer of the metal–organic framework Co(BDP) (H2BDP = 1,4-di(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)benzene), captures trace levels of benzene, producing an air stream with benzene content below acceptable limits. Furthermore, BUT-55 can be regenerated with mild heating. Insight into the performance of BUT-55 comes from the crystal structure of the benzene-loaded phase (C6H6@BUT-55) and density functional theory calculations, which reveal that C–H···X interactions drive the tight binding of benzene. Our results demonstrate that BUT-55 is a recyclable physisorbent that exhibits high affinity and adsorption capacity towards benzene, making it a candidate for environmental remediation of benzene-contaminated gas mixtures. Volatile organic compounds such as benzene are toxic pollutants that cause health issues even at trace concentrations. Here, a double-walled metal–organic framework is presented that demonstrates high uptake at very low pressures (&amp;lt;10 Pa), allowing the removal of benzene to below acceptable indoor limits.},

Dozens of single-atom catalysts have been developed, and they exhibit notable catalytic activity and selectivity that are not achievable on metal surfaces. Although promising, there is limited knowledge about the boundaries for the monometallic single-atom phase space, not to mention multimetallic phase spaces. Here, single-atom catalysts based on 37 monometallic elements are synthesized using a dissolution-and-carbonization method, characterized and analysed to build the largest reported library of single-atom catalysts. In conjunction with in situ studies, we uncover unified principles on the oxidation state, coordination number, bond length, coordination element and metal loading of single atoms to guide the design of single-atom catalysts with atomically dispersed atoms anchored on N-doped carbon. We utilize the library to open up complex multimetallic phase spaces for single-atom catalysts and demonstrate that there is no fundamental limit on using single-atom anchor sites as structural units to assemble concentration-complex single-atom catalyst materials with up to 12 different elements. Our work offers a single-atom library spanning from monometallic to concentration-complex multimetallic materials for the rational design of single-atom catalysts. Single-atom catalysts demonstrate enhanced catalytic properties, but most systems only explore combinations of a few different metals. Here, a library of 37 different elements is investigated, and it is shown that loading 12 metallic atoms in one system presents improved electrochemical activity.},

Combining the great tunability of enzymatic systems with known oxide-based catalysts can create breakthrough opportunities to achieve both high activity and stability. Here we report a series of metal hydroxide–organic frameworks (MHOFs) synthesized by transforming layered hydroxides into two-dimensional sheets crosslinked using aromatic carboxylate linkers. MHOFs act as a tunable catalytic platform for the oxygen evolution reaction, where the π–π interactions between adjacent stacked linkers dictate stability, while the nature of transition metals in the hydroxides modulates catalytic activity. Substituting Ni-based MHOFs with acidic cations or electron-withdrawing linkers enhances oxygen evolution reaction activity by over three orders of magnitude per metal site, with Fe substitution achieving a mass activity of 80 A  $${\rm{g}}_{\rm{catalyst}}^{-1}$$ at 0.3 V overpotential for 20 h. Density functional theory calculations correlate the enhanced oxygen evolution reaction activity with the MHOF-based modulation of Ni redox and the optimized binding of oxygenated intermediates. The oxygen evolution reaction is central to making chemicals and energy carriers using electrons. Metal hydroxide–organic frameworks are shown to act as a tunable catalytic platform for oxygen evolution, with π–π interactions dictating stability and transition metals modulating activity.},

  abstract     = {Lattice oxygen redox offers an unexplored way to access superior electrochemical properties of transition metal oxides (TMOs) for rechargeable batteries. However, the reaction is often accompanied by unfavourable structural transformations and persistent electrochemical degradation, thereby precluding the practical application of this strategy. Here we explore the close interplay between the local structural change and oxygen electrochemistry during short- and long-term battery operation for layered TMOs. The substantially distinct evolution of the oxygen-redox activity and reversibility are demonstrated to stem from the different cation-migration mechanisms during the dynamic de/intercalation process. We show that the π stabilization on the oxygen oxidation initially aids in the reversibility of the oxygen redox and is predominant in the absence of cation migrations; however, the π-interacting oxygen is gradually replaced by σ-interacting oxygen that triggers the formation of O–O dimers and structural destabilization as cycling progresses. More importantly, it is revealed that the distinct cation-migration paths available in the layered TMOs govern the conversion kinetics from π to σ interactions. These findings constitute a step forward in unravelling the correlation between the local structural evolution and the reversibility of oxygen electrochemistry and provide guidance for further development of oxygen-redox layered electrode materials. Transition metal oxide electrodes are promising for rechargeable batteries but are subject to suffer from structural transformations and electrochemical degradation. The evolution of oxygen-redox activity and reversibility in layered electrodes are shown to arise from cation-migration mechanisms during de/intercalation.},

  abstract     = {In organic photovoltaics, morphological control of donor and acceptor domains on the nanoscale is the key for enabling efficient exciton diffusion and dissociation, carrier transport and suppression of recombination losses. To realize this, here, we demonstrated a double-fibril network based on a ternary donor–acceptor morphology with multi-length scales constructed by combining ancillary conjugated polymer crystallizers and a non-fullerene acceptor filament assembly. Using this approach, we achieved an average power conversion efficiency of 19.3% (certified 19.2%). The success lies in the good match between the photoelectric parameters and the morphological characteristic lengths, which utilizes the excitons and free charges efficiently. This strategy leads to an enhanced exciton diffusion length and a reduced recombination rate, hence minimizing photon-to-electron losses in the ternary devices as compared to their binary counterparts. The double-fibril network morphology strategy minimizes losses and maximizes the power output, offering the possibility of 20% power conversion efficiencies in single-junction organic photovoltaics. The morphology of donor–acceptor blends in organic photovoltaics dictates the efficiency of the exciton dissociation and charge diffusion, and thus the final device performance. Here, the authors show that filament assembly helps to maximize the output, further enabling a power conversion efficiency greater than 19%.},

  abstract     = {Homo- and heterojunctions play essential roles in semiconductor-based devices such as field-effect transistors, solar cells, photodetectors and light-emitting diodes. Semiconductor junctions have been recently used to optically trigger biological modulation via photovoltaic or photoelectrochemical mechanisms. The creation of heterojunctions typically involves materials with different doping or composition, which leads to high cost, complex fabrications and potential side effects at biointerfaces. Here we show that a porosity-based heterojunction, a largely overlooked system in materials science, can yield an efficient photoelectrochemical response from the semiconductor surface. Using self-limiting stain etching, we create a nanoporous/non-porous, soft–hard heterojunction in p-type silicon within seconds under ambient conditions. Upon surface oxidation, the heterojunction yields a strong photoelectrochemical response in saline. Without any interconnects or metal modifications, the heterojunction enables efficient non-genetic optoelectronic stimulation of isolated rat hearts ex vivo and sciatic nerves in vivo with optical power comparable to optogenetics, and with near-infrared capabilities. Fabrication of semiconductor heterojunctions typically involves a complex process and often leads to bioincompatibility. Here, the authors propose a porous heterojunction in p-type silicon via simple stain etching at ambient conditions, and apply it in optically induced biomodulation.},

  abstract     = {Ferrimagnetic alloys are model systems for understanding the ultrafast magnetization switching in materials with antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices. Here we investigate the dynamics of the rare-earth and transition-metal sublattices in ferrimagnetic GdFeCo and TbCo dots excited by spin–orbit torques with combined temporal, spatial and elemental resolution. We observe distinct switching regimes in which the magnetizations of the two sublattices either remain synchronized throughout the reversal process or switch following different trajectories in time and space. In the latter case, we observe a transient ferromagnetic state that lasts up to 2 ns. The asynchronous switching of the two magnetizations is ascribed to the master–agent dynamics induced by the spin–orbit torques on the transition-metal and rare-earth sublattices and their weak antiferromagnetic coupling, which depends sensitively on the alloy microstructure. Larger antiferromagnetic exchange leads to faster switching and shorter recovery of the magnetization after a current pulse. Our findings provide insight into the dynamics of ferrimagnets and the design of spintronic devices with fast and uniform switching. Asynchronous sublattice magnetization switching is found in a ferrimagnetic material and understood by considering the exchange coupling and alloy microstructure.},

  abstract     = {Topological theories have established a unique set of rules that govern the transport properties in a wide variety of wave-mechanical settings. In a marked departure from the established approaches that induce Floquet topological phases by specifically tailored discrete coupling protocols or helical lattice motions, we introduce a class of bimorphic Floquet topological insulators that leverage connective chains with periodically modulated on-site potentials to reveal rich topological features in the system. In exploring a ‘chain-driven’ generalization of the archetypical Floquet honeycomb lattice, we identify a rich phase structure that can host multiple non-trivial topological phases associated simultaneously with both Chern-type and anomalous chiral states. Experiments carried out in photonic waveguide lattices reveal a strongly confined helical edge state that, owing to its origin in bulk flat bands, can be set into motion in a topologically protected fashion, or halted at will, without compromising its adherence to individual lattice sites. Departing from common approaches to designing Floquet topological insulators, here the authors present a photonic realization of Floquet topological insulators revealing topological phases that simultaneously support Chern and anomalous topological states.},

  abstract     = {(Ba,K)BiO3 constitute an interesting class of superconductors, where the remarkably high superconducting transition temperature Tc of 30 K arises in proximity to charge density wave order. However, the precise mechanism behind these phases remains unclear. Here, enabled by high-pressure synthesis, we report superconductivity in (Ba,K)SbO3 with a positive oxygen–metal charge transfer energy in contrast to (Ba,K)BiO3. The parent compound BaSbO3−δ shows a larger charge density wave gap compared to BaBiO3. As the charge density wave order is suppressed via potassium substitution up to 65%, superconductivity emerges, rising up to Tc = 15 K. This value is lower than the maximum Tc of (Ba,K)BiO3, but higher by more than a factor of two at comparable potassium concentrations. The discovery of an enhanced charge density wave gap and superconductivity in (Ba,K)SbO3 indicates that strong oxygen–metal covalency may be more essential than the sign of the charge transfer energy in the main-group perovskite superconductors. High-pressure synthesis is used to stabilize superconducting (Ba,K)SbO3, whose properties provide a fresh perspective on the origin of superconductivity in these types of materials.},

  abstract     = {Atomic reconstruction has been widely observed in two-dimensional van der Waals structures with small twist angles1–7. This unusual behaviour leads to many novel phenomena, including strong electronic correlation, spontaneous ferromagnetism and topologically protected states1,5,8–14. Nevertheless, atomic reconstruction typically occurs spontaneously, exhibiting only one single stable state. Using conductive atomic force microscopy, here we show that, for small-angle twisted monolayer–multilayer graphene, there exist two metastable reconstruction states with distinct stacking orders and strain soliton structures. More importantly, we demonstrate that these two reconstruction states can be reversibly switched, and the switching can propagate spontaneously in an unusual domino-like fashion. Assisted by lattice-resolved conductive atomic force microscopy imaging and atomistic simulations, the detailed structure of the strain soliton networks has been identified and the associated propagation mechanism is attributed to the strong mechanical coupling among solitons. The fine structure of the bistable states is critical for understanding the unique properties of van der Waals structures with tiny twists, and the switching mechanism offers a viable means for manipulating their stacking states. The interface stacking order of twisted graphene can be actively flipped between locally stable states using a mechanical impulse, and this flipping propagates spontaneously through the network in a domino-like fashion.},

  abstract     = {Optical nanoparticles are promising diagnostic tools; however, their shallow optical imaging depth and slow clearance from the body have impeded their use for in vivo disease detection. To address these limitations, we develop activatable polyfluorophore nanosensors with biomarker-triggered nanoparticle-to-molecule pharmacokinetic conversion and near-infrared fluorogenic turn-on response. Activatable polyfluorophore nanosensors can accumulate at the disease site and react with disease-associated proteases to undergo in situ enzyme-catalysed depolymerization. This disease-specific interaction liberates renal-clearable fluorogenic fragments from activatable polyfluorophore nanosensors for non-invasive longitudinal urinalysis and outperforms the gold standard blood and urine assays, providing a level of sensitivity and specificity comparable to those of invasive biopsy and flow cytometry analysis. In rodent models, activatable polyfluorophore nanosensors enable ultrasensitive detection of tumours (1.6 mm diameter) and early diagnosis of acute liver allograft rejection. We anticipate that our modular nanosensor platform may be applied for early diagnosis of a range of diseases via a simple urine test. Early cancer detection typically involves invasive biopsies. Here the authors designed nanosensors that are depolymerized by disease-associated enzymes in vivo to produce fluorescent urinary signals for non-invasive early diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Tissues acquire function and shape via differentiation and morphogenesis. Both processes are driven by coordinating cellular forces and shapes at the tissue scale, but general principles governing this interplay remain to be discovered. Here we report that self-organization of myoblasts around integer topological defects, namely spirals and asters, suffices to establish complex multicellular architectures. In particular, these arrangements can trigger localized cell differentiation or, alternatively, when differentiation is inhibited, they can drive the growth of swirling protrusions. Both localized differentiation and growth of cellular vortices require specific stress patterns. By analysing the experimental velocity and orientational fields through active gel theory, we show that integer topological defects can generate force gradients that concentrate compressive stresses. We reveal these gradients by assessing spatial changes in nuclear volume and deformations of elastic pillars. We propose integer topological defects as mechanical organizing centres controlling differentiation and morphogenesis. Integer topological defects promote cellular self-organization, leading to the formation of complex cellular assemblies that trigger cell differentiation and the formation of swirling cellular pillars once differentiation is inhibited. These findings suggest that integer topological defects are important modulators of cellular differentiation and tissue morphogenesis.},

  abstract     = {Colloidal crystal engineering of complex, low-symmetry architectures is challenging when isotropic building blocks are assembled. Here we describe an approach to generating such structures based upon programmable atom equivalents (nanoparticles functionalized with many DNA strands) and mobile electron equivalents (small particles functionalized with a low number of DNA strands complementary to the programmable atom equivalents). Under appropriate conditions, the spatial distribution of the electron equivalents breaks the symmetry of isotropic programmable atom equivalents, akin to the anisotropic distribution of valence electrons or coordination sites around a metal atom, leading to a set of well-defined coordination geometries and access to three new low-symmetry crystalline phases. All three phases represent the first examples of colloidal crystals, with two of them having elemental analogues (body-centred tetragonal and high-pressure gallium), while the third (triple double-gyroid structure) has no known natural equivalent. This approach enables the creation of complex, low-symmetry colloidal crystals that might find use in various technologies. Symmetry breaking in colloidal crystals is achieved with DNA-grafted programmable atom equivalents and complementary electron equivalents, whose interactions are tuned to create anisotropic crystalline precursors with well-defined coordination geometries that assemble into distinct low-symmetry crystals.},

  abstract     = {Metal–zeolite composites with metal (oxide) and acid sites are promising catalysts for integrating multiple reactions in tandem to produce a wide variety of wanted products without separating or purifying the intermediates. However, the conventional design of such materials often leads to uncontrolled and non-ideal spatial distributions of the metal inside/on the zeolites, limiting their catalytic performance. Here we demonstrate a simple strategy for synthesizing double-shelled, contiguous metal oxide@zeolite hollow spheres (denoted as MO@ZEO DSHSs) with controllable structural parameters and chemical compositions. This involves the self-assembly of zeolite nanocrystals onto the surface of metal ion-containing carbon spheres followed by calcination and zeolite growth steps. The step-by-step formation mechanism of the material is revealed using mainly in situ Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction and ex situ electron microscopy. We demonstrate that it is due to this structure that an Fe2O3@H-ZSM-5 DSHSs-showcase catalyst exhibits superior performance compared with various conventionally structured Fe2O3-H-ZSM-5 catalysts in gasoline production by the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. This work is expected to advance the rational synthesis and research of hierarchically hollow, core–shell, multifunctional catalyst materials. Metal oxide–zeolite bifunctional catalysts allow coupling of reactions and so enhance catalytic processes, but structure and reactivity control is difficult. Here, a general synthesis is presented for metal oxide–zeolite double-shelled hollow spheres, which outperform other catalysts for petroleum production.},

Anion exchange membrane fuel cells and anion exchange membrane water electrolysers rely on the membrane to transport OH− ions between the cathode and anode in a process that involves cooperative interactions with H2O molecules and polymer dynamics. Understanding and controlling the interactions between the relaxation and diffusional processes pose a main scientific and critical membrane design challenge. Here quasi-elastic neutron scattering is applied over a wide range of timescales (100–103 ps) to disentangle the water, polymer relaxation and OH− diffusional dynamics in commercially available anion exchange membranes (Fumatech FAD-55) designed for selective anion transport across different technology platforms, using the concept of serial decoupling of relaxation and diffusional processes to analyse the data. Preliminary data are also reported for a laboratory-prepared anion exchange membrane especially designed for fuel cell applications.

  abstract     = {Constitutive laws underlie most physical processes in nature. However, learning such equations in heterogeneous solids (for example, due to phase separation) is challenging. One such relationship is between composition and eigenstrain, which governs the chemo-mechanical expansion in solids. Here we developed a generalizable, physically constrained image-learning framework to algorithmically learn the chemo-mechanical constitutive law at the nanoscale from correlative four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray spectro-ptychography images. We demonstrated this approach on LiXFePO4, a technologically relevant battery positive electrode material. We uncovered the functional form of the composition–eigenstrain relation in this two-phase binary solid across the entire composition range (0 ≤ X ≤ 1), including inside the thermodynamically unstable miscibility gap. The learned relation directly validates Vegard’s law of linear response at the nanoscale. Our physics-constrained data-driven approach directly visualizes the residual strain field (by removing the compositional and coherency strain), which is otherwise impossible to quantify. Heterogeneities in the residual strain arise from misfit dislocations and were independently verified by X-ray diffraction line profile analysis. Our work provides the means to simultaneously quantify chemical expansion, coherency strain and dislocations in battery electrodes, which has implications on rate capabilities and lifetime. Broadly, this work also highlights the potential of integrating correlative microscopy and image learning for extracting material properties and physics. Constitutive laws underlie most physical processes, but understanding chemo-mechanical expansion in heterogeneous solids is challenging. A physically constrained image-learning approach is now proposed to obtain fundamental insight into dislocations inside battery electrodes.},

We compose Fourier-synthesized harmonic waves to create soft acoustic lattices and colloidal crystals without using surface treatment or modifying their material properties. We have achieved active control of the lattice constant to dynamically modulate the interparticle distance in a high-throughput (&amp;gt;100 pairs), precise, selective and reversible manner. Furthermore, we apply this HANDS platform to quantify the intercellular adhesion forces among various cancer cell lines. Our biocompatible HANDS platform provides a highly versatile particle manipulation method that can handle soft matter and measure the interaction forces between living cells with high sensitivity. Precise manipulation of colloids and cells is desired for material and life sciences. However, such control remains challenging without material modifications.

Thus, understanding exciton dynamics is essential towards developing and optimizing QD devices. Here, using transient absorption microscopy, we reveal the initial exciton dynamics in QDs with femtosecond timescales. We observe high exciton diffusivity (~102 cm2 s–1) in lead chalcogenide QDs within the first few hundred femtoseconds after photoexcitation followed by a transition to a slower regime (~10–1–1 cm2 s–1). QD solids with larger interdot distances exhibit higher initial diffusivity and a delayed transition to the slower regime, while higher QD packing density and heterogeneity accelerate this transition. The fast transport regime occurs only in materials with exciton Bohr radii much larger than the QD sizes, suggesting the transport of delocalized excitons in this regime and a transition to slower transport governed by exciton localization. These findings suggest routes to control the optoelectronic properties of QD solids. Understanding exciton dynamics in quantum dots is important for realizing their potential in optoelectronics. Here, the authors use femtosecond transient absorption microscopy to reveal ultrafast exciton transport, enhanced at larger interdot distance and taking place within hundreds of femtoseconds after generation.},

Here, we demonstrate the all-electrical generation, manipulation and detection of spin polarization in chiral single-crystalline tellurium nanowires. By recording a large (up to 7%) and chirality-dependent unidirectional magnetoresistance, we show that the orientation of the electrically generated spin polarization is determined by the nanowire handedness and uniquely follows the current direction, while its magnitude can be manipulated by an electrostatic gate.

The creation of synthetic nanomaterials that mimic the self-organization of complex superstructures commonly seen in biomolecules has proved challenging due to the lack of biomolecule-like building blocks that feature versatile, programmable interactions to render structural complexity. In this study, highly aligned structures are obtained from an organic–inorganic mesophase composed of monodisperse Cd37S18 magic-size cluster building blocks. Impressively, structural alignment spans over six orders of magnitude in length scale: nanoscale magic-size clusters arrange into a hexagonal geometry organized inside micrometre-sized filaments; self-assembly of these filaments leads to fibres that then organize into uniform arrays of centimetre-scale bands with well-defined surface periodicity. Enhanced patterning can be achieved by controlling processing conditions, resulting in bullseye and ‘zigzag’ stacking patterns with periodicity in two directions. Overall, we demonstrate that colloidal nanomaterials can exhibit a high level of self-organization behaviour at macroscopic-length scales. Nanometre-sized clusters can self-organize into centimetre-scale hierarchical structures, mimicking the complex constructions seen in nature and providing a platform to design synthetically directed advanced materials with sophisticated functions.},

  abstract     = {Ultrafast manipulation of magnetism bears great potential for future information technologies. While demagnetization in ferromagnets is governed by the dissipation of angular momentum1–3, materials with multiple spin sublattices, for example antiferromagnets, can allow direct angular momentum transfer between opposing spins, promising faster functionality. In lanthanides, 4f magnetic exchange is mediated indirectly through the conduction electrons4 (the Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida (RKKY) interaction), and the effect of such conditions on direct spin transfer processes is largely unexplored. Here, we investigate ultrafast magnetization dynamics in 4f antiferromagnets and systematically vary the 4f occupation, thereby altering the magnitude of the RKKY coupling energy. By combining time-resolved soft X-ray diffraction with ab initio calculations, we find that the rate of direct transfer between opposing moments is directly determined by this coupling. Given the high sensitivity of RKKY to the conduction electrons, our results offer a useful approach for fine tuning the speed of magnetic devices. By exploring ultrafast magnetization in several compounds with similar crystal structures but different 4f magnetic elements, the authors show that the Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida interaction controls the spin dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Thermoelectric materials can be potentially employed in solid-state devices that harvest waste heat and convert it to electrical power, thereby improving the efficiency of fuel utilization. The spectacular increases in the efficiencies of these materials achieved over the past decade have raised expectations regarding the use of thermoelectric generators in various energy saving and energy management applications, especially at mid to high temperature (400–900 °C). However, several important issues that prevent successful thermoelectric generator commercialization remain unresolved, in good part because of the lack of a research roadmap. Thermoelectric materials can generate energy from a heat differential. This Review provides an overview of mid- to high-temperature thermoelectrics, their application in modules, and the issues that need to be addressed to enable commercial implementation of state-of-the-art materials.},

  abstract     = {Epithelial organoids are most efficiently grown from mouse-tumour-derived, reconstituted extracellular matrix hydrogels, whose poorly defined composition, batch-to-batch variability and immunogenicity limit clinical applications. Efforts to replace such ill-defined matrices for organoid culture have largely focused on non-adaptable hydrogels composed of covalently crosslinked hydrophilic macromolecules. However, the excessive forces caused by tissue expansion in such elastic gels severely restrict organoid growth and morphogenesis. Chemical or enzymatic degradation schemes can partially alleviate this problem, but due to their irreversibility, long-term applicability is limited. Here we report a family of synthetic hydrogels that promote extensive organoid morphogenesis through dynamic rearrangements mediated by reversible hydrogen bonding. These tunable matrices are stress relaxing and thus promote efficient crypt budding in intestinal stem-cell epithelia through increased symmetry breaking and Paneth cell formation dependent on yes-associated protein 1. As such, these well-defined gels provide promising versatile matrices for fostering elaborate in vitro morphogenesis. The influence of stress relaxation of the extracellular matrix on the formation of intestinal organoids was investigated. It was shown that a stress-relaxing synthetic matrix promotes crypt budding through increased symmetry breaking and niche cell formation.},

Here we describe the development, characterization and engineering of a fungal–bacterial biocomposite grown on lignocellulosic feedstocks that can form mouldable, foldable and regenerative living structures. We have developed strategies to make human-scale biocomposite structures using mould-based and origami-inspired growth and assembly paradigms. Microbiome profiling of the biocomposite over multiple generations enabled the identification of a dominant bacterial component, Pantoea agglomerans, which was further isolated and developed into a new chassis. We introduced engineered P. agglomerans into native feedstocks to yield living blocks with new biosynthetic and sensing–reporting capabilities. Bioprospecting the native microbiota to develop engineerable chassis constitutes an important strategy to facilitate the development of living biomaterials with new properties and functionalities. Lignocellulosic waste is transformed into fungal–bacterial biocomposites that can be processed into recyclable, human-scale structural objects with biosynthetic and sensing–reporting functionalities.},

  abstract     = {Membranes with high selectivity offer an attractive route to molecular separations, where technologies such as distillation and chromatography are energy intensive. However, it remains challenging to fine tune the structure and porosity in membranes, particularly to separate molecules of similar size. Here, we report a process for producing composite membranes that comprise crystalline porous organic cage films fabricated by interfacial synthesis on a polyacrylonitrile support. These membranes exhibit ultrafast solvent permeance and high rejection of organic dyes with molecular weights over 600 g mol−1. The crystalline cage film is dynamic, and its pore aperture can be switched in methanol to generate larger pores that provide increased methanol permeance and higher molecular weight cut-offs (1,400 g mol−1). By varying the water/methanol ratio, the film can be switched between two phases that have different selectivities, such that a single, ‘smart’ crystalline membrane can perform graded molecular sieving. We exemplify this by separating three organic dyes in a single-stage, single-membrane process. The separation of multicomponent mixtures is performed by distillation, as multiple-membrane cascades are too complex. Here, a porous organic cage composite undergoes solid-state transformation in solvent; this alters pore size, enabling graded separation of three dyes with a single membrane.},

  abstract     = {Rechargeable lithium metal (Li0) batteries (RLMBs) are considered attractive for improving Li-ion batteries. Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) has been extensively used as a conducting salt for RLMBs due to its advantageous stability and innocuity. However, LiTFSI-based electrolytes are corrosive towards aluminium (Al0) current collectors at low potentials (&amp;gt;3.8 V versus Li/Li+), thereby excluding their application in 4-V-class RLMBs. Herein, we report on a non-corrosive sulfonimide salt, lithium (difluoromethanesulfonyl)(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiDFTFSI), that remarkably suppresses the anodic dissolution of the Al0 current collector at high potentials (&amp;gt;4.2 V versus Li/Li+) and significantly improves the cycling performance of Li(Ni1/3Mn1/3Co1/3)O2 (NMC111) cells. In addition, this sulfonimide salt results in the growth of an advantageous solid electrolyte interphase on the Li0 electrode. The replacement of either LiTFSI or LiPF6 with LiDFTFSI endows a Li0||NMC111 cell with superior cycling stability and capacity retention (87% at cycle 200), demonstrating the decisive role of the salt anion in dictating the electrochemical performance of RLMBs. Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide is used as a conducting salt for rechargeable lithium metal batteries because of its stability, but corrosion with aluminium current collectors is an issue. A non-corrosive sulfonimide salt is shown to suppress anodic dissolution of an Al current collector at high potentials while improving cycling.},

Herein, we report a suspension electrolyte design that modifies the Li+ solvation environment in liquid electrolytes and creates inorganic-rich solid–electrolyte interphases on Li. Li2O nanoparticles suspended in liquid electrolytes were investigated as a proof of concept. Through theoretical and empirical analyses of Li2O suspension electrolytes, the roles played by Li2O in the liquid electrolyte and solid–electrolyte interphases of the Li anode are elucidated. Also, the suspension electrolyte design is applied in conventional and state-of-the-art high-performance electrolytes to demonstrate its applicability. Based on electrochemical analyses, improved Coulombic efficiency (up to ~99.7%), reduced Li nucleation overpotential, stabilized Li interphases and prolonged cycle life of anode-free cells (~70 cycles at 80% of initial capacity) were achieved with the suspension electrolytes. We expect this design principle and our findings to be expanded into developing electrolytes and solid–electrolyte interphases for Li metal batteries. Stable solid–electrolyte interphases on Li anodes are crucial for reliable Li metal batteries. A suspension electrolyte design that modifies the Li+ solvation environment in liquid electrolytes and creates inorganic-rich interphases on Li is now reported.},

Specifically, we demonstrate the increase of the grain boundary conductance of a 3 mol% Gd-doped ceria thin film by a factor of approximately 3.5 at 250 °C and the reduction of its activation energy from 1.12 to 0.68 eV under illumination, while light-induced heating and electronic conductivity could be excluded as potential sources for the observed opto-ionic effect. The presented model predicts that photo-generated electrons decrease the potential barrier heights associated with space charge zones depleted in charge carriers between adjacent grains. The discovered opto-ionic effect could pave the way for the development of new electrochemical storage and conversion technologies operating at lower temperatures and/or higher efficiencies and could be further used for fast and contactless control or diagnosis of ionic conduction in polycrystalline solids. Grain boundary conductivity limitations are ubiquitous in material science. Illumination with above-bandgap light is now shown to decrease grain boundary resistance in a model gadolinium-doped ceria solid ionic conductor.},

  abstract     = {Gauge fields play a major role in understanding quantum effects. For example, gauge flux insertion into single unit cells is crucial towards detecting quantum phases and controlling quantum dynamics and classical waves. However, the potential of gauge fields in topological materials studies has not been fully exploited. Here, we experimentally demonstrate artificial gauge flux insertion into a single plaquette of a sonic crystal with a gauge phase ranging from 0 to 2π. We insert the gauge flux through a three-step process of dimensional extension, engineering a screw dislocation and dimensional reduction. Additionally, the single-plaquette gauge flux leads to cyclic spectral flows across multiple bandgaps that manifest as topological boundary states on the plaquette and emerge only when the flux-carrying plaquette encloses the Wannier centres. We termed this phenomenon as the topological Wannier cycle. This work paves the way towards sub-unit-cell gauge flux, enabling future studies on synthetic gauge fields and topological materials. Gauge fields are essential for detecting and controlling quantum dynamical systems, but their potential has yet to be fully exploited. Here, the authors insert a single-unit-cell synthetic gauge flux into a sonic crystal with the gauge phase ranging from 0 to 2π, leading to topological Wannier cycles.},

  abstract     = {Charge neutrality and their expected itinerant nature makes excitons potential transmitters of information. However, exciton mobility remains inaccessible to traditional optical experiments that only create and detect excitons with negligible momentum. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we detect dispersing excitons in the quasi-one-dimensional metallic trichalcogenide, TaSe3. The low density of conduction electrons and the low dimensionality in TaSe3 combined with a polaronic renormalization of the conduction band and the poorly screened interaction between these polarons and photo-induced valence holes leads to various excitonic bound states that we interpret as intrachain and interchain excitons, and possibly trions. The thresholds for the formation of a photo-hole together with an exciton appear as side valence bands with dispersions nearly parallel to the main valence band, but shifted to lower excitation energies. The energy separation between side and main valence bands can be controlled by surface doping, enabling the tuning of certain exciton properties. Mobile excitons in metals have been elusive, as screening usually suppresses their formation. Here, the authors demonstrate such mobile bound states in quasi-one-dimensional metallic TaSe3, taking advantage of its low dimensionality and carrier density.},

  abstract     = {Disordered magnetic states known as spin liquids are of paramount importance in both fundamental and applied science. A classical state of this kind was predicted for the Ising antiferromagnetic triangular model, while additional non-commuting exchange terms were proposed to induce its quantum version—a quantum spin liquid. However, these predictions have not yet been confirmed experimentally. Here, we report evidence for such a state in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet NdTa7O19. We determine its magnetic ground state, which is characterized by effective spin-1/2 degrees of freedom with Ising-like nearest-neighbour correlations and gives rise to spin excitations persisting down to the lowest accessible temperature of 40 mK. Our study demonstrates the key role of strong spin–orbit coupling in stabilizing spin liquids that result from magnetic anisotropy and highlights the large family of rare-earth (RE) heptatantalates RETa7O19 as a framework for realization of these states, which represent a promising platform for quantum applications. Neutron scattering, electron spin resonance, muon spectroscopy and magnetization measurements are applied to evidence a quantum spin liquid phase in NdTa7O19.},

Here, we examine the low-energy electronic structures of CeSb through the anomalous magnetostructural transitions below the Néel temperature, ~17 K, termed the ‘devil’s staircase’, using laser angle-resolved photoemission, Raman and neutron scattering spectroscopies. We report another type of electron–boson coupling between mobile electrons and quadrupole crystal-electric-field excitations of the 4f orbitals, which renormalizes the Sb 5p band prominently, yielding a kink at a very low energy (~7 meV). This coupling strength is strong and exhibits anomalous step-like enhancement during the devil’s staircase transition, unveiling a new type of quasiparticle, named the ‘multipole polaron’, comprising a mobile electron dressed with a cloud of the quadrupole crystal-electric-field polarization. A multipole polaron, composed of a mobile electron dressed with a cloud of the quadrupole crystal-electric-field polarization, is identified in a rare-earth intermetallic.},

  abstract     = {The similarity in atomic/molecular structure between liquids and glasses has stimulated a long-standing hypothesis that the nature of glasses may be more fluid-like, rather than the apparent solid. In principle, the nature of glasses can be characterized by the dynamic response of their rheology in a wide rate range, but this has not been realized experimentally, to the best of our knowledge. Here we report the dynamic response of shear stress to the shear strain rate of metallic glasses over a timescale of nine orders of magnitude, equivalent to hundreds of years, by broadband stress relaxation experiments. The dynamic response of the metallic glasses, together with other ‘glasses’, follows a universal scaling law within the framework of fluid dynamics. The universal scaling law provides comprehensive validation of the conjecture on the jamming (dynamic) phase diagram by which the dynamic behaviours of a wide variety of ‘glasses’ can be unified under one rubric parameterized by the thermodynamic variables of temperature, volume and stress in the trajectory space. The liquid nature of hard glasses is demonstrated by broadband stress relaxation experiments. The rheology and dynamic transition of various glass systems can be unified by a universal scaling law in the time–stress–temperature–volume domain.},

  abstract     = {Dielectrics with low loss at microwave frequencies are imperative for high-coherence solid-state quantum computing platforms. Here we study the dielectric loss of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) thin films in the microwave regime by measuring the quality factor of parallel-plate capacitors (PPCs) made of NbSe2–hBN–NbSe2 heterostructures integrated into superconducting circuits. The extracted microwave loss tangent of hBN is bounded to be at most in the mid-10−6 range in the low-temperature, single-photon regime. We integrate hBN PPCs with aluminium Josephson junctions to realize transmon qubits with coherence times reaching 25 μs, consistent with the hBN loss tangent inferred from resonator measurements. The hBN PPC reduces the qubit feature size by approximately two orders of magnitude compared with conventional all-aluminium coplanar transmons. Our results establish hBN as a promising dielectric for building high-coherence quantum circuits with substantially reduced footprint and with a high energy participation that helps to reduce unwanted qubit cross-talk. Parallel-plate capacitors of the two-dimensional materials hBN and NbSe2 are integrated with aluminium Josephson junctions to realize transmon qubits with coherence times reaching 25 μs.},

Conversely, advances in the fundamental understanding of soft-condensed matter, polymers and biomaterials offer new avenues to extend the reach of synthetic biology. The broad and exciting range of possible applications have substantial implications to address grand challenges in health, biotechnology and sustainability. Despite the potentially transformative impact that lies at the interface of synthetic biology and biomaterials, the two fields have, so far, progressed mostly separately. This Perspective provides a review of recent key advances in these two fields, and a roadmap for collaboration at the interface between the two communities. We highlight the near-term applications of this interface to the development of hierarchically structured biomaterials, from bioinspired building blocks to ‘living’ materials that sense and respond based on the reciprocal interactions between materials and embedded cells. This Perspective reviews the complementary developments in synthetic biology and biomaterials and discusses how convergence of these two fields creates a promising design strategy for the fabrication of tailored living materials for medicine and biotechnology.},

  abstract     = {Mechanotransduction is a process by which cells sense the mechanical properties of their surrounding environment and adapt accordingly to perform cellular functions such as adhesion, migration and differentiation. Integrin-mediated focal adhesions are major sites of mechanotransduction and their connection with the actomyosin network is crucial for mechanosensing as well as for the generation and transmission of forces onto the substrate. Despite having emerged as major regulators of cell adhesion and migration, the contribution of microtubules to mechanotransduction still remains elusive. Here, we show that talin- and actomyosin-dependent mechanosensing of substrate rigidity controls microtubule acetylation (a tubulin post-translational modification) by promoting the recruitment of α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (αTAT1) to focal adhesions. Microtubule acetylation tunes the mechanosensitivity of focal adhesions and Yes-associated protein (YAP) translocation. Microtubule acetylation, in turn, promotes the release of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1 from microtubules to activate RhoA, actomyosin contractility and traction forces. Our results reveal a fundamental crosstalk between microtubules and actin in mechanotransduction that contributes to mechanosensitive cell adhesion and migration. Substrate-rigidity-dependent microtubule acetylation is now shown to be triggered by mechanosensing at focal adhesions, and in turn controls the mechanosensitivity of Yes-associated protein (YAP) translocation, focal adhesion distribution, actomyosin contractility and cell migration.},

  abstract     = {Ionogels are compelling materials for technological devices due to their excellent ionic conductivity, thermal and electrochemical stability, and non-volatility. However, most existing ionogels suffer from low strength and toughness. Here, we report a simple one-step method to achieve ultra-tough and stretchable ionogels by randomly copolymerizing two common monomers with distinct solubility of the corresponding polymers in an ionic liquid. Copolymerization of acrylamide and acrylic acid in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethyl sulfate results in a macroscopically homogeneous covalent network with in situ phase separation: a polymer-rich phase with hydrogen bonds that dissipate energy and toughen the ionogel; and an elastic solvent-rich phase that enables for large strain. These ionogels have high fracture strength (12.6 MPa), fracture energy (~24 kJ m−2) and Young’s modulus (46.5 MPa), while being highly stretchable (~600% strain) and having self-healing and shape-memory properties. This concept can be applied to other monomers and ionic liquids, offering a promising way to tune ionogel microstructure and properties in situ during one-step polymerization. Two monomers with distinct solubility of their corresponding polymers in an ionic liquid enable tuning of the microstructure of the copolymers during their polymerization. Thus, energy dissipative and elastic molecular domains are created, resulting in highly tough and stretchable ionogels.},

So far, the cellulose nanocrystal self-assembly process has been studied only at a small scale, neglecting the limitations and challenges posed by the continuous deposition processes that are required to exploit this sustainable material in an industrial context. Here, we addressed these limitations by using roll-to-roll deposition to produce large-area photonic films, which required optimization of the formulation of the cellulose nanocrystal suspension and the deposition and drying conditions. Furthermore, we showed how metre-long structurally coloured films can be processed into effect pigments and glitters that are dispersible, even in water-based formulations. These promising effect pigments are an industrially relevant cellulose-based alternative to current products that are either micro-polluting (for example, non-biodegradable microplastic glitters) or based on carcinogenic, unsustainable or unethically sourced compounds (for example, titania or mica). The large-scale fabrication of cellulose nanocrystal photonic films in a roll-to-roll device is achieved by careful optimization of the cellulose nanocrystal formulation and its controlled deposition and drying on a substrate. Once dry, these photonic films can be peeled and milled into effect pigments, highlighting the potential of cellulose nanocrystals as a sustainable material for industrial photonic applications.},

  abstract     = {Progress in understanding crystallization pathways depends on the ability to unravel relationships between intermediates and final crystalline products at the nanoscale, which is a particular challenge at elevated pressure and temperature. Here we exploit a high-pressure atomic force microscope to directly visualize brucite carbonation in water-bearing supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) at 90 bar and 50 °C. On introduction of water-saturated scCO2, in situ visualization revealed initial dissolution followed by nanoparticle nucleation consistent with amorphous magnesium carbonate (AMC) on the surface. This is followed by growth of nesquehonite (MgCO3·3H2O) crystallites. In situ imaging provided direct evidence that the AMC intermediate acts as a seed for crystallization of nesquehonite. In situ infrared and thermogravimetric–mass spectrometry indicate that the stoichiometry of AMC is MgCO3·xH2O (x = 0.5–1.0), while its structure is indicated to be hydromagnesite-like according to density functional theory and X-ray pair distribution function analysis. Our findings thus provide insight for understanding the stability, lifetime and role of amorphous intermediates in natural and synthetic systems. Non-classical crystallization may proceed through formation of intermediate phases, but it is not known whether these are linked to the final crystallization. Here, using an atomic force microscope at 90 bar, brucite carbonation is directly observed, with an amorphous intermediate acting as the seed for crystalline nesquehonite.},

  abstract     = {Organic long-persistent-luminescent (OLPL) materials demonstrating hour-long photoluminescence have practical advantages in applications owing to their flexible design and easy processability. However, the energy absorbed in these materials is typically stored in an intermediate charge-separated state that is unstable when exposed to oxygen, thus preventing persistent luminescence in air unless oxygen penetration is suppressed through crystallization. Moreover, OLPL materials usually require ultraviolet excitation. Here we overcome such limitations and demonstrate amorphous OLPL systems that can be excited by radiation up to 600 nm and exhibit persistent luminescence in air. By adding cationic photoredox catalysts as electron-accepting dopants in a neutral electron-donor host, stable charge-separated states are generated by hole diffusion in these blends. Furthermore, the addition of hole-trapping molecules extends the photoluminescence lifetime. By using a p-type host less reactive to oxygen and tuning the donor–acceptor energy gap, our amorphous blends exhibit persistent luminescence stimulated by visible light even in air, expanding the applicability of OLPL materials. Organic blends based on cationic photoredox catalyst dopants in neutral donor hosts show p-type charge transport behaviour. This favours reduced reactivity to oxygen in organic long-persistent luminescence materials responsive to visible light.},

In anisotropically shaped photocatalyst particles, the different constituent facets may form inter-facet junctions at their adjoining edges, analogous to lateral two-dimensional (2D) heterojunctions or pseudo-2D junctions made of few-layer 2D materials. Using subfacet-level multimodal functional imaging, we uncover inter-facet junction effects on anisotropically shaped bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) particles and identify the characteristics of near-edge transition zones on the particle surface, which underpin the whole-particle photoelectrochemistry. We further show that chemical doping modulates the widths of such near-edge surface transition zones, consequently altering particles’ performance. Decoupled facet-size scaling laws further translate inter-facet junction effects into quantitative particle-size engineering principles, revealing surprising multiphasic size dependences of whole-particle photoelectrode performance. The imaging tools, the analytical framework and the inter-facet junction concept pave new avenues towards understanding, predicting and engineering (opto)electronic and photoelectrochemical properties of faceted semiconducting materials, with broad implications in energy science and semiconductor technology.

Alternatively, hydride ions (H–), that is, monovalent anions with high polarizability, can be considered a promising charge carrier that facilitates fast ionic conduction in solids. Here, we report a K2NiF4-type Ba–Li oxyhydride with an appreciable amount of hydrogen vacancies that presents long-range order at room temperature. Increasing the temperature results in the disappearance of the vacancy ordering, triggering a high and essentially temperature-independent H– conductivity of more than 0.01 S cm–1 above 315 °C.

Here, we present a dielectric tensor tomographic approach to directly measure dielectric tensors of anisotropic structures including the spatial variations of principal refractive indices and directors. The anisotropic structure is illuminated with a polarized plane wave with various angles and polarization states. Then, the scattered fields are holographically measured and converted into vectorial diffracted field components. Finally, by inversely solving a vectorial wave equation, the three-dimensional dielectric tensor is reconstructed. Using this approach, we demonstrate quantitative tomographic measurements of various nematic liquid-crystal structures and their fast three-dimensional non-equilibrium dynamics. Measuring three-dimensional dielectric tensors is desired for applications in material and soft matter physics.

An analysis of the electronic transport provides evidence for competing correlated metallic and insulating states with varying degrees of spin polarization. Some features bear quantitative resemblance to quantum Monte Carlo simulation results, including the transition point from the paramagnetic Fermi liquid to Wigner crystal and the absence of a Stoner transition. At very low temperatures, we resolve a non-monotonic spin polarizability of electrons across the phase transition, pointing towards a low spin phase of electrons, and a two-order-of-magnitude positive magnetoresistance that is challenging to understand within traditional metallic transport paradigms. This work establishes zinc oxide as a platform for studying strongly correlated electrons in two dimensions.

  abstract     = {Rapid progress in additive manufacturing methods has created a new class of ultralight mechanical metamaterials with extreme functional properties. Their application is ultimately limited by their tolerance to damage and defects, but an understanding of this sensitivity has remained elusive. Using metamaterial specimens consisting of millions of unit cells, we show that not only is the stress intensity factor, as used in conventional elastic fracture mechanics, insufficient to characterize fracture, but also that conventional fracture testing protocols are inadequate. Via a combination of numerical and asymptotic analysis, we extend the ideas of elastic fracture mechanics to truss-based metamaterials and develop a general test and design protocol. This framework can form the basis for fracture characterization in other discrete elastic-brittle solids where the notion of fracture toughness is known to break down. Microscale architecting enables metamaterials to achieve mechanical properties not accessible to bulk materials. Here the authors show that established design protocols for the fracture of materials need to be revised to predict the failure of these materials.},

  abstract     = {Two-phase titanium-based alloys are widely used in aerospace and biomedical applications, and they are obtained through phase transformations between a low-temperature hexagonal closed-packed α-phase and a high-temperature body-centred cubic β-phase. Understanding how a new phase evolves from its parent phase is critical to controlling the transforming microstructures and thus material properties. Here, we report time-resolved experimental evidence, at sub-ångström resolution, of a non-classically nucleated metastable phase that bridges the α-phase and the β-phase, in a technologically important titanium–molybdenum alloy. We observed a nanosized and chemically ordered superstructure in the α-phase matrix; its composition, chemical order and crystal structure are all found to be different from both the parent and the product phases, but instigating a vanishingly low energy barrier for the transformation into the β-phase. This latter phase transition can proceed instantly via vibrational switching when the molybdenum concentration in the superstructure exceeds a critical value. We expect that such a non-classical phase evolution mechanism is much more common than previously believed for solid-state transformations. A full kinetic pathway of a non-classical nucleation-induced phase transformation through metastable states is elucidated at sub-ångström resolution in a technologically important titanium alloy.},

  abstract     = {Nanoscale periodic moiré patterns, for example those formed at the interface of a twisted bilayer of two-dimensional materials, provide opportunities for engineering the electronic properties of van der Waals heterostructures1–11. In this work, we synthesized the epitaxial heterostructure of 1T-TiTe2/1T-TiSe2 with various twist angles using molecular beam epitaxy and investigated the moiré pattern induced/enhanced charge density wave (CDW) states with scanning tunnelling microscopy. When the twist angle is near zero degrees, 2 × 2 CDW domains are formed in 1T-TiTe2, separated by 1 × 1 normal state domains, and trapped in the moiré pattern. The formation of the moiré-trapped CDW state is ascribed to the local strain variation due to atomic reconstruction. Furthermore, this CDW state persists at room temperature, suggesting its potential for future CDW-based applications. Such moiré-trapped CDW patterns were not observed at larger twist angles. Our study paves the way for constructing metallic twist van der Waals bilayers and tuning many-body effects via moiré engineering. A moiré-trapped charge density wave is observed at room temperature in a twisted transition metal dichalcogenide system and attributed to local strain variation due to atomic reconstruction.},

Despite being proposed on a number of occasions, the direct, bottom-up assembly of molecular building blocks into woven organic polymers remained an aspirational, but elusive, target for several decades. However, recent successes in two-dimensional and three-dimensional molecular-level weaving now offer new opportunities and research directions at the interface of polymer science and molecular nanotopology. This Perspective provides an overview of the features and potential of the periodic nanoscale weaving of polymer chains, distinguishing it from randomly entangled polymer networks and rigid crystalline frameworks. We review the background and experimental progress so far, and conclude by considering the potential of molecular weaving and outline some of the current and future challenges in this emerging field. Molecular weaving is the entanglement of one-dimensional flexible molecules into higher-dimensional networks.

  abstract     = {Solvent-free chemical manufacturing is one of the awaited technologies for addressing an emergent issue of environmental pollution. Here, we report solvent-free autocatalytic supramolecular polymerization (SF-ASP), which provides an inhibition-free template-assisted catalytic organic transformation that takes great advantage of the fact that the product (template) undergoes a termination-free nucleation–elongation assembly (living supramolecular polymerization) under solvent-free conditions. SF-ASP allows for reductive cyclotetramerization of hydrogen-bonding phthalonitriles into the corresponding phthalocyanines in exceptionally high yields (&amp;gt;80%). SF-ASP requires the growing polymer to form hexagonally packed crystalline fibres, which possibly preorganize the phthalonitriles at their cross-sectional edges for their efficient transformation. With metal oleates, SF-ASP produces single-crystalline fibres of metallophthalocyanines again in exceptionally high yields, which grow in both directions without terminal coupling until the phthalonitrile precursors are completely consumed. By taking advantage of this living nature of polymerization, multistep SF-ASP without/with metal oleates allows for the precision synthesis of multi-block supramolecular copolymers. The solvent-free conversion of phthalonitrile derivatives into phthalocyanines in the bulk is described, involving a reductive cyclotetramerization step and the formation of one-dimensional single-crystalline fibres. This solvent-free autocatalytic supramolecular polymerization may enable for a sustainable fabrication of multi-block supramolecular copolymers.},

However, limited material choices for heavy metal-free III-V–II-VI h-NCs pose challenges in comprehensive control of the potential profile. Herein, we present an approach to such a control by steering dipole densities at the interface of III-V–II-VI h-NCs. The controllable heterovalency at the interface is responsible for interfacial dipole densities that result in the vacuum-level shift, providing an additional knob for the control of optical and electrical characteristics of h-NCs. The synthesis of h-NCs with atomic precision allows us to correlate interfacial dipole moments with the NCs’ photochemical stability and optoelectronic performance. Controlled synthesis of heterostructured III-V–II-VI nanocrystals shows that dipole moments formed at the core–shell interface can tune the optoelectronic properties of these nanomaterials and their performance in light-emitting devices.},

  abstract     = {Of relevance to energy storage, electrochemistry and catalysis, ionic and dipolar liquids display unexpected behaviours—especially in confinement. Beyond adsorption, over-screening and crowding effects, experiments have highlighted novel phenomena, such as unconventional screening and the impact of the electronic nature—metallic versus insulating—of the confining surface. Such behaviours, which challenge existing frameworks, highlight the need for tools to fully embrace the properties of confined liquids. Here we introduce a novel approach that involves electronic screening while capturing molecular aspects of interfacial fluids. Although available strategies consider perfect metal or insulator surfaces, we build on the Thomas–Fermi formalism to develop an effective approach that deals with any imperfect metal between these asymptotes. Our approach describes electrostatic interactions within the metal through a ‘virtual’ Thomas–Fermi fluid of charged particles, whose Debye length sets the screening length λ. We show that this method captures the electrostatic interaction decay and electrochemical behaviour on varying λ. By applying this strategy to an ionic liquid, we unveil a wetting transition on switching from insulating to metallic conditions. Ionic and dipolar liquids display unexpected behaviours, especially in confinement, that are relevant to energy storage, electrochemistry and catalysis. An approach that involves electronic screening while capturing molecular aspects of interfacial fluids is now proposed.},

  abstract     = {Zwitterionic materials can exhibit unique characteristics and are highly tunable by variation to the covalently bound cationic and anionic moieties. Despite the breadth of properties and potential uses reported to date, for electrolyte applications they have thus far primarily been used as additives or for making polymer gels. However, zwitterions offer intriguing promise as electrolyte matrix materials that are non-volatile and charged but non-migrating. Here we report a family of zwitterions that exhibit molecular disorder and plasticity, which allows their use as a solid-state conductive matrix. We have characterized the thermal, morphological and structural properties of these materials using techniques including differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, solid-state NMR and X-ray crystallography. We report the physical and transport properties of zwitterions combined with lithium salts and a lithium-functionalized polymer to form solid or high-salt-content liquid electrolytes. We demonstrate that the zwitterion-based electrolytes can allow high target ion transport and support stable lithium metal cell cycling. The ability to use disordered zwitterionic materials as electrolyte matrices for high target ion conduction, coupled with an extensive scope for varying the chemical and physical properties, has important implications for the future design of non-volatile materials that bridge the choice between traditional molecular and ionic solvent systems. The tunability of covalently bound cationic and anionic moieties of zwitterionic materials makes them attractive for potential applications. A family of zwitterions exhibiting molecular disorder and plasticity allows their use as a solid-state conductive matrix.},

  abstract     = {Lithium-ion batteries are yet to realize their full promise because of challenges in the design and construction of electrode architectures that allow for their entire interior volumes to be reversibly accessible for ion storage. Electrodes constructed from the same material and with the same specifications, which differ only in terms of dimensions and geometries of the constituent particles, can show surprising differences in polarization, stress accumulation and capacity fade. Here, using operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDXRD), we probe the mechanistic origins of the remarkable particle geometry-dependent modification of lithiation-induced phase transformations in V2O5 as a model phase-transforming cathode. A pronounced modulation of phase coexistence regimes is observed as a function of particle geometry. Specifically, a metastable phase is stabilized for nanometre-sized spherical V2O5 particles, to circumvent the formation of large misfit strains. Spatially resolved EDXRD measurements demonstrate that particle geometries strongly modify the tortuosity of the porous cathode architecture. Greater ion-transport limitations in electrode architectures comprising micrometre-sized platelets result in considerable lithiation heterogeneities across the thickness of the electrode. These insights establish particle geometry-dependent modification of metastable phase regimes and electrode tortuosity as key design principles for realizing the promise of intercalation cathodes. Designing electrode architectures for Li-ion batteries that can be reversibly accessible for ion storage can be challenging. Using operando techniques the mechanistic origin of lithiation-induced phase transformations in a V2O5 model cathode is now clarified.},

  abstract     = {X-ray detection, which plays an important role in medical and industrial fields, usually relies on inorganic scintillators to convert X-rays to visible photons; although several high-quantum-yield fluorescent molecules have been tested as scintillators, they are generally less efficient. High-energy radiation can ionize molecules and create secondary electrons and ions. As a result, a high fraction of triplet states is generated, which act as scintillation loss channels. Here we found that X-ray-induced triplet excitons can be exploited for emission through very rapid, thermally activated up-conversion. We report scintillators based on three thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecules with different emission bands, which showed significantly higher efficiency than conventional anthracene-based scintillators. X-ray imaging with 16.6 line pairs mm−1 resolution was also demonstrated. These results highlight the importance of efficient and prompt harvesting of triplet excitons for efficient X-ray scintillation and radiation detection. Triplet exciton harvesting through thermally activated delayed fluorescence is shown to be effective also under X-ray excitation, increasing the efficiency and imaging quality of X-ray detectors based on organic scintillation.},

  abstract     = {A large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) is crucial for thermoelectric energy conversion applications because the associated unique transverse geometry facilitates module fabrication. Topological ferromagnets with large Berry curvatures show large ANEs; however, they face drawbacks such as strong magnetic disturbances and low mobility due to high magnetization. Herein, we demonstrate that YbMnBi2, a canted antiferromagnet, has a large ANE conductivity of ~10 A m−1 K−1 that surpasses large values observed in other ferromagnets (3–5 A m−1 K−1). The canted spin structure of Mn guarantees a non-zero Berry curvature, but generates only a weak magnetization three orders of magnitude lower than that of general ferromagnets. The heavy Bi with a large spin–orbit coupling enables a large ANE and low thermal conductivity, whereas its highly dispersive px/y orbitals ensure low resistivity. The high anomalous transverse thermoelectric performance and extremely small magnetization make YbMnBi2 an excellent candidate for transverse thermoelectrics. The anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) in topological materials with large Berry curvature shows great potential for transverse thermoelectrics, but antiferromagnets typically show small ANEs. The antiferromagnet YbMnBi2 has an ANE thermopower of 3 μV K−1, similar to ferromagnets, and a larger ANE conductivity.},

Brain-inspired computing paradigms have been implemented in crossbar arrays of memristive devices; however, this approach does not emulate the topology and the emergent behaviour of biological neuronal circuits, where the principle of self-organization regulates both structure and function. Here, we report on in materia reservoir computing in a fully memristive architecture based on self-organized nanowire networks. Thanks to the functional synaptic connectivity with nonlinear dynamics and fading memory properties, the designless nanowire complex network acts as a network-wide physical reservoir able to map spatio-temporal inputs into a feature space that can be analysed by a memristive resistive switching memory read-out layer. Computing capabilities, including recognition of spatio-temporal patterns and time-series prediction, show that the emergent memristive behaviour of nanowire networks allows in materia implementation of brain-inspired computing paradigms characterized by a reduced training cost. A network of self-organized nanowires combined with a memristive read-out layer is used to demonstrate a hardware implementation of reservoir computing for recognition of spatio-temporal patterns and time-series prediction.},

However, in junctions with ferromagnetic spacers, very long-range Josephson effects have remained elusive. Here we demonstrate extremely long-range (micrometric) high-temperature (tens of kelvins) Josephson coupling across the half-metallic manganite La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 combined with the superconducting cuprate YBa2Cu3O7. These planar junctions, in addition to large critical currents, display the hallmarks of Josephson physics, such as critical current oscillations driven by magnetic flux quantization and quantum phase locking effects under microwave excitation (Shapiro steps). The latter display an anomalous doubling of the Josephson frequency predicted by several theories. In addition to its fundamental interest, the marriage between high-temperature, dissipationless quantum coherent transport and full spin polarization brings opportunities for the practical realization of superconducting spintronics, and opens new perspectives for quantum computing. Josephson coupling over micrometres and at tens of kelvins is demonstrated across the half-metallic manganite La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 combined with the superconducting cuprate YBa2Cu3O7.},

The observed point defect may represent the Bloch point serving as an emergent magnetic monopole, as proposed theoretically. Our tomographic approach with a tunable magnetic field paves the way for direct visualization of the structural dynamics of individual skyrmion strings in 3D space, which will contribute to a better understanding of the creation, annihilation and transfer of these topological objects.

Although techniques based on atomic force microscopy have identified many friction phenomena at the nanoscale, many interpretative pitfalls still result from the indirect or ex situ characterization of contacting surfaces. Here we combined in situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy measurements to provide direct real-time observations of atomic-scale interfacial structure during frictional processes and discovered the formation of a loosely packed interfacial layer between two metallic asperities that enabled a low friction under tensile stress. This finding is corroborated by molecular dynamic simulations. The loosely packed interfacial layer became an ordered layer at equilibrium distances under compressive stress, which led to a transition from a low-friction to a dissipative high-friction motion. This work directly unveils a unique role of atomic diffusion in the friction of metallic contacts. The atomic-scale frictional processes between two metallic single-crystal asperities are visualized by combining in situ high-resolution TEM and AFM, elucidating diffusion-mediated low friction.},

Here, we uncover that the glass forming ability of an alloy is represented in its amorphous structure far away from equilibrium, which can be exposed by conventional X-ray diffraction. Specifically, we fabricated roughly 5,700 alloys from 12 alloy systems and characterized the full-width at half-maximum, Δq, of the first diffraction peak in the X-ray diffraction pattern. A strong correlation between high glass forming ability and a large Δq was found. This correlation indicates that a large dispersion of structural units comprising the amorphous structure is the universal indicator for high metallic glass formation. When paired with combinatorial synthesis, the correlation enhances throughput by up to 100 times compared to today’s state-of-the-art combinatorial methods and will facilitate the discovery of bulk metallic glasses. The glass forming ability of alloys is found to be strongly correlated with the full-width at half-maximum of the first diffraction peak in the X-ray diffraction pattern, which facilitates the discovery of bulk metallic glass compositions.},

One prime materials platform has been the rare-earth nickelates and, indeed, superconductivity was recently discovered in the doped compound Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 (ref. 3). Undoped NdNiO2 belongs to a series of layered square-planar nickelates with chemical formula Ndn+1NinO2n+2 and is known as the ‘infinite-layer’ (n = ∞) nickelate. Here we report the synthesis of the quintuple-layer (n = 5) member of this series, Nd6Ni5O12, in which optimal cuprate-like electron filling (d8.8) is achieved without chemical doping. We observe a superconducting transition beginning at ~13 K. Electronic structure calculations, in tandem with magnetoresistive and spectroscopic measurements, suggest that Nd6Ni5O12 interpolates between cuprate-like and infinite-layer nickelate-like behaviour. In engineering a distinct superconducting nickelate, we identify the square-planar nickelates as a new family of superconductors that can be tuned via both doping and dimensionality.

These advancements are, in part, attributed to the ability of organoid models to stably preserve genetic, proteomic, morphological and pharmacotypic features of the parent tumour in vitro, while also offering unprecedented genomic and environmental manipulation. Despite recent innovations in organoid protocols, current techniques for cancer organoid culture are inherently uncontrolled and irreproducible, owing to several non-standardized facets including cancer tissue sources and subsequent processing, medium formulations, and animal-derived three-dimensional matrices. Given the potential for cancer organoids to accurately recapitulate the intra- and intertumoral biological heterogeneity associated with patient-specific cancers, eliminating the undesirable technical variability accompanying cancer organoid culture is necessary to establish reproducible platforms that accelerate translatable insights into patient care. Here we describe the current challenges and recent multidisciplinary advancements and opportunities for standardizing next-generation cancer organoid systems.

  abstract     = {The actin cytoskeleton is the primary driver of cellular adhesion and mechanosensing due to its ability to generate force and sense the stiffness of the environment. At the cell’s leading edge, severing of the protruding Arp2/3 actin network generates a specific actin/tropomyosin (Tpm) filament population that controls lamellipodial persistence. The interaction between these filaments and adhesion to the environment is unknown. Using cellular cryo-electron tomography we resolve the ultrastructure of the Tpm/actin copolymers and show that they specifically anchor to nascent adhesions and are essential for focal adhesion assembly. Re-expression of Tpm1.8/1.9 in transformed and cancer cells is sufficient to restore cell–substrate adhesions. We demonstrate that knock-out of Tpm1.8/1.9 disrupts the formation of dorsal actin bundles, hindering the recruitment of α-actinin and non-muscle myosin IIa, critical mechanosensors. This loss causes a force-generation and proliferation defect that is notably reversed when cells are grown on soft surfaces. We conclude that Tpm1.8/1.9 suppress the metastatic phenotype, which may explain why transformed cells naturally downregulate this Tpm subset during malignant transformation. The role of actin/tropomyosin filaments in the assembly of cell–substrate adhesions has been investigated and it is now shown by cryo-electron tomography that they are essential for adhesion assembly and also regulate mechanosensing, matrix remodelling and transformation of cells towards a cancer phenotype.},

Here, we describe a fully synthetic hydrogel extracellular matrix designed to elicit key phenotypic traits of the pancreatic environment in culture. To enable the growth of normal and cancerous pancreatic organoids from genetically engineered murine models and human patients, essential adhesive cues were empirically defined and replicated in the hydrogel scaffold, revealing a functional role of laminin–integrin α3/α6 signalling in establishment and survival of pancreatic organoids. Altered tissue stiffness—a hallmark of pancreatic cancer—was recapitulated in culture by adjusting the hydrogel properties to engage mechano-sensing pathways and alter organoid growth. Pancreatic stromal cells were readily incorporated into the hydrogels and replicated phenotypic traits characteristic of the tumour environment in vivo. This model therefore recapitulates a pathologically remodelled tumour microenvironment for studies of normal and pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. A synthetic hydrogel has been developed to mimic the physicochemical properties of pancreatic tissue and is shown to support the culture of pancreatic cancer organoids, revealing the role of laminin–integrin interactions in their growth.},

Previous studies have focused on optimizing such properties using fast-dissociative crosslinks (that is, for an aqueous system, dissociation rate constant kd &amp;gt; 10 s−1). Herein, we describe non-covalent crosslinkers with slow, tuneable dissociation kinetics (kd &amp;lt; 1 s−1) that enable high compressibility to supramolecular polymer networks. The resultant glass-like supramolecular networks have compressive strengths up to 100 MPa with no fracture, even when compressed at 93% strain over 12 cycles of compression and relaxation. Notably, these networks show a fast, room-temperature self-recovery (&amp;lt; 120 s), which may be useful for the design of high-performance soft materials. Retarding the dissociation kinetics of non-covalent crosslinks through structural control enables access of such glass-like supramolecular materials, holding substantial promise in applications including soft robotics, tissue engineering and wearable bioelectronics. Glass-like supramolecular polymer networks with high compressibility and fast self-recovery are fabricated using host–guest crosslinkers with slow dissociation kinetics.},

Here we use atomic electron tomography to experimentally determine the three-dimensional atomic positions of monatomic amorphous solids, namely a Ta thin film and two Pd nanoparticles. We observe that pentagonal bipyramids are the most abundant atomic motifs in these amorphous materials. Instead of forming icosahedra, the majority of pentagonal bipyramids arrange into pentagonal bipyramid networks with medium-range order. Molecular dynamics simulations further reveal that pentagonal bipyramid networks are prevalent in monatomic metallic liquids, which rapidly grow in size and form more icosahedra during the quench from the liquid to the glass state. These results expand our understanding of the atomic structures of amorphous solids and will encourage future studies on amorphous–crystalline phase and glass transitions in non-crystalline materials with three-dimensional atomic resolution. Atomic electron tomography is used to determine the three-dimensional atomic structure of monatomic amorphous solids with liquid-like structure, which is characterized by the existence of pentagonal bipyramid networks with medium-range order.},

Recently, time-resolved spectroscopy of a photo-electrochemically driven oxygen evolution reaction followed the vibrational and optical spectra of this intermediate, denoted M-OH*. However, these inherently kinetic experiments have not been connected to the relevant thermodynamic quantities. Here we discover that picosecond optical spectra of the Ti-OH* population on lightly doped SrTiO3 are ordered by the surface hydroxylation. A Langmuir isotherm as a function of pH extracts an effective equilibrium constant relatable to the free energy difference of the first oxygen evolution reaction step. Thus, time-resolved spectroscopy of the catalytic surface reveals both kinetic and energetic information of elementary reaction steps, which provides a critical new connection between theory and experiment by which to tailor the pathway of water oxidation and other surface reactions. Theoretical descriptors differentiate catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction by the strength of oxygen binding in the reactive intermediate created upon electron transfer. Picosecond optical spectra of the Ti-OH* population on doped SrTiO3 are now shown to be ordered by surface hydroxylation.},

  abstract     = {Synchronization of large spin Hall nano-oscillator (SHNO) arrays is an appealing approach toward ultrafast non-conventional computing. However, interfacing to the array, tuning its individual oscillators and providing built-in memory units remain substantial challenges. Here, we address these challenges using memristive gating of W/CoFeB/MgO/AlOx-based SHNOs. In its high resistance state, the memristor modulates the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy at the CoFeB/MgO interface by the applied electric field. In its low resistance state the memristor adds or subtracts current to the SHNO drive. Both electric field and current control affect the SHNO auto-oscillation mode and frequency, allowing us to reversibly turn on/off mutual synchronization in chains of four SHNOs. We also demonstrate that two individually controlled memristors can be used to tune a four-SHNO chain into differently synchronized states. Memristor gating is therefore an efficient approach to input, tune and store the state of SHNO arrays for non-conventional computing models. This allows versatile non-volatile tuning of the mutual synchronization of chains of up to four oscillators and provides a path toward individual oscillator control in large oscillatory arrays.},

  abstract     = {Piezoelectrics interconvert mechanical energy and electric charge and are widely used in actuators and sensors. The best performing materials are ferroelectrics at a morphotropic phase boundary, where several phases coexist. Switching between these phases by electric field produces a large electromechanical response. In ferroelectric BiFeO3, strain can create a morphotropic-phase-boundary-like phase mixture and thus generate large electric-field-dependent strains. However, this enhanced response occurs at localized, randomly positioned regions of the film. Here, we use epitaxial strain and orientation engineering in tandem—anisotropic epitaxy—to craft a low-symmetry phase of BiFeO3 that acts as a structural bridge between the rhombohedral-like and tetragonal-like polymorphs. Interferometric displacement sensor measurements reveal that this phase has an enhanced piezoelectric coefficient of ×2.4 compared with typical rhombohedral-like BiFeO3. Band-excitation frequency response measurements and first-principles calculations provide evidence that this phase undergoes a transition to the tetragonal-like polymorph under electric field, generating an enhanced piezoelectric response throughout the film and associated field-induced reversible strains. These results offer a route to engineer thin-film piezoelectrics with improved functionalities, with broader perspectives for other functional oxides. Strain in thin films can increase piezoelectric properties, but crystallographic constraints may restrict the enhanced response to localized regions. Here, by combining strain and orientation engineering, a low-symmetry bridging phase of BiFeO3 with enhanced piezoresponse is stabilized uniformly throughout the film.},

  abstract     = {Optically addressable spin defects in silicon carbide (SiC) are an emerging platform for quantum information processing compatible with nanofabrication processes and device control used by the semiconductor industry. System scalability towards large-scale quantum networks demands integration into nanophotonic structures with efficient spin–photon interfaces. However, degradation of the spin-optical coherence after integration in nanophotonic structures has hindered the potential of most colour centre platforms. Here, we demonstrate the implantation of silicon vacancy centres (VSi) in SiC without deterioration of their intrinsic spin-optical properties. In particular, we show nearly lifetime-limited photon emission and high spin-coherence times for single defects implanted in bulk as well as in nanophotonic waveguides created by reactive ion etching. Furthermore, we take advantage of the high spin-optical coherences of VSi centres in waveguides to demonstrate controlled operations on nearby nuclear spin qubits, which is a crucial step towards fault-tolerant quantum information distribution based on cavity quantum electrodynamics. Colour centres are a promising quantum information platform, but coherence degradation after integration in nanostructures has hindered scalability. Here, the authors show that waveguide-integrated VSi centres in SiC maintain spin-optical coherences, enabling nuclear high-fidelity spin qubit operations.},

  abstract     = {Symmetry plays a central role in conventional and topological phases of matter, making the ability to optically drive symmetry changes a critical step in developing future technologies that rely on such control. Topological materials, like topological semimetals, are particularly sensitive to a breaking or restoring of time-reversal and crystalline symmetries, which affect both bulk and surface electronic states. While previous studies have focused on controlling symmetry via coupling to the crystal lattice, we demonstrate here an all-electronic mechanism based on photocurrent generation. Using second harmonic generation spectroscopy as a sensitive probe of symmetry changes, we observe an ultrafast breaking of time-reversal and spatial symmetries following femtosecond optical excitation in the prototypical type-I Weyl semimetal TaAs. Our results show that optically driven photocurrents can be tailored to explicitly break electronic symmetry in a generic fashion, opening up the possibility of driving phase transitions between symmetry-protected states on ultrafast timescales. The authors demonstrate ultrafast symmetry breaking by optically driven photocurrents.},

  abstract     = {The properties of quantum materials are commonly tuned using experimental variables such as pressure, magnetic field and doping. Here we explore a different approach using irreversible, plastic deformation of single crystals. We show that compressive plastic deformation induces low-dimensional superconductivity well above the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of undeformed SrTiO3, with evidence of possible superconducting correlations at temperatures two orders of magnitude above the bulk Tc. The enhanced superconductivity is correlated with the appearance of self-organized dislocation structures, as revealed by diffuse neutron and X-ray scattering. We also observe deformation-induced signatures of quantum-critical ferroelectric fluctuations and inhomogeneous ferroelectric order using Raman scattering. Our results suggest that strain surrounding the self-organized dislocation structures induces local ferroelectricity and quantum-critical dynamics that strongly influence Tc, consistent with a theory of superconductivity enhanced by soft polar fluctuations. Our results demonstrate the potential of plastic deformation and dislocation engineering for the manipulation of electronic properties of quantum materials. Plastic deformation is shown to tune the quantum degrees of freedom in SrTiO3.},

However, for finite-size interfaces, the effect of domain edges on the friction process remains unclear. Here we report the superlubricity phenomenon and the edge-pinning effect at MoS2/graphite and MoS2/hexagonal boron nitride van der Waals heterostructure interfaces. We found that the friction coefficients of these heterostructures are below 10−6. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate the experiments, which highlights the contribution of edges and interface steps to friction forces. Our experiments and simulations provide more information on the sliding mechanism of finite low-dimensional structures, which is vital to understand the friction process of laminar solid lubricants. MoS2/graphite and MoS2/h-BN interfaces are shown to have ultra-low friction coefficients, whereas edges and interface steps mainly contribute to the friction force.},

Despite extensive efforts to create colour-changing materials and devices4, it is challenging to achieve pixelated structural coloration with broadband spectral shifts in a compact space. Here, we describe pneumatically inflating thin membranes of main-chain chiral nematic liquid crystalline elastomers that have such properties. By taking advantage of the large elasticity anisotropy and Poisson’s ratio (&amp;gt;0.5) of these materials, we geometrically program the size and the layout of the encapsulated air channels to achieve colour shifting from near-infrared to ultraviolet wavelengths with less than 20% equi-biaxial transverse strain. Each channel can be individually controlled as a colour ‘pixel’ to match with surroundings, whether periodically or irregularly patterned. These soft materials may find uses in distinct applications such as cryptography, adaptive optics and soft robotics. Pneumatically actuated membranes made from a chiral nematic liquid crystalline elastomer supported by poly(dimethylsiloxane) layers are assembled into pixelated colour devices, where each individual pixel can be tuned throughout the entire visible spectrum.},

Multilayer formation, although broadly sought for structure and property tuning, has not yet been achieved in the case of synthetic 2D boron: that is, borophene1,2. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the synthesis of an atomically well-defined borophene polymorph beyond the single-atomic-layer (SL) limit. The structure of this bilayer (BL) borophene is consistent with two covalently bonded α-phase layers (termed BL-α borophene) as evidenced from bond-resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy, non-contact atomic force microscopy and density functional theory calculations. While the electronic density of states near the Fermi level of BL-α borophene is similar to SL borophene polymorphs, field-emission resonance spectroscopy reveals distinct interfacial charge transfer doping and a heightened local work function exceeding 5 eV. The extension of borophene polymorphs beyond the SL limit significantly expands the phase space for boron-based nanomaterials. A borophene polymorph with two covalently bonded boron monolayers was synthesized, expanding the physical properties of borophene and filling the gap between monolayer borophene and icosahedron-based bulk boron.},
