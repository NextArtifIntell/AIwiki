  abstract = {When disaggregation of national estimates in several domains or areas is required, direct survey estimators, which use only the domain-specific survey data, are usually design-unbiased even under complex survey designs (at least approximately) and require no model assumptions. Nevertheless, they are appropriate only for domains or areas with sufficiently large sample size. For example, when estimating poverty in a domain with a small sample size (small area), the volatility of a direct estimator might make that area seems like very poor in one period and very rich in the next one. Small area (or indirect) estimators have been developed in order to avoid such undesired instability. Small area estimators borrow strength from the other areas so as to improve the precision and therefore obtain much more stable estimators. However, the usual model-based assumptions, which include some kind of area homogeneity, may not hold in real applications. A more flexible model based on multivariate mixtures of normal distributions that generalises the usual nested error linear regression model is proposed for estimation of general parameters in small areas. This flexibility makes the model adaptable to more general situations, where there may be areas with a different behaviour from the other ones, making the model less restrictive (hence, more close to nonparametric) and more robust to outlying areas. An expectation-maximisation (E-M) method is designed for fitting the proposed mixture model. Under the proposed mixture model, two different new predictors of general small area indicators are proposed. A parametric bootstrap method is used to estimate the mean squared errors of the proposed predictors. Small sample properties of the new predictors and of the bootstrap procedure are analysed by simulation studies and the new methodology is illustrated with an application to poverty mapping in Palestine.},

Yet different, equally justifiable choices when developing, testing and deploying these socio-technical tools can lead to disparate predicted risk scores for the same individual. Synthesising diverse perspectives from machine learning, statistics, sociology, criminology, law, philosophy and economics, we conceptualise this phenomenon as predictive inconsistency . We describe sources of predictive inconsistency at different stages of algorithmic risk assessment tool development and deployment and consider how future technological developments may amplify predictive inconsistency. We argue, however, that in a diverse and pluralistic society we should not expect to completely eliminate predictive inconsistency. Instead, to bolster the legal, political and scientific legitimacy of algorithmic risk prediction tools, we propose identifying and documenting relevant and reasonable ‘forking paths’ to enable quantifiable, reproducible multiverse and specification curve analyses of predictive inconsistency at the individual level.},

  abstract = {When drawing causal inference from observational data, there is almost always concern about unmeasured confounding. One way to tackle this is to conduct a sensitivity analysis. One widely used sensitivity analysis framework hypothesises the existence of a scalar unmeasured confounder U and asks how the causal conclusion would change were U measured and included in the primary analysis. Work along this line often makes various parametric assumptions on U, for the sake of mathematical and computational convenience. In this article, we further this line of research by developing a valid sensitivity analysis that leaves the distribution of U unrestricted. Compared to many existing methods in the literature, our method allows for a larger and more flexible family of models, mitigates observable implications, and works seamlessly with any primary analysis that models the outcome regression parametrically. We construct both pointwise confidence intervals and confidence bands that are uniformly valid over a given sensitivity parameter space, thus formally accounting for unknown sensitivity parameters. We apply our proposed method on an influential yet controversial study of the causal relationship between war experiences and political activeness using observational data from Uganda.},

It may not be optimal to apply the conventional mean regression due to its sensitivity to the high level of skewness and spatio-temporal heterogeneity presented in the cost data. To find an alternative method for spatio-temporal analysis with robustness and high estimation efficiency, we combine information across multiple quantiles and propose a Bayesian spatio-temporal weighted composite quantile regression (ST-WCQR) model. An easy-to-implement Gibbs sampling algorithm is provided based on the asymmetric Laplace mixture representation of the error term. Extensive simulation studies show that ST-WCQR outperforms existing methods for skewed error distributions. We apply ST-WCQR to investigate how patients&#39; characteristics affected the inpatient hospital costs for alcohol-related disorders and identify areas that could be targeted for cost reduction in New York State from 2015 to 2017.},

We provide a probabilistic framework for describing how information is updated in a forensic analysis setting by using the ratio form of Bayes&#39; rule. We analyse results from empirical studies using this framework and employ simulations to demonstrate how bias can be compounded where experiments do not exist. We find that even minor biases in the earlier stages of forensic analysis can lead to large, compounded biases in the final determination of guilt in a criminal trial.},

In this paper, in line with the recent literature, we consider a classification with more than three statuses and estimate related population parameters for 611 local labour market areas using data from the 2012 Italian Labour Force Survey, administrative registers and the 2011 Census. As for the methodology, we propose multinomial expectile regression models. These models provide a means to utilise M $$ M $$ -quantile type approaches, which have been shown to be a useful alternative to mixed model approaches when parametric assumptions on the distribution of random effects cannot be met. Via a large-scale simulation study, we show how this novel approach is much faster and provides reliable results when compared to multinomial mixed model approaches, and works for any number of categories rather than just a small number of categories as is more commonly the case with existing methods. Furthermore, the proposed approach potentially provides a framework for developing other methods for prediction with multi-category outcomes.},

  abstract = {There is a growing literature on finding rules by which to assign treatment based on an individual&#39;s characteristics such that a desired outcome under the intervention is maximised. A related goal entails identifying a sub-population of individuals predicted to have a harmful indirect effect (the effect of treatment on an outcome through mediators), perhaps even in the presence of a predicted beneficial total treatment effect. In some cases, the implications of a likely harmful indirect effect may outweigh an anticipated beneficial total treatment effect, and would motivate further discussion of whether to treat identified individuals. We build on the mediation and optimal treatment rule literatures to propose a method of identifying a subgroup for which the treatment effect through the mediator is expected to be harmful. Our approach is non-parametric, incorporates post-treatment confounders of the mediator–outcome relationship, and does not make restrictions on the distribution of baseline covariates, mediating variables or outcomes. We apply the proposed approach to identify a subgroup of boys in the Moving To Opportunity housing voucher experiment who are predicted to have a harmful indirect effect of housing voucher receipt on subsequent psychiatric disorder incidence through aspects of their school and neighbourhood environments.},

Higher opportunity costs of having children are found to be associated with lower fertility within a country, while the magnitude of the adjustment differs strongly across countries. In Germany, fertility decisions are found to depend more on individual circumstances than in France, where better public childcare support enhances the compatibility between family and professional life.},

We bring together within one framework various determinants of NEET status, such as educational achievements, non-cognitive skills, family socio-economic factors, aspirations, mental health and local labour market conditions. We model the educational progress over multiple periods through the life of the young person, up to the completion of compulsory schooling. By taking into account this progression, we can determine the direct and indirect impacts of different determinants of NEET status, and the stage in the life of the young person at which each determinant is important. Our findings suggest that cognitive ability (as measured by educational achievements) remains the key predictor of NEET status. Further, while a range of individual and family factors determines NEET status, the impact of most of these factors is largely indirect, through ability formation and not necessarily direct. To gauge the relative contributions of various determinants, we conduct simulations to predict the probability of the young person being NEET under different scenarios and assumptions. The exercise indicates that the effects of aspirations of the young person, their school engagement, and the local youth unemployment rate on the likelihood of the young person being NEET are as large as boosting their cognitive skills.},

This paper documents the feasibility of collecting pictures instead of answers in a web survey and studies the consequences of using pictures/questions or a choice for components of Total Survey Error. We find that respondents in our study were much more willing to answer survey questions than to take pictures, but this difference depended on the difficulty of the topic.

It is crucial, nevertheless, to understand its limitations. Although some research have explored the potential errors of metered data, a systematic categorisation and conceptualisation of these errors are missing. Inspired by the Total Survey Error, we present a Total Error framework for digital traces collected with Meters (TEM). The TEM framework (1) describes the data generation and the analysis process for metered data and (2) documents the sources of bias and variance that may arise in each step of this process. Using a case study we also show how the TEM can be applied in real life to identify, quantify and reduce metered data errors. Results suggest that metered data might indeed be affected by the error sources identified in our framework and, to some extent, biased. This framework can help improve the quality of both stand-alone metered data research projects, as well as foster the understanding of how and when survey and metered data can be combined.},

  abstract = {Combining surveys and digital trace data can enhance the analytic potential of both data types. We present two studies that examine factors influencing data sharing behaviour of survey respondents for different types of digital trace data: Facebook, Twitter, Spotify and health app data. Across those data types, we compared the relative impact of four factors on data sharing: data sharing method, respondent characteristics, sample composition and incentives. The results show that data sharing rates differ substantially across data types. Two particularly important factors predicting data sharing behaviour are the incentive size and data sharing method, which are both directly related to task difficulty and respondent burden. In sum, the paper reveals systematic variation in the willingness to share additional data which need to be considered in research designs linking surveys and digital traces.},

It also investigates two types of factors, those related to the individual and to the design of the consent request. Individual-level factors include respondents&#39; attitudes towards helpful behaviours, privacy concerns and social media engagement patterns. The design factor focuses on the position of the consent request within the interview. These investigations were conducted using data that was collected from a web survey on a sample of Twitter users selected from an adult online probability panel in the United States. The sample was randomly divided into two groups, those who received the consent to link request at the beginning of the survey, and others who received the request towards the end of the survey. Privacy concerns, measures of social media engagement and consent request placement were all found to be related to consent to link. The findings have important implications for designing future studies that aim at linking social media data with survey data.},

Both approaches depend on the accuracy of the data that Facebook provides about its users, but little is known about how accurate these data are. We address this gap in a large-scale, cross-national online survey ( N = 137,224), in which we compare self-reported and Facebook-classified demographic information (sex, age and region of residence). Our results suggest that Facebook&#39;s advertising platform can be fruitfully used for conducing social science research if additional steps are taken to assess the accuracy of the characteristics under consideration.},

Using comprehensive administrative data, we formulate and test several theory-driven hypotheses on survey participation and evaluate the potential of various machine learning algorithms for non-response bias adjustment. The analysis revealed that while the response rate decreased during the decade, no concomitant increase in aggregate non-response bias was observed. Several hypotheses of participation were at least partially supported. Lastly, the expanded use of administrative data reduced non-response bias over the standard weighting variables, but only limited evidence was found for further non-response bias reduction through the use of machine learning methods.},

The rich information on PASS members from previous survey waves allows us to compare participants and non-participants in the IAB-SMART study at the individual stages of the participation process and across the different types of data collected. We find that 14.5 percent of the invited smartphone users installed the app, between 12.2 and 13.4 percent provided the different types of passively collected data, and 10.8 percent provided all types of data at least once. Likelihood to participate was smaller among women, decreased with age and increased with educational attainment, German citizenship, and PASS tenure. We find non-participation bias in substantive variables, including overestimation of social media usage and social network size and underestimation of non-working status.},

  abstract = {The effect of school closure on the spread of COVID-19 has been discussed intensively in the literature and the news. To capture the interdependencies between children and adults, we consider daily age-stratified incidence data and contact patterns between age groups which change over time to reflect social distancing policy indicators. We fit a multivariate time-series endemic–epidemic model to such data from the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland and use the model to predict the age-specific incidence in a counterfactual approach (with and without school closures). The results indicate a 17\% median increase of incidence in the youngest age group (0–14 year olds), whereas the relative increase in the other age groups drops to values between 2\% and 3\%. We argue that our approach is more informative to policy makers than summarising the effect of school closures with time-dependent effective reproduction numbers, which are difficult to estimate due to the sparsity of incidence counts within the relevant age groups.},

  abstract = {The reproduction number R $$ R $$ has been a central metric of the COVID-19 pandemic response, published weekly by the UK government and regularly reported in the media. Here, we provide a formal definition and discuss the advantages and most common misconceptions around this quantity. We consider the intuition behind different formulations of R $$ R $$ , the complexities in its estimation (including the unavoidable lags involved), and its value compared to other indicators (e.g. the growth rate) that can be directly observed from aggregate surveillance data and react more promptly to changes in epidemic trend. As models become more sophisticated, with age and/or spatial structure, formulating R $$ R $$ becomes increasingly complicated and inevitably model-dependent. We present some models currently used in the UK pandemic response as examples. Ultimately, limitations in the available data streams, data quality and time constraints force pragmatic choices to be made on a quantity that is an average across time, space, social structure and settings. Effectively communicating these challenges is important but often difficult in an emergency.},

The model fits within a general framework for semi-mechanistic Bayesian models of the epidemic based on renewal equations, with some important innovations, including a random walk modelling the reproduction number, incorporating information from different sources, including surveys to estimate the time-varying proportion of infections that lead to reported cases or deaths, and modelling the underlying infections as latent random variables. The model is designed to be updated daily using publicly available data. We envisage the model to be useful for now-casting and short-term projections of the epidemic as well as estimating historical trends. The model fits are available on a public website: https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/covid19local . The model is currently being used by the Scottish government to inform their interventions.},

  abstract = {The basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) is an established concept to describe the potential for an infectious disease to cause an epidemic and to derive estimates of the required effect of interventions for successful control. Calculating R 0 from simple deterministic transmission models may result in biased estimates when important sources of heterogeneity related to transmission and control are ignored. Using stochastic simulations with a geographically stratified individual-based SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) model, we illustrate that if heterogeneity is ignored (i.e. no or too little assumed interindividual variation or assortative mixing) this may substantially overestimate the transmission rate and the potential course of the epidemic. Consequently, predictions for the impact of interventions then become relatively pessimistic. However, should such an intervention be suspended, then the potential for a consecutive epidemic wave will depend strongly on assumptions about heterogeneity, with more heterogeneity resulting in lower remaining epidemic potential, due to selection and depletion of high-risk individuals during the early stages of the epidemic. These phenomena have likely also affected current model predictions regarding COVID-19, as most transmission models assume homogeneous mixing or at most employ a simple age stratification, thereby leading to overcautious predictions of durations of lockdowns and required vaccine coverage levels.},

Estimation methods for R t have a long history, have been widely developed and are now enhanced by application to the COVID-19 pandemic. While retrospective analyses of R t have provided insight into epidemic dynamics and the effects of control strategies in prior outbreaks, misconceptions around the interpretation of R t have arisen with broader recognition and near real-time monitoring of this parameter alongside reported case data during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we discuss some widespread misunderstandings regarding the use of R t as a barometer for population risk and its related use as an ‘on/off’ switch for policy decisions regarding relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Computation of R t from downstream data (e.g. hospitalizations) when infection counts are unreliable exacerbates lags between when transmission happens and when events are recorded. We also discuss analyses that have shown various relationships between R t and measures of mobility, vaccination coverage and a test–trace–isolation intervention in different settings.},

The instantaneous reproduction number, R t , is predominant among these statistics, measuring the average ability of an infection to multiply. However, R t encodes no temporal information and is sensitive to modelling assumptions. Consequently, some have proposed the epidemic growth rate, r t , that is, the rate of change of the log-transformed case incidence, as a more temporally meaningful and model-agnostic policy guide. We examine this assertion, identifying if and when estimates of r t are more informative than those of R t . We assess their relative strengths both for learning about pathogen transmission mechanisms and for guiding public health interventions in real time.},

Methods commonly used to investigate this hypothesis are unable to simultaneously acknowledge that childlessness entails a heterogeneous and processual ‘non-event’ which interrelates with multiple life domains. I use Bayesian multivariate hierarchical growth curve modelling to facilitate synchronous incorporation of these substantive complexities. I construct prospective interdependent life course trajectories of socio-economic well-being for eventual parents and permanently childless adults; distinguishing voluntary, involuntary, circumstantial and indecisive childlessness. Using 1970 British Cohort Study data, I find that parents and voluntarily childless adults are more satisfied with life than non-voluntarily childless adults. Voluntarily and circumstantially childless women earn most and mothers least, while fathers outearn childless men. (Dis)advantage in economic and male subjective well-being accumulates throughout the life course. Group differences in partnerships, employment, education and health, more than childbearing behaviours themselves, explain the (growth of) these socio-economic differentials. The findings have implications for policies addressing socio-economic inequalities by both parental status and gender. The proposed approach provides valuable for assessing cumulative (dis)advantage in interrelated life domains via an unclearly marked heterogeneous process, not only in the context of childlessness but also other life course topics.},

However, the prevalence of large, and increasing, volumes of administrative and alternative data-sources motivates the need for such methods to be adapted for high-dimensional settings. In this article, we propose a novel sparse temporal-disaggregation procedure and contrast this with the classical Chow–Lin method. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed method through simulation study, highlighting various advantages realised. We also explore its application to disaggregation of UK GDP data, demonstrating the method&#39;s ability to operate when the number of potential indicators is greater than the number of low-frequency observations.},

  abstract = {The expected number of secondary infections arising from each index case, referred to as the reproduction or R $$ R $$ number, is a vital summary statistic for understanding and managing epidemic diseases. There are many methods for estimating R $$ R $$ ; however, few explicitly model heterogeneous disease reproduction, which gives rise to superspreading within the population. We propose a parsimonious discrete-time branching process model for epidemic curves that incorporates heterogeneous individual reproduction numbers. Our Bayesian approach to inference illustrates that this heterogeneity results in less certainty on estimates of the time-varying cohort reproduction number R t $$ {R}_t $$ . We apply these methods to a COVID-19 epidemic curve for the Republic of Ireland and find support for heterogeneous disease reproduction. Our analysis allows us to estimate the expected proportion of secondary infections attributable to the most infectious proportion of the population. For example, we estimate that the 20\% most infectious index cases account for approximately 75\%–98\% of the expected secondary infections with 95\% posterior probability. In addition, we highlight that heterogeneity is a vital consideration when estimating R t $$ {R}_t $$ .},

  abstract = {The rapid finding of effective therapeutics requires efficient use of available resources in clinical trials. Covariate adjustment can yield statistical estimates with improved precision, resulting in a reduction in the number of participants required to draw futility or efficacy conclusions. We focus on time-to-event and ordinal outcomes. When more than a few baseline covariates are available, a key question for covariate adjustment in randomised studies is how to fit a model relating the outcome and the baseline covariates to maximise precision. We present a novel theoretical result establishing conditions for asymptotic normality of a variety of covariate-adjusted estimators that rely on machine learning (e.g., ℓ 1 $$ {\ell}_1 $$ -regularisation, Random Forests, XGBoost, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines [MARS]), under the assumption that outcome data are missing completely at random. We further present a consistent estimator of the asymptotic variance. Importantly, the conditions do not require the machine learning methods to converge to the true outcome distribution conditional on baseline variables, as long as they converge to some (possibly incorrect) limit. We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the aforementioned prediction methods in COVID-19 trials. Our simulation is based on resampling longitudinal data from over 1500 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 at Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital. We found that using ℓ 1 $$ {\ell}_1 $$ -regularisation led to estimators and corresponding hypothesis tests that control type 1 error and are more precise than an unadjusted estimator across all sample sizes tested. We also show that when covariates are not prognostic of the outcome, ℓ 1 $$ {\ell}_1 $$ -regularisation remains as precise as the unadjusted estimator, even at small sample sizes ( n = 100 $$ n=100 $$ ). We give an R package adjrct that performs model-robust covariate adjustment for ordinal and time-to-event outcomes.},

Ex ante information on the spatial probability distribution of early infections can guide governments to better target protection efforts. We propose a two-stage statistical approach to spatially map the ex ante importation risk of COVID-19 and its uncertainty across Indonesia based on a minimal set of routinely available input data related to the Indonesian flight network, traffic and population data, and geographical information. In a first step, we use a generalised additive model to predict the ex ante COVID-19 risk for 78 domestic Indonesian airports based on data from a global model on the disease spread and covariates associated with Indonesian airport network flight data prior to the global COVID-19 outbreak. In a second step, we apply a Bayesian geostatistical model to propagate the estimated COVID-19 risk from the airports to all of Indonesia using freely available spatial covariates including traffic density, population and two spatial distance metrics. The results of our analysis are illustrated using exceedance probability surface maps, which provide policy-relevant information accounting for the uncertainty of the estimates on the location of areas at risk and those that might require further data collection.},

  abstract = {Reducing neonatal and child mortality is a global priority. In countries without comprehensive vital registration data to inform policy and planning, statistical modelling is used to estimate the distribution of key causes of death. This modelling presents challenges given that the input data are few, noisy, often not nationally representative of the country from which they are derived, and often do not report separately on all of the key causes. As more nationally representative data come to be available, it becomes possible to produce country estimates that go beyond fixed-effects models with national-level covariates by incorporating country-specific random effects. However, the existing frequentist multinomial model is limited by convergence problems when adding random effects, and had not incorporated a covariate selection procedure simultaneously over all causes. We report here on the translation of a fixed effects, frequentist model into a Bayesian framework to address these problems, incorporating a misclassification matrix with the potential to correct for mis-reported as well as unreported causes. We apply the new method and compare the model parameters and predicted distributions of eight key causes of death with those based on the previous, frequentist model.},

  abstract = {Estimating poverty and inequality parameters for small sub-populations with adequate precision is often beyond the reach of ordinary survey-weighted methods because of small sample sizes. In small area estimation, survey data and auxiliary information are combined, in most cases using a model. In this paper, motivated by the analysis of EU-SILC data for Italy, we target the estimation of a selection of poverty and inequality indicators, that is mean, headcount ratio and quintile share ratio, adopting a Bayesian approach. We consider unit-level models specified on the log transformation of a skewed variable (equivalized income). We show how a finite mixture of log-normals provides a substantial improvement in the quality of fit with respect to a single log-normal model. Unfortunately, working with these distributions leads, for some estimands, to the non-existence of posterior moments whenever priors for the variance components are not carefully chosen, as our theoretical results show. To allow the use of moments in posterior summaries, we recommend generalized inverse Gaussian distributions as priors for variance components, guiding the choice of hyperparameters.},

In the advanced internal ratings-based approach, banks are obliged to use their own estimates of exposure at default using credit conversion factors. For volatile segments, additional downturn estimates are required. Using the world&#39;s largest database of defaulted credit lines from the US and Europe and macroeconomic variables, we apply a Bayesian mixed effect quantile regression and find strongly varying covariate effects over the whole conditional distribution of credit conversion factors and especially between United States and Europe. If macroeconomic variables do not provide adequate downturn estimates, the model is enhanced by random effects. Results from European credit lines suggest that high conversion factors are driven by random effects rather than observable covariates. We further show that the impact of the economic surrounding highly depends on the level of utilization one year prior default, suggesting that credit lines with high drawdown potential are most affected by economic downturns and hence bear the highest risk in crisis periods.},

  abstract = {The current paper is motivated by longitudinal progress tests given to medical students in the United Kingdom, which are used to assess students&#39; applied medical knowledge during their learning programme. The main analytic interest is the maximum competency each student achieves on the assessment and the point in the programme at which each student attains this competency. Direct estimates of maximum competency and the time at which students realised this competency are useful for optimising allocation of classroom and hands-on experiences, as well as to inform curriculum development. Models have been developed for estimating the timing of a threshold or cut-off common across people or for estimating different rates of change that occur for different phases of time. However, less attention has been paid to models interested in the timing of a value that can change across people—such as maximum competency—and where growth is flat in some phases of time. In this paper, we build a model that borrows pieces from various existing methods such as reparameterisations of polynomial models, splines for ceiling effects, time-to-criterion models, dynamic measurement and non-linear mixed-effect models to allow the motivating questions to be addressed from these data.},

We present four extensions of the classical Taylor&#39;s law (TL): (1) a cubic extension of the linear TL describes the mean–variance relationship of human mortality at subnational levels well; (2) in a time series, long-run variance measures not only variance but also autocovariance, and it is a more suitable measure than variance alone to capture temporal/spatial correlation; (3) an extension of the classical equally weighted spatial variance takes account of synchrony and proximity; (4) robust linear regression estimators of TL parameters reduce vulnerability to outliers. Applying the proposed methods to age-specific Japanese subnational death rates from 1975 to 2018, we study temporal and spatial variations, compare different coefficient estimators, and interpret the implications. We apply a clustering algorithm to the estimated TL coefficients and find that cluster memberships are strongly related to prefectural gross domestic product. The time series of spatial TL coefficients has a decreasing trend that confirms the narrowing gap between rural and urban mortality in Japan.},

Identifying the causal effect of hypergamy violation on domestic violence, however, is challenging due to unmeasured confounding and reverse causality. To overcome these difficulties, we utilize a non-parametric bounds approach. Employing this approach, we find strong evidence that violation of hypergamy leads to a significant increase in domestic violence. Furthermore, we provide suggestive evidence that this result arises because violation of hypergamy is likely to undermine patriarchal beliefs and norms about gender roles, and also because it is likely to increase men&#39;s likelihood of using domestic violence as an instrument to sabotage their wives&#39; labour market prospects. Our findings suggest that policies that seek to empower women and promote gender equality might paradoxically increase women&#39;s exposure to domestic violence.},

  abstract = {In causal inference, natural strata are a new compromise between conventional strata and matching in a fixed ratio, say pair matching or matching two controls to each treated individual. Like matching in a fixed ratio, natural strata: (a) do not require weights, (b) balance many measured covariates beyond those that define the strata and (c) provide closer balance for a measured continuous covariate coarsely cut to form strata. Unlike matching in a fixed ratio, the ratio of controls to treated individuals need not be an integer, so if the data permit a fixed ratio comparison of 1-to-2.5 or even 1-to-0.75, then these ratios are possible using natural strata. Optimal natural strata are defined by a moderate number of fixed strata plus an integer program that minimizes the imbalance in many other measured covariates that are not used to specify the strata. Solving large integer programs is computationally difficult. A tool in the theory of approximation algorithms is ‘randomized rounding of a linear program’ to produce an integer solution: a fractional solution to a linear program defines a probability distribution for an integer-valued random variable which is sampled. We apply this tool in a new way to produce natural strata and develop new properties of randomized rounding in this context. When proportional strata are impractical, we approximate them by minimizing the earthmover distance to proportionality. The method is applied to study birth outcomes for older and younger mothers in the United States in 2018. An R package natstrat is available at CRAN .},

Often, the nearest neighbour imputation method is used to handle such incomplete multinomial data. In this article, we investigate the nearest neighbour ratio imputation (NNRI) estimator, in which auxiliary variables are used to identify the closest donor and the vector of proportions from the donor is applied to the total of the recipient to implement ratio imputation. To estimate the asymptotic variance, we first treat the NNRI as a special case of predictive matching imputation and build on earlier work to linearize the imputed estimate. To account for the non-negligible sampling fractions, parametric and generalized additive models are employed to incorporate the smoothness of the imputation estimator, which results in a valid variance estimator. We apply the proposed method to estimate expenditures detail items based on empirical data from the 2018 collection of the Service Annual Survey, conducted by the United States Census Bureau. Our simulation results demonstrate the validity of our proposed estimators and also confirm that the derived variance estimators have good performance even when the sampling fraction is non-negligible.},

These investigations were based on very small datasets but were momentous in the initial global reactions to the pandemic. The article discusses the initial evidence of high infectiousness of COVID-19 and why that conclusion was not reached faster than in reality. Further reanalyses of some published COVID-19 studies show that the epidemic growth was dramatically underestimated by compartmental models, and the lack of fit could have been clearly identified by simple data visualization. Finally, some lessons for statisticians are discussed.},

We use recently developed generalised network autoregressive (GNAR) models, using trade-determined networks, to model and forecast the Purchasing Managers&#39; Indices for a number of countries. We use networks that link countries where the links themselves, or their weights, are determined by the degree of export trade between the countries. We extend these models to include node-specific time series exogenous variables (GNARX models), using this to incorporate COVID-19 mitigation stringency indices and COVID-19 death rates into our analysis. The highly parsimonious GNAR models considerably outperform vector autoregressive models in terms of mean-squared forecasting error and our GNARX models themselves outperform GNAR ones. Further mixed frequency modelling predicts the extent to which that the UK economy will be affected by harsher, weaker or no interventions.},

This paper develops a general approach for determining efficient sampling designs for probability-weighted maximum likelihood estimators and considers application to generalized linear models. We allow for non-ignorable sampling, including outcome-dependent sampling. The new designs have probabilities of selection closely related to influence statistics such as dfbeta and Cook&#39;s distance. The new approach is shown to perform well in a simulation based on data from the New Zealand Health Survey.},

Bivariate time series models with claimant count auxiliary data and multivariate models combining survey data of several states are investigated. The results demonstrated the benefits of the univariate state-space approach to produce unemployment official statistics for Brazil.

  abstract = {Spatially disaggregated income indicators are typically estimated by using model-based methods that assume access to auxiliary information from population micro-data. In many countries like Germany and the UK population micro-data are not publicly available. In this work we propose small area methodology when only aggregate population-level auxiliary information is available. We use data-driven transformations of the response to satisfy the parametric assumptions of the used models. In the absence of population micro-data, appropriate bias-corrections for small area prediction are needed. Under the approach we propose in this paper, aggregate statistics (means and covariances) and kernel density estimation are used to resolve the issue of not having access to population micro-data. We further explore the estimation of the mean squared error using the parametric bootstrap. Extensive model-based and design-based simulations are used to compare the proposed method to alternative methods. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to the 2011 Socio-Economic Panel and aggregate census information from the same year to estimate the average income for 96 regional planning regions in Germany.},

We use the sample microdata to infer population parameters when the population is unknown, and estimate the risk of re-identification based on the notion of population uniqueness using probabilistic modelling. We also introduce a new approach to measure the risk of re-identification for a subpopulation in a register that is not representative of the general population, for example a register of cancer patients. In addition, we can use the additional information from the register to measure the risk of re-identification for the sample microdata. This new approach was developed by the two authors and is published here for the first time. We demonstrate this approach in an application study based on UK census data where we can compare the estimated risk measures to the known truth.},

There are certain characteristics of administrative databases, such as their size, which present challenges from a synthesis perspective and require special attention. This paper, through the fitting of saturated count models, presents a synthesis method that is suitable for administrative databases. It is tuned by two parameters, σ and α . The method allows large categorical data sets to be synthesized quickly and allows risk and utility metrics to be satisfied a priori , that is, prior to synthetic data generation. The paper explores how the flexibility afforded by two-parameter count models (the negative binomial and Poisson-inverse Gaussian) can be utilised to protect respondents&#39;—especially uniques&#39;—privacy in synthetic data. Finally, an empirical example is carried out through the synthesis of a database which can be viewed as a good substitute to the English School Census.},

  abstract = {Sampling is informative when probabilities of sample inclusion depend on unknown variables that are correlated with a response variable of interest. When sample inclusion probabilities are available, inverse probability weighting can be used to account for informative sampling in such a situation, although usually at the cost of less precise inference. This paper reviews two important research contributions by Chris Skinner that modify these weights to reduce their variability while at the same time retaining consistency of the weighted estimators. In some cases, however, sample inclusion probabilities are not known, and are estimated as propensity scores. This is often the situation in causal analysis, and double robust methods that protect against the resulting misspecification of the sampling process have been the focus of much recent research. In this paper we propose two model-assisted modifications to the popular inverse propensity score weighted estimator of an average treatment effect, and then illustrate their use in a causal analysis of a rainfall enhancement experiment that was carried out in Oman between 2013 and 2018.},

  abstract = {Official monthly statistics about the Dutch labour force are based on the Dutch Labour Force Survey (LFS). The LFS is a continuously conducted survey that is designed as a rotating panel design. Data collection among selected households is based on a mixed-mode design that uses web interviewing, telephone interviewing and face-to-face interviewing. Monthly estimates about the labour force are obtained with a structural time series model. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face interviewing stopped. It was anticipated that this would have a systematic effect on the outcomes of the LFS and that the lockdown at the same time affected the real monthly labour force figures. The lockdown indeed marked a sharp turning point in the evolution of the series of the monthly labour force figures and strongly increased the volatility of these series. In this paper, it is explained how Statistics Netherlands produced monthly labour force figures during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is shown how the sudden change in the mode effects, because face-to-face interviewing stopped, were separated from real period-to-period changes in the labour force figures. It is also explained how the time series model is adapted to the increased volatility in the labour force figures.},

There is an increasing need for greater confidentiality protection during data collection and processing by National Statistical Offices. In particular, various transactions and remote sensing signals are examples of useful but very detailed big data that can be highly sensitive. Moreover, possible conflicts of interest may arise for data suppliers who operate commercially. In this paper, we formulate statistical disclosure control for data collection and processing as an optimisation problem. Even when it is difficult to specify and solve the problem unequivocally, the formulation can still provide the basis for comparing different disclosure control methods. We develop a general compartmented system that adapts and implements non-perturbative methods in the related fields of linking sensitive data and secure computation. We illustrate how the system can be configured to yield variously required tables and microdata sets with sufficiently low disclosure risks.},

In a pioneering paper, Scott and Smith ( Journal of the American Statistical Association , 1969, 64 , 830–840) proposed a Bayesian model based or prediction approach to estimating a finite population mean under two-stage cluster sampling. We provide a brief account of their pioneering work. We review two methods for the analysis of two-level models based on matching two-stage samples. Those methods are based on pseudo maximum likelihood and pseudo composite likelihood taking account of design weights. We then propose a new method for analysis of two-level models based on a normal approximation to the estimated cluster effects and taking account of design weights. This method does not require cluster sizes to be constants or unrelated to cluster effects. We evaluate the relative performance of the three methods in a simulation study. Finally, we apply the methods to real data obtained from 2011 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS).},

Estimation treats the post-strata as strata for standard stratified-sample estimation. Samples often contain empty post-strata requiring adjustment to the estimation procedure. To avoid empty post-strata, we propose using the sample distribution function of an auxiliary variable to define the post-strata. We show that the large-sample efficiency of the sample-based post-stratification procedure is the same as that of the equivalently defined population-based procedure. In the simulation, the sample-based procedure was slightly more efficient than the classical procedure. The Monte Carlo coverage of a nominal 95\% interval was approximately 95\% for the sample-based procedure and approximately 94\% for the classical procedure.},

I argue that these challenges gave impetus to fruitful new directions in the merging of statistical principles with constraints of agility, responsiveness and societal responsibilities. The lessons learned from this will strengthen the long-term impact of the discipline and of the Society. The need to evaluate policies even in emergency, and to strive for statistical interoperability in future disease surveillance systems is highlighted.

  abstract = {In this paper, under the stationary α -mixing dependent samples, we develop a novel nonlinear modal regression for time series sequences and establish the consistency and asymptotic property of the proposed nonlinear modal estimator with a shrinking bandwidth h under certain regularity conditions. The asymptotic distribution is shown to be identical to the one derived from the independent observations, whereas the convergence rate ( n h 3 in which n is the sample size) is slower than that in the nonlinear mean regression. We numerically estimate the proposed nonlinear modal regression model by the use of a modified modal expectation–maximization (MEM) algorithm in conjunction with Taylor expansion. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to demonstrate the good finite sample (prediction) performance of the newly proposed model. We also construct a specified nonlinear modal regression to match the available daily new cases and new deaths data of the COVID-19 outbreak at the state/region level in the United States, and provide forward predictions up to 130 days ahead (from 24 August 2020 to 31 December 2020). In comparison to the traditional nonlinear regressions, the suggested model can fit the COVID-19 data better and produce more precise predictions. The prediction results indicate that there are systematic differences in spreading distributions among states/regions. For most western and eastern states, they have many serious COVID-19 burdens compared to Midwest. We hope that the built nonlinear modal regression can help policymakers to implement fast actions to curb the spread of the infection, avoid overburdening the health system and understand the development of COVID-19 from some points.},

  abstract = {As meta-analysis of multiple diagnostic tests impacts clinical decision making and patient health, there is an increasing body of research in models and methods for meta-analysis of studies comparing multiple diagnostic tests. The application of the existing models to compare the accuracy of three or more tests suffers from the curse of multi-dimensionality, that is, either the number of model parameters increases rapidly or high dimensional integration is required. To overcome these issues in joint meta-analysis of studies comparing T &gt; 2 diagnostic tests in a multiple tests design with a gold standard, we propose a model that assumes the true positives and true negatives for each test are conditionally independent and binomially distributed given the 2 T -variate latent vector of sensitivities and specificities. For the random effects distribution, we employ a one-factor copula that provides tail dependence or tail asymmetry. Maximum likelihood estimation of the model is straightforward as the derivation of the likelihood requires bi-dimensional instead of 2 T -dimensional integration. Our methodology is demonstrated with an extensive simulation study and an application example that determines which is the best test for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.},

We rely on multichannel sequence analysis (MSA) and on the Partitioning around Medoids algorithm to cluster individuals with similar experiences, and relate clusters to PTs via multinomial regression. We also develop a procedure to apply standard and MSA to truncated trajectories. This enables inclusion of individuals whose trajectories were otherwise observed for a limited age span, notably belonging to younger cohorts.

  abstract = {When an epidemic outbreak occurs, the demand for healthcare services may increase because more people may seek medical care regardless of their infection status. On the other hand, it may decrease because of the fear of getting infected while seeking treatment. Moreover, the epidemic may have lasting effects on individuals&#39; healthcare service usage after it ends. Armed with a representative and detailed individual level healthcare usage dataset, we examine the dynamic effect of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak which occurred in South Korea in 2015. To be more specific, we select patients who lived in regions where the MERS outbreak took place as the treatment group, and patients who lived in regions where MERS-related events never occurred as the control group. Using this sample, we apply a difference-in-difference approach with propensity score matching to investigate the effect of epidemic disease on individuals&#39; healthcare service usage. We find that healthcare visits to treat minor diseases during the MERS outbreak showed a significant decrease of 3.7\%. This effect was pronounced in large tertiary hospitals (22.7\%) and among minors under age 10 (10.1\%). We could not find significant changes in visits to treat serious diseases. However, visits to the emergency department showed a temporary but significant decrease (18.1\%). After the end of the epidemic, healthcare visits to treat minor diseases significantly increased by 4.0\%. This after-effect was pronounced in secondary hospitals (8.7\%) and primary healthcare facilities (3.9\%) and among minors under age 10. We discuss the implications of our findings for various stakeholders.},

  abstract = {Understanding the usage patterns for bike-sharing systems is essential in terms of supporting and enhancing operational planning for such schemes. Studies have demonstrated how factors such as weather conditions influence the number of bikes that should be available at bike-sharing stations at certain times during the day. However, the influences of these factors usually vary over the course of a day, and if there is good temporal resolution, there could also be significant effects only for some hours/minutes (rush hours, the hours when shops are open and so forth). Thus, in this paper, an analysis of Helsinki&#39;s bike-sharing data from 2017 is conducted that considers full temporal and spatial resolutions. The station hire data are analysed in a spatiotemporal functional setting, where the number of bikes at a station is defined as a continuous function of the time of day. For this completely novel approach, we apply a functional spatiotemporal hierarchical model to investigate the effect of environmental factors and the magnitude of the spatial and temporal dependence. Challenges in computational complexity are faced using a Monte Carlo subsampling approach. The results show the necessity of splitting the bike-sharing stations into two clusters based on the similarity of their spatiotemporal functional observations in order to model the station hire data of Helsinki&#39;s bike-sharing system effectively.},

Historians have a good record of where these people went across the Atlantic, but little is known about where individuals were from or enslaved within Africa. In this work, we develop a novel statistical modelling strategy to describe the enslavement of people given documented violent conflict, the transport of enslaved peoples from their location of capture to their port of departure, and—given an enslaved individual&#39;s location of departure—that person&#39;s probability of origin. We combine spatial prediction of conflict density via kriging with a Markov decision process characterising intra-African transportation. The results of this model can be visualised using an interactive web application to plot—for the first time—estimated conditional probabilities of historical origins during the African diaspora. Understanding the likely origins within Africa of enslaved people may have ramifications for the history of the Atlantic world, whereby the ocean connects , rather than disconnects, Africa, the Americas, and Europe.},

  abstract = {Regression discontinuity designs (RDDs) have been developed for the estimation of treatment effects using observational data, where a treatment is administered using an externally defined decision rule, linked to a continuous assignment variable. Typically, RDDs have been applied to situations where the outcome of interest is continuous and non-temporal. Conversely, RDDs for time-to-event outcomes have received less attention, despite such outcomes being common in many applications. We explore RDDs for a time-to-event outcome subject to right censoring. An accelerated failure time (AFT) approach is used to establish a treatment effect estimate for a fuzzy RDD (where treatment is not always strictly applied according to the decision rule). This estimation approach is robust to different levels of fuzziness and unobserved confounding, assessed using simulation studies and compares favourably to established structural AFT models. A motivating example is presented in which models are fitted to estimate the effect of metformin on mortality and cardiovascular disease rate using real observational data from UK Primary Care.},

Specifically, we estimate a ‘structural’ model based on the SIR epidemiological model extended to incorporate underreporting. The results indicate significant underreporting by magnitudes that align with existing research and conjectures by public health experts. While our approach requires some strong assumptions, these assumptions are very different from the equally strong assumptions required by other approaches addressing underreporting in the assessment of the extent of the pandemic.

This paper demonstrates a network lattice approach for identifying road segments of particular concern, based on a case study of a major city (Leeds, UK), in which 5862 crashes of different severities were recorded over an 8-year period (2011–2018). We consider a family of Bayesian hierarchical models that include spatially structured and unstructured random effects to capture the dependencies between the severity levels. Results highlight roads that are more prone to collisions, relative to estimated traffic volumes, in the north-west and south of city centre. We analyse the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), proposing a novel procedure to investigate the presence of MAUP on a network lattice. We conclude that our methods enable a reliable estimation of road safety levels to help identify ‘hotspots’ on the road network and to inform effective local interventions.},

First, we introduce the setup and the issues related to conducting causal inference with observational or non-fully randomized data, and how these issues can be tackled with the help of statistical learning tools. Then, we review and develop a unifying taxonomy of the existing state-of-the-art frameworks that allow for individual treatment effects estimation via non-parametric regression models. After presenting a brief overview on the problem of model selection, we illustrate the performance of some of the methods on three different simulated studies.

  abstract = {We investigate the transnational transferability of statistical screening methods originally developed using Swiss data for detecting bid-rigging cartels in Japan. We find that combining screens with machine learning (either a random forest or an ensemble method consisting of six different algorithms) to classify collusive versus competitive tenders entails (depending on the model) correct classification rates of 88\%–97\% when training and testing the method on the Okinawa bid-rigging cartel. As in Switzerland, bid rigging in Okinawa reduced the variance and increased the asymmetry in the distribution of bids. When training the models in data from one country to test their performance in the data from the other country, imbalance increases between the correct prediction of truly collusive and competitive tenders for all machine learners and classification rates go down substantially when using the random forest as machine learner, due to some screens for competitive Japanese tenders being similar to those for collusive Swiss tenders. Demeaning the screens reduces such distortions due to institutional differences across countries such that correct classification rates based on training in one and testing in the other country amount to 85\% and to 90\% when using the ensemble method as machine learner, which generally outperforms the random forest.},

  abstract = {Pairwise comparison models are an important type of latent attribute measurement model with broad applications in the social and behavioural sciences. Current pairwise comparison models are typically unidimensional. The existing multidimensional pairwise comparison models tend to be difficult to interpret and they are unable to identify groups of raters that share the same rater-specific parameters. To fill this gap, we propose a new multidimensional pairwise comparison model with enhanced interpretability which explicitly models how object attributes on different dimensions are differentially perceived by raters. Moreover, we add a Dirichlet process prior on rater-specific parameters which allows us to flexibly cluster raters into groups with similar perceptual orientations. We conduct simulation studies to show that the new model is able to recover the true latent variable values from the observed binary choice data. We use the new model to analyse original survey data regarding the perceived truthfulness of statements on COVID-19 collected in the summer of 2020. By leveraging the strengths of the new model, we find that the partisanship of the speaker and the partisanship of the respondent account for the majority of the variation in perceived truthfulness, with statements made by co-partisans being viewed as more truthful.},

In this article, we propose a novel dynamic Bayesian approach for modelling and forecasting the age-at-death distribution, focusing on a three-component mixture of a Dirac mass, a Gaussian distribution and a skew-normal distribution. According to the specified model, the age-at-death distribution is characterized via seven parameters corresponding to the main aspects of infant, adult and old-age mortality. The proposed approach focuses on coherent modelling of multiple countries, and following a Bayesian approach to inference we allow to borrow information across populations and to shrink parameters towards a common mean level, implicitly penalizing diverging scenarios. Dynamic modelling across years is induced through an hierarchical dynamic prior distribution that allows to characterize the temporal evolution of each mortality component and to forecast the age-at-death distribution. Empirical results on multiple countries indicate that the proposed approach outperforms popular methods for forecasting mortality, providing interpretable insights on its evolution.},

The correspondence between clusters and dense regions in the sample space is here exploited to discuss an extension of this approach to the analysis of social networks. Conceptually, the notion of high-density cluster fits well the one of community in a network, regarded to as a collection of individuals with dense local ties in its neighbourhood. The lack of a probabilistic notion of density in networks is turned into a strength of the proposed method, where node-wise measures that quantify the role of actors are used to derive different community configurations. The approach allows for the identification of a hierarchical structure of clusters, which may catch different degrees of resolution of the clustering structure. This feature well fits the nature of social networks, disentangling different involvements of individuals in aggregations.},

Both previous survey experience and participation in surveys due to incentives have been discussed in terms of their links with response quality. This study aims to assess whether previous web survey experience and survey participation due to incentives are linked with three indicators of response quality: item non-response, primacy effect and non-differentiation. Analysing data of the probability-based CROss-National Online Survey panel covering Estonia, Slovenia and Great Britain, we found that previous web survey experience is not associated with item non-response and the occurrence of a primacy effect but is associated with non-differentiation. Participating due to the incentive is not associated with any of the three response quality indicators assessed. Hence, overall, we find little evidence that response quality is linked with either previous web survey experience or participating due to the incentive.},

Little is known, nonetheless, about the consequences for data quality of asking participants to answer open-ended questions with images. Therefore, this paper addresses three research questions: (1) What is the effect of answering web survey questions with images instead of text on breakoff, noncompliance with the task, completion time and question evaluation? (2) What is the effect of including a motivational message on these four aspects? (3) Does the impact of asking to answer with images instead of text vary across device types? To answer these questions, we implemented a 2 × 3 between-subject web survey experiment ( N = 3043) in Germany. Half of the sample was required to answer using PCs and the other half with smartphones. Within each device group, respondents were randomly assigned to (1) a control group answering open-ended questions with text; (2) a treatment group answering open-ended questions with images; and (3) another treatment group answering open-ended questions with images but prompted with a motivational message. Results show that asking participants to answer with images significantly increases participants&#39; likelihood of noncompliance as well as their completion times, while worsening their overall survey experience. Including motivational messages, moreover, moderately reduces the likelihood of noncompliance. Finally, the likelihood of noncompliance is similar across devices.},

We applied this design to the European Values Study 2017/2018 in Germany that advanced its general social survey-type design away from the traditional face-to-face mode to self-administered modes. These design changes resulted in uncertainty as to how different incentive strategies and mode choice sequences would affect response rates, nonresponse bias, and survey costs. We illustrate the application and operation of the proposed responsive survey design, as well as an efficiency issue that accompanies it. We also compare the performance of the responsive survey design to a traditional survey design that would have kept all design characteristics static during the field period.},

For this purpose, we conducted an experiment in a smartphone survey (N = 2402) and randomly assigned respondents to an answer format (written or oral). Oral answers were collected via the open source ‘SurveyVoice (SVoice)’ tool, whereas written answers were typed in via the smartphone keypad. Applying length analysis, lexical structure analysis, sentiment analysis and structural topic models, our results reveal that written and oral answers differ substantially from each other in terms of lengths, structures, sentiments and topics. We find evidence that written answers are characterized by an intentional and conscious answering, whereas oral answers are characterized by an intuitive and spontaneous answering.},

  abstract = {Driven by innovations in the digital space, surveys have started to move towards online data collection across the world. However, evidence is needed to demonstrate that online data collection strategy will produce reliable data which could be confidently used to inform policy decisions. This issue is even more pertinent in cross-national surveys, where the comparability of data is of the utmost importance. Due to differences in internet coverage and willingness to participate in online surveys across Europe, there is a risk that any strategy to move existing surveys online will introduce differential coverage and nonresponse bias. This paper explores representativeness across waves in the first cross-national online probability-based panel (CRONOS) by employing R-indicators that summarize the representativeness of the data across a range of variables. The analysis allows comparison of the results over time and across three countries (Estonia, Great Britain and Slovenia). The results suggest that there are differences in representativeness over time in each country and across countries. Those with lower levels of education and those who are in the oldest age category contribute more to the lack of representativeness in the three countries. However, the representativeness of CRONOS panel does not become worse when compared to the regular face-to-face interviewing conducted in the European Social Survey (ESS).},

Relative to telephone-only, the offer of the Web increased overall participation rates by 5.0 percentage points (82.8\% vs. 77.8\%; 95\% confidence interval for difference: 2.7\% to 7.3\%). Differences attributable to mode of interview were detected in levels of item non-response and response values for a limited number of questions. Most notably, response by Web (relative to telephone) was found to have increased the likelihood of non-response to questions relating to pay and other financial matters, and increased the likelihood of ‘less desirable’ responses. For example, response by Web resulted in the reporting of more units of alcohol consumed, and more negative responses to subjective questions such as self-rated health, self-rated financial status and well-being. As there was evidence of mode effects, there is the potential for biases in some analyses, unless appropriate techniques are utilised to correct for these.},

The paper describes the design as it was applied to the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health)—a nationally representative panel survey of around 20,000 adolescents selected from grades 7 to 12 (typically 13 to 18 years of age) in the 1994–95 school year. Also described are key results from several experiments embedded within the design and the analysis of mode effects.

  abstract = {The outbreak of COVID-19 has sparked a sudden demand for fast, frequent and accurate data on the societal impact of the pandemic. This demand has highlighted a divide in survey data collection: Most probability-based social surveys, which can deliver the necessary data quality to allow valid inference to the general population, are slow, infrequent and ill-equipped to survey people during a lockdown. Most non-probability online surveys, which can deliver large amounts of data fast, frequently and without interviewer contact, however, cannot provide the data quality needed for population inference. Well aware of this chasm in the data landscape, at the onset of the pandemic, we set up the Mannheim Corona Study (MCS), a rotating panel survey with daily data collection on the basis of the long-standing probability-based online panel infrastructure of the German Internet Panel (GIP). The MCS has provided academics and political decision makers with key information to understand the social and economic developments during the early phase of the pandemic. This paper describes the panel adaptation process, demonstrates the power of the MCS data on its own and when linked to other data sources, and evaluates the data quality achieved by the MCS fast-response methodology.},

This study focuses on the distribution of COVID-19 confirmed cases in China—the original epicentre of the outbreak. We show that the upper tail of COVID-19 cases in Chinese cities is well described by a power law distribution, with exponent around one in the early phases of the outbreak (when the number of cases was growing rapidly) and less than one thereafter. This finding is significant because it implies that (i) COVID-19 cases in China is heavy tailed and disperse; (ii) a few cities account for a disproportionate share of COVID-19 cases; and (iii) the distribution generally has no finite mean or variance. We find that a proportionate random growth model predicated by Gibrat&#39;s law offers a plausible explanation for the emergence of a power law in the distribution of COVID-19 cases in Chinese cities in the early phases of the outbreak.},

This ignores that mortality rates can be co-dependent due to bereavement effects, that is, to a causal effect of the loss of the co-twin on the mortality rate of the surviving twin. We develop a novel approach based on a model incorporating both types of dependence. We prove identification and we estimate models with Danish register data on twin pairs. Among men, losing an identical co-twin at age 75 causally reduces the remaining lifetime on average by more than a year. This bereavement effect is less severe among non-identical twins. The results are relevant for the assessment of the economic component of bereavement effects in general. Furthermore, estimates of correlations between the frailty terms by zygosity and the ensuing relative importance of genetic determinants are highly dependent on whether bereavement effects are ignored.},

Echoing a long-standing controversy, disagreements have re-surfaced regarding the underlying MSE assumptions, the robustness of MSE methodology and the accuracy of MSE estimates in this application. Our goal was to help address and move past these controversies. To do so, we review MSE, its assumptions, and commonly used models for modern slavery applications. We introduce all of the publicly available modern slavery datasets in the literature, providing a reproducible analysis and highlighting current issues. Specifically, we utilize an internal consistency approach that constructs subsets of data for which ground truth is available, allowing us to evaluate the accuracy of MSE estimators. Next, we propose a characterization of the large sample bias of estimators as a function of misspecified assumptions. Then, we propose an alternative to traditional (e.g. bootstrap-based) assessments of reliability, which allows us to visualize trajectories of MSE estimates to illustrate the robustness of estimates. Finally, our complementary analyses are used to provide guidance regarding the application and reliability of MSE methodology.},

  abstract = {Efficient mass transit provision should be responsive to the behaviour of passengers. Operators often conduct surveys to elicit passenger perspectives, but these can be expensive to administer and can suffer from hypothetical biases. With the advent of smart card and automated vehicle location data, operators have reliable sources of revealed preference (RP) data that can be utilized to estimate transit riders&#39; valuation of service attributes. To date, effective use of RP data has been limited due to modelling complexities. We propose a dynamic choice model (DCM) for population-level longitudinal RP data to address prominent challenges. In the DCM, riders are assumed to follow different decision rules (compensatory and inertia/habit) and temporal switching between decision rules based on experience-based learning is also formulated. We develop an expectation–maximization algorithm to estimate the DCM and apply our model to estimate passenger valuation of crowding. Using large-scale data of 2 months with over four million daily trips by an Asian metro, our DCM estimates show an increase of 47\% in passenger&#39;s valuation of travel time under extremely crowded conditions. Furthermore, the average passenger follows the compensatory rule on only 25.5\% or fewer trips. These results are valuable for supply-side decisions of transit operators.},

The estimated probabilities are then used in making decisions at the individual level. In the past, there has been controversy about whether the probabilities derived from group-level calculations can meaningfully be applied to individuals. Using Bayesian hierarchical models applied to a large longitudinal dataset from the court system in the state of Kentucky, we analyse variation in individual-level probabilities of failing to appear for court and the extent to which it is captured by covariates. We find that individuals within the same risk group vary widely in their probability of the outcome. In practice, this means that allocating individuals to risk groups based on standard approaches to risk assessment, in large part, results in creating distinctions among individuals who are not meaningfully different in terms of their likelihood of the outcome. This is because uncertainty about the probability that any particular individual will fail to appear is large relative to the difference in average probabilities among any reasonable set of risk groups.},

ERGMs are typically interpreted as a snapshot of a network at a given point in time or in a final state. The recently proposed Latent Order Logistic model (LOLOG) directly allows for a latent network formation process. We assess the real-world performance of these models when applied to typical networks modelled by researchers. Specifically, we model data from an ensemble of articles in the journal Social Networks with published ERGM fits, and compare the ERGM fit to a comparable LOLOG fit. We demonstrate that the LOLOG models are, in general, in qualitative agreement with the ERGM models, and provide at least as good a model fit. In addition, they are typically faster and easier to fit to data, without the tendency for degeneracy that plagues ERGMs. Our results support the general use of LOLOG models in circumstances where ERGMs are considered.},

However, like many other statistical tools, there is sometimes the risk of misuse or even abuse. In this paper, we highlight possible pitfalls in using the theoretical results of PCA based on the assumption of independent data when the data are time series. For the latter, we state with proof a central limit theorem of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (loadings), give direct and bootstrap estimation of their asymptotic covariances, and assess their efficacy via simulation. Specifically, we pay attention to the proportion of variation, which decides the number of principal components (PCs), and the loadings, which help interpret the meaning of PCs. Our findings are that while the proportion of variation is quite robust to different dependence assumptions, the inference of PC loadings requires careful attention. We initiate and conclude our investigation with an empirical example on portfolio management, in which the PC loadings play a prominent role. It is given as a paradigm of correct usage of PCA for time series data.},

  abstract = {Composite scales are widely used for measuring aggregate social science concepts. These often consist of linear indices obtained as the weighted sum of a set of relevant indicators. However, selecting coefficients (or weights) that reflect the substantive importance of each indicator towards the concept of interest is a difficult task. We propose a method for the generation of linear indices for aggregate concepts based on pairwise comparisons. Specifically, we ask a group of subject-matter experts to perform a series of pairwise comparisons, with respect to the concept of interest, between profiles displaying different combinations of indicators. This allows us to estimate coefficients for each indicator that provide a linear approximation to how experts make the pairwise evaluations. As we show, the method makes it straightforward to assess intercoder reliability, while being a more accessible task than directly asking experts for coefficients. We demonstrate our method with an application to the concept of ‘productive ageing’, including a cross-cultural comparison of weighting schemes derived from a group of Italian and a group of South Korean experts on this concept.},

  abstract = {In contrast to widespread concerns that COVID-19 lockdowns have substantially increased the incidence of domestic violence, research based on police-recorded crimes or calls-for-service has typically found small and often even negligible effects. One explanation for this discrepancy is that lockdowns have left victims of domestic violence trapped in-home with their perpetrators, limiting their ability to safely report incidents to the police. To overcome this measurement problem, we propose a model-based algorithm for measuring temporal variation in domestic violence incidence using internet search activity and make precise the conditions under which this measure yields less biased estimates of domestic violence problem during periods of crisis than commonly used police-recorded crime measures. Analysing the COVID-19 lockdown in Greater London, we find a 40\% increase in our internet search-based domestic violence index at the peak occurring 3–6 weeks into the lockdown, -seven to eight times larger than the increase in police-recorded crimes and much closer to the increase in helpline calls reported by victim support charities. Applying the same methodology to Los Angeles, we find strikingly similar results. We conclude that evidence based solely on police-recorded domestic violence incidents cannot reliably inform us about the scale of the domestic violence problem during crises like COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Despite the overwhelming evidence that shows the persistence of intra-annual variations on demographic events (deaths, birth dates and migration flows), life tables are computed and provided on an annual basis. This paper develops a new estimator for estimating sub-annual death rates that, considering the exact moment of occurrence (exact age and day) of events, concurrently accounts for ageing and calendar fluctuations. This paper also shows how modelling the intra-annual variations of death rates, through specific seasonal–ageing indexes, can be used as a tool for constructing new sub-annual tables from annual tables. This new methodology is exemplified using a real database of Spain made up of 186 million demographic events (1.5 million of which are deaths), from which seasonal–ageing indexes are estimated and conclusions drawn. First, seasonal effects are, as a rule, stronger than ageing effects. For a given integer age, season has a higher impact on increasing or decreasing the average risk of death at that age than the actual age of the exposed-to-risk. Second, the intensity of the effects varies among seasons and age-quarters. Third, neither seasonal nor ageing effects are age-stationary. Their impact, be it to varying degrees, intensifies as people get older. Fourth, there is interaction between seasonal and ageing effects. In short, life expectancies and probabilities of dying/surviving not only depend on people&#39;s age, but also on when their birthday falls within the year. This has implications, for instance, in managing pension systems or for insurance companies.},

In ever-larger dynamic systems, such as the food system, it is increasingly difficult for decision makers (DMs) to effectively account for all the variables within the system that may influence the outcomes of interest under enactments of various candidate policies. Each of the influencing variables is likely, themselves, to be dynamic subsystems with expert domains supported by sophisticated probabilistic models. Recent increases in food poverty in the United Kingdom have raised the questions about the main drivers of food insecurity, how this may be changing over time and how evidence can be used in evaluating policy for decision support. In this context, an IDSS is proposed for household food security to allow DMs to compare several candidate policies which may affect the outcome of food insecurity at the household level.},

While research has shown that non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) had an evident impact on national mobility patterns, we investigate the relative regional mobility behaviour to assess the effect of human movement on the spread of COVID-19. In particular, we explore the impact of human mobility and social connectivity derived from Facebook activities on the weekly rate of new infections in Germany between 3 March and 22 June 2020. Our results confirm that reduced social activity lowers the infection rate, accounting for regional and temporal patterns. The extent of social distancing, quantified by the percentage of people staying put within a federal administrative district, has an overall negative effect on the incidence of infections. Additionally, our results show spatial infection patterns based on geographical as well as social distances.},

  abstract = {Time-varying treatments are prevalent in the social sciences. For example, a political campaign might decide to air attack ads against an opponent, but this decision to go negative will impact polling and, thus, future campaign strategy. If an analyst naively applies methods for point exposures to estimate the effect of earlier treatments, this would lead to post-treatment bias. Several existing methods can adjust for this type of time-varying confounding, but they typically rely on strong modelling assumptions. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step matching procedure for estimating the effect of two-period treatments. This method, telescope matching , reduces model dependence without inducing post-treatment bias by using matching with replacement to impute missing counterfactual outcomes. It then employs flexible regression models to correct for bias induced by imperfect matches. We derive the asymptotic properties of the telescope matching estimator and provide a consistent estimator for its variance. We illustrate telescope matching by investigating the effect of negative campaigning in US Senate and gubernatorial elections. Using the method, we uncover a positive effect on turnout of negative ads early in a campaign and a negative effect of early negativity on vote shares.},

We deal with left-censored data using recently developed maximum simulated likelihood methods. The models allow risk to vary with age, previous heart attack history and unobserved individual heterogeneity. We find that the risk of subsequent events is far higher than the risk of the first event, particularly high within 1 year after an event, and that unobserved heterogeneity is important. Generally, male Maoris have the highest risk, followed by female Maoris, then ethnically European males, while ethnically European females have the lowest risk.},

Certain tools, such as the p -value and significance test, have recently come under renewed criticism, with some arguing that they damage trust in statistics. We argue the contrary, beginning from the position that the central role of these methods is to form the basis for trusted conclusions in the face of uncertainty in the data, and noting that it is the misuse and misunderstanding of these tools which damages trustworthiness and hence trust. We go on to argue that recent calls to ban these tools tackle the symptom, not the cause, and themselves risk damaging the capability of science to advance, as well as risking feeding into public suspicion of the discipline of statistics. The consequence could be aggravated mistrust of our discipline and of science more generally. In short, the very proposals could work in quite the contrary direction from that intended. We make some alternative proposals for tackling the misuse and misunderstanding of these methods, and for how trust in our discipline might be promoted.},

In this article, we present a simple yet flexible statistical model for insurers to assess and manage hail risks from two aspects: analysing the insurance claims arrival pattern upon occurrence of a hailstorm and quantifying the subsequent financial impact of the hailstorm. We formulate the problem using a marked point process where the reporting of insurance claims due to a hailstorm is treated as recurrent events and the claim amounts are viewed as associated marks. Three complications are addressed in model building: the unobserved heterogeneity in claim arrival, the dependence between the event time and the mark and the complex distribution in claim amount. Using a unique data that combine the exposure data from a major US insurer and the radar data from a third-party vendor, we show the proposed method help improve predictive analytics for post-hailstorm claims volume, arrival rate and severity, and thus claim management decisions for the insurer.},

  abstract = {The use of likelihood ratios for quantifying the strength of forensic evidence in criminal cases is gaining widespread acceptance in many forensic disciplines. Although some forensic scientists feel that subjective likelihood ratios are a reasonable way of expressing expert opinion regarding strength of evidence in criminal trials, legal requirements of reliability of expert evidence in the United Kingdom, United States and some other countries have encouraged researchers to develop likelihood ratio systems based on statistical modelling using relevant empirical data. Many such systems exhibit exceptional power to discriminate between the scenario presented by the prosecution and an alternate scenario implying the innocence of the defendant. However, such systems are not necessarily well calibrated. Consequently, verbal explanations to triers of fact, by forensic experts, of the meaning of the offered likelihood ratio may be misleading. In this article, we put forth a statistical approach for testing the calibration discrepancy of likelihood ratio systems using ground truth known empirical data. We provide point estimates as well as confidence intervals for the calibration discrepancy. Several examples, previously discussed in the literature, are used to illustrate our method. Results from a limited simulation study concerning the performance of the proposed approach are also provided.},

  abstract = {In order to analyse worldwide data about access to food, coming from a series of Gallup&#39;s world polls, we propose a hidden Markov model with both a spatial and a temporal component. This model is estimated by an augmented data MCMC algorithm in a Bayesian framework. Data are referred to a sample of more than 750 thousand individuals in 166 countries, widespread in more than two thousand areas, and cover the period 2007–2014. The model is based on a discrete latent space, with the latent state corresponding to a certain area and time occasion that depends on the states of neighbouring areas at the same time occasion, and on the previous state for the same area. The latent model also accounts for area-time-specific covariates. Moreover, the binary response variable (access to food, in our case) observed at individual level is modelled on the basis of individual-specific covariates through a logistic model with a vector of parameters depending on the latent state. Model selection, in particular for the number of latent states, is based on the Watanabe–Akaike information criterion. The application shows the potential of the approach in terms of clustering the areas, data smoothing and prediction of prevalence for areas without sample units and over time.},

We propose a model-based decomposition, similar to the most popular approaches, where the first component measures differences in group characteristics and the second component measures the unexplained effect; the latter being the real gap. The novel approach incorporates model selection and bias correction. The pay gap problem in a small area context is considered in this paper, although the approach is flexible to be applied to other contexts. Specifically, the methodology is validated for analysing wage differentials by economic activities in the region of Galicia (Spain) and by analysing simulated data from an experimental design that imitates the generation of real data. The good performance of the proposed estimators is shown in both cases, specifically when compared with those obtained from the widely used Oaxaca–Blinder approach.},

  abstract = {This paper analysed several longitudinal data sets for investigating the dynamic inter-relationships between CO 2 emissions and atmospheric concentrations, ambient temperatures and ocean acidification and deoxygenation. The methodological framework addressed issues such as the use of temperature ‘anomalies’, diffusion of CO 2 to atmospheric stations, distributional misspecification and non-stationarity of errors affecting empirical models, and use of spline functions for modelling trends in temperatures. Longitudinal data on CO 2 emissions for 163 countries and atmospheric CO 2 concentrations at 10 stations, ambient temperatures from over 8,500 weather stations and seawater composition from over 380,000 oceanographic stations were analysed for 1985–2018 by estimating dynamic random effects models using maximum likelihood methods. The main findings were that CO 2 emissions exhibited rapid upward trends at the country level, while minimum and maximum temperatures showed cyclical patterns; economic activity and population levels were associated with higher CO 2 emissions. Second, there were gradual upward trends in annual and seasonal temperatures compiled at weather stations, and atmospheric CO 2 concentrations were significantly associated with higher temperatures in the hemispheres. Third, there was a steady decline in dissolved oxygen levels, and the interactive effects of water temperatures and pH levels were significant. Overall, the results underscore the benefits of reducing CO 2 emissions for ambient temperatures and for ocean deoxygenation. Synergies between CO 2 emissions, ambient temperatures and ocean acidification are likely to exacerbate the melting of polar ice.},

  abstract = {We investigate the use of two or more linked lists, for both population size estimation and the relationship between variables appearing on all or only some lists. This relationship is usually not fully known because some individuals appear in only some lists, and some are not in any list. These two problems have been solved simultaneously using the EM algorithm. We extend this approach to estimate the size of the indigenous Māori population in New Zealand, leading to several innovations: (1) the approach is extended to four lists (including the population census), where the reporting of Māori status differs between registers; (2) some individuals in one or more lists have missing ethnicity, and we adapt the approach to handle this additional missingness; (3) some lists cover subsets of the population by design. We discuss under which assumptions such structural undercoverage can be ignored and provide a general result; (4) we treat the Māori indicator in each list as a variable measured with error, and embed a latent class model in the multiple system estimation to estimate the population size of a latent variable, interpreted as the true Māori status. Finally, we discuss estimating the Māori population size from administrative data only. Supplementary materials for our article are available online.},

  abstract = {Surveys are well known to contain response errors of different types, including acquiescence, social desirability, common method variance and random error simultaneously. Nevertheless, a single error source at a time is all that most methods developed to estimate and correct for such errors consider in practice. Consequently, estimation of response errors is inefficient, their relative importance is unknown and the optimal question format may not be discoverable. To remedy this situation, we demonstrate how multiple types of errors can be estimated concurrently with the recently introduced ‘multitrait-multierror’ (MTME) approach. MTME combines the theory of design of experiments with latent variable modelling to estimate response error variances of different error types simultaneously. This allows researchers to evaluate which errors are most impactful, and aids in the discovery of optimal question formats. We apply this approach using representative data from the United Kingdom to six survey items measuring attitudes towards immigrants that are commonly used across public opinion studies.},

  abstract = {We consider user retention analytics for online freemium role-playing games (RPGs). RPGs constitute a very popular genre of computer-based games that, along with a player&#39;s gaming actions, focus on the development of the player&#39;s in-game virtual character through a persistent exploration of the gaming environment. Most RPGs follow the freemium business model in which the gamers can play for free but they are charged for premium add-on amenities. As with other freemium products, RPGs suffer from the curse of high dropout rates. This makes retention analysis extremely important for successful operation and survival of their gaming portals. Here, we develop a disciplined statistical framework for retention analysis by modelling multiple in-game player characteristics along with the dropout probabilities. We capture players’ motivations through engagement times, collaboration and achievement score at each level of the game, and jointly model them using a generalized linear mixed model (glmm) framework that further includes a time-to-event variable corresponding to churn. We capture the interdependencies in a player&#39;s level-wise engagement, collaboration, achievement with dropout through a shared parameter model. We illustrate interesting changes in player behaviours as the gaming level progresses. The parameters in our joint model were estimated by a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm which incorporated a divide-and-recombine approach for increased scalability in glmm estimation that was needed to accommodate our large longitudinal gaming data-set. By incorporating the level-wise changes in a player&#39;s motivations and using them for dropout rate prediction, our method greatly improves on state-of-the-art retention models. Based on data from a popular action based RPG, we demonstrate the competitive optimality of our proposed joint modelling approach by exhibiting its improved predictive performance over competitors. In particular, we outperform aggregate statistics based methods that ignore level-wise progressions as well as progression tracking non-joint model such as the Cox proportional hazards model. We also display improved predictions of popular marketing retention statistics and discuss how they can be used in managerial decision making.},

  abstract = {Predicting a dengue outbreak well ahead of time is of immense importance to healthcare personnel. In this study, an ensemble method based on three different types of models has been developed. The proposed approach combines negative binomial regression, autoregressive integrated moving average model and generalized linear autoregressive moving average model through a vector autoregressive structure. Lagged values of terrain and climate covariates are used as regressors. Real-life application using data from San Juan and Iquitos shows that the proposed method usually incurs a mean absolute error of less than 10 cases when the predictions are made 8 weeks in advance. Furthermore, using model confidence set procedure, it is also shown that the proposed method always outperforms other candidate models in providing early prediction for a dengue epidemic.},

The application of this method to a subset of the WHO mortality database reveals the main modes of variation of cause-specific rates over years for men and women and enables us to perform clustering in the projected subspace. The results give many insights of the ongoing trends, only partially explained by past literature, that the considered countries are undergoing. We are also able to show the different evolution of cause of death undergone by men and women: for example, we can see that while lung cancer incidence is stabilizing for men, it is still increasing for women.},

Applying the method of local instrumental variables to administrative data, we estimate the marginal treatment effects on apprenticeship take-up and employment. The heterogeneous impacts are then aggregated to form an estimate of the average impact of treatment for all participants. The results suggest that, among younger trainees, participation increases the probability of becoming an apprentice and that this holds across the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity. For older trainees, we find no significant effect on the probability of becoming an apprenticeship on average but some evidence of a negative effect among those more resistant to participating. We find no effects on employment for either age group.},

  abstract = {Given the extreme dependence of agriculture on weather conditions, this paper analyses the effect of climatic variations on this economic sector, by considering both a huge data set and a flexible spatiotemporal model specification. In particular, we study the response of N-fertilizer application to abnormal weather conditions, while accounting for other relevant control variables. The data set consists of gridded data spanning over 21 years (1993–2013), while the methodological strategy makes use of a spatial dynamic panel data (SDPD) model that accounts for both space and time fixed effects, besides dealing with both space and time dependences. Time-invariant short- and long-term effects, as well as time-varying marginal effects are also properly defined, revealing interesting results on the impact of both GDP and weather conditions on fertilizer utilizations. The analysis considers four macroregions—Europe, South America, Southeast Asia and Africa—to allow for comparisons among different socio-economic societies. In addition to finding both spatial (in the form of knowledge spillover effects ) and temporal dependences as well as a good support for the existence of an environmental Kuznets curve for fertilizer application, the paper shows peculiar responses of N-fertilization to deviations from normal weather conditions of moisture for each selected region, calling for ad hoc policy interventions.},
