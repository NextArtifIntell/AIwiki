  abstract     = {Acquiring a subterranean lifestyle entails a substantial shift for many aspects of terrestrial vertebrates’ biology. Although this lifestyle is associated with multiple instances of convergent evolution, the relative success of some subterranean lineages largely remains unexplained. Here, we focus on the mammalian transitions to life underground, quantifying bone microanatomy through high-resolution X-ray tomography. The true moles stand out in this dataset. Examination of this family&#39;s bone histology reveals that the highly fossorial moles acquired a unique phenotype involving large amounts of compacted coarse cancellous bone. This phenotype exceeds the adaptive optimum seemingly shared by several other subterranean mammals and can be traced back to some of the first known members of the family. This remarkable microanatomy was acquired early in the history of the group and evolved faster than the gross morphology innovations of true moles’ forelimb. This echoes the pattern described for other lifestyle transitions, such as the acquisition of bone mass specializations in secondarily aquatic tetrapods. Highly plastic traits—such as those pertaining to bone structure—are hence involved in the early stages of different types of lifestyle transitions.},

However, the frequency of introgression between recently diverged species and the evolutionary consequences of gene flow are still poorly understood. The ; group of ; contains 12 species that are geographically widespread and show varying levels of prezygotic and postzygotic isolation. Here, we use de novo genome assemblies and whole-genome sequencing data to resolve phylogenetic relationships and describe patterns of introgression and divergence across the group. We suggest that the ; group consists of three, rather than the traditional two, subgroups. Some genes undergoing rapid sequence divergence across the group were involved in chemical communication and desiccation tolerance, and may be related to the evolution of sexual isolation and adaptation. We found evidence of pervasive phylogenetic discordance caused by ancient introgression events between distant lineages within the group, and more recent gene flow between closely related species. When assessing patterns of genome-wide divergence in species pairs across the group, we found no consistent genomic evidence of a disproportionate role for the X chromosome as has been found in other systems. Our results show how ancient and recent introgressions confuse phylogenetic reconstruction, but may play an important role during early radiation of a group.},

  abstract     = {Environmental tolerance curves, representing absolute fitness against the environment, are an empirical assessment of the fundamental niche, and emerge from the phenotypic plasticity of underlying phenotypic traits. Dynamic plastic responses of these traits can lead to acclimation effects, whereby recent past environments impact current fitness. Theory predicts that higher levels of phenotypic plasticity should evolve in environments that fluctuate more predictably, but there have been few experimental tests of these predictions. Specifically, we still lack experimental evidence for the evolution of acclimation effects in response to environmental predictability. Here, we exposed 25 genetically diverse populations of the halotolerant microalgae ; to different constant salinities, or to randomly fluctuating salinities, for over 200 generations. The fluctuating treatments differed in their autocorrelation, which determines the similarity of subsequent values, and thus environmental predictability. We then measured acclimated tolerance surfaces, mapping population growth rate against past (acclimation) and current (assay) environments. We found that experimental mean and variance in salinity caused the evolution of niche position (optimal salinity) and breadth, with respect to not only current but also past (acclimation) salinity. We also detected weak but significant evidence for evolutionary changes in response to environmental predictability, with higher predictability leading notably to lower optimal salinities and stronger acclimation effect of past environment on current fitness. We further showed that these responses are related to the evolution of plasticity for intracellular glycerol, the major osmoregulatory mechanism in this species. However, the direction of plasticity evolution did not match simple theoretical predictions. Our results underline the need for a more explicit consideration of the dynamics of environmental tolerance and its underlying plastic traits to reach a better understanding of ecology and evolution in fluctuating environments.},

Most SNPs exhibit minimal change over a span of 23 generations (less than 1\% per year), consistent with neutral evolution in a large population. However, several thousand SNPs display strong fluctuations in frequency. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that these ‘Fluctuating SNPs’ are driven by temporally varying selection. Unlinked loci exhibit synchronous changes with the same allele increasing consistently in certain time intervals but declining in others. This synchrony is sufficiently pronounced that we can roughly classify intervals into two categories, “green” and “yellow,” corresponding to conflicting selection regimes. Alleles increasing in green intervals are associated with early life investment in vegetative tissue and delayed flowering. The alternative alleles that increase in yellow intervals are associated with rapid progression to flowering. Selection on the Fluctuating SNPs produces a strong ripple effect on variation across the genome. Accounting for estimation error, we estimate the distribution of allele frequency change per generation in this population. While change is minimal for most SNPs, diffuse hitchhiking effects generated by selected loci may be driving neutral SNPs to a much greater extent than classic genetic drift.},

Theory predicts that environments stable for multiple generations promote local adaptation, whereas highly heterogeneous environments favor adaptive phenotypic plasticity. However, when environments have periods of stability mixed with heterogeneity, the relative importance of local adaptation and adaptive phenotypic plasticity is unclear. Here, we used ; as a model system to evaluate the relative influence of genetic and plastic effects on the match of populations to environments with periods of stability from three to four generations. This invasive pest insect can develop within different fruits, and persists throughout the year in a given location on a succession of distinct host fruits, each one being available for only a few generations. Using reciprocal common environment experiments of natural ; populations collected from cherry, strawberry, and blackberry, we found that both oviposition preference and offspring performance were higher on medium made with the fruit from which the population originated than on media made with alternative fruits. This pattern, which remained after two generations in the laboratory, was analyzed using a statistical method we developed to quantify the contributions of local adaptation and adaptive plasticity in determining fitness. Altogether, we found that genetic effects (local adaptation) dominate over plastic effects (adaptive phenotypic plasticity). Our study demonstrates that spatially and temporally variable selection does not prevent the rapid evolution of local adaptation in natural populations. The speed and strength of adaptation may be facilitated by several mechanisms including a large effective population size and strong selective pressures imposed by host plants.},

  abstract     = {How novel phenotypes evolve is challenging to imagine because traits are often underlain by numerous integrated phenotypic components, and changes to any one form can disrupt the function of the entire module. Yet novel phenotypes do emerge, and research on adaptive phenotypic evolution suggests that complex traits can diverge while either maintaining existing form–function relationships or through innovations that alter form–function relationships. How these alternate routes contribute to sexual signal evolution is poorly understood, despite the role of sexual signals in generating biodiversity. In Hawaiian populations of the Pacific field cricket, male song attracts both female crickets and a deadly acoustically orienting parasitoid fly. In response to this conflict between natural and sexual selection, male crickets have evolved altered wing morphologies multiple times, resulting in loss and dramatic alteration of sexual signals. More recently, we and others have observed a radical increase in sexual signal variation and the underlying morphological structures that produce song. We conducted the first combined analysis of form (wing morphology), function (emergent signal), and receiver responses to characterize novel variation, test alternative hypotheses about form–function relationships (Form–Function Continuity vs. Form–Function Decoupling), and investigate underlying mechanistic changes and fitness consequences of novel signals. We identified three sound-producing male morphs (one previously undescribed, named “rattling”) and found that relationships between morphology and signals have been rewired (Form–Function Decoupling), rapidly and repeatedly, through the gain, loss, and alteration of morphological structures, facilitating the production of signals that exist in novel phenotypic space. By integrating across a hierarchy of phenotypes, we uncovered divergent morphs with unique solutions to the challenge of attracting mates while evading fatal parasitism.},

In particular, seed size, dormancy, and early seedling vigor are thought to be key functional traits with important recruitment and fitness consequences across abiotic stress gradients. Selection for favored seed-trait combinations, or against maladaptive combinations, is likely an important driver shaping recruitment strategies. Here, we test for seed-trait plasticity and patterns of recruitment using two genotypes representative of contrasting upland and lowland ecotypes of ; with field experiments in native versus foreign habitats. Furthermore, we test whether seed traits have been under directional selection in ; using the ; -test based on trait variance in a genetic cross. Finally, we evaluate the genetic architecture of ecotypic divergence for these traits with quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. Field experiments reveal little plasticity but support a hypothesis of adaptation divergence among ecotypes based on recruitment. Patterns of segregation within recombinant hybrids provides strong support for directional selection driving ecotypic divergence in seed traits. Genetic mapping revealed a polygenic architecture with evidence of genetic correlation between seed mass, dormancy, and seedling vigor. Our results suggest that the evolution of these traits may involve constraints that affect the direction of adaptive divergence. For example, seed size and germination percentage shared two colocalized QTL with antagonistic additive effects. This supports the hypothesis of a functional genetic relationship between these traits, resulting in either large seed/strong dormancy or small seed/weak dormancy trait combinations. Overall, our study provides insights into the factors facilitating and potentially constraining ecotypic differentiation in seed traits.},

  abstract     = {Cooperatively breeding animals live longer than their solitary counterparts. This has been suggested for birds, mole rats, and social insects. A common explanation for these long lifespans is that cooperative breeding evolves more readily in long-lived species because lower mortality reduces the rate of territory turnover and thus leads to a limitation of breeding territories. Here, we reverse this argument and show that—rather than being a cause for its evolution—long lifespans are an evolutionary consequence of cooperative breeding. In evolutionary individual-based simulations, we show that natural selection favors a delayed onset of senescence in cooperative breeders, relative to solitary breeders, because cooperative breeders have a delayed age of first reproduction as helpers wait in a reproductive queue to obtain breeder status. Especially long lifespans evolve in cooperative breeders in which queue positions depend on the helpers’ age rank among the helpers within the breeding territory. Furthermore, we show that lower genetic relatedness among group members leads to the evolution of longer lifespans. This is because selection against higher mortality is weaker when mortality reduces competition for breeding between relatives. Our results link the evolutionary theory of ageing with kin selection theory, demonstrating that the evolution of ageing in cooperative breeders is driven by the timing of reproduction and kin structure within breeding territories.},

Few studies have investigated parental age effects on offspring fitness in natural populations while also testing for sex- and environment-specific effects. Further, longitudinal parental age effects may be masked by population-level processes such as the selective disappearance of poor-quality individuals. Here, we used multigenerational data collected on individually marked Seychelles warblers (; ) to investigate the impact of maternal and paternal age on offspring life span and lifetime reproductive success. We found negative effects of maternal age on female offspring life span and lifetime reproductive success, which were driven by within-mother effects. There was no difference in annual reproductive output of females born to older versus younger mothers, suggesting that the differences in offspring lifetime reproductive success were driven by effects on offspring life span. In contrast, there was no association between paternal age and female offspring life span or either maternal or paternal age and male offspring life span. Lifetime reproductive success, but not annual reproductive success, of male offspring increased with maternal age, but this was driven by between-mother effects. No paternal age effects were found on female offspring lifetime reproductive success but there was a positive between-father effect on male offspring lifetime reproductive success. We did not find strong evidence for environment-dependent parental age effects. Our study provides evidence for parental age effects on the lifetime fitness of offspring and shows that such effects can be sex dependent. These results add to the growing literature indicating the importance of intergenerational effects on long-term offspring performance and highlight that these effects can be an important driver of variation in longevity and fitness in the wild.},

  abstract     = {In addition to nucleotide variation, many bacteria also undergo changes at a much larger scale via rearrangement of their genome structure (GS) around long repeat sequences. These rearrangements result in genome fragments shifting position and/or orientation in the genome without necessarily affecting the underlying nucleotide sequence. To date, scalable techniques have not been applied to GS identification, so it remains unclear how extensive this variation is and the extent of its impact upon gene expression. However, the emergence of multiplexed, long-read sequencing overcomes the scale problem, as reads of several thousand bases are routinely produced that can span long repeat sequences to identify the flanking chromosomal DNA, allowing GS identification. Genome rearrangements were generated in ; serovar Typhi through long-term culture at ambient temperature. Colonies with rearrangements were identified via long-range PCR and subjected to long-read nanopore sequencing to confirm genome variation. Four rearrangements were investigated for differential gene expression using transcriptomics. All isolates with changes in genome arrangement relative to the parent strain were accompanied by changes in gene expression. Rearrangements with similar fragment movements demonstrated similar changes in gene expression. The most extreme rearrangement caused a large imbalance between the origin and terminus of replication and was associated with differential gene expression as a factor of distance moved toward or away from the origin of replication. Genome structure variation may provide a mechanism through which bacteria can quickly adapt to new environments and warrants routine assessment alongside traditional nucleotide-level measures of variation.},

A key factor is thought to be a “critical window” during which the host&#39;s immune system can “learn” tolerance, and beyond which learning is no longer possible. Animal models indicate that many mechanisms have evolved to enable critical windows, and that their time limits are distinct and consistent. Such a variety of mechanisms, and precision in their manifestation suggest the outcome of strong evolutionary selection. To strengthen our understanding of critical windows, we explore their underlying evolutionary ecology using models encompassing demographic and epidemiological transitions, identifying the length of the critical window that would maximize fitness in different environments. We characterize how direct effects of microbes on host mortality, but also indirect effects via microbial ecology, will drive the optimal length of the critical window. We find that indirect effects such as magnitude of transmission, duration of infection, rates of reinfection, vertical transmission, host demography, and seasonality in transmission all have the effect of redistributing the timing and/or likelihood of encounters with microbial taxa across age, and thus increasing or decreasing the optimal length of the critical window. Declining microbial population abundance and diversity are predicted to result in increases in immune dysfunction later in life. We also make predictions for the length of the critical window across different taxa and environments. Overall, our modeling efforts demonstrate how critical windows will be impacted over evolution as a function of both host-microbiome/pathogen interactions and dispersal, raising central questions about potential mismatches between these evolved systems and the current loss of microbial diversity and/or increases in infectious disease.},

  abstract     = {Temperature has a profound effect on the growth and development of ectothermic animals. However, the extent to which ecologically driven selection pressures can adjust thermal plastic responses in growth schedules is not well understood. Comparing temperature-induced plastic responses between sexes provides a promising but underexploited approach to evaluating the evolvability of thermal reaction norms: males and females share largely the same genes and immature environments but typically experience different ecological selection pressures. We proceed from the idea that substantial sex differences in plastic responses could be interpreted as resulting from sex-specific life-history optimization, whereas similarity among the sexes should rather be seen as evidence of an essential role of physiological constraints. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of sex-specific thermal responses in insect development times, using data on 161 species with comprehensive phylogenetic and ecological coverage. As a reference for judging the magnitude of sex specificity in thermal plasticity, we compared the magnitude of sex differences in plastic responses to temperature with those in response to diet. We show that sex-specific responses of development times to temperature variation are broadly similar. We also found no strong evidence for sex specificity in thermal responses to depend on the magnitude or direction of sex differences in development time. Sex differences in temperature-induced plastic responses were systematically less pronounced than sex differences in responses induced by variations in larval diet. Our results point to the existence of substantial constraints on the evolvability of thermal reaction norms in insects as the most likely explanation. If confirmed, the low evolvability of thermal response is an essential aspect to consider in predicting evolutionary responses to climate warming.},

  abstract     = {Interactions between species are widely understood to have promoted the diversification of life on Earth, but how interactions spur the formation of new species remains unclear. Interacting species often become locally adapted to each other, but they may also be subject to shared dispersal limitations and environmental conditions. Moreover, theory predicts that different kinds of interactions have different effects on diversification. To better understand how species interactions promote diversification, we compiled population genetic studies of host plants and intimately associated herbivores, parasites, and mutualists. We used Bayesian multiple regressions and the BEDASSLE modeling framework to test whether host and associate population structures were correlated over and above the potentially confounding effects of geography and shared environmental variation. We found that associates&#39; population structure often paralleled their hosts&#39; population structure, and that this effect is robust to accounting for geographic distance and climate. Associate genetic structure was significantly explained by plant genetic structure somewhat more often in antagonistic interactions than in mutualistic ones. This aligns with a key prediction of coevolutionary theory that antagonistic interactions promote diversity through local adaptation of antagonists to hosts, while mutualistic interactions more often promote diversity via the effect of hosts&#39; geographic distribution on mutualists&#39; dispersal.},

  abstract     = {Sexual antagonism is a common hypothesis for driving the evolution of sex chromosomes, whereby recombination suppression is favored between sexually antagonistic loci and the sex-determining locus to maintain beneficial combinations of alleles. This results in the formation of a sex-determining region. Chromosomal inversions may contribute to recombination suppression but their precise role in sex chromosome evolution remains unclear. Because local adaptation is frequently facilitated through the suppression of recombination between adaptive loci by chromosomal inversions, there is potential for inversions that cover sex-determining regions to be involved in local adaptation as well, particularly if habitat variation creates environment-dependent sexual antagonism. With these processes in mind, we investigated sex determination in a well-studied example of local adaptation within a species: the intertidal snail, ; . Using SNP data from a Swedish hybrid zone, we find novel evidence for a female-heterogametic sex determination system that is restricted to one ecotype. Our results suggest that four putative chromosomal inversions, two previously described and two newly discovered, span the putative sex chromosome pair. We determine their differing associations with sex, which suggest distinct strata of differing ages. The same inversions are found in the second ecotype but do not show any sex association. The striking disparity in inversion-sex associations between ecotypes that are connected by gene flow across a habitat transition that is just a few meters wide indicates a difference in selective regime that has produced a distinct barrier to the spread of the newly discovered sex-determining region between ecotypes. Such sex chromosome-environment interactions have not previously been uncovered in ; and are known in few other organisms. A combination of both sex-specific selection and divergent natural selection is required to explain these highly unusual patterns.},

  abstract     = {With the rise of affordable next-generation sequencing technology, introgression—or the exchange of genetic materials between taxa—has become widely perceived to be a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature. Although this claim is supported by several keystone studies, no thorough assessment of the frequency of introgression across eukaryotes in nature has been performed to date. In this manuscript, we aim to address this knowledge gap by examining patterns of introgression across eukaryotes. We collated a single statistic, Patterson&#39;s ; , which can be used as a test for introgression across 123 studies to further assess how taxonomic group, divergence time, and sequencing technology influence reports of introgression. Overall, introgression has mostly been measured in plants and vertebrates, with less attention given to the rest of the Eukaryotes. We find that the most frequently used metrics to detect introgression are difficult to compare across studies and even more so across biological systems due to differences in study effort, reporting standards, and methodology. Nonetheless, our analyses reveal several intriguing patterns, including the observation that differences in sequencing technologies may bias values of Patterson&#39;s ; and that introgression may differ throughout the course of the speciation process. Together, these results suggest the need for a unified approach to quantifying introgression in natural communities and highlight important areas of future research that can be better assessed once this unified approach is met.},

Here, we test for interspecific variation in behavioral flexibility by comparing burrowing behavior across three species of deer mice (genus ; ) with divergent social systems, ranging from promiscuous (; and ; ) to monogamous (; ). First, we compared the burrows built by individual mice to those built by pairs of mice in all three species. Although burrow length did not differ in ; or ; , we found that ; pairs cooperatively constructed burrows that were nearly twice as long as those built by individuals and that opposite-sex pairs dug longer burrows than same-sex pairs. Second, to directly observe cooperative digging behavior in ; , we designed a burrowing assay in which we could video-record active digging in narrow, transparent enclosures. Using this novel assay, we found, unexpectedly, that neither males nor females spent more time digging with an opposite-sex partner. Rather, we demonstrate that opposite-sex pairs are more socially cohesive and thus more efficient digging partners than same-sex pairs. Together, our study demonstrates how social context can modulate innate behavior and offers insight into how differences in behavioral flexibility may evolve among closely related species.},

  abstract     = {Females and males often have markedly different mortality rates and life spans, but it is unclear why these forms of sexual dimorphism evolve. The unguarded X hypothesis contends that dimorphic life spans arise from sex differences in X or Z chromosome copy number (i.e., one copy in the “heterogametic” sex; two copies in the “homogametic” sex), which leads to a disproportionate expression of deleterious mutations by the heterogametic sex (e.g., mammalian males; avian females). Although data on adult sex ratios and sex-specific longevity are consistent with predictions of the unguarded X hypothesis, direct experimental evidence remains scant, and alternative explanations are difficult to rule out. Using a simple population genetic model, we show that the unguarded X effect on sex differential mortality is a function of several reasonably well-studied evolutionary parameters, including the proportion of the genome that is sex linked, the genomic deleterious mutation rate, the mean dominance of deleterious mutations, the relative rates of mutation and strengths of selection in each sex, and the average effect of mutations on survival and longevity relative to their effects on fitness. We review published estimates of these parameters, parameterize our model with them, and show that unguarded X effects are too small to explain observed sex differences in life span across species. For example, sex differences in mean life span are known to often exceed 20\% (e.g., in mammals), whereas our parameterized models predict unguarded X effects of a few percent (e.g., 1–3\% in ; and mammals). Indeed, these predicted unguarded X effects fall below statistical thresholds of detectability in most experiments, potentially explaining why direct tests of the hypothesis have generated little support for it. Our results suggest that evolution of sexually dimorphic life spans is predominantly attributable to other mechanisms, potentially including “toxic Y” effects and sexual dimorphism for optimal investment in survival versus reproduction.; Impact Summary; Females and males are dimorphic for a wide range of traits, including the average lengths of their life spans. Sex differences in life span are both conspicuous and variable among species. For example, in mammals, females live ∼20\% longer than males (on average), whereas in birds, males live ∼10\% longer than females. One leading explanation for these patterns—the unguarded X hypothesis—argues that sex differences in life span emerge from the distinct sex chromosomes that females and males inherit. For many species, one sex (e.g., female mammals; male birds) carries two copies of each X-linked gene, whereas the other carries one. Because harmful mutations are partially recessive, the sex with only one copy of the X is more prone to expressing them, and that sex should therefore have a shorter average life span. This prediction of the unguarded X hypothesis is qualitatively consistent with observations of sex-ratio bias in adults and sexual dimorphism for longevity (e.g., mammalian males have one copy of the X and have shorter lives than females). However, there are other possible explanations for these patterns, making it unclear how much the unguarded X explains species diversity for sex-specific longevity. We developed a mathematical model for the contribution of unguarded X effects to sex differences in survival and life span, and used data on mutation rates and their effects on survival and fitness to quantify the importance of the unguarded X across species. The model, when combined with current data, suggests that the unguarded X hypothesis cannot explain the conspicuous sex differences in life span that are commonly reported in animal species, particularly vertebrates. Our results suggest that the unguarded X is an unlikely general explanation for the evolution of sexually dimorphic life spans, which gives weight to alternative mechanisms, including “toxic Y” effects and sex differential selection via trade-offs between survival and reproduction.},

  abstract     = {Selection that acts in a sex-specific manner causes the evolution of sexual dimorphism. Sex-specific phenotypic selection has been demonstrated in many taxa and can be in the same direction in the two sexes (differing only in magnitude), limited to one sex, or in opposing directions (antagonistic). Attempts to detect the signal of sex-specific selection from genomic data have confronted numerous difficulties. These challenges highlight the utility of “direct approaches,” in which fitness is predicted from individual genotype within each sex. Here, we directly measured selection on Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in a natural population of the sexually dimorphic, dioecious plant, ; . We measured flowering phenotypes, estimated fitness over one reproductive season, as well as survival to the next year, and genotyped all adults and a subset of their offspring for SNPs across the genome. We found that while phenotypic selection was congruent (fitness covaried similarly with flowering traits in both sexes), SNPs showed clear evidence for sex-specific selection. SNP-level selection was particularly strong in males and may involve an important gametic component (e.g., pollen competition). While the most significant SNPs under selection in males differed from those under selection in females, paternity selection showed a highly polygenic tradeoff with female survival. Alleles that increased male mating success tended to reduce female survival, indicating sexual antagonism at the genomic level. Perhaps most importantly, this experiment demonstrates that selection within natural populations can be strong enough to measure sex-specific fitness effects of individual loci.; Males and females typically differ phenotypically, a phenomenon known as sexual dimorphism. These differences arise when selection on males differs from selection on females, either in magnitude or direction. Estimated relationships between traits and fitness indicate that sex-specific selection is widespread, occurring in both plants and animals, and explains why so many species exhibit sexual dimorphism. Finding the specific loci experiencing sex-specific selection is a challenging prospect but one worth undertaking given the extensive evolutionary consequences. Flowering plants with separate sexes are ideal organisms for such studies, given that the fitness of females can be estimated by counting the number of seeds they produce. Determination of fitness for males has been made easier as thousands of genetic markers can now be used to assign paternity to seeds. We undertook just such a study in ; , a short-lived, herbaceous plant. We identified loci under sex-specific selection in this species and found more loci affecting fitness in males than females. Importantly, loci with major effects on male fitness were distinct from the loci with major effects on females. We detected sexual antagonism only when considering the aggregate effect of many loci. Hence, even though males and females share the same genome, this does not necessarily impose a constraint on their independent evolution.},

It is cultivated in small-scale agriculture in the highlands of Mesoamerica for its dry seeds and immature pods, and unlike the other domesticated beans, ; is an open-pollinated legume. Contrasting with its close relative, the common bean, few studies focusing on its domestication history have been conducted. Demographic bottlenecks associated with domestication might reduce genetic diversity and facilitate the accumulation of deleterious mutations. Conversely, introgression from wild relatives could be a source of variation. Using Genotyping by Sequencing data (79,286 single-nucleotide variants) from 237 cultivated and wild samples, we evaluated the demographic history of traditional varieties from different regions of Mexico and looked for evidence of introgression between sympatric wild and cultivated populations. Traditional varieties have high levels of diversity, even though there is evidence of a severe initial genetic bottleneck followed by a population expansion. Introgression from wild to domesticated populations was detected, which might contribute to the recovery of the genetic variation. Introgression has occurred at different times: constantly in the center of Mexico; recently in the North West; and anciently in the South. Several factors are acting together to increase and maintain genetic diversity in ; cultivars, such as demographic expansion and introgression. Wild relatives represent a valuable genetic resource and have played a key role in scarlet runner bean evolution via introgression into traditional varieties.},

Here, we investigate the pattern of adaptation to an extreme +10°C climate change in the wild, following the introduction of brine shrimp ; from San Francisco Bay, USA, to Vinh Chau saltern in Vietnam. We use a resurrection ecology approach, hatching diapause eggs from the ancestral population and the introduced population after 13 and 24 years (∼54 and ∼100 generations, respectively). In a series of coordinated experiments, we determined whether the introduced ; show increased tolerance to higher temperatures, and the extent to which genetic adaptation, developmental plasticity, transgenerational effects, and local microbiome differences contributed to this tolerance. We find that introduced brine shrimp do show increased phenotypic tolerance to warming. Yet strikingly, these changes do not have a detectable additive genetic component, are not caused by mitochondrial genetic variation, and do not seem to be caused by epigenetic marks set by adult parents exposed to warming. Further, we do not find any developmental plasticity that would help cope with warming, nor any protective effect of heat-tolerant local microbiota. The evolved thermal tolerance might therefore be entirely due to transgenerational (great)grandparental effects, possibly epigenetic marks set by parents who were exposed to high temperatures as juveniles. This study is a striking example of “missing heritability,” where a large adaptive phenotypic change is not accompanied by additive genetic effects.},

  abstract     = {The impact of fitness landscape features on evolutionary outcomes has attracted considerable interest in recent decades. However, evolution often occurs under time-dependent selection in so-called fitness seascapes where the landscape is under flux. Fitness seascapes are an inherent feature of natural environments, where the landscape changes owing both to the intrinsic fitness consequences of previous adaptations and extrinsic changes in selected traits caused by new environments. The complexity of such seascapes may curb the predictability of evolution. However, empirical efforts to test this question using a comprehensive set of regimes are lacking. Here, we employed an in vitro microbial model system to investigate differences in evolutionary outcomes between time-invariant and time-dependent environments, including all possible temporal permutations, with three subinhibitory antimicrobials and a viral parasite (phage) as selective agents. Expectedly, time-invariant environments caused stronger directional selection for resistances compared to time-dependent environments. Intriguingly, however, multidrug resistance outcomes in both cases were largely driven by two strong selective agents (rifampicin and phage) out of four agents in total. These agents either caused cross-resistance or obscured the phenotypic effect of other resistance mutations, modulating the evolutionary outcome overall in time-invariant environments and as a function of exposure epoch in time-dependent environments. This suggests that identifying strong selective agents and their pleiotropic effects is critical for predicting evolution in fitness seascapes, with ramifications for evolutionarily informed strategies to mitigate drug resistance evolution.},

  abstract     = {Reproductive parasites such as ; spread within host populations by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). CI occurs when parasite-modified sperm fertilizes uninfected eggs and is typified by great variation in strength across biological systems. In haplodiploid hosts, CI has different phenotypic outcomes depending on whether the fertilized eggs die or develop into males. Genetic conflict theories predict the evolution of host modulation of CI, which in turn influences the stability of reproductive parasitism. However, despite the ubiquity of CI-inducing parasites in nature, there is scarce evidence for intraspecific host modulation of CI strength and phenotype. Here, we tested for intraspecific host modulation of ; -induced CI in haplodiploid ; mites. Using a single CI-inducing ; variant and mitochondrion, a nuclear panel was created that consisted of infected and cured near-isogenic lines. We performed a highly replicated age-synchronized full diallel cross composed of incompatible and compatible control crosses. We uncovered host modifier systems that cause striking variation in CI strength when carried by infected ; males. We observed a continuum of CI phenotypes in our crosses and identified strong intraspecific female modulation of the CI phenotype. Crosses established a recessive genetic basis for the maternal effect and were consistent with polygenic Mendelian inheritance. Both male and female modulation interacted with the genotype of the mating partner. Our findings identify spermatogenesis as an important target of selection for host modulation of CI strength and underscore the importance of maternal genetic effects for the CI phenotype. Our findings reveal that intraspecific host modulation of CI is underpinned by complex genetic architectures and confirm that the evolution of reproductive parasitism is contingent on host genetics.},

Measuring these context-dependent effects in hosts and symbionts is critical to determining the nature of symbiotic interactions. We investigated context dependence in the symbiosis between social amoeba hosts and their inedible ; bacterial symbionts, where the context is the abundance of host food bacteria. ; have been shown to harm hosts dispersed to food-rich environments, but aid hosts dispersed to food-poor environments by allowing hosts to carry food bacteria. Through measuring symbiont density and host spore production, we show that this food context matters in three other ways. First, it matters for symbionts, who suffer a greater cost from competition with food bacteria in the food-rich context. Second, it matters for host-symbiont conflict, changing how symbiont density negatively impacts host spore production. Third, data-based simulations show that symbiosis often provides a long-term fitness advantage for hosts after rounds of growth and dispersal in variable food contexts, especially when conditions are harsh with little food. These results show how food context can have many consequences for the ; -; symbiosis and that both sides can frequently benefit.; Many organisms form symbiotic relationships with other species. These symbioses often exhibit context dependence, where the sign or magnitude of one partner&#39;s effect on the other will change in different environments. Context-dependent effects make it difficult to assign interactions to categories like mutualisms or antagonisms because they involve both benefits and costs depending on the environment. However, in some cases, accounting for context dependence can clarify an interaction so that it more easily fits a mutualism or antagonism. We investigated context dependence using the symbiosis between ; and two symbiotic ; species. In this symbiosis, ; bacteria allow hosts to carry food bacteria to food-poor contexts, where hosts rarely survive without food, but reduce host fitness in the more hospitable food-rich contexts. The effect of food context on P; symbionts is unknown. We show that ; symbionts are also affected by this context, through facing reduced competition after being dispersed by hosts to food-poor contexts. We also identify a new way that symbionts affect hosts, where symbiont density reduces host fitness, but less so in food-poor contexts. Finally, we use simulations to show that infected hosts benefit in the long term across variable food contexts, especially in the harshest environments with little food. These results show that context dependence in symbiosis can have many consequences for hosts and symbionts, although in general for ; and ; , both are likely to benefit.},

  abstract     = {Many biological traits covary with body size, resulting in an allometric relationship. Identifying the evolutionary drivers of these traits is complicated by possible relationships between a candidate selective agent and body size itself, motivating the widespread use of multiple regression analysis. However, the possibility that multiple regression may generate misleading estimates when predictor variables are correlated has recently received much attention. Here, we argue that a primary source of such bias is the failure to account for the complex causal structures underlying brains, bodies, and agents. When brains and bodies are expected to evolve in a correlated manner over and above the effects of specific agents of selection, neither simple nor multiple regression will identify the true causal effect of an agent on brain size. This problem results from the inclusion of a predictor variable in a regression analysis that is (in part) a consequence of the response variable. We demonstrate these biases with examples and derive estimators to identify causal relationships when traits evolve as a function of an existing allometry. Model mis-specification relative to plausible causal structures, not collinearity, requires further consideration as an important source of bias in comparative analyses.},

Such estimation in turn requires that focal traits, and their underlying quantitative genetic architectures, are appropriately conceptualized. Here, we highlight that directly analyzing observed phenotypes as continuously distributed quantitative traits can potentially generate biased and misleading estimates of additive genetic variances and individual-by-environment and gene-by-environment interactions, and hence of forms of plasticity and genetic constraints, if in fact the underlying biology is best conceptualized as an environmentally sensitive threshold trait. We illustrate this scenario with particular reference to the key phenological trait of seasonal breeding date, which has become a focus for quantifying joint microevolutionary, plastic, and population responses to environmental change, but has also become a focus for highlighting that predicted adaptive outcomes are not always observed. Specifically, we use simple simulations to illustrate how potentially misleading inferences on magnitudes of additive genetic variance, and forms of environmental interactions, can arise by directly analyzing observed breeding dates if the transition to breeding in fact represents a threshold trait with latent-scale plasticity. We summarize how existing and new datasets could be (re)analyzed, potentially providing new insights into how critical microevolutionary and plastic phenological responses to environmental variation and change can arise and be constrained.},

Understanding the genetic basis of sexual dimorphism and its evolution is crucial for understanding biological differences between the sexes. Genetic variants with sex-antagonistic effects on fitness are expected to segregate in populations at the early phases of sexual dimorphism emergence. Detecting such variants is notoriously difficult, and the few genome-scan methods employed so far have limited power and little specificity. Here, we propose a new framework to detect a signature of sexually antagonistic (SA) selection. We rely on trio datasets where sex-biased transmission distortions can be directly tracked from parents to offspring, and identify signals of SA transmission distortions in genomic regions. We report the genomic location of six candidate regions detected in human populations as potentially under sexually antagonist selection. We find an enrichment of genes associated with embryonic development within these regions. Last, we highlight two candidate regions for SA selection in humans.},

  abstract     = {A central question in evolution is how several adaptive phenotypes are maintained within a species. Theory predicts that the genetic determination of a trait, and in particular the amounts of redundancy in the mapping of genotypes to phenotypes, mediates evolutionary outcomes of phenotypic selection. In Mediterranean wild thyme, numerous discrete chemical phenotypes (chemotypes) occur in close geographic proximity. Chemotypes are defined by the predominant monoterpene produced by individual plants in their essential oil. In this study, we analyze the ecological genetics of six chemotypes nested within two well-established chemical families (hereafter ecotypes). Ecotypes, and chemotypes within ecotypes, are spatially segregated, and their distributions track local differences in the abiotic environment. By combining population genomic, phenotypic, and environmental data from 700 individuals, we show how the genetics of ecotype determination mediates this evolutionary response. Variation in three terpene-synthase loci explains variation in ecotype identity, with one single locus accounting for as much as 78\% of this variation. Phenotypic selection combined with low segregating genotypic redundancy of ecotypes leaves a clear footprint at the genomic level: alleles associated with ecotype identity track environmental variation despite extensive gene flow. Different chemotypes within each ecotype differentially track environmental variation. Their identity is determined by multiple loci and displays a wider range of genotypic redundancy that dilutes phenotypic selection on their characteristic alleles. Our study thus provides a novel illustration of how genetic redundancy of a phenotype modulates the ability of selection to maintain adaptive differentiation. Identifying the precise genetics of the chemical polymorphism in thyme is the next crucial step for our understanding of the origin and maintenance of a polymorphism that is present in many aromatic plants.},

Price at al.&#39;s less obvious result is that individuals, on average, are expected to breed later than the optimum. Here, we provide an explanation of their non-intuitive result in terms of hard selection, and go on to show that neither of their results are expected to hold if the relationship between breeding date and nutrition is allowed to evolve. By introducing the assumption that the advantage of breeding early is greater for individuals in high nutritional condition, we show that their most cited result can be salvaged. However, individuals, on average, are expected to breed earlier than the optimum, not later. More generally, we also show that the hard selection mechanisms that underpin these results have major implications for the evolution of plasticity: when environmental heterogeneity becomes too great, plasticity is selected against, prohibiting the evolution of generalists.},

  abstract     = {Closely related populations often differ in resistance to a given parasite, as measured by infection success or failure. Yet, the immunological mechanisms of these evolved differences are rarely specified. Does resistance evolve via changes to the host&#39;s ability to recognize that an infection exists, actuate an effective immune response, or attenuate that response? We tested whether each of these phases of the host response contributed to threespine sticklebacks’ recently evolved resistance to their tapeworm ; . Although marine stickleback and some susceptible lake fish permit fast-growing tapeworms, other lake populations are resistant and suppress tapeworm growth via a fibrosis response. We subjected lab-raised fish from three populations (susceptible marine “ancestors,” a susceptible lake population, and a resistant lake population) to a novel immune challenge using an injection of (1) a saline control, (2) alum, a generalized pro-inflammatory adjuvant that causes fibrosis, (3) a tapeworm protein extract, or (4) a combination of alum and tapeworm protein. With enough time, all three populations generated a robust fibrosis response to the alum treatments. Yet, only the resistant population exhibited a fibrosis response to the tapeworm protein alone. Thus, these populations differed in their ability to respond to the tapeworm protein but shared an intact fibrosis pathway. The resistant population also initiated fibrosis faster in response to alum, and was able to attenuate fibrosis, unlike the susceptible populations’ slow but longer lasting response to alum. As fibrosis has pathological side effects that reduce fecundity, the faster recovery by the resistant population may reflect an adaptation to mitigate the costs of immunity. Broadly, our results confirm that parasite detection and immune initiation, activation speed, and immune attenuation simultaneously contribute to the evolution of parasite resistance and adaptations to infection in natural populations.},

Population genomic studies of experimental populations of Trinidadian guppies (; ) provide a unique opportunity to study this phenomenon. Guppy populations that were transplanted from high-predation (HP) to low-predation (LP) environments have been shown to evolve toward the phenotypes of naturally colonized LP populations in as few as eight generations. These changes persist in common garden experiments, indicating that they have a genetic basis. Here, we report results of whole genome variation in four experimental populations colonizing LP sites along with the corresponding HP source population. We examined genome-wide patterns of genetic variation to estimate past demography and used a combination of genome scans, forward simulations, and a novel analysis of allele frequency change vectors to uncover the signature of selection. We detected clear signals of population growth and bottlenecks at the genome-wide level that matched the known history of population numbers. We found a region on chromosome 15 under strong selection in three of the four populations and with our multivariate approach revealing subtle parallel changes in allele frequency in all four populations across this region. Investigating patterns of genome-wide selection in this uniquely replicated experiment offers remarkable insight into the mechanisms underlying rapid adaptation, providing a basis for comparison with other species and populations experiencing rapidly changing environments.},

  abstract     = {The rise of globalization has spread organisms beyond their natural range, allowing further opportunity for species to adapt to novel environments and potentially become invaders. Yet, the role of thermal niche evolution in promoting the success of invasive species remains poorly understood. Here, we use thermal performance curves (TPCs) to test hypotheses about thermal adaptation during the invasion process. First, we tested the hypothesis that if species largely conserve their thermal niche in the introduced range, invasive populations may not evolve distinct TPCs relative to native populations, against the alternative hypothesis that thermal niche and therefore TPC evolution has occurred in the invasive range. Second, we tested the hypothesis that clines of TPC parameters are shallower or absent in the invasive range, against the alternative hypothesis that with sufficient time, standing genetic variation, and temperature-mediated selection, invasive populations would re-establish clines found in the native range in response to temperature gradients. To test these hypotheses, we built TPCs for 18 native (United States) and 13 invasive (United Kingdom) populations of the yellow monkeyflower, ; . We grew clones of multiple genotypes per population at six temperature regimes in growth chambers. We found that invasive populations have not evolved different thermal optima or performance breadths, providing evidence for evolutionary stasis of thermal performance between the native and invasive ranges after over 200 years post introduction. Thermal optimum increased with mean annual temperature in the native range, indicating some adaptive differentiation among native populations that was absent in the invasive range. Further, native and invasive populations did not exhibit adaptive clines in thermal performance breadth with latitude or temperature seasonality. These findings suggest that TPCs remained unaltered post invasion, and that invasion may proceed via broad thermal tolerance and establishment in already climatically suitable areas rather than rapid evolution upon introduction.},

  abstract     = {It has been hypothesized that the effects of pollutants on phenotypes can be passed to subsequent generations through epigenetic inheritance, affecting populations long after the removal of a pollutant. But there is still little evidence that pollutants can induce persistent epigenetic effects in animals. Here, we show that low doses of commonly used pollutants induce genome-wide differences in cytosine methylation in the freshwater crustacean ; . Uniclonal populations were either continually exposed to pollutants or switched to clean water, and methylation was compared to control populations that did not experience pollutant exposure. Although some direct changes to methylation were only present in the continually exposed populations, others were present in both the continually exposed and switched to clean water treatments, suggesting that these modifications had persisted for 7 months (&gt;15 generations). We also identified modifications that were only present in the populations that had switched to clean water, indicating a long-term legacy of pollutant exposure distinct from the persistent effects. Pollutant-induced differential methylation tended to occur at sites that were highly methylated in controls. Modifications that were observed in both continually and switched treatments were highly methylated in controls and showed reduced methylation in the treatments. On the other hand, modifications found just in the switched treatment tended to have lower levels of methylation in the controls and showed increase methylation in the switched treatment. In a second experiment, we confirmed that sublethal doses of the same pollutants generate effects on life histories for at least three generations following the removal of the pollutant. Our results demonstrate that even low doses of pollutants can induce transgenerational epigenetic effects that are stably transmitted over many generations. Persistent effects are likely to influence phenotypic development, which could contribute to the rapid adaptation, or extinction, of populations confronted by anthropogenic stressors.},

In an influential paper, Kirkpatrick and Barton used a good-genes model and evolutionary rates estimated from the fossil record to conclude that indirect selection on preference is likely to be weak compared to typical strengths of direct selection. More recent authors have extrapolated from Kirkpatrick and Barton&#39;s conclusions to suggest that the presence of preference-trait genetic correlations in equations for indirect but not direct selection gives a purely theoretical basis to the conclusion that the former is likely to be weaker than the latter. Here, I challenge these views, and argue that the relative importance of direct and indirect selection on preference is an empirical issue that defies simple generalizations. First, I show that Kirkpatrick and Barton based their conclusion on a questionable claim about typical rates of evolution due to direct selection. Second, I argue that claiming that direct selection on preference is stronger than indirect selection because only equations for the latter contain a genetic correlation mistakes the mathematical simplicity with which direct selection is usually represented for evidence regarding its magnitude. By comparing a simple equation for the selection response of preference caused by somatic (“direct”) benefits to Kirkpatrick and Barton&#39;s result for the response to indirect selection, I show that indirect selection on preference is not inherently weaker than direct selection. I also point out an important but overlooked reason why selection on preference under the sensory bias hypothesis can be expected to be less effective in the long run than that from either somatic or genetic benefits of mate choices.},

  abstract     = {Maternally inherited ; transinfections are being introduced into natural mosquito populations to reduce the transmission of dengue, Zika, and other arboviruses. ; -induced cytoplasmic incompatibility provides a frequency-dependent reproductive advantage to infected females that can spread transinfections within and among populations. However, because transinfections generally reduce host fitness, they tend to spread within populations only after their frequency exceeds a critical threshold. This produces bistability with stable equilibrium frequencies at both 0 and 1, analogous to the bistability produced by underdominance between alleles or karyotypes and by population dynamics under Allee effects. Here, we analyze how stochastic frequency variation produced by finite population size can facilitate the local spread of variants with bistable dynamics into areas where invasion is unexpected from deterministic models. Our exemplar is the establishment of ; Mel ; in the ; population of Pyramid Estates (PE), a small community in far north Queensland, Australia. In 2011, ; Mel was stably introduced into Gordonvale, separated from PE by barriers to ; dispersal. After nearly 6 years during which ; Mel was observed only at low frequencies in PE, corresponding to an apparent equilibrium between immigration and selection, ; Mel rose to fixation by 2018. Using analytic approximations and statistical analyses, we demonstrate that the observed fixation of ; Mel at PE is consistent with both stochastic transition past an unstable threshold frequency and deterministic transformation produced by steady immigration at a rate just above the threshold required for deterministic invasion. The indeterminacy results from a delicate balance of parameters needed to produce the delayed transition observed. Our analyses suggest that once ; transinfections are established locally through systematic introductions, stochastic “threshold crossing” is likely to only minimally enhance spatial spread, providing a local ratchet that slightly—but systematically—aids area-wide transformation of disease-vector populations in heterogeneous landscapes.},

  abstract     = {Evolution can involve periods of rapid divergent adaptation and expansion in the range of diversity, but evolution can also be relatively conservative over certain timescales due to functional, genetic-developmental, and ecological constraints. One way in which evolution may be conservative is in terms of allometry, the scaling relationship between the traits of organisms and body size. Here, we investigate patterns of allometric conservatism in the evolution of bird beaks with beak size and body size data for a representative sample of over 5000 extant bird species within a phylogenetic framework. We identify clades in which the allometric relationship between beak size and body size has remained relatively conserved across species over millions to tens of millions of years. We find that allometric conservatism is nonetheless punctuated by occasional shifts in the slopes and intercepts of allometric relationships. A steady accumulation of such shifts through time has given rise to the tremendous diversity of beak size relative to body size across birds today. Our findings are consistent with the Simpsonian vision of macroevolution, with evolutionary conservatism being the rule but with occasional shifts to new adaptive zones.},

  abstract     = {Traumatic insemination is a mating behavior during which the (sperm) donor uses a traumatic intromittent organ to inject an ejaculate through the epidermis of the (sperm) recipient, thereby frequently circumventing the female genitalia. Traumatic insemination occurs widely across animals, but the frequency of its evolution, the intermediate stages via which it originates, and the morphological changes that such shifts involve remain poorly understood. Based on observations in 145 species of the free-living flatworm genus ; , we identify at least nine independent evolutionary origins of traumatic insemination from reciprocal copulation, but no clear indication of reversals. These origins involve convergent shifts in multivariate morphospace of male and female reproductive traits, suggesting that traumatic insemination has a canalizing effect on morphology. We also observed sperm in both the sperm receiving organ and within the body tissue of two species. These species had intermediate trait values indicating that traumatic insemination evolves through initial internal wounding during copulation. Finally, signatures of male-female coevolution of genitalia across the genus indicate that sexual selection and sexual conflict drive the evolution of traumatic insemination, because it allows donors to bypass postcopulatory control mechanisms of recipients.},

The neutral theory predicts that the amount of variation in the genome sequence between different individuals of the same species should increase with its effective population size (; ). In real populations, multiple factors that modulate the variance in reproductive success among individuals cause ; to differ from the total number of individuals (; ). Among these, age-specific mortality and fecundity rates are known to have a direct impact on the ; ratio. However, the extent to which vital rates account for differences in genetic diversity among species remains unknown. Here, we addressed this question by comparing genome-wide genetic diversity across 16 marine fish species with similar geographic distributions but contrasted lifespan and age-specific survivorship and fecundity curves. We sequenced the whole genome of 300 individuals to high coverage and assessed their genome-wide heterozygosity with a reference-free approach. Genetic diversity varied from 0.2\% to 1.4\% among species, and showed a negative correlation with adult lifespan, with a large negative effect (; per additional year of lifespan) that was further increased when brooding species providing intense parental care were removed from the dataset (; per additional year of lifespan). Using published vital rates for each species, we showed that the ; ratio resulting simply from life tables parameters can predict the observed differences in genetic diversity among species. Using simulations, we further found that the extent of reduction in ; with increasing adult lifespan is particularly strong under Type III survivorship curves (high juvenile and low adult mortality) and increasing fecundity with age, a typical characteristic of marine fishes. Our study highlights the importance of vital rates as key determinants of species genetic diversity levels in nature.},

Mismatch occurs when hybrids resemble one parent population for some phenotypic traits and the other parent population for other traits, and is caused by dominance in opposing directions or from segregation of alleles in recombinant hybrids. In this study, we used threespine stickleback fish (; L.) to test the theoretical prediction that trait mismatch in hybrids should increase with the magnitude of phenotypic divergence between parent populations. We measured morphological traits in parents and hybrids in crosses between a marine population representing the ancestral form and twelve freshwater populations that have diverged from this ancestral state to varying degrees according to their environments. We found that trait mismatch was greater in more divergent crosses for both F; and F; hybrids. In the F; , the divergence–mismatch relationship was caused by traits having dominance in different directions, whereas it was caused by increasing segregating phenotypic variation in the F; .

  abstract     = {Frequency-dependent (FD) selection, whereby fitness and selection depend on the genetic or phenotypic composition of the population, arises in numerous ecological contexts (competition, mate choice, crypsis, mimicry, etc.) and can strongly impact evolutionary dynamics. In particular, negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS) is well known for its ability to potentially maintain stable polymorphisms, but it has also been invoked as a source of persistent, predictable frequency fluctuations. However, the conditions under which such fluctuations persist are not entirely clear. In particular, previous work rarely considered that FD is unlikely to be the sole driver of evolutionary dynamics when it occurs, because most environments are not static but instead change dynamically over time. Here, we investigate how FD interacts with a temporally fluctuating environment to shape the dynamics of population genetic change. We show that a simple metric introduced by Lewontin, the slope of frequency change against frequency near equilibrium, works as a key criterion for distinguishing microevolutionary outcomes, even in a changing environment. When this slope ; is between 0 and –2 (consistent with the empirical examples we review), substantial fluctuations would not persist on their own in a large population occupying a constant environment, but they can still be maintained indefinitely as quasi-cycles fueled by environmental noise or genetic drift. However, such moderate NFDS buffers and temporally shifts evolutionary responses to periodic environments (e.g., seasonality). Stronger FD, with slope ; &lt; –2, can produce self-sustained cycles that may overwhelm responses to a changing environment, or even chaos that fundamentally limits predictability. This diversity of expected outcomes, together with the empirical evidence for both FD and environment-dependent selection, suggests that the interplay of internal dynamics with external forcing should be investigated more systematically to reach a better understanding and prediction of evolution.},

  abstract     = {The pace of tree microevolution during Anthropocene warming is largely unknown. We used a retrospective approach to monitor genomic changes in oak trees since the Little Ice Age (LIA). Allelic frequency changes were assessed from whole-genome pooled sequences for four age-structured cohorts of sessile oak (; ) dating back to 1680, in each of three different oak forests in France. The genetic covariances of allelic frequency changes increased between successive time periods, highlighting genome-wide effects of linked selection. We found imprints of parallel linked selection in the three forests during the late LIA, and a shift of selection during more recent time periods of the Anthropocene. The changes in allelic covariances within and between forests mirrored the documented changes in the occurrence of extreme events (droughts and frosts) over the last 300 years. The genomic regions with the highest covariances were enriched in genes involved in plant responses to pathogens and abiotic stresses (temperature and drought). These responses are consistent with the reported sequence of frost (or drought) and disease damage ultimately leading to the oak dieback after extreme events. They provide support for adaptive evolution of long-lived species during recent climatic changes. Although we acknowledge that other sources (e.g., gene flow, generation overlap) may have contributed to temporal covariances of allelic frequency changes, the consistent and correlated response across the three forests lends support to the existence of a systematic driving force such as natural selection.},
