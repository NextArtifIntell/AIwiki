  abstract     = {Apparent cases of sympatric speciation may actually be due to micro-allopatric or micro-parapatric speciation. One way to distinguish between these models is to examine the existence and nature of genomic islands of divergence, wherein divergent DNA segments are interspersed with low-divergence segments. Such islands should be rare or absent under micro-allopatric speciation but common in cases of speciation with gene flow. Sympatric divergence of endemic fishes is known from isolated saline, crater, postglacial, and ancient lakes. Two morphologically distinct cyprinid fishes, Gymnocypris eckloni scoliostomus (GS) and G. eckloni eckloni (GE), in a small glacial lake on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau, Lake Sunmcuo, match the biogeographic criteria of sympatric speciation. In this study, we examined genome-wide variation in 46 individuals from these two groups. The divergence time between the GS and GE lineages was estimated to be 20–60 Kya. We identified 54 large genomic islands (≥100 kb) of speciation, which accounted for 89.4% of the total length of all genomic islands. These islands harboured divergent genes related to olfactory receptors and olfaction signals that may play important roles in food selection and assortative mating in fishes. Although the genomic islands clearly indicated speciation with gene flow and rejected micro-allopatric speciation, they were too large to support the hypothesis of sympatric speciation. Theoretical and recent empirical studies suggested that continual gene flow in sympatry should give rise to many small genomic islands (as small as a few kilobases in size). Thus, the observed pattern is consistent with the extensive evidence on parapatric speciation, in which adjacent habitats facilitate divergent selection but also permit gene flow during speciation. We suggest that many, if not most, of the reported cases of sympatric speciation are likely to be micro-parapatric speciation.},

  abstract     = {In the conventional view, species are separate gene pools delineated by reproductive isolation (RI). In an alternative view, species may also be delineated by a small set of ‘speciation genes’ without full RI, a view that has gained broad acceptance. A recent survey, however, suggested that the extensive literature on ‘speciation with gene flow’ is mostly (if not all) about exchanges in the early stages of speciation. There is no definitive evidence that the observed gene flow actually happened after speciation is completed. Here, we wish to know whether ‘good species’ (defined by the ‘secondary sympatry’ test) do continue to exchange genes and, importantly, under what conditions such exchanges can be observed. De novo whole-genome assembly and re-sequencing of individuals across the range of two closely related mangrove species ( Rhizophora mucronata and R. stylosa ) reveal the genomes to be well delineated in allopatry. They became sympatric in northeastern Australia but remain distinct species. Nevertheless, their genomes harbor ∼4000–10 000 introgression blocks averaging only about 3–4 Kb. These fine-grained introgressions indicate continual gene flow long after speciation as non-introgressable ‘genomic islets,’ ∼1.4 Kb in size, often harbor diverging genes of flower or gamete development. The fine-grained introgression in secondary sympatry may help settle the debate about sympatric vs. micro-allopatric speciation. In conclusion, true ‘good species’ may often continue to exchange genes but the opportunity for detection is highly constrained.},

  abstract     = {Radiations are especially important for generating species biodiversity in mountainous ecosystems. The contribution of hybridization to such radiations has rarely been examined. Here, we use extensive genomic data to test whether hybridization was involved in evolutionary radiation within Rhododendron subgenus Hymenanthes , whose members show strong geographic isolation in the mountains of southwest China. We sequenced genomes for 143 species of this subgenus and 93 species of four other subgenera, and found that Hymenanthes was monophyletic and radiated during the late Oligocene to middle Miocene. Widespread hybridization events were inferred within and between the identified clades and subclades. This suggests that hybridization occurred both early and late during diversification of subgenus Hymenanthes , although the extent to which hybridization, speciation through mixing-isolation-mixing or hybrid speciation, accelerated the diversification needs further exploration. Cycles of isolation and contact in such and other montane ecosystems may have together promoted species radiation through hybridization between diverging populations and species. Similar radiation processes may apply to other montane floras in this region and elsewhere.},

  abstract     = {Despite the concern of within-tumor genetic diversity, this diversity is in fact limited by the kinship among cells in the tumor. Indeed, genomic studies have amply supported the ‘Nowell dogma’ whereby cells of the same tumor descend from a single progenitor cell. In parallel, genomic data also suggest that the diversity could be &gt;10-fold larger if tumor cells are of multiple origins. We develop an evolutionary hypothesis that a single tumor may often harbor multiple cell clones of independent origins, but only one would be large enough to be detected. To test the hypothesis, we search for independent tumors within a larger one (or tumors-in-tumor). Very high density sampling was done on two cases of colon tumors. Case 1 indeed has 13 independent clones of disparate sizes, many having heavy mutation burdens and potentially highly tumorigenic. In Case 2, despite a very intensive search, only two small independent clones could be found. The two cases show very similar movements and metastasis of the dominant clone. Cells initially move actively in the expanding tumor but become nearly immobile in late stages. In conclusion, tumors-in-tumor are plausible but could be very demanding to find. Despite their small sizes, they can enhance the within-tumor diversity by orders of magnitude. Such increases may contribute to the missing genetic diversity associated with the resistance to cancer therapy.},

Introducing interconnected mesopores and macropores into a single microporous zeolite with the rationalized pore size at each level is an effective strategy to suppress the diffusion limitations, but remains highly challenging due to the lack of rational design principles. Herein, we demonstrate the first example of boosting molecular diffusion by constructing hierarchical Murray zeolites with a highly ordered and fully interconnected macro–meso–microporous structure on the basis of the generalized Murray&#39;s Law. Such a hierarchical Murray zeolite with a refined quantitative relationship between the pore size at each length scale exhibited 9 and 5 times higher effective diffusion rates, leading to 2.5 and 1.5 times higher catalytic performance in the bulky 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene cracking reaction than those of microporous ZSM-5 and ZSM-5 nanocrystals, respectively. The concept of hierarchical Murray zeolites with optimized structural features and their design principles could be applied to other catalytic reactions for maximized performance.},

  abstract     = {The arrival of surgical robots in high-end medical equipment is a landmark, and the realization of tactile sensation a major challenge in this important cutting-edge research field. Aiming to address this issue, we present ultra-sensitive ionic electronic skin in the form of flexible capacitive pressure sensors, which incorporate multistage bionic microstructures in ion gels for the purpose of monitoring the delicate operations of surgical robots. Significantly, the ionic skin exhibits an ultra-high sensitivity of 9484.3 kPa −1 (&lt;15 kPa), and the sensitivity remains higher than 235 kPa −1 in the wide range of 15–155 kPa. The device has also achieved a detection limit as low as 0.12 Pa or, equivalently, 0.31 mg, fast response within 24 ms, and high robustness (loading/unloading for 5000 cycles without fatigue). The sensor facilitates the challenging task of tele-operated robotic threading, which exceeds the human tactile perception limit when threading a needle. We have also confirmed that ionic skin can be used in robot-assisted invasive surgery, such as incision/resection of tissues and suturing of wounds, providing tactile information to surgeons to improve operation success rates. The flexible ionic skin is capable of conforming to the various shapes of robotic manipulators, thus has great promise for applications in robotic dexterous manipulation, prosthetics and human–machine interfaces.},

  abstract     = {International efforts to avoid dangerous climate change have historically focused on reducing energy-related CO 2 emissions from countries with either the largest economies (e.g. the EU and the USA) and/or the largest populations (e.g. China and India). However, in recent years, emissions have surged among a different and much less-examined group of countries, raising concerns that a next generation of high-emitting economies will obviate current mitigation targets. Here, we analyse the trends and drivers of emissions in each of the 59 countries where emissions in 2010–2018 grew faster than the global average (excluding China and India), project their emissions under a range of longer-term energy scenarios and estimate the costs of decarbonization pathways. Total emissions from these ‘emerging emitters’ reach as much as 7.5 GtCO 2 /year in the baseline 2.5° scenario—substantially greater than the emissions from these regions in previously published scenarios that would limit warming to 1.5°C or even 2°C. Such unanticipated emissions would in turn require non-emitting energy deployment from all sectors within these emerging emitters, and faster and deeper reductions in emissions from other countries to meet international climate goals. Moreover, the annual costs of keeping emissions at the low level are in many cases 0.2%–4.1% of countries’ gross domestic production, pointing to potential trade-offs with poverty-reduction goals and/or the need for economic support and low-carbon technology transfer from historically high-emitting countries. Our results thus highlight the critical importance of ramping up mitigation efforts in countries that to this point have been largely ignored.},

  abstract     = {Earth&#39;s known supercontinents are believed to have formed in vastly different ways, with two endmembers being introversion and extroversion. The former involves the closure of the internal oceans formed during the break-up of the previous supercontinent, whereas the latter involves the closure of the previous external superocean. However, it is unclear what caused such diverging behavior of supercontinent cycles that involved first-order interaction between subducting tectonic plates and the mantle. Here we address this question through 4D geodynamic modeling using realistic tectonic set-ups. Our results show that the strength of the oceanic lithosphere plays a critical role in determining the assembly path of a supercontinent. We found that high oceanic lithospheric strength leads to introversion assembly, whereas lower strength leads to extroversion assembly. A theoretically estimated reduction in oceanic crustal thickness, and thus its strength, during Earth&#39;s secular cooling indicates that introversion was only possible for the Precambrian time when the oceanic lithosphere was stronger, thus predicting the assembling of the next supercontinent Amasia through the closure of the Pacific Ocean instead of the Indian-Atlantic oceans. Our work provides a new understanding of the secular evolution of plate tectonics and geodynamics as the Earth cooled.},

The N 2 molecule was first fixed with carbon and LiH through a one-pot heterogeneous process, forming Li 2 CN 2 as an ‘activated’ nitrogen source with high efficiency. Then subsequent homogeneous treatments of Li 2 CN 2 to construct the organic synthon carbodiimide and the RNA/DNA building block pyrimidines were fulfilled. By using 15 N 2 as the feedstock, their corresponding 15 N-labeled carbodiimide and pyrimidines were readily obtained. This homogeneous–heterogeneous synergy strategy will open a new chapter for N 2 transformation.},

However, most previous studies only focused on a single resource while neglecting the nature of resource multidimensionality. Here we integrated four essential resources for plant growth into a single metric of resource diversity (RD) to investigate its effects on the productivity–biodiversity relationship (PBR) across Chinese grasslands. Results showed that habitats differing in RD have different PBRs—positive in low-resource habitats, but neutral in medium- and high-resource ones—while collectively, a weak positive PBR was observed. However, when excluding direct effects of RD on productivity and biodiversity, the PBR in high-resource habitats became negative, which leads to a unimodal instead of a positive PBR along the RD gradient. By integrating resource effects and changing plant–plant interactions into a unified framework with the RD gradient, our work contributes to uncovering underlying mechanisms for inconsistent PBRs at large scales.},

We found that deletion of Tbx2 in neonatal IHCs led to their transdifferentiation into OHCs by repressing 26.7% of IHC genes and inducing 56.3% of OHC genes, including Ikzf2 . More importantly, persistent expression of Tbx2 coupled with transient Atoh1 expression effectively reprogrammed non-sensory supporting cells into new IHCs expressing the functional IHC marker vGlut3. The differentiation status of these new IHCs was considerably more advanced than that previously reported. Thus, Tbx2 is essential for IHC development and co-upregulation of Tbx2 with Atoh1 in supporting cells represents a new approach for treating deafness related to IHC degeneration.},

Comparative proteomics uncovered dysregulated synaptic glutamate utilization and transport in CPE-deficient flies. An extensive genetic screen was conducted to verify the role of differentially expressed proteins in circadian regulation. Arrhythmic locomotion under cpes 1 mutant background was rescued only by restoring endogenous CPE or SM through expressing their respective synthases. Our results underscore the essential role of CPE in maintaining synaptic glutamate homeostasis and modulating circadian behavior in Drosophila .

By means of the redistribution of atoms and chemical bonds, it invokes an effective lattice adjustment and tailors corresponding physical properties.

In this work, we deciphered the interlaced distribution of nanosized domains with chemical order/disorder in Fe 3 Pt bulk alloy. HAADF-STEM images evidence the existence of such nanodomains. The reverse Monte Carlo method with the X-ray pair distribution function data reveal the 3D distribution of local structures and the tensile effect in the disordered domains at the single-atomic level. The chemical bonding around the domain boundary changes the bonding feature in the disordered side and reduces the local magnetic moment of Fe atoms. This results in a suppressed negative thermal expansion and extended temperature range in Fe 3 Pt bulk alloy with nanodomains. Our study demonstrates a local revelation for the chemical order/disorder nanodomains in bulk alloy. The understanding gained from atomic short-range interactions within the domain boundaries provides useful insights with regard to designing new functional compounds.},

To address this issue, we report a general methodology for generating ultra-broadband achromatic metasurfaces with prescribed ultra-broadband achromatic properties in a bottom-up inverse-design paradigm. We demonstrate three ultra-broadband functionalities, including acoustic beam deflection, focusing and levitation, with relative bandwidths of 93.3%, 120% and 118.9%, respectively. In addition, we reveal a relationship between broadband achromatic functionality and element dispersion. All metasurface elements have anisotropic and asymmetric geometries with multiple scatterers and local cavities that synthetically support internal resonances, bi-anisotropy and multiple scattering for ultra-broadband customized dispersion. Our study opens new horizons for ultra-broadband highly efficient achromatic functional devices, with promising extension to optical and elastic metamaterials.},

  abstract     = {Quantum statistics plays a fundamental role in the laws of nature. Haldane fractional exclusion statistics (FES) generalizes the Pauli exclusion statistics, and can emerge in the properties of elementary particles and hole excitations of a quantum system consisting of conventional bosons or fermions. FES has a long history of intensive studies, but its simple realization in interacting physical systems is rare. Here we report a simple non-mutual FES that depicts the particle-hole symmetry breaking in interacting Bose gases at a quantum critical point. We show that the FES distribution directly comes from particle-hole symmetry breaking. Based on exact solutions, quantum Monte Carlo simulations and experiments, we find that, over a wide range of interaction strengths, the macroscopic physical properties of these gases are determined by non-interacting quasi-particles that obey non-mutual FES of the same form in one and two dimensions. Whereas strongly interacting Bose gases reach full fermionization in one dimension, they exhibit incomplete fermionization in two dimensions. Our results provide a generic connection between interaction-induced particle-hole symmetry breaking (depicted by FES) and macroscopic properties of many-body systems in arbitrary dimensions. Our work lays the groundwork for using FES to explore quantum criticality and other novel many-body phenomena in strongly correlated quantum systems.},

In such spin-based logic devices, however, the multi-strip structure and fewer functions are obstacles to improving integration and reducing energy consumption. Here we propose a skyrmions-based single-nanotrack logic family including AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR and XNOR that can be implemented and reconstructed by building and switching the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI) chirality barrier on a racetrack memory. Besides the pinning effect of the DMI chirality barrier on skyrmions, the annihilation, fusion and shunting of two skyrmions with opposite chirality are also achieved and demonstrated via local reversal of the DMI, which are necessary for the design of an engineer programmable logic nanotrack, transistor and complementary racetrack memory.},

  abstract     = {The second-order nonlinear Hall effect observed in the time-reversal symmetric system has not only shown abundant physical content, but also exhibited potential application prospects. Recently, a third-order nonlinear Hall effect has been observed in MoTe 2 and WTe 2 . However, few-layer MoTe 2 and WTe 2 are usually unstable in air and the observed third-order nonlinear Hall effect can be measured only at low temperature, which hinders further investigation as well as potential application. Thus, exploring new air-stable material systems with a sizable third-order nonlinear Hall effect at room temperature is an urgent task. Here, in type-II Weyl semimetal TaIrTe 4 , we observed a pronounced third-order nonlinear Hall effect, which can exist at room temperature and remain stable for months. The third-order nonlinear Hall effect is connected to the Berry-connection polarizability tensor instead of the Berry curvature. The possible mechanism of the observation of the third-order nonlinear Hall effect in TaIrTe 4 at room temperature has been discussed. Our findings will open an avenue towards exploring room-temperature nonlinear devices in new quantum materials.},

  abstract     = {In the past few years, wireless communications based on digital coding metasurfaces have gained research interest owing to their simplified architectures and low cost. However, in most of the metasurface-based wireless systems, a single-polarization scenario is used, limiting the channel capacities. To solve the problem, multiplexing methods have been adopted, but the system complexity is inevitably increased. Here, a space-frequency-polarization-division multiplexed wireless communication system is proposed using an anisotropic space-time-coding digital metasurface. By separately designing time-varying control voltage sequences for differently oriented varactor diodes integrated on the metasurface, we achieve frequency-polarization-division multiplexed modulations. By further introducing different time-delay gradients to the control voltage sequences in two polarization directions, we successfully obtain space-frequency-polarization-division multiplexed modulations to realize a wireless communication system with a new architecture. The new communication system is designed with compact dual-polarized meta-elements, and can improve channel capacity and space utilization. Experimental results demonstrate the high-performance and real-time transmission capability of the proposed communication system, confirming its potential application in multiple-user collaborative wireless communications.},

Preparing a more informative but smaller dataset to reduce labelling efforts has been a vital research problem. Although existing techniques can assess the value of individual data samples, how to represent the value of a sample set remains an open problem. In this research, the aggregation value is defined using a novel representation for the value of a sample set by modelling the invisible redundant information as the overlaps of neighbouring values. The sampling problem is hence converted to the maximisation of the submodular function over the aggregation value. The comprehensive analysis of several manufacturing datasets demonstrates that the proposed method can provide sample sets with superior and stable performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. The research outcome also indicates its appealing potential to reduce labelling efforts for more data-scarcity scenarios.},

Herein, a unique LiF interlayer woven by millimeter-level, single-crystal and serrated LiF nanofibers (NFs) was designed to enable dendrite-free and highly efficient Li-metal deposition. This high-conductivity LiF interlayer can increase the Li + transference number and induce the formation of ‘LiF–NFs-rich’ solid–electrolyte interface (SEI). In the ‘LiF–NFs-rich’ SEI, the ultra-long LiF nanofibers provide a continuously interfacial Li + transport path. Moreover, the formed Li–LiF interface between Li-metal and SEI film renders low Li nucleation and high Li + migration energy barriers, leading to uniform Li plating and stripping processes. As a result, steady charge–discharge in a Li//Li symmetrical cell for 1600 h under 4 mAh cm −2 and 400 stable cycles under a high area capacity of 5.65 mAh cm −2 in a high-loading Li//rGO–S cell at 17.9 mA cm −2 could be achieved. The free-standing LiF–NFs interlayer exhibits superior advantages for commercial Li batteries and displays significant potential for expanding the applications in solid Li batteries.},

  abstract     = {The past Asian precipitation δ 18 O (δ 18 O p ) records from stalagmites and other deposits have shown significant orbital-scale variations, but their climatic implications and regional differences are still not fully understood. This study, as the first attempt of a 300-kyr transient stable isotope-enabled simulation, investigated the characteristics and mechanisms of the orbital-scale δ 18 O p variations in three representative regions of Asia: arid Central Asia (CA), monsoonal South Asia (SA) and monsoonal East Asia (EA). The modelling results showed that the variations in the CA, SA and EA annual δ 18 O p exhibited significant but asynchronous 23-kyr precession cycles. Further analyses revealed that although the precession-induced insolation variation was the ultimate cause of the δ 18 O p variation in all three regions, the dominant mechanisms and the involved physical processes were distinct among them. For the CA region, the rainy-season (November–March) temperature effect and water vapour transport by the westerly circulation were identified as the key precession-scale processes linking the October–February boreal mid-latitude insolation to the rainy-season or annual δ 18 O p . In the SA region, the rainy-season (June–September) precipitation amount effect and upstream depletion of the monsoonal water vapour δ 18 O served as the main mechanisms linking the rainy-season or annual δ 18 O p to the April–July insolation variation at the precession scale. For the EA region, however, the precession-scale annual δ 18 O p was mainly controlled by the late-monsoon (August–September) and pre-monsoon (April–May) water vapour transport patterns, which were driven by the July–August insolation and the global ice volume, respectively. These results suggest that the climatic implications of the orbital-scale Asia δ 18 O p variations are sensitive to their geographic locations as determined by the combined effects of insolation and regional circulation patterns associated with the respective rainy seasons. This study provides new insights into understanding the regional differences and formation mechanisms of the Asian orbital-scale δ 18 O p variations.},

  abstract     = {Generation and regeneration as an answer to disease treatment has been around for some time. Yet never have we come so close to reaching such ‘life-altering’ capabilities. Today, the field of regenerative medicine research focuses on replacing non-functional or dead cells with healthy ones, in order to repair or regenerate tissues and organs to restore normal functions. Pluripotent stem cells have the ability of long-term self-renewal and possess the potential to differentiate to all kinds of functional cells in humans. Therefore, how to directly obtain a large number of pluripotent stem cells from patients in vitro , to be grown into differentiated specific tissues and organs, has become one of the most important topics. Six decades ago, Gurdon&#39;s group discovered that cell differentiation is a reversible process [ 1 ], laying down the foundation for cell reprogramming research. Commonly there are biological and chemical methods for the acquisition of pluripotent stem cells in vitro , which also aim to produce further differentiated specific tissues and organs. Fifteen years ago, Yamanaka&#39;s group first reported the acquisition of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) via overexpression of four transcription factors OSKM to the somatic cells [ 2 ]. Chemical reprogramming—using cell permeable small molecules to manipulate the cell fates—has also progressed significantly. Hongkui Deng at Peking University and his co-workers reported that a combination of small molecule compounds could induce pluripotent stem cells from mouse somatic cells with an induction efficiency as high as 0.2% in 2013 [ 3 ]. After long-term persistence and unremitting efforts, Deng&#39;s group announced the acquisition of chemically induced pluripotent stem cells (CiPSCs) from human fibroblasts through a step-wised chemical reprogramming strategy in 2022. This technology for preparing human CiPSCs solves the underlying technical bottleneck for the development of stem cells and regenerative medicine, and advances the application of cell reprogramming towards a new stage [ 4 ]. As the progress in human cell reprogramming led to sufficient resources of CiPSCs, chemically induced cell fate trans differentiation research also brought us surprises. Deng and colleagues not only demonstrated that small molecules can reprogram astrocytes into neurons in the adult mouse brain, which provides a potential approach for developing neuronal replacement therapies [ 5 ], but also constructed a bio-artificial liver device through directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells to hepatic cells [ 6 ]. Recently, Deng and colleagues established an efficient method for producing islet cells from human CiPSCs and demonstrated that these cells were able to ameliorate diabetes in non-human primates [ 7 ]. CiPSCs might be considered to have potential in the fields of cell therapy, drug screening and disease modeling, and are the most critical ‘seed cells’ in the field of regenerative medicine. Emerging as important regulators of cell fate, natural product small molecules and their derivatives have played an important role in Deng&#39;s work. NSR spoke to Hongkui Deng about the highlights and possibilities of the field.},

Anisomelic acid effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication and viral-induced cytopathic effects with an EC 50 of 1.1 and 4.3 μM, respectively. Challenge studies of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice showed that oral administration of anisomelic acid and subcutaneous dosing of remdesivir can both reduce the viral titers in the lung tissue at the same level. To facilitate drug discovery, we used a semisynthetic approach to shorten the project timelines. The enantioselective semisynthesis of anisomelic acid from the naturally enriched and commercially available starting material (+)-costunolide was achieved in five steps with a 27% overall yield. The developed chemistry provides opportunities for developing anisomelic-acid-based novel ligands for selectively targeting proteins involved in viral infections.},

  abstract     = {Tumor-associated bacteria (TAB) play a critically important role in regulating the microenvironment of a tumor, which consequently greatly deteriorates the therapeutic effects by chemo- and radiotherapy deactivation and, more considerably, leads to substantial immunosuppression. On the contrary, herein we propose a nanocatalytic tumor-immunotherapeutic modality based on the bacteria disintegration by bacteria-specific oxidative damage under magnetic hyperthermia for highly effective immune response activation-promoted tumor regression. A monodispersed and superparamagnetic nanocatalytic medicine modified by arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid (RGD) and (3-carboxypropyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide (TPP), named as MNP-RGD-TPP herein, has been synthesized, which features selective accumulation at the TAB by the electrostatic affinity, enabling effective TAB disintegration by the nanocatalytic Fenton reaction producing abundant cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals in situ under alternating magnetic field-induced hyperthermia. More importantly, the lipopolysaccharide has been metabolically secreted from the destructed TAB as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to M1-polarize tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and promote the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) for innate immuno-response activation of TAMs, followed by cytotoxic T lymphocytes awakening under the PAMPs presentation by the mature DCs against tumor cells. The integrated innate and adaptive immunity activations based on this TAB-promoted nanocatalytic immunomedicine, instead of magnetic heating-induced hyperthermia or the released Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ Fenton agent, has been found to achieve excellent therapeutic efficacy in an orthotopic colorectal cancer model, demonstrating the great potential of such an integrated immunity strategy in clinical tumor immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by origami/kirigami, three-dimensional (3D) mesostructures assembled via a mechanics-guided approach, with reversible and maneuverable shape-morphing capabilities, have attracted great interest with regard to a broad range of applications. Despite intensive studies, the development of morphable 3D mesostructures with high-order (multi-degree-of-freedom) deformation and untethered high-frequency actuation remains challenging. This work introduces a scheme for a magnetically encoded transferable 3D mesostructure, with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film as the skeleton and discrete magnetic domains as actuation units, to address this challenge. The high-order deformation, including hierarchical, multidirectional and blending shape morphing, is realized by encoding 3D discrete magnetization profiles on the architecture through ultraviolet curing. Reconfigurable 3D mesostructures with a modest structural modulus (∼3 GPa) enable both high-frequency (∼55 Hz) and large-deformation (∼66.8%) actuation under an alternating magnetic field. Additionally, combined with the shape-retention and adhesion property of PET, these 3D mesostructures can be readily transferred and attached to many solid substrates. On this basis, diverse functional devices, including a switchable colour letter display, liquid mixer, sequential flashlight and biomimetic sliding robot, are demonstrated to offer new perspectives for robotics and microelectronics.},

Unexpected non-compressible bleeding not only happens in pre-hospital situations but also leads to a high risk of death during surgical processes throughout in-hospital treatment. Hemostatic materials for pre-hospital treatment or surgical procedures for non-compressible hemorrhage control have drawn more and more attention in recent years and several commercialized products have been developed. However, these products have all shown non-negligible limitations and researchers are focusing on developing more effective hemostatic materials for non-compressible hemorrhage control. Different hemostatic strategies (physical, chemical and biological) have been proposed and different forms (sponges/foams, sealants/adhesives, microparticles/powders and platelet mimics) of hemostatic materials have been developed based on these strategies. A summary of the requirements, state-of-the-art studies and commercial products of non-compressible hemorrhage-control materials is provided in this review with particular attention on the advantages and limitations of their emerging forms, to give a clear understanding of the progress that has been made in this area and the promising directions for future generations.},

These synapses can be adjusted adaptively depending on the stored weight value to mitigate time and energy loss resulting from recalculation. The resistance can be used to effectively regulate the accumulation and dissipation of ions in single devices, without changing the external pulse stimulation or preprogramming, to ensure selective and linear synaptic weight updates. The feasibility of the proposed neural network based on the synapses of flexible energy devices was investigated through training and machine learning. The results indicated that the device achieved a recognition accuracy of ∼95% for various neural network calculation tasks such as numeric classification.},

  abstract     = {Intermuscular bones (IBs) are mineralized spicules, present in the myosepta of many, but not all, teleost species. IBs are often small and sharp, and they consequently limit how the fish can be processed; the IBs may cause injury or trauma if lodged in consumers’ throats or mouths, and therefore affect the appeal of the fish to many consumers. The development of IBs in teleosts is still not fully understood and the molecular basis of IB development remains to be established. Here, the characteristics of IB tissue are evaluated based on single-cell transcriptomics in wild-type zebrafish. The analysis defined 18 distinct cell types. Differentiation trajectories showed that IBs are derived from tendons and that a core tendon-osteoblast cell lineage is related to IB formation. In particular, the functions of 10 candidate genes were evaluated via CRISPR-Cas9 mutants. Among those, runx2b −/− mutants completely lost IBs, while swimming performance, growth and bone mineral density were not significantly different from runx2b +/+ zebrafish. Comparative single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis in runx2b −/− and runx2b +/+ zebrafish revealed the role of osteoblasts in IB formation. In addition, differentially expressed genes were enriched in the transforming growth factor β/bone morphogenetic protein (TGF-β/BMP) pathway after runx2b deletion. This study provides evidence for the crucial role of runx2b regulation in IB formation. Genetic breeding can target runx2b regulation and generate strains of commercial fish species without IBs, which can improve the safe consumption and economic value of many farmed fish species.},

Using the transcriptomes of 105 057 nuclei from the hippocampus of a Beagle dog, we identified 26 cell clusters and a putative trajectory of oligodendrocyte development. Comparative analysis revealed a significant convergence between dog differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and putative positively selected genes (PSGs). Forty putative PSGs were DEGs in glutamatergic neurons, especially in Cluster 14, which is related to the regulation of nervous system development.

  abstract     = {To maintain genomic integrity and avoid diseases, the DNA-damage response (DDR) not only detects and repairs DNA lesions, but also contributes to the resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics. Targeting the DDR plays a significant role in drug discovery using the principle of synthetic lethality. The incomplete current knowledge of the DDR encouraged us to develop new strategies to identify and study its components and pathways. Polycarcin V, belonging to the C-aryl glycoside natural products, is a light-activatable DNA-intercalating agent that causes DNA damage by forming a covalent [2+2] cycloadduct with thymine residue under 365–450 nm of light irradiation in a DNA-sequence-independent manner. Taking advantage of the light-activatable feature and temporal control of DDR, we designed and synthesized polycarcin V-based bifunctional chemical probes, including one that cross-links DNA to DNA-binding protein to explore the DDR induced by polycarcin V and uncover novel DNA–protein interactions. Utilizing this chemical probe and activity-based protein profiling-stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture, we identified 311 DNA-binding protein candidates, including known DDR factors and additional proteins that may be of interest in discovering new biology. We validated our approach by showing that our probe could specifically cross-link proteins involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) that repair bulky DNA adducts. Our studies showed that the [2+2] cycloadduct formed by polycarcin V could indeed be repaired by NER in vivo . As a DNA-damaging agent, polycarcin V or its drug-like derivative plus blue light showed promising properties for psoriasis treatment, suggesting that it may itself hold promise for clinic applications.},

  abstract     = {The dynamics of energetic particles and tearing modes and the interactions between them are of great significance for magnetically confined fusion plasmas. In this review, we focus on these issues in the context of tokamak plasmas. The interaction between energetic particles and tearing modes is considered from two perspectives: (i) the influence of energetic particles on tearing modes and (ii) the transport of energetic particles by tearing modes. The influence of energetic particles on tearing modes is described on the basis of a general dispersion relation for tearing modes. The effects of energetic particles are considered separately in the outer region and the island region of a tearing mode. The physics mainly results from the modification of the perturbed parallel current by energetic particles without wave–particle resonance. In addition, the resonance between energetic particles and tearing modes is also reviewed. For the transport of energetic particles, transport of both circulating and trapped energetic particles by tearing mode is reviewed. Our descriptions of physical phenomena here are based on an analytical approach, while the experiments and simulations are used to illustrate and confirm our results. Finally, a number of open issues are discussed.},

These eigenstates can evolve across different sheets—a process that naturally corresponds to state permutation. Here, we report the first experimental realization of non-Abelian permutations in a three-state non-Hermitian system. Our approach relies on the stroboscopic encircling of two different exceptional arcs (EAs), which are smooth trajectories of order-2 EPs appearing from the coalescence of two adjacent states. The non-Abelian characteristics are confirmed by encircling the EAs in opposite sequences. A total of five non-trivial permutations are experimentally realized, which together comprise a non-Abelian group. Our approach provides a reliable way of investigating non-Abelian state permutations and the related exotic winding effects in non-Hermitian systems.},

  abstract     = {Resist-based patterning solutions play essential roles in modern micro- and nanoscale science and technology. The commonly used ‘resist’ patterning strategy depends on selective-area scission or cross-linking of resist molecules under the action of an energy beam. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a different resist-patterning strategy, termed ‘resist nanokirigami’, in which the resist structures are defined by their outlines and revealed by selective mechanical peeling of the unwanted resist film. Unlike conventional resist-based patterning processes, the final resist-nanokirigami structures do not undergo exposure and the exposure area is dramatically reduced. With these two advantages, a variety of functional structures that are difficult or impossible to fabricate by conventional processes, such as inverse nanostructures and their oligomers, multi-scale electrodes and freestanding plasmonic nanogaps, can be easily achieved with much higher efficiency. Thus, with its unique and complementary capabilities, the resist-nanokirigami process provides a new patterning solution that expands the family of lithography techniques and will play a significant role in fabricating multi-scale functional structures.},

Based on a service platform, the AI-Chemist is able to automatically read the literatures from a cloud database and propose experimental plans accordingly. It can control a mobile robot in-house or online to automatically execute the complete experimental process on 14 workstations, including synthesis, characterization and performance tests. The experimental data can be simultaneously analysed by the computational brain of the AI-Chemist through machine learning and Bayesian optimization, allowing a new hypothesis for the next iteration to be proposed. The competence of the AI-Chemist has been scrutinized by three different chemical tasks.

The five national parks cover a total area of ∼230 000 square kilometers and protect nearly 30% of the key terrestrial wildlife species found in China. Since the establishment of the United States’ Yellowstone National Park in 1872, national parks have been founded in many countries, and some of them have become distinctive ‘national signatures’ and important ecological security shelters. As a large country with rich biodiversity, China now begins to establish its first five national parks, with a total of about 50 planned for the future, and to form a national-park-centric protected-area system. How will national parks change the landscape of China&#39;s ecological conservation? Is China well prepared to scientifically establish and administrate national parks? In this panel discussion, six Chinese ecological conservationists introduce the background, plans and challenges of China&#39;s national park system, and provide their scientific perspectives.

Herein, we propose a core-sheath pillar (CSP) architecture with a perfect synergistic interface that effectively integrates the advantages of metal–organic frameworks and metal oxides to tackle the above-mentioned challenge. The sheath material, NH 2 -MIL-125, can concentrate target analyte, nitro-explosives, by 10 12 times from its vapour. The perfect band-matched synergistic interface enables the TiO 2 core to effectively harvest and utilize visible light. At room temperature and under visible light, CSP (TiO 2 , NH 2 -MIL-125) shows an unexpected self-promoting analyte-sensing behaviour. Its experimentally reached limit of detection (∼0.8 ppq, hexogeon) is 10 3 times lower than the lowest one achieved by a sniffer dog or all sensing techniques without analyte pre-concentration. Moreover, the sensor exhibits excellent selectivity against commonly existing interferences, with a short response time of 0.14 min.},

The clustering of acid and base molecules is a major mechanism driving fast nucleation and initial growth of new particles in the atmosphere. However, the acid–base cluster composition, measured using state-of-the-art mass spectrometers, cannot explain the measured high formation rate of new particles. Here we present strong evidence for the existence of base molecules such as amines in the smallest atmospheric sulfuric acid clusters prior to their detection by mass spectrometers. We demonstrate that forming (H 2 SO 4 ) 1 (amine) 1 is the rate-limiting step in atmospheric H 2 SO 4 -amine nucleation and the uptake of (H 2 SO 4 ) 1 (amine) 1 is a major pathway for the initial growth of H 2 SO 4 clusters. The proposed mechanism is very consistent with measured new particle formation in urban Beijing, in which dimethylamine is the key base for H 2 SO 4 nucleation while other bases such as ammonia may contribute to the growth of larger clusters. Our findings further underline the fact that strong amines, even at low concentrations and when undetected in the smallest clusters, can be crucial to particle formation in the planetary boundary layer.},

By employing an mtDNA mutator (Polg m ) mouse model, we found the fetal growth retardation and placental dysfunction in post-implantation embryos derived from Polg m oocytes. Remarkably, Polg m oocytes displayed the global loss of DNA methylation; following fertilization, zygotic genome experienced insufficient demethylation, along with dysregulation of gene expression. Spindle–chromosome exchange experiment revealed that cytoplasmic factors in Polg m oocytes are responsible for such a deficient epigenetic remodeling. Moreover, metabolomic profiling identified a significant reduction in the α-ketoglutarate (αKG) level in oocytes from Polg m mice. Importantly, αKG supplement restored both DNA methylation state and transcriptional activity in Polg m embryos, consequently preventing the developmental defects. Our findings uncover the important role of oocyte mtDNA mutation in controlling epigenetic reprogramming and gene expression during embryogenesis. αKG deserves further evaluation as a potential drug for treating mitochondrial dysfunction-related fertility decline.},

Particularly, even using low salt concentration (0.8 M) and additive-free carbonate-based electrolytes, the PMBs with a high-voltage polyanion cathode (4.4 V) also exhibit excellent cycling stability of 200 cycles with a good capacity retention of 83%. This noticeable electrochemical performance is due to the highly efficient passivation ability of the cyclic anions on both anode and cathode surfaces. This cyclic-anion-based electrolyte design strategy is also suitable for lithium and sodium-metal battery technologies.},

Minerals provide both beneficial (physical and chemical protection, nutrients, and energy) and detrimental (toxic substances and oxidative pressure) effects to microbes, resulting in mineral-specific microbial colonization. Microbes impact dissolution, transformation and precipitation of minerals through their activity, resulting in either genetically controlled or metabolism-induced biomineralization. Through these interactions, minerals and microbes co-evolve through Earth history. Mineral–microbe interactions typically occur at microscopic scale but the effect is often manifested at global scale. Despite advances achieved through decades of research, major questions remain. Four areas are identified for future research: integrating mineral and microbial ecology, establishing mineral biosignatures, linking laboratory mechanistic investigation to field observation, and manipulating mineral–microbe interactions for the benefit of humankind.},

A promising approach to enhance their phase stability is to incorporate cesium into FAPbI 3 . However, state-of-the-art formamidinium–cesium (FA–Cs) iodide perovskites demonstrate much worse efficiency compared with FAPbI 3 , limited by the different crystallization dynamics of formamidinium and cesium, which result in poor composition homogeneity and high trap densities. We develop a novel strategy of crystallization decoupling processes of formamidinium and cesium via a sequential cesium incorporation approach. As such, we obtain highly reproducible, highly efficient and stable solar cells based on FA 1 – x Cs x PbI 3 ( x = 0.05–0.16) films with uniform composition distribution in the nanoscale and low defect densities. We also revealed a new stabilization mechanism for Cs doping to stabilize FAPbI 3 , i.e. the incorporation of Cs into FAPbI 3 significantly reduces the electron–phonon coupling strength to suppress ionic migration, thereby improving the stability of FA–Cs-based devices.},

  abstract     = {Apomixis, or asexual seed formation, is prevalent in Citrinae via a mechanism termed nucellar or adventitious embryony. Here, multiple embryos of a maternal genotype form directly from nucellar cells in the ovule and can outcompete the developing zygotic embryo as they utilize the sexually derived endosperm for growth. Whilst nucellar embryony enables the propagation of clonal plants of maternal genetic constitution, it is also a barrier to effective breeding through hybridization. To address the genetics and evolution of apomixis in Citrinae , a chromosome-level genome of the Hongkong kumquat ( Fortunella hindsii ) was assembled following a genome-wide variation map including structural variants (SVs) based on 234 Citrinae accessions. This map revealed that hybrid citrus cultivars shelter genome-wide deleterious mutations and SVs into heterozygous states free from recessive selection, which may explain the capability of nucellar embryony in most cultivars during Citrinae diversification. Analyses revealed that parallel evolution may explain the repeated origin of apomixis in different genera of Citrinae . Within Fortunella , we found that apomixis of some varieties originated via introgression. In apomictic Fortunella , the locus associated with apomixis contains the FhRWP gene, encoding an RWP-RK domain-containing protein previously shown to be required for nucellar embryogenesis in Citrus . We found the heterozygous SV in the FhRWP and CitRWP promoters from apomictic Citrus and Fortunella , due to either two or three miniature inverted transposon element (MITE) insertions. A transcription factor, FhARID , encoding an AT-rich interaction domain-containing protein binds to the MITEs in the promoter of apomictic varieties, which facilitates induction of nucellar embryogenesis. This study provides evolutionary genomic and molecular insights into apomixis in Citrinae and has potential ramifications for citrus breeding.},

  abstract     = {Harnessing the fascinating properties of correlated oxides requires precise control of their carrier density. Compared to other methods, oxygen doping provides an effective and more direct way to tune the electronic properties of correlated oxides. Although several approaches, such as thermal annealing and oxygen migration, have been introduced to change the oxygen content, a continuous and reversible solution that can be integrated with modern electronic technology is much in demand. Here, we report a novel ionic field-effect transistor using solid Gd-doped CeO 2 as the gate dielectric, which shows a remarkable carrier-density-tuning ability via electric-field-controlled oxygen concentration at room temperature. In Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ (Bi-2212) thin flakes, we achieve a reversible superconductor–insulator transition by driving oxygen ions in and out of the samples with electric fields, and map out the phase diagram all the way from the insulating regime to the over-doped superconducting regime by continuously changing the oxygen doping level. Scaling analysis indicates that the reversible superconductor–insulator transition for the Bi-2212 thin flakes follows the theoretical description of a two-dimensional quantum phase transition. Our work provides a route for realizing electric-field control of phase transition in correlated oxides. Moreover, the configuration of this type of transistor makes heterostructure/interface engineering possible, thus having the potential to serve as the next-generation all-solid-state field-effect transistor.},

By introducing 30% (volume fractions) N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF) to the 2 M Zn(CF 3 SO 3 ) 2 –H 2 O electrolyte (ZHD30), the preferential hydrogen-bonding effect between DMF and H 2 O effectively reduces the water activity and hinders deprotonation of the electrolyte. The ZHD30 electrolyte improves the Zn plating/stripping coulombic efficiency from ∼95.3% to ∼99.4% and enhances the cycles from 65 to 300. The Zn–polyaniline full battery employing the ZHD30 electrolyte can operate over a wide temperature range from –40°C to +25°C and deliver capacities of 161.6, 127.4 and 65.8 mAh g –1 at 25, –20 and –40°C, respectively.

Hence, activating O 2 to create suitable reactive oxygen species, such as singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ), can significantly increase the yield of desired products. Herein, using ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheets as a model system, we build a surface-modified theoretical structure, where a surface-covered non-conductive macromolecular chain, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), is bound to ZnIn 2 S 4 and influences the O 2 adsorption process. PVP on the surface significantly changes the electronic structure and suppresses electron conduction of ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheets. Therefore, abundantly photogenerated and long-lived species transfer their energy to physically absorbed O 2 to efficiently generate 1 O 2 , which can oxidize sulphides into their corresponding sulphoxides. For sulphoxidation of different sulphides, surface modification brings a 3–9-fold increase in conversion efficiency and high selectivities ≥98%.

Unfortunately, simultaneous, on-demand manipulation of their radial and axial sizes—that allows strong quantum confinement in the blue-light region—has so far been challenging. Here we present a two-step catalyzed growth strategy that enables independent, high-precision and wide-range controls over the diameter and length of ZnSe QWs. We find that a new epitaxial orientation between the cubic-phase Ag 2 Se solid catalyst and wurtzite ZnSe QWs kinetically favors the formation of defect-free ultrathin QWs. Thanks to their high uniformity, the resulting blue-light-active, phase-pure ZnSe QWs exhibit well-defined excitonic absorption with the 1S e –1S h transition linewidth as narrow as sub-13 nm. Combining the transient absorption spectroscopy, we further show that surface electron traps in these ZnSe QWs can be eliminated by thiol passivation, which results in long-lived charge carriers and high-efficiency solar-to-hydrogen conversion.},

Searching for enzyme-like nanomaterials, clarifying the origins of catalytic activity and developing activity assessment methodologies are therefore of great significance. Here, we report that oxidase catalysis and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis can be well bridged based on their identical activity origins, which makes facile electrocatalytic ORR activity measurements intrinsically applicable to oxidase-like activity evaluations. Inspired by natural heme-copper oxidases, Cu/Fe-doped single-atom catalysts (SACs) were first synthesized and used as model catalysts. Chromogenic reactions, electrochemical voltammetric measurements and density functional theory calculations further verified the linear relationship between the oxidase-like and ORR catalytic activities of the catalysts; thus, an effective descriptor ( ⁠ | j n ― | ⁠ ) is proposed for rapid enzymatic catalyst evaluation. Evidence suggests that the enhanced tumour therapeutic efficacy of SACs is a result of their oxidase-like/ORR activities, which proves that numerous ORR electrocatalysts are promising candidates for oxidase mimics and tumour therapy.

In this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of the latest optical approaches for neuromodulation. We begin with the physical principles and constraints underlying the interaction between light and neural tissue. We then present advances in optical neurotechnologies in seven modules: conventional optical fibers, multifunctional fibers, optical waveguides, light-emitting diodes, upconversion nanoparticles, optical neuromodulation based on the secondary effects of light, and unconventional light sources facilitated by ultrasound and magnetic fields. We conclude our review with an outlook on new methods and mechanisms that afford optical neuromodulation with minimal invasiveness and footprint.},

Of particular interest is the strongly interacting regime. We show that the closed-channel fraction Z c c provides an effective probe for important many-body interacting effects, especially through its density dependence, which is absent from two-body theoretical predictions. Here we measure Z c c as a function of interaction strength and the Fermi temperature T F in a trapped 6 Li superfluid throughout the entire Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer–Bose-Einstein-condensate crossover, in quantitative agreement with theory when important thermal contributions outside the superfluid core are taken into account. Away from the deep-BEC regime, the fraction Z c c is sensitive to T F ⁠ . In particular, our data show Z c c ∝ T F α with α = 1 / 2 at unitarity, in quantitative agreement with calculations of a two-channel pairing fluctuation theory, and α increases rapidly into the BCS regime, reflecting many-body interaction effects as predicted.},

Recently discovered transition-metal pentatellurides can reach the ultra-quantum limit in low magnetic fields and serve as good candidates for achieving such a combination. Here, we report evidence of density wave and metal-insulator transition in HfTe 5 induced by intense magnetic fields. Using the non-linear transport technique, we detect a distinct non-linear conduction behavior in the longitudinal resistivity within the a–c plane, corresponding to the formation of a density wave induced by magnetic fields. In high fields, the onset of non-linear conduction in the Hall resistivity indicates an impurity-pinned magnetic freeze-out as the possible origin of the insulating behavior. These frozen electrons can be gradually reactivated into mobile states above a threshold of electric field. This experimental evidence calls for further investigation into the underlying mechanism of the bulk quantum Hall effect and field-induced phase transitions in pentatellurides.},

In this review, we provide a brief discussion on the recent progress in exploring framework structures, catalytically active sites and intermolecular interactions in zeolites and metal-containing ones by using various solid-state NMR methods. Advances in the mechanistic understanding of zeolite-catalysed reactions including methanol and ethanol conversions are presented as selected examples.

  abstract     = {Establishing a comprehensive understanding of the dynamical multiscale diffusion and reaction process is crucial for zeolite shape-selective catalysis and is urgently demanded in academia and industry. So far, diffusion and reaction for methanol and dimethyl ether (DME) conversions have usually been studied separately and focused on a single scale. Herein, we decipher the dynamical molecular diffusion and reaction process for methanol and DME conversions within the zeolite material evolving with time, at multiple scales, from the scale of molecules to single catalyst crystal and catalyst ensemble. Microscopic intracrystalline diffusivity is successfully decoupled from the macroscopic experiments and verified by molecular dynamics simulation. Spatiotemporal analyses of the confined carbonaceous species allow us to track the migratory reaction fronts in a single catalyst crystal and the catalyst ensemble. The constrained diffusion of DME relative to methanol alleviates the high local chemical potential of the reactant by attenuating its local enrichment, enhancing the utilization efficiency of the inner active sites of the catalyst crystal. In this context, the dynamical cross-talk behaviors of material, diffusion and reaction occurring at multiple scales is uncovered. Zeolite catalysis not only reflects the reaction characteristics of heterogeneous catalysis, but also provides enhanced, moderate or suppressed local reaction kinetics through the special catalytic micro-environment, which leads to the heterogeneity of diffusion and reaction at multiple scales, thereby realizing efficient and shape-selective catalysis.},

  abstract     = {The OXZEO (oxide−zeolite) bifunctional catalyst concept has enabled selective syngas conversion to a series of value-added chemicals and fuels such as light olefins, aromatics and gasoline. Herein we report for the first time a dynamic confinement of SAPO-17 cages on the selectivity control of syngas conversion observed during an induction period. Structured illumination microscopy, intelligent gravimetric analysis, UV-Raman, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometer analysis indicate that this is attributed to the evolution of carbonaceous species as the reaction proceeds, which gradually reduces the effective space inside the cage. Consequently, the diffusion of molecules is hindered and the hindering is much more prominent for larger molecules such as C 4+ . As a result, the selectivity of ethylene is enhanced whereas that of C 4+ is suppressed. Beyond the induction period, the product selectivity levels off. For instance, ethylene selectivity levels off at 44% and propylene selectivity at 31%, as well as CO conversion at 27%. The findings here bring a new fundamental understanding that will guide further development of selective catalysts for olefin synthesis based on the OXZEO concept.},

We have extended the biocatalyst applications by designing a chemo-enzymatic process that allows, as the first step, prochiral ketones to be obtained from biomass-derived compounds through an aldol condensation–reduction step using a bifunctional metal/base catalyst. The prochiral ketone is subsequently converted into the chiral amine using the immobilized ATA.

By observing the same spines at weekly intervals, we found that newly formed spines were more susceptible to elimination, with only 40% persisting over a period of months. Analyses of spatial distribution of large numbers of spines revealed that spine distribution was neither uniform nor random, favoring inter-spine distances of 2–4 μm. Furthermore, spine formation and elimination occurred more often in low- and high-density dendritic segments, respectively, and preferentially within a hot zone of ∼4 μm from existing spines. Our results demonstrate long-term stability and spatially regulated spine dynamics in the macaque cortex and provide a structural basis for understanding neural circuit plasticity in the primate brain.},

However, recent studies are controversial, especially concerning the intrinsic link between ACE2 diversity and COVID-19 susceptibility. Here, we conduct a population genetic study on ACE2 in 6354 individuals representing 210 present-day populations and 5329 individuals of ancient or archaic groups. We dissected the genetic architecture of ACE2 and identified two major haplogroups (hg) in East Asians, i.e. ACE2 -hg1 (43%) and ACE2 -hg2 (53%), while other populations harbor more diverse ACE2 -hgs. Accordingly, there was a significant loss of ACE2 common variations in East Asians in contrast to the X-chromosome-wide and genome-wide patterns. Notably, association analysis between ACE2 -hgs and COVID-19 severity in 1229 Han Chinese individuals with various levels of COVID-19 severity showed a higher risk of ACE2 -hg1 (odds ratio = 1.56, P &lt; 0.01) and a lower risk of ACE2 -hg2 (odds ratio = 0.65, P &lt; 0.01). Interestingly, ACE2 -hg1 is in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs1849863-C, which is an assumed risk factor of elevated plasma ACE2 level and is related to a higher risk of COVID-19 severity, hospitalization and infection. Strikingly, remarkable signatures of positive selection were detected, especially on ACE2 -hg2, and were traced back to 100 000 years ago (but rose to a strong level during the Bronze Age, 5000∼3000 years ago, in East Asians). The selection pressures could have stemmed from multiple sources, but pre-COVID-19 viral epidemics and pandemics might have been potential driving forces, which consequently contributed to the genetic susceptibility to COVID-19 within and between populations.},

  abstract     = {Nitrogen oxides (NO x , the sum of nitric oxide (NO) and N dioxide (NO 2 )) emissions and deposition have increased markedly over the past several decades, resulting in many adverse outcomes in both terrestrial and oceanic environments. However, because the microbial NO x emissions have been substantially underestimated on the land and unconstrained in the ocean, the global microbial NO x emissions and their importance relative to the known fossil-fuel NO x emissions remain unclear. Here we complied data on stable N isotopes of nitrate in atmospheric particulates over the land and ocean to ground-truth estimates of NO x emissions worldwide. By considering the N isotope effect of NO x transformations to particulate nitrate combined with dominant NO x emissions in the land (coal combustion, oil combustion, biomass burning and microbial N cycle) and ocean (oil combustion, microbial N cycle), we demonstrated that microbial NO x emissions account for 24 ± 4%, 58 ± 3% and 31 ± 12% in the land, ocean and global environment, respectively. Corresponding amounts of microbial NO x emissions in the land (13.6 ± 4.7 Tg N yr −1 ), ocean (8.8 ± 1.5 Tg N yr −1 ) and globe (22.5 ± 4.7 Tg N yr −1 ) are about 0.5, 1.4 and 0.6 times on average those of fossil-fuel NO x emissions in these sectors. Our findings provide empirical constraints on model predictions, revealing significant contributions of the microbial N cycle to regional NO x emissions into the atmospheric system, which is critical information for mitigating strategies, budgeting N deposition and evaluating the effects of atmospheric NO x loading on the world.},

  abstract     = {Monoterpenes have been known to have a critical influence on air quality and climate change through their impact on the formation of fine particles. Here we present field evidence that monoterpene oxidations largely enhanced local ozone production in a regional site in eastern China. The observed monoterpene was most likely from biomass burning rather than biogenic emissions, as indicated by the high correlation with CO at night-time, and the observed ratio of these two species was consistent with previously determined values from biomass burning experiments. Fast monoterpene oxidations were determined experimentally based on direct radical measurements, leading to a daily ozone enhancement of 4–18 parts per billion by volume (ppb), which was 6%–16% of the total ozone production, depending on the speciation of monoterpenes. It demonstrates that the previously overlooked anthropogenic monoterpenes make an important contribution to O 3 production in eastern China. The role could possibly be important at similar locations across China and other parts of the world that are characterized by massive emissions, especially where there are high NO x levels. Our results highlight that anthropogenic monoterpenes should be taken into account when proceeding with the coordinated mitigation of O 3 and particulate matter pollution.},

This is also an essential step to confirm their existence. In this study, we propose an iron-based superconducting nanowire system with Majorana vortex states to satisfy desirable conditions. This system has a radius-induced topological phase transition, giving a lower bound for the nanowire radius. In the topological phase, the iron-based superconducting nanowires have only one pair of MZMs over a wide range of radii, chemical potential and external magnetic fields. The wave function of MZMs has a sizable distribution at the side edge of the nanowires. This property enables the control of the interaction of MZMs in neighboring vortex nanowires and paves the way for Majorana fusion and braiding.},

Regulating the distribution of isolated SiO 4 tetrahedra in SAPO zeolites is formidably challenging because SiO 4 tetrahedra tend to agglomerate to form Si islands and the isolated SiO 4 tetrahedra are difficult to determine using conventional characterization techniques. Here we synthesized Si-island-free SAPO-35 zeolites by using N -methylpiperidine as a new template, which exhibited excellent thermal stability compared to conventional SAPO-35 zeolites and a substantially improved methanol-to-olefins catalytic lifetime even comparable to that of commercial SAPO-34 zeolites. More strikingly, with the aid of high-throughput computations on 44 697 structure models combined with various state-of-the-art characterization techniques, for the first time, we reveal that the host–guest interactions between template molecules and SAPO frameworks determine the specific distributions of isolated SiO 4 tetrahedra, which are responsible for the improvement in the chemical properties of zeolites. Our work provides an insight into the template-based regulation of isolated SiO 4 tetrahedra in SAPO zeolites, which opens a new avenue in the discovery of promising zeolite catalysts with optimal SiO 4 distribution.},

  abstract     = {Separation of mixture is always necessarily required in modern industry, especially in fine chemical, petrochemical, coal chemical and pharmaceutical industries. The challenge of the separation process is usually associated with small molecules with very similar physical and chemical properties. Among the separation techniques, the commonly used high-pressure cryogenic distillation process with combination of high pressure and very low temperature is heavily energy-consuming, which accounts for the major production costs as well as 10–15% of the world&#39;s energy consumption. To this end, the adsorptive separation process based on zeolite sorbents is a promising lower-energy alternative and the performance is directly determined by the zeolite sorbents. In this review, we surveyed the separation mechanisms based on the steric, equilibrium, kinetic and ‘trapdoor’ effect, and summarized the recent advances in adsorptive separation via zeolites including CO 2 , light olefins, C 8 aromatics and hydrogen isotopes. Furthermore, we provided the perspectives on the rational design of zeolite sorbents for the absolute separation of mixtures.},

  abstract     = {In recent decades, the application of zeolite has been extended to many sustainable processes. Professor Ruren Xu (徐如人) of Jilin University is a leader within Chinese, Asian and worldwide zeolite communities, as well as the founder of the inorganic synthesis discipline in China and the first person in the world to propose the scientific discipline of modern inorganic synthetic chemistry. Professor Xu started his scholarly research on zeolites in the mid-1970s. He focused initially on crystallization and mechanisms of zeolite formation. In the 1980s, he gradually shifted his research to the exploration of microporous materials with novel frameworks and compositions. In 1984, he outlined new directions in the synthesis of zeolites and placed emphasis on the ‘heteroatom concept’, which turned out to be very influential and fruitful for the subsequent development of heteroatom-containing zeolite catalysts. In the following years, he and his group systematically developed new solvothermal routes for zeolite synthesis. In the late 1990s, Xu started to think about the rational synthesis of zeolites, a major challenge for zeolite as well as inorganic synthesis in general. His group developed several effective strategies for the rational design and synthesis of zeolitic materials. He is the chairman of the 15th International Zeolite Conference (15th IZC) held in 2007 for the first time in China. Because of his significant contribution to zeolite science in China, he received the National Zeolite Lifetime Achievement Award of China in 2017. NSR recently interviewed Professor Xu about the current status and future prospects of zeolites and related porous materials. This interview is dedicated to Professor Xu on his 90th birthday, in recognition of his seminal contribution to zeolite science, modern inorganic synthetic chemistry and the new discipline of condensed matter chemistry, which was first suggested by Professor Xu in 2018.},

Here, we report an orthogonal dual-regulation strategy for precise motion control of droplets and we demonstrate its utility as a sensitive sensing system with controllable dynamic ranges of sensing for adenosine triphosphate, miRNA, thrombin and kanamycin, as well as discrimination of five kinds of DNA. We endowed a DNA-contained bio-droplet sliding on a lubricant-infused structural surface with micro-grooves to separately adjust the resistance from liquid phase and solid phase. The resistance from liquid phase mainly depended on hydrophobic interaction between DNA and lubricant, which can be finely tuned by different DNA’s average chain length. Meanwhile, the resistance from solid surface was determined by the energy barrier from the periodic micro-grooves, which can be adjusted by varying the droplet&#39;s sliding direction on the surface. The hydrophobic interaction is conformed to be orthogonal to the micro-grooves’ anisotropic resistance by three different methods. This orthogonal dual-regulation strategy thus demonstrated its ability to precisely control bio-droplets’ motion behaviors and sensitive detection with adjustable dynamic ranges for various bio-targets. The dual-regulation strategy will provide significant insights for super-wettable biosensors, visual inspection and beyond.},

Catalytic applications of zeolite materials have expanded from conventional single functionalities, such as solid acids or selective oxidation catalysts to bi/multifunctionalities through combination with metals or metal oxides. This is a response to new requirements from petrochemical and fine chemical industries, such as precise control of product distribution, conversion of low-carbon resources for chemical production, and solutions to increasingly severe environmental problems related to CO 2 and NO x . Thus, based on the systematic knowledge of zeolite chemistry and science that researchers have acquired in the past half-century and the development requirements, remarkable progress has been made in zeolite synthesis and catalysis in the past 10 years. This includes the manipulation of zeolitic monolayers derived from layered zeolites and germanosilicates to construct novel zeolite materials and effective and green zeolite syntheses as well as the synergistic interaction of zeolites and metal/metal oxides with different space distributions in the conversion of low-carbon resources. With many zeolite catalysts and catalytic processes being developed, our understanding of the close relationship between zeolite synthesis, structure and catalytic properties has deepened.

In recent years, theoretical simulation from the interaction between a zeolite structure and an organic template has been used to guide the synthesis of zeolites, which is time-saving. In this review, recent progress in the targeted synthesis of zeolites from interaction between a zeolite structure and an organic template are briefly outlined including the design of new templates for zeolite synthesis, preparation of zeolites with new composition, development of novel routes for zeolite synthesis, synthesis of intergrowth zeolites, generation of novel zeolite structures, control of zeolite morphology and modulation of aluminum distribution in zeolites. These targeted syntheses reveal that the minimum energy principle from the theoretical simulation is key for guiding zeolite crystallization.

  abstract     = {For single-atom catalysts (SACs), the catalyst supports are not only anchors for single atoms, but also modulators for geometric and electronic structures, which determine their catalytic performance. Selecting an appropriate support to prepare SACs with uniform coordination environments is critical for achieving optimal performance and clarifying the relationship between the structure and the property of SACs. Approaching such a goal is still a significant challenge. Taking advantage of the strong d-π interaction between Cu atoms and diacetylenic in a graphdiyne (GDY) support, we present an efficient and simple strategy for fabricating Cu single atoms anchored on GDY (Cu 1 /GDY) with uniform Cu 1 -C 4 single sites under mild conditions. The Cu atomic structure was confirmed by combining synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The as-prepared Cu 1 /GDY exhibits much higher activity than state-of-the-art SACs in direct benzene oxidation to phenol with H 2 O 2 reaction, with turnover frequency values of 251 h −1 at room temperature and 1889 h −1 at 60°C, respectively. Furthermore, even with a high benzene conversion of 86%, high phenol selectivity (96%) is maintained, which can be ascribed to the hydrophobic and oleophyllic surface nature of Cu 1 /GDY for benzene adsorption and phenol desorption. Both experiments and DFT calculations indicate that Cu 1 -C 4 single sites are more effective at activating H 2 O 2 to form Cu=O bonds, which are important active intermediates for benzene oxidation to phenol.},

  abstract     = {Owing to their low density, high porosity and unique micro-nanostructures, aerogels are attractive for application in various fields; however, they suffer from shrinkage and/or cracking during preparation, mechanical brittleness, low production efficiency and non-degradation. Herein, we introduce the concept of dynamic covalent polymer chemistry to produce a new class of aerogels—referred to as DCPAs. The resulting lightweight DCPAs have the potential to be prepared on a large scale and feature high porosity (90.7%–91.3%), large degrees of compression (80% strain) and bending (diametral deflection of 30 mm) without any cracks, as well as considerable tensile properties (an elongation with a break at 32.7%). In addition, the DCPAs showcase the emergent characteristics of weldability, repairability, degradability and closed-loop recyclability that are highly desirable for providing versatile material platforms, though hardly achieved by traditional aerogels. Taking advantage of their robust porous structures, we demonstrate the potential of DCPAs for applications in thermal insulation and emulsion separation. These findings reveal that the dynamic covalent bond strategy would be generalized for the production of a new generation of aerogels with customized features for functioning in the field of intelligent and sustainable materials.},

  abstract     = {Plastics take hundreds of years to degrade naturally, while their chemical degradation typically requires high temperature and pressure. Here, we first utilize solar energy to realize the sustainable and efficient plastic-to-syngas conversion with the aid of water at ambient conditions. As an example, the commercial plastic bags could be efficiently photoconverted into renewable syngas by Co–Ga 2 O 3 nanosheets, with hydrogen and carbon monoxide formation rates of 647.8 and 158.3 μmol g −1 h −1 . In situ characterizations and labelling experiments unveil water is photoreduced into hydrogen, while non-recyclable plastics including polyethylene bags, polypropylene boxes and polyethylene terephthalate bottles are photodegraded into carbon dioxide, which is further selectively photoreduced into carbon monoxide. In-depth investigation illustrates that the efficiency of syngas production mainly depends on the carbon dioxide reduction process and hence photocatalysts of high carbon dioxide reduction activity should be designed to promote the efficiency of plastic-to-syngas conversion in the future. The concept for the photoreforming of non-recyclable plastics into renewable syngas helps to eradicate ‘white pollution’ and alleviate the energy crisis simultaneously.},

However, how water responds within these confined spaces, with prevalent inhomogeneity built in or caused by impurities, is not well understood. Here, we show theoretically that water confined in one-dimensional nanochannels with localized perturbation exhibits pronounced density oscillations. The oscillations occur vividly like the Friedel oscillations in electron density resulting from defects in metals. A model analysis reveals that the density oscillations result from the perturbation-induced molecular scattering that is augmented by the confinement-enhanced correlation of water dipoles. This renders the oscillations a general behavior independent of the channel geometries and specific forms of the perturbation. Under confinements comparable to biological ion channels, such oscillations can strikingly extend over 10 nm, resulting in non-trivial effects at large distances that, for example, repel all ions from the channels with their long-range force. These results deepen the understanding of biological functions and inspire new applications in a variety of domains, such as ionic sensing and seawater desalination.},

Inspired by transformation optics and metamaterials, recent theories have proposed the concept of fluid cloaking, which is able to recover the straight streamlines, as if the obstacle did not exist. However, such a cloak, similar to all previous transformation-optics-based devices, relies on complex metamaterials with inhomogeneous parameters and is difficult to implement. Here we deploy the theory of scattering cancellation and report on the experimental realization of a fluid-flow cloak without metamaterials. This cloak is realized by engineering the geometry of the fluid channel, which effectively cancels the dipole-like scattering of the obstacle. The cloaking effect is demonstrated through the direct observation of recovered straight streamlines in the fluid flow. Our work sheds new light on conventional fluid control and may find application in microfluidic devices.},

With the great success of machine learning, nowadays, more and more practical tasks, particularly those involving open-environment scenarios where important factors are subject to change, called open-environment machine learning in this article, are present to the community. Evidently, it is a grand challenge for machine learning turning from close environment to open environment. It becomes even more challenging since, in various big data tasks, data are usually accumulated with time, like streams , while it is hard to train the machine learning model after collecting all data as in conventional studies. This article briefly introduces some advances in this line of research, focusing on techniques concerning emerging new classes, decremental/incremental features, changing data distributions and varied learning objectives, and discusses some theoretical issues.},

We establish a landscape theory for cell differentiation with proliferation effect, in which the developmental process is modeled as a stochastic dynamical system with a birth-death term. We find that two different energy landscapes, denoted U and V , collectively contribute to the establishment of non-equilibrium steady differentiation. The potential U is known as the energy landscape leading to the steady distribution, whose metastable states stand for cell types, while V indicates the differentiation direction from pluripotent to differentiated cells. This interpretation of cell differentiation is different from the previous landscape theory without the proliferation effect. We propose feasible numerical methods and a mean-field approximation for constructing landscapes U and V . Successful applications to typical biological models demonstrate the energy landscape decomposition&#39;s validity and reveal biological insights into the considered processes.},

Herein, a forward genetic screening isolated an Arabidopsis mutant with a loss of plant-rhizobacteria mutualism, leading to the disclosure of a plant latent defense response (LDR) to NPFs. The activation of LDR in the mutant, named rol1 for regulator of LDR 1 , is triggered by several non-pathogenic volatile organic compounds and antagonizes plant compatibility with the beneficial bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens GB03. The activation of LDR in rol1 is mediated through the prokaryotic pathway of chloroplastic lipid biosynthesis. The rol1 root microbiome showed a reduced proportion of the Bacillaceae family. We propose that, parallel to the forefront immunity to MAMPs, LDR to certain NPFs provides a hidden layer of defense for controlling compatibility with commensal or beneficial microbes.},

  abstract     = {The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic was partially due to the challenge of identifying asymptomatic and presymptomatic carriers of the virus, and thus highlights a strong motivation for diagnostics with high sensitivity that can be rapidly deployed. On the other hand, several concerning SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron, are required to be identified as soon as the samples are identified as ‘positive’. Unfortunately, a traditional PCR test does not allow their specific identification. Herein, for the first time, we have developed MOPCS (Methodologies of Photonic CRISPR Sensing), which combines an optical sensing technology-surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with the ‘gene scissors’ clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) technique to achieve both high sensitivity and specificity when it comes to measurement of viral variants. MOPCS is a low-cost, CRISPR/Cas12a-system-empowered SPR gene-detecting platform that can analyze viral RNA, without the need for amplification, within 38 min from sample input to results output, and achieve a limit of detection of 15 fM. MOPCS achieves a highly sensitive analysis of SARS-CoV-2, and mutations appear in variants B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.1.529 (Omicron) and BA.1 (a subtype of Omicron). This platform was also used to analyze some recently collected patient samples from a local outbreak in China, identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This innovative CRISPR-empowered SPR platform will further contribute to the fast, sensitive and accurate detection of target nucleic acid sequences with single-base mutations.},

Herein, a direct repairing method for degraded LiCoO 2 using a LiCl–CH 4 N 2 O deep eutectic solvent (DES) was established. The DES is not used to dissolve LiCoO 2 but directly serves as a carrier for the selective replenishment of lithium and cobalt. Replenishment of lithium restores LiCoO 2 at different states of charge to a capacity of 130 mAh/g (at 0.1 C rate), while replenishing the cobalt increases the capacity retention rate of 90% after 100 cycles, which is comparable to pristine LiCoO 2 . The DES is collected and reused multiple times with a high repair efficiency. This process reduces energy consumption by 37.1% and greenhouse gas emissions by 34.8% compared with the current production process of LiCoO 2 , demonstrating excellent environmental and economic viability.},

Schottky junctions formed at the cathode and anode either prevent or allow the device to be rectifying, so that the output current of the device changes from fully-off to rectified. By increasing the thickness of the photogating layer, the behavior of the device changes from a photodetector to a multifunctional photomemory with the highest non-volatile responsivity of 4.8 × 10 7 A/W and the longest retention time of 6.5 × 10 6 s reported so far.

Here, we propose sieving carbons, featuring highly tunable nanopores with tightened pore entrances, as high-energy anodes with extensible and reversible low-potential plateaus (&lt;0.1 V). It is shown that the tightened pore entrance blocks the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase inside the nanopores and enables sodium clustering to produce the plateau. Theoretical and spectroscopic studies also show that creating a larger area of sodiophilic pore surface leads to an almost linearly increased number of sodium clusters, and controlling the pore body diameter guarantees the reversibility of sodium cluster formation, producing a sieving carbon anode with a record-high plateau capacity of 400 mAh g –1 . More excitingly, this approach to preparing sieving carbons has the potential to be scalable for modifying different commercial porous carbons.},

Kinematically restoring incipient horizontal underthrusting accurately predicts geologically estimated diachronous slab break-off, unlocking the Miocene of Himalaya–Tibet as a natural laboratory for unsubductable lithosphere convergence. Additionally, three endmember paleogeographic scenarios exist with different predictions for the nature of post-collisional subducted lithosphere but each is defended and challenged based on similar data types. This paper attempts at breaking through this impasse by identifying how the three paleogeographic scenarios each challenge paradigms in geodynamics, orogenesis, magmatism or paleogeographic reconstruction and identify opportunities for methodological advances in paleomagnetism, sediment provenance analysis, and seismology to conclusively constrain Greater Indian paleogeography.},

  abstract     = {Allostery is a fundamental element during channel gating in response to an appropriate stimulus by which events occurring at one site are transmitted to distal sites to regulate activity. To address how binding of the first Ca 2+ ion at one of the eight chemically identical subunits facilitates the other Ca 2+ -binding events in MthK, a Ca 2+ -gated K + channel containing a conserved ligand-binding RCK domain, we analysed a large collection of MthK structures and performed the corresponding thermodynamic and electrophysiological measurements. These structural and functional studies led us to conclude that the conformations of the Ca 2+ -binding sites alternate between two quaternary states and exhibit significant differences in Ca 2+ affinity. We further propose an allosteric model of the MthK-gating mechanism by which a cascade of structural events connect the initial Ca 2+ -binding to the final changes of the ring structure that open the ion-conduction pore. This mechanical model reveals the exquisite design that achieves the allosteric gating and could be of general relevance for the action of other ligand-gated ion channels containing the RCK domain.},

  abstract     = {Energy consumption dominates annual CO 2 emissions in China. It is essential to significantly reduce CO 2 emissions from energy consumption to reach national carbon neutrality by 2060, while the role of terrestrial carbon sequestration in offsetting energy-related CO 2 emissions cannot be underestimated. Natural climate solutions (NCS), including improvements in terrestrial carbon sequestration, represent readily deployable options to offset anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. However, the extent to which China&#39;s terrestrial carbon sequestration in the future, especially when target-oriented managements (TOMs) are implemented, can help to mitigate energy-related CO 2 emissions is far from certain. By synthesizing available findings and using several parameter-sparse empirical models that have been calibrated and/or fitted against contemporary measurements, we assessed China&#39;s terrestrial carbon sequestration over 2010–2060 and its contribution to offsetting national energy-related CO 2 emissions. We show that terrestrial C sequestration in China will increase from 0.375 ± 0.056 (mean ± standard deviation) Pg C yr −1 in the 2010s to 0.458 ± 0.100 Pg C yr −1 under RCP2.6 and 0.493 ± 0.108 Pg C yr −1 under the RCP4.5 scenario in the 2050s, when TOMs are implemented. The majority of carbon sequestration comes from forest, accounting for 67.8–71.4% of the total amount. China&#39;s terrestrial ecosystems can offset 12.2–15.0% and 13.4–17.8% of energy-related peak CO 2 emissions in 2030 and 2060, respectively. The implementation of TOMs contributes 11.9% of the overall terrestrial carbon sequestration in the 2020s and 23.7% in the 2050s. The most likely strategy to maximize future NCS effectiveness is a full implementation of all applicable cost-effective NCS pathways in China. Our findings highlight the role of terrestrial carbon sequestration in offsetting energy-related CO 2 emissions and put forward future needs in the context of carbon neutrality.},

Recent advances in the deep-learning method and the new availability of long-term turbulence measurements provide an opportunity to explore data-driven approaches to parameterizing oceanic vertical-mixing processes. Here, we describe a novel parameterization based on an artificial neural network trained using a decadal-long time record of hydrographic and turbulence observations in the tropical Pacific. This data-driven parameterization achieves higher accuracy than current parameterizations, demonstrating good generalization ability under physical constraints. When integrated into an ocean model, our parameterization facilitates improved simulations in both ocean-only and coupled modeling. As a novel application of machine learning to the geophysical fluid, these results show the feasibility of using limited observations and well-understood physical constraints to construct a physics-informed deep-learning parameterization for improved climate simulations.},

  abstract     = {The production of polypeptides via the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of N -carboxyanhydride (NCA) is usually conducted under stringent anhydrous conditions. The ROP of proline NCA (ProNCA) for the synthesis of poly- L -proline (PLP) is particularly challenging due to the premature product precipitation as polyproline type I helices, leading to slow reactions for up to one week, poor control of the molar mass and laborious workup. Here, we report the unexpected water-assisted controlled ROP of ProNCA, which affords well-defined PLP as polyproline II helices in 2–5 minutes and almost-quantitative yields. Experimental and theoretical studies together suggest the as-yet-unreported role of water in facilitating proton shift, which significantly lowers the energy barrier of the chain propagation. The scope of initiators can be expanded from hydrophobic amines to encompass hydrophilic amines and thiol-bearing nucleophiles, including complex biomacromolecules such as proteins. Protein-mediated ROP of ProNCA conveniently affords various protein-PLP conjugates via a grafting-from approach. PLP modification not only preserves the biological activities of the native proteins, but also enhances their resistance to extreme conditions. Moreover, PLP modification extends the elimination half-life of asparaginase (ASNase) 18-fold and mitigates the immunogenicity of wt ASNase &gt;250-fold (ASNase is a first-line anticancer drug for lymphoma treatment). This work provides a simple solution to a long-standing problem in PLP synthesis, and offers valuable guidance for the development of water-resistant ROP of other proline-like NCAs. The facile access to PLP can greatly boost the application potential of PLP-based functional materials for engineering industry enzymes and therapeutic proteins.},

It is of great significance to reveal LMB failure mechanisms and understand their relationship with battery performance. This review presents an overview of the state-of-the-art Li-metal anodes, with an emphasis on two typical failure modes: capacity degradation and dendritic growth of Li metal. The critical correlations between the composition, structure and failure are explained point by point. The chemical and electrochemical stabilities of the lithium anode are discussed. Particularly, for the first time, five types of lithium-metal anodes are classified to develop a comprehensive understanding of LMBs. Furthermore, strategies are suggested to improve the practical performance of LMBs, including material innovation, electrolyte modification and advanced characterization.},

  abstract     = {Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) was achieved when electron-rich triphenylene (Tpl) donors were confined to a cage-based porous metal-organic framework (MOF) host (NKU-111) composed of electron-deficient 2,4,6-tri(pyridin-4-yl)-1,3,5-triazine (Tpt) acceptor as the ligand. The spatially separated donor and acceptor molecules in a face-to-face stacking pattern generated strong through-space charge transfer (CT) interactions with a small energy splitting between the singlet and triplet excited states (∼0.1 eV), which enabled TADF. The resulting Tpl@NKU-111 exhibited an uncommon enhanced emission intensity as the temperature increased. Extensive steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic measurements and first-principles simulations revealed the chemical and electronic structure of this compound in both the ground and low-lying excited states. A double-channel (T 1 , T 2 ) intersystem crossing mechanism with S 1 was found and explained as single-directional CT from the degenerate HOMO−1/HOMO of the guest donor to the LUMO+1 of one of the nearest acceptors. The rigid skeleton of the compound and effective through-space CT enhanced the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). A maximum PLQY of 57.36% was achieved by optimizing the Tpl loading ratio in the host framework. These results indicate the potential of the MOFs for the targeted construction and optimization of TADF materials.},

  abstract     = {Metal clusters are useful phosphors, but highly luminescent examples are quite rare. Usually, the phosphorescence of metal clusters is hindered by ambient O 2 molecules. Transforming this disadvantage into an advantage for meaningful applications of metal clusters presents a formidable challenge. In this work, we used ligand engineering to judiciously prepare colour-tuneable and brightly emitting Cu(I) clusters that are ultrasensitive to O 2 upon dispersion in a fluid solution or in a solid matrix. When the O 2 scavenger dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as the solvent, joint photo- and oxygen-controlled multicolour switches were achieved for the first time for metal cluster-based photopatterning and photo-anticounterfeiting. More importantly, an aggregation-induced barrier to oxygen, a new aggregation-induced emission mechanism for metal clusters, was proposed, providing a new pathway to realizing the intense emission of metal clusters in the aggregated state. These results are expected to promote the application of metal clusters and enrich the luminescence theory of metal cluster aggregates.},

  abstract     = {Fermi arcs on Weyl semimetals exhibit many exotic quantum phenomena. Usually found on atomically flat surfaces with approximate translation symmetry, Fermi arcs are rooted in the peculiar topology of bulk Bloch bands of 3D crystals. The fundamental question of whether a 1D Fermi arc can be probed remains unanswered. Such an answer could significantly broaden potential applications of Weyl semimetals. Here, we report a direct observation of robust edge states on atomic-scale ledges in TaAs using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. Spectroscopic signatures and theoretical calculations reveal that the 1D Fermi arcs arise from the chiral Weyl points of bulk crystals. The crossover from 2D Fermi arcs to eventual complete localization on 1D edges was arrested experimentally on a sequence of surfaces. Our results demonstrate extreme robustness of the bulk-boundary correspondence, which offers topological protection for Fermi arcs, even in cases in which the boundaries are at the atomic-scale. The persistent 1D Fermi arcs can be profitably exploited in miniaturized quantum devices.},

  abstract     = {Causality of linear time-invariant systems inherently defines the wave-matter interaction process in wave physics. This principle imposes strict constraints on the interfacial response of materials on various physical platforms. A typical consequence is that a delicate balance has to be struck between the conflicting bandwidth and geometric thickness when constructing a medium with desired impedance, which makes it challenging to realize broadband impedance modulation with compact structures. In pursuit of improvement, the over-damped recipe and the reduced excessive response recipe are creatively presented in this work. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we construct a metamaterial with intensive mode density that supports strong non-locality over a frequency band from 320 Hz to 6400 Hz. Under the guidelines of the over-damped recipe and the reduced excessive response recipe, the metamaterial realizes impedance matching to air and exhibits broadband near-perfect absorption without evident impedance oscillation and absorption dips in the working frequency band. We further present a dual-functional design capable of frequency-selective absorption and reflection by concentrating the resonance modes in three frequency bands. Our research reveals the significance of over-damped recipe and the strong non-local effect in broadband impedance modulation, which may open up avenues for constructing efficient artificial impedance boundaries for energy absorption and other wave manipulation.},

  abstract     = {Higher-order topological insulator (HOTI) states, such as two-dimension (2D) HOTI featured with topologically protected corner modes at the intersection of two gapped crystalline boundaries, have attracted much recent interest. However, the physical mechanism underlying the formation of HOTI states is not fully understood, which has hindered our fundamental understanding and discovery of HOTI materials. Here we propose a mechanistic approach to induce higher-order topological phases via structural buckling of 2D topological crystalline insulators (TCIs). While in-plane mirror symmetry is broken by structural buckling, which destroys the TCI state, the combination of mirror and rotation symmetry is preserved in the buckled system, which gives rise to the HOTI state. We demonstrate that this approach is generally applicable to various 2D lattices with different symmetries and buckling patterns, opening a horizon of possible materials to realize 2D HOTIs. The HOTIs so generated are also shown to be robust against buckling height fluctuation and in-plane displacement. A concrete example is given for the buckled |$\beta $| -Sb monolayer from first-principles calculations. Our finding not only enriches our fundamental understanding of higher-order topology, but also opens a new route to discovering HOTI materials.},

  abstract     = {Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed from a rich library of organic struts and metal ions/clusters represent promising candidates for a wide range of applications. The unique structure, porous nature, easy tunability and processability of these materials make them an outstanding class of materials for tackling serious global problems relating to energy and environment. Among them, environmental pollution is one aspect that has increased at an alarming rate in the past decade or so. With rapid urbanization and industrialization, toxic environmental pollutants are constantly released and accumulated leading to serious contamination in water bodies and thereby having adverse effects on human health. Recent studies have shown that many toxic pollutants, as listed by the World Health Organization and the US Environmental Protection Agency, can be selectively detected, captured, sequestered and removed by MOFs from air and aquatic systems. Most of these sensing/capture processes in MOFs are quantifiable and effective for even a trace amount of the targeted chemical species. The functional sites (ligands and metals) play a critical role in such recognition processes and offer an extensive scope of structural tunability for guest (pollutants, toxic entities) recognition. Whereas on the one hand, the underlying mechanisms governing such sensing and capture are important, it is also crucial to identify MOFs that are best suited for commercial applications for the future. In this review article, we provide an overview of the most recent progress in the sensing, capture and removal of various common toxic pollutants, including neutral and ionic, inorganic and organic species, with brief discussions on the mechanism and efficacy of selected MOFs.},

Here, we demonstrate a potassium ion (K + ) sensitive dual-mode nanoprobe (KDMN) for non-invasive tumor imaging and malignancy identification, which operates via a cascaded ‘AND’ logic gate controlled by inputs of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorescence imaging (FI) signals. We encapsulate commercial K + indicators into the hollow cavities of magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles, which are subsequently coated with a K + -selective membrane that exclusively permits the passage of K + while excluding other cations. The KDMN can readily accumulate in tumors and enhance the MRI contrast after systemic administration. Spatial information of the tumor lesion is thus accessible via MRI and forms the first layer of the ‘AND’ gate. Meanwhile, the KDMN selectively captures K + and prevents interference from other cations, triggering a K + -activated FI signal as the second layer of the ‘AND’ gate in the case of a malignant tumor with a high extracellular K + level. This dual-mode imaging approach effectively eliminates false positive or negative diagnostic results and allows for non-invasive imaging of tumor malignancy with high sensitivity and accuracy.},

This hierarchically 3D, cross-linked and stable sulfur–polyaniline backbone with interconnected disulfide bonds provides a new type and strong intrinsic chemical confinement of sulfur owing to the atomic orbital hybridization of Li 2s, S 3p, C 2p and N 2p. Crucially, such atomic orbital hybridization of sulfur sandwiched in the double sulfur–polyaniline network is highly reversible during the discharge/charge process and can very efficiently suppress the shuttle effect and volume expansion, contributing to a very high capacity of 1142 mAh g –1 and an excellent stabilized capacity of 886 mAh g –1 at 0.2 C after 500 cycles with a suppressed volume expansion and an unprecedented electrode integrity. This innovative atomic orbital hybridization concept can be extended to the preparation of other electrode materials to eliminate the shuttle effect and volume expansion in battery technologies.

The Linyi Lagerstätte contains a variety of well-preserved soft-bodied fossils, among which the non-trilobite arthropods, particularly the mollisoniids and radiodonts, are the most important groups.

  abstract     = {The household energy mix has significant impacts on human health and climate, as it contributes greatly to many health- and climate-relevant air pollutants. Compared to the well-established urban energy statistical system, the rural household energy statistical system is incomplete and is often associated with high biases. Via a nationwide investigation, this study revealed high contributions to energy supply from coal and biomass fuels in the rural household energy sector, while electricity comprised ∼20%. Stacking (the use of multiple sources of energy) is significant, and the average number of energy types was 2.8 per household. Compared to 2012, the consumption of biomass and coals in 2017 decreased by 45% and 12%, respectively, while the gas consumption amount increased by 204%. Increased gas and decreased coal consumptions were mainly in cooking, while decreased biomass was in both cooking (41%) and heating (59%). The time-sharing fraction of electricity and gases (E&amp;G) for daily cooking grew, reaching 69% in 2017, but for space heating, traditional solid fuels were still dominant, with the national average shared fraction of E&amp;G being only 20%. The non-uniform spatial distribution and the non-linear increase in the fraction of E&amp;G indicated challenges to achieving universal access to modern cooking energy by 2030, particularly in less-developed rural and mountainous areas. In some non-typical heating zones, the increased share of E&amp;G for heating was significant and largely driven by income growth, but in typical heating zones, the time-sharing fraction was &lt;5% and was not significantly increased, except in areas with policy intervention. The intervention policy not only led to dramatic increases in the clean energy fraction for heating but also accelerated the clean cooking transition. Higher income, higher education, younger age, less energy/stove stacking and smaller family size positively impacted the clean energy transition.},

However, the energy densities of MSCs are greatly hampered by MXenes’ narrow working potential window (typically ≤0.6 V) in aqueous electrolytes. Here, we report the fabrication of high-voltage MXene-MSCs through the efficient regulation of reaction kinetics in 2D Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene microelectrodes using a water-in-LiCl (WIL, 20 m LiCl) salt gel electrolyte. Importantly, the intrinsic energy-storage mechanism of MXene microelectrodes in WIL, which is totally different from traditional electrolytes (1 m LiCl), was revealed through in situ and ex situ characterizations. We validated that the suppression of MXene oxidation at high anodic potential occurred due to the high content of WIL regulating anion intercalation in MXene electrodes, which effectively broadened the voltage window of MXene-MSCs. Remarkably, the symmetric planar MXene-MSCs presented a record operating voltage of 1.6 V, resulting in an exceptionally high volumetric energy density of 31.7 mWh cm −3 . With the ultra-high ionic conductivity (69.5 mS cm −1 ) and ultralow freezing point (−57°C) of the WIL gel electrolyte, our MSCs could be operated in a wide temperature range of −40 to 60°C, and worked for a long duration even at −40°C, demonstrative of its practicality in extreme environments.},

  abstract     = {As early as 2001, the need for the ‘functional motif theory’ was pointed out, to assist the rational design of functional materials. The properties of materials are determined by their functional motifs and how they are arranged in the materials. Uncovering functional motifs and their arrangements is crucial in understanding the properties of materials and rationally designing new materials of desired properties. The functional motifs of materials are the critical microstructural units (e.g. constituent components and building blocks) that play a decisive role in generating certain material functions, and can not be replaced with other structural units without the loss, or significant suppression, of relevant functions. The role of functional motifs and their arrangement in materials, with representative examples, is presented. The microscopic structures of these examples can be classified into six types on a length scale smaller than ∼10 nm with maximum subatomic resolution, i.e. crystal, magnetic, aperiodic, defect, local and electronic structures. Functional motif analysis can be employed in the function-oriented design of materials, as elucidated by taking infrared non-linear optical materials as an example. Machine learning is more efficient in predicting material properties and screening materials with high efficiency than high-throughput experimentation and high-throughput calculations. In order to extract functional motifs and find their quantitative relationships, the development of sufficiently reliable databases for material structures and properties is imperative.},

  abstract     = {The polar bodies (PBs) are extruded microcells during oocyte meiosis and generally regarded as inessentials for embryonic development. Therefore, PBs have been widely used as important materials for pre-implantation genetic diagnosis in human. Here we report that the second PB (PB2) in the mouse zygote may play roles in cell-fate specification and post-implantation development. A subset of mRNAs encoding pluripotency-related factors are enriched in PB2. Nascent proteins may be synthesized in PB2 after fertilization and transport from PB2 to the zygote before the two-cell stage. The PB2-attached blastomere (pbB) at the two-cell stage, compared to the other blastomere (npbB), likely contributes more descendants to the inner cell mass (ICM) lineage in the blastocyst. Removal of PB2 from the zygote or transient blockage of material exchange between PB2 and the zygote by nocodazole treatment appears to cause a loss of the ICM fate bias of pbB. PB2 removal or nocodazole treatment also results in abnormal post-implantation development. Injection of PB2 lysate into pbB of PB2-removed two-cell-stage embryos may reset the cell-fate preference and rescue post-implantation development. Our data collectively suggest that PB2 would demarcate the earliest cell-fate asymmetry of the mouse zygote and be required for post-implantation development.},

Using a Rb1 L/L /Trp53 L/L mouse model, we identify the NCAM hi CD44 lo/– subpopulation as the SCLC metastasizing cell (SMC), which is progressively transitioned from the non-metastasizing NCAM lo CD44 hi cell (non-SMC). Integrative chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiling studies reveal the important role of the SWI/SNF complex, and knockout of its central component, Brg1 , significantly inhibits such phenotypic transition and metastasis. Mechanistically, TAZ is silenced by the SWI/SNF complex during SCLC malignant progression, and its knockdown promotes SMC transition and metastasis. Importantly, ectopic TAZ expression reversely drives SMC-to-non-SMC transition and alleviates metastasis. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses identify SMC as the dominant subpopulation in human SCLC metastasis, and immunostaining data show a positive correlation between TAZ and patient prognosis. These data uncover high SCLC plasticity and identify TAZ as the key molecular switch in orchestrating SCLC phenotypic transition and metastasis.},

Thus, the design and synthesis of stable size/morphology-controlled MOF nanocrystals is critical but challenging. In this study, dual-ligand and hard-soft-acid-base strategies were used to fabricate a variety of 3D pillared-layer [Ni(thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylate)(4,4 ′ -bipyridine)] n MOF nanocrystals (1D nanofibers, 2D nanosheets and 3D aggregates) with controllable morphology by varying the concentration of 4,4 ′ -bipyridine and thus controlling the crystal growth direction. Owing to the shorter ion diffusion length, enhanced electron/ion transfer and strong interactions between thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylate and 4,4 ′ -bipyridine, the 2D nanosheets showed much larger specific capacitance than 1D nanofibers and 3D aggregates. A single device with an output voltage as high as 3.0 V and exceptional cycling performance (95% of retention after 5000 cycles at 3 mA cm –2 ) was realized by configuring two aqueous asymmetric supercapacitive devices in series. The excellent cycling property and charge–discharge mechanism are consistent with the hard-soft-acid-base theory.},

Here, we present an ER-targeting Re(I) tricarbonyl complex (Re-ERLAD) that can accumulate in the ER, induce ER-to-lysosome-associated degradation (ERLAD) upon visible light irradiation, and label ER buds and track their morphological alterations during ER-phagy. The emission of Re-ERLAD is sensitive to viscosity, which is a key parameter reflecting the amount of unfolded protein in the ER. Quantitative detection using two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy shows that ER viscosity initially increases and then decreases during ERLAD, which reveals that ERLAD is a pathway for alleviating ER stress caused by unfolded proteins. In conclusion, our work presents the first specific photoinducer and tracker of ERLAD, which can be used in studying the regulatory mechanism and function of this process.},

Herein, we report an effective approach that utilizes a metal-containing species, copper acetate, to continuously supply copper clusters in a gaseous form to aid transfer-free growth of graphene over a wafer scale. The thus-derived graphene films were found to show reduced multilayer density and improved electrical performance and exhibited a carrier mobility of 8500 cm 2 V −1 s −1 . Furthermore, droplet-based hydrovoltaic electricity generator devices based on directly grown graphene were found to exhibit robust voltage output and long cyclic stability, in stark contrast to their counterparts based on transferred graphene, demonstrating the potential for emerging energy harvesting applications.

Using an advanced crystal structure search method, we have identified a quaternary compound FeO 2 H 2 He stabilized in a wide range of P-T conditions. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations further reveal a novel superionic state of FeO 2 H 2 He hosting liquid-like diffusive hydrogen in the FeO 2 He sublattice, creating a conducive environment for H-He chemical association, at P-T conditions corresponding to the Earth&#39;s lowest mantle regions. To our surprise, this chemically facilitated coalescence of otherwise immiscible molecular species highlights a promising avenue for exploring this long-sought but hitherto unattainable state of matter.

  abstract     = {Hydrogels have emerged as promising materials for the construction of skin-like mechanical sensors. The common design of hydrogel-based artificial skin requires a dielectric sandwiched between two hydrogel layers for capacitive sensing. However, such a planar configuration limits the sensitivity, stretchability and self-healing properties. Here, we report the design of single-layer composite hydrogels with bulk capacitive junctions as mechanical sensors. We engineer dielectric peptide-coated graphene (PCG) to serve as homogenously dispersed electric double layers in hydrogels. Any mechanical motions that alter the microscopic distributions of PCG in the hydrogels can significantly change the overall capacitance. We use peptide self-assembly to render strong yet dynamic interfacial interactions between the hydrogel network and graphene. The resulting hydrogels can be stretched up to 77 times their original length and self-heal in a few minutes. The devices can effectively sense strain and pressure in both air and aqueous environments, providing tremendous opportunities for next-generation iontronics.},

In this field, interconnection and novel display applications are acknowledged as important future directions. However, it is a huge scientific and technical challenge to develop intrinsically flexible displays due to the limited size and shape of the display panel. To address this conundrum, it is crucial to develop intrinsically flexible electrode materials, semiconductor materials and dielectric materials, as well as the relevant flexible transistor drivers and display panels. In this review, we focus on the recent progress in this field from seven aspects: background and concept, intrinsically flexible electrode materials, intrinsically flexible organic semiconductors and dielectric materials for organic thin film transistors (OTFTs), intrinsically flexible organic emissive semiconductors for electroluminescent devices, and OTFT-driven electroluminescent devices for intrinsically flexible displays. Finally, some suggestions and prospects for the future development of intrinsically flexible displays are proposed.},

We propose a facile method to manipulate nanoconfined water through surface chemistry modification. By introducing oxygen and nitrogen surface groups, more active sites were created for Ti 3 C 2 MXene, and the interlayer spacing was significantly increased by accommodating three-layer nanoconfined water. Exceptionally high capacitance of 550 F g –1 (2000 F cm –3 ) was obtained with outstanding high-rate performance. The atomic scale elucidation of the layer-dependent properties of nanoconfined water and pseudocapacitive charge storage was deeply probed through a combination of ‘computational and experimental microscopy’. We believe that an understanding of, and a manipulation strategy for, nanoconfined water will shed light on ways to improve the electrochemical performance of MXene and other two-dimensional materials.},

  abstract     = {The 2D semiconductor of MoS 2 has great potential for advanced electronics technologies beyond silicon. So far, high-quality monolayer MoS 2 wafers have been available and various demonstrations from individual transistors to integrated circuits have also been shown. In addition to the monolayer, multilayers have narrower band gaps but improved carrier mobilities and current capacities over the monolayer. However, achieving high-quality multi-layer MoS 2 wafers remains a challenge. Here we report the growth of high-quality multi-layer MoS 2 4-inch wafers via the layer-by-layer epitaxy process. The epitaxy leads to well-defined stacking orders between adjacent epitaxial layers and offers a delicate control of layer numbers up to six. Systematic evaluations on the atomic structures and electronic properties were carried out for achieved wafers with different layer numbers. Significant improvements in device performances were found in thicker-layer field-effect transistors (FETs), as expected. For example, the average field-effect mobility ( μ FE ) at room temperature (RT) can increase from ∼80 cm 2 ·V –1 ·s –1 for monolayers to ∼110/145 cm 2 ·V –1 ·s –1 for bilayer/trilayer devices. The highest RT μ FE of 234.7 cm 2 ·V –1 ·s –1 and record-high on-current densities of 1.70 mA·μm –1 at V ds = 2 V were also achieved in trilayer MoS 2 FETs with a high on/off ratio of &gt;10 7 . Our work hence moves a step closer to practical applications of 2D MoS 2 in electronics.},

Due to the reinforced lattice distortion effect and excellent IBTs, the nanoparticles can realize an average absorption of &gt;92% in the entire solar spectrum (250 to 2500 nm). In particular, the 21-element nanoparticles achieve a considerably high solar steam efficiency of nearly 99% under one solar irradiation, with a water evaporation rate of 2.42 kg m –2 h –1 , demonstrating a highly efficient photothermal conversion performance.

  abstract     = {The lighter magnesium (Mg) isotopic signatures observed in intraplate basalts are commonly thought to result from deep carbonate recycling, provided that the sharp difference in Mg isotopic composition between surface carbonates and the normal mantle is preserved during plate subduction. However, deep subduction of carbonates and silicates could potentially fractionate Mg isotopes and change their chemical compositions. Subducting silicate rocks that experience metamorphic dehydration lose a small amount of Mg, and preserve the original Mg isotopic signature of their protoliths. When the dehydrated fluids dissolve carbonate minerals, they may evolve into lighter Mg isotopic compositions. The solubility of carbonate minerals in fluids decreases in the order of calcite, aragonite, dolomite, magnesite and siderite, leading to selective and partial dissolution of carbonate minerals along the subduction path. At the island arc depth (70–120 km), the metamorphic fluid dissolves mainly Mg-poor calcites, and thus the fluid has difficulty modifying the Mg isotopic system of the mantle wedge and associated arc basalts. At the greater depth of the back arc system or continental margin (&gt;150 km), the supercritical fluid can dissolve Mg-rich carbonate minerals, and its interaction with the mantle wedge could significantly imprint the light Mg isotopic signature onto the mantle rocks and derivatives. Meanwhile, the carbonate and silicate remaining within the subducting slab could experience elemental and isotopic exchange, during which the silicate can obtain a light Mg isotopic signature and high CaO/Al 2 O 3 , whereas the carbonates, particularly the Ca-rich limestone, shift Mg isotopes and MgO contents towards higher values. If this isotopic and elemental exchange event occurs widely during crustal subduction, subducted Ca-rich carbonates can partially transform into being Mg-rich, and a portion of recycled silicates (e.g. carbonated eclogites) can have light Mg isotopic composition alongside carbonates. Both serve as the low-δ 26 Mg endmember recycled back into the deep mantle, but the latter is not related to deep carbonate recycling. Therefore, it is important to determine whether the light Mg isotopic signatures observed in intraplate basalts are linked to deep carbonate recycling, or alternatively, recycling of carbonated eclogites.},

  abstract     = {Recent decades have witnessed an exponential growth in the discovery of low-dimensional materials (LDMs), benefiting from our unprecedented capabilities in characterizing their structure and chemistry with the aid of advanced computational techniques. Recently, the success of two-dimensional compounds has encouraged extensive research into one-dimensional (1D) atomic chains. Here, we present a methodology for topological classification of structural blocks in bulk crystals based on graph theory, leading to the identification of exfoliable 1D atomic chains and their categorization into a variety of chemical families. A subtle interplay is revealed between the prototypical 1D structural motifs and their chemical space. Leveraging the structure graphs, we elucidate the self-passivation mechanism of 1D compounds imparted by lone electron pairs, and reveal the dependence of the electronic band gap on the cationic percolation network formed by connections between structure units. This graph-theory-based formalism could serve as a source of stimuli for the future design of LDMs.},

  abstract     = {Dams are often regarded as greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters. However, our study indicated that the world&#39;s largest dam, the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), has caused significant drops in annual average emissions of CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O over 4300 km along the Yangtze River, accompanied by remarkable reductions in the annual export of CO 2 (79%), CH 4 (50%) and N 2 O (9%) to the sea. Since the commencement of its operation in 2003, the TGD has altered the carbonate equilibrium in the reservoir area, enhanced methanogenesis in the upstream, and restrained methanogenesis and denitrification via modifying anoxic habitats through long-distance scouring in the downstream. These findings suggest that ‘large-dam effects’ are far beyond our previous understanding spatiotemporally, which highlights the fundamental importance of whole-system budgeting of GHGs under the profound impacts of huge dams.},

Here we examine the role of cratonic destruction in mantle CO 2 outgassing via collating and presenting new data for Paleozoic kimberlites, Mesozoic basaltic rocks and their mantle xenoliths from the eastern North China Craton (NCC), which underwent extensive destruction in the early Cretaceous. High Ca/Al and low Ti/Eu and δ 26 Mg are widely observed in lamprophyres and mantle xenoliths, which demonstrates that the cratonic lithospheric mantle (CLM) was pervasively metasomatized by recycled carbonates. Raman analysis of bubble-bearing melt inclusions shows that redox melting of the C-rich CLM produced carbonated silicate melts with high CO 2 content. The enormous quantities of CO 2 in these magmas, together with substantial CO 2 degassing from the carbonated melt–CLM reaction and crustal heating, indicate that destruction of the eastern NCC resulted in rapid and extensive mantle CO 2 emission, which partly contributed to the early Cretaceous greenhouse climate episode.},

Although extrinsic factors driving cell-identity conversion have been extensively characterized, it remains elusive which intrinsic epigenetic attributes, including high-order chromatin organization, delineate cell plasticity. By analysing the transcription-factor-induced transdifferentiation from fibroblasts to hepatocytes, we uncovered contiguous compartment-switchable regions (CSRs) as a unique chromatin unit. Specifically, compartment B-to-A CSRs, enriched with hepatic genes, possessed a mosaic status of inactive chromatin and pre-existing and continuous accessibility in fibroblasts. Pre-existing accessibility enhanced the binding of inducible factor Foxa3, which triggered epigenetic activation and chromatin interaction as well as hepatic gene expression. Notably, these changes were restrained within B-to-A CSR boundaries that were defined by CTCF occupancy. Moreover, such chromatin organization and mosaic status were detectable in different cell types and involved in multiple reprogramming processes, suggesting an intrinsic chromatin attribute in understanding cell plasticity.},

We found that pharmacological inactivation of S1 abolished itch-induced scratching behavior, and the itch-induced scratching behavior could be well predicted by the activity of a fraction of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, suggesting that a subpopulation of S1 pyramidal neurons encoded itch perception, as indicated by immediate subsequent scratching behaviors. With a newly established optogenetics-based paradigm that allows precisely controlled pruritic stimulation, we found that a small fraction of S1 neurons exhibited an ignition-like pattern at the detection threshold of itch perception. Our study revealed the neural mechanism underlying itch perceptual coding in S1, thus paving the way for the study of cortical representation of itch perception at the single-neuron level in freely moving animals.},

It is crucial but challenging to deliberately direct intracellular pathways to synthesize desired nanocrystals that cannot be produced naturally in cells, because the relevant reactions exist in different spatiotemporal dimensions and will never encounter each other spontaneously. This article summarizes the progress in the introduction of inorganic functional nanocrystals into live cells via the ‘artificially regulated space–time-coupled live-cell synthesis’ strategy. We also describe ingenious bio-applications of nanocrystal–cell systems, and quasi-biosynthesis strategies expanded from live-cell synthesis. Artificially regulated live-cell synthesis—which involves the interdisciplinary application of biology, chemistry, nanoscience and medicine—will enable researchers to better exploit the unanticipated potentialities of live cells and open up new directions in synthetic biology.},

Accordingly, development of facile strategies toward functional MOFs with covalently bound M-NHCs for catalysis is needed. Herein, we describe the development of a general and facile approach to preparing MOFs with covalently linked active M-NHC (M = Pd, Ir) single-site catalysts by using a soluble Ag salt AgOC(CF 3 ) 3 as the source and subsequent transmetalation. The well-defined M-NHC-MOF (M = Pd, Ir) catalysts obtained in this way have shown excellent catalytic activity and stability in Suzuki reactions and hydrogen transfer reactions. This provides a general and facile strategy for anchoring functional M-NHC single-site catalysts onto functionalized MOFs for different reactions.},

  abstract     = {Stacking atomically thin films enables artificial construction of van der Waals heterostructures with exotic functionalities such as superconductivity, the quantum Hall effect, and engineered light-matter interactions. In particular, heterobilayers composed of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides have attracted significant interest due to their controllable interlayer coupling and trapped valley excitons in moiré superlattices. However, the identification of twist-angle-modulated optical transitions in heterobilayers is sometimes controversial since both momentum-direct (K–K) and -indirect excitons reside on the low energy side of the bright exciton in the monolayer constituents. Here, we attribute the optical transition at ∼1.35 eV in the WS 2 /WSe 2 heterobilayer to an indirect Γ–K transition based on a systematic analysis and comparison of experimental photoluminescence spectra with theoretical calculations. The exciton wavefunction obtained by the state-of-the-art GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation approach indicates that both the electron and hole of the excitons are contributed by the WS 2 layer. Polarization-resolved k -space imaging further confirms that the transition dipole moment of this optical transition is dominantly in-plane and is independent of the twist angle. The calculated absorption spectrum predicts that the so-called interlayer exciton peak coming from the K–K transition is located at 1.06 eV, but with a much weaker amplitude. Our work provides new insight into the steady-state and dynamic properties of twist-angle-dependent excitons in van der Waals heterostructures.},

  abstract     = {Quantum machine learning explores the interplay between machine learning and quantum physics, which may lead to unprecedented perspectives for both fields. In fact, recent works have shown strong evidence that quantum computers could outperform classical computers in solving certain notable machine learning tasks. Yet, quantum learning systems may also suffer from the vulnerability problem: adding a tiny carefully crafted perturbation to the legitimate input data would cause the systems to make incorrect predictions at a notably high confidence level. In this paper, we study the universality of adversarial examples and perturbations for quantum classifiers. Through concrete examples involving classifications of real-life images and quantum phases of matter, we show that there exist universal adversarial examples that can fool a set of different quantum classifiers. We prove that, for a set of k classifiers with each receiving input data of n qubits, an O (ln [ k ]/2 n ) increase of the perturbation strength is enough to ensure a moderate universal adversarial risk. In addition, for a given quantum classifier, we show that there exist universal adversarial perturbations, which can be added to different legitimate samples to make them adversarial examples for the classifier. Our results reveal the universality perspective of adversarial attacks for quantum machine learning systems, which would be crucial for practical applications of both near-term and future quantum technologies in solving machine learning problems.},

Here, we report molecular-beam epitaxy growth of wafer-scale Fe 3+X GeTe 2 films with T C above room temperature. By controlling the Fe composition in Fe 3+X GeTe 2 , a continuously modulated T C in a broad range of 185–320 K has been achieved. This widely tunable T C is attributed to the doped interlayer Fe that provides a 40% enhancement around the optimal composition X = 2. We further fabricated magnetic tunneling junction device arrays that exhibit clear tunneling signals.

Functional dynamics analysis revealed good biocompatibility, low toxicity and programmable structures, and their advantages include controllable size and modifiability. The development of novel hybrids has focused on the distinct roles of biosensing, drug and gene delivery, vaccine transport, photosensitization, counteracting drug resistance and functioning as carriers and logic gates. This review is divided into three parts: (i) DNA nanocarriers, (ii) RNA nanocarriers and (iii) DNA/RNA hybrid nanocarriers and their applications in nanobiology delivery systems.

  abstract     = {There has been a large literature in the last two decades affirming adaptive DNA sequence evolution between species. The main lines of evidence are from (i) the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test, which compares divergence and polymorphism data, and (ii) the phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood (PAML) test, which analyzes multispecies divergence data. Here, we apply these two tests concurrently to genomic data of Drosophila and Arabidopsis . To our surprise, the &gt;100 genes identified by the two tests do not overlap beyond random expectation. Because the non-concordance could be due to low powers leading to high false negatives, we merge every 20–30 genes into a ‘supergene’. At the supergene level, the power of detection is large but the calls still do not overlap. We rule out methodological reasons for the non-concordance. In particular, extensive simulations fail to find scenarios whereby positive selection can only be detected by either MK or PAML, but not both. Since molecular evolution is governed by positive and negative selection concurrently, a fundamental assumption for estimating one of these (say, positive selection) is that the other is constant. However, in a broad survey of primates, birds, Drosophila and Arabidopsis , we found that negative selection rarely stays constant for long in evolution. As a consequence, the variation in negative selection is often misconstrued as a signal of positive selection. In conclusion, MK, PAML and any method that examines genomic sequence evolution has to explicitly address the variation in negative selection before estimating positive selection. In a companion study, we propose a possible path forward in two stages—first, by mapping out the changes in negative selection and then using this map to estimate positive selection. For now, the large literature on positive selection between species has to await reassessment.},

In Arabidopsis thaliana , RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6)/JUMONJI DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 12 demethylates H3K27me3 by recognizing a specific DNA motif. However, little is known about how REF6 activates target gene expression after recognition, especially in environmental responses. In response to warm ambient temperature, plants undergo thermomorphogenesis, which involves accelerated growth, early flowering and changes in morphology. Here we show that REF6 regulates thermomorphogenesis and cooperates with the transcription factor PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 to synergistically activate thermoresponsive genes under warm ambient temperature. The ref6 loss-of-function mutants exhibited attenuated hypocotyl elongation at warm temperature, partially due to downregulation of GIBBERELLIN 20-OXIDASE 2 and BASIC HELIX-LOOP-HELIX 87 . REF6 enzymatic activity is necessary for warm ambient temperature responses. Together, our results provide direct evidence of an epigenetic modifier and a transcription factor working together to respond to the environment.},

However, whether a high-BCAA diet promotes PDAC development in vivo , and the underlying mechanism of BCAT2 upregulation, remain undefined. Here, we find that a high-BCAA diet promotes pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) progression in LSL-Kras G12D/+ ; Pdx1-Cre (KC) mice. Moreover, we screened with an available deubiquitylase library which contains 31 members of USP family and identified that USP1 deubiquitylates BCAT2 at the K229 site. Furthermore, BCAA increases USP1 protein at the translational level via the GCN2-eIF2α pathway both in vitro and in vivo . More importantly, USP1 inhibition recedes cell proliferation and clone formation in PDAC cells and attenuates pancreas tumor growth in an orthotopic transplanted mice model. Consistently, a positive correlation between USP1 and BCAT2 is found in KC; LSL-Kras G12D/+ ; p53 flox/+ ; Pdx1-Cre mice and clinical samples. Thus, a therapeutic targeting USP1-BCAT2-BCAA metabolic axis could be considered as a rational strategy for treatment of PDAC and precisive dietary intervention of BCAA has potentially translational significance.},

The eastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt, where the Mongol-Okhotsk orocline is situated, is one of the world&#39;s largest magmatic provinces. Using a large data set of U-Pb zircon ages, we updated the timing of many published igneous rocks, which allowed us to recognize tightly ‘folded’ linear Carboniferous-Jurassic magmatic belts that wrap around the Mongol-Okhotsk suture and their migrations both sutureward and suture-parallel. The new successive magmatic belts reveal a rollback, scissor-like (or zipper-like) closure of the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean that was fundamentally controlled by coeval subduction rollback and rotation of the Siberian and Mongolian-Erguna blocks. This study also demonstrates the complex mechanisms and processes of the closure of an ocean with irregular margins and the formation of a consequent orocline.},

  abstract     = {Atmospheric methane (CH 4 ) concentrations have shown a puzzling resumption in growth since 2007 following a period of stabilization from 2000 to 2006. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain the temporal variations in CH 4 growth, and attribute the rise of atmospheric CH 4 either to increases in emissions from fossil fuel activities, agriculture and natural wetlands, or to a decrease in the atmospheric chemical sink. Here, we use a comprehensive ensemble of CH 4 source estimates and isotopic δ 13 C-CH 4 source signature data to show that the resumption of CH 4 growth is most likely due to increased anthropogenic emissions. Our emission scenarios that have the fewest biases with respect to isotopic composition suggest that the agriculture, landfill and waste sectors were responsible for 53 ± 13% of the renewed growth over the period 2007–2017 compared to 2000–2006; industrial fossil fuel sources explained an additional 34 ± 24%, and wetland sources contributed the least at 13 ± 9%. The hypothesis that a large increase in emissions from natural wetlands drove the decrease in atmospheric δ 13 C-CH 4 values cannot be reconciled with current process-based wetland CH 4 models. This finding suggests the need for increased wetland measurements to better understand the contemporary and future role of wetlands in the rise of atmospheric methane and climate feedback. Our findings highlight the predominant role of anthropogenic activities in driving the growth of atmospheric CH 4 concentrations.},

Although electron-phonon interaction has been suggested by various time-resolved measurements to be important for the relaxation dynamics of graphene, the lack of energy- and momentum-resolved self-energy dynamics prohibits direct identification of the role of specific phonon modes in the relaxation dynamics. Here, by performing time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on Kekulé-ordered graphene with folded Dirac cones at the Γ point, we have succeeded in resolving the self-energy effect induced by the coupling of electrons to two phonons at Ω 1 = 177 meV and Ω 2 = 54 meV, and revealing its dynamical change in the time domain. Moreover, these strongly coupled phonons define energy thresholds, which separate the hierarchical relaxation dynamics from ultrafast, fast to slow, thereby providing direct experimental evidence for the dominant role of mode-specific phonons in the relaxation dynamics.},

Here we introduce the PALME (protein activation and ligation with multiple enzymes) platform designed for sequence-unconstrained synthesis and modification of biomacromolecules. The upstream activating modules accept and process easily accessible synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins, avoiding the challenges associated with preparation and manipulation of activated peptide substrates. Cooperatively, the downstream coupling module provides comprehensive solutions for sequential peptide condensation, cyclization and protein N/C-terminal or internal functionalization. The practical utility of this methodology is demonstrated by synthesizing a series of bioactive targets ranging from pharmaceutical ingredients to synthetically challenging proteins. The modular PALME platform exhibits unprecedentedly broad accessibility for traceless protein synthesis and functionalization, and holds enormous potential to extend the scope of protein chemistry and synthetic biology.},

The high positive charges on [(Pd/Pt) 6 (RuL 3 ) 8 ] 28+ nanocages drive imidazole–proton equilibrium to display a significantly perturbed p K a shift, creating cage-defined nanospaces in solution with distinct intrinsic basicity and extrinsic acidity. The supramolecular cage effect plays pivotal roles in elaborating robust solution nanospaces, controlling ingress-and-egress molecular processes through open-cage portals and endowing nanocages with transition-state stabilization, amphoteric reactivities and the phase transfer of insoluble molecules, thus promoting chemical transformations in unconventional ways. Consequently, a wide range of application of cage-confined catalysis with anomalous reactivities may be expected based on this kind of open-cage solution medium, which combines cage nanocavity, solution heterogeneity and liquid-phase fluidity to benefit various potential mass transfer and molecular process options.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) rare-earth oxides (REOs) are a large family of materials with various intriguing applications and precise facet control is essential for investigating new properties in the 2D limit. However, a bottleneck remains with regard to obtaining their 2D single crystals with specific facets because of the intrinsic non-layered structure and disparate thermodynamic stability of different facets. Herein, for the first time, we achieve the synthesis of a wide variety of high-quality 2D REO single crystals with tailorable facets via designing a hard-soft-acid-base couple for controlling the 2D nucleation of the predetermined facets and adjusting the growth mode and direction of crystals. Also, the facet-related magnetic properties of 2D REO single crystals were revealed. Our approach provides a foundation for further exploring other facet-dependent properties and various applications of 2D REO, as well as inspiration for the precise growth of other non-layered 2D materials.},

  abstract     = {Spin defects in silicon carbide (SiC) with mature wafer-scale fabrication and micro/nano-processing technologies have recently drawn considerable attention. Although room-temperature single-spin manipulation of colour centres in SiC has been demonstrated, the typically detected contrast is less than 2 % ⁠ , and the photon count rate is also low. Here, we present the coherent manipulation of single divacancy spins in 4H-SiC with a high readout contrast ( ⁠ − 30 % ⁠ ) and a high photon count rate (150 kilo counts per second) under ambient conditions, which are competitive with the nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond. Coupling between a single defect spin and a nearby nuclear spin is also observed. We further provide a theoretical explanation for the high readout contrast by analysing the defect levels and decay paths. Since the high readout contrast is of utmost importance in many applications of quantum technologies, this work might open a new territory for SiC-based quantum devices with many advanced properties of the host material.},

Among the three specific polytypes ( γ -, ϵ - and β -phase) of InSe, only the crystal lattice of InSe in β -phase ( β -InSe) belongs to a non-symmetry point group of D 6 h 4 ⁠ , which indicates stronger anisotropic transport behavior and potential in the polarized photodetection of β -InSe-based optoelectronic devices. Therefore, we prepare the stable p-type 2D-layered β -InSe via temperature gradient method. The anisotropic Raman, transport and photoresponse properties of β -InSe have been experimentally and theoretically proven, showing that the β -InSe-based device has a ratio of 3.76 for the maximum to minimum dark current at two orthogonal orientations and a high photocurrent anisotropic ratio of 0.70 at 1 V bias voltage, respectively. The appealing anisotropic properties demonstrated in this work clearly identify β -InSe as a competitive candidate for filter-free polarization-sensitive photodetectors.},

To fully unlock the capability of Li–O 2 batteries, an in-depth understanding of the catalytic mechanisms of RMs is necessary.

  abstract     = {Cartilage injuries are often devastating and most cannot be cured because of the intrinsically low regenerative capacity of cartilage tissues. Although stem-cell therapy has shown enormous potential for cartilage repair, the therapeutic outcome has been restricted by low survival rates and poor chondrocyte differentiation in vivo . Here, we report an injectable hybrid inorganic (IHI) nanoscaffold that facilitates fast assembly, enhances survival and regulates chondrogenic differentiation of stem cells. IHI nanoscaffolds that strongly bind to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins assemble stem cells through synergistic 3D cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions, creating a favorable physical microenvironment for stem-cell survival and differentiation in vitro and in vivo . Additionally, chondrogenic factors can be loaded into nanoscaffolds with a high capacity, which allows deep, homogenous drug delivery into assembled 3D stem-cell-derived tissues for effective control over the soluble microenvironment of stem cells. The developed IHI nanoscaffolds that assemble with stem cells are injectable. They also scavenge reactive oxygen species and timely biodegrade for proper integration into injured cartilage tissues. Implantation of stem-cell-assembled IHI nanoscaffolds into injured cartilage results in accelerated tissue regeneration and functional recovery. By establishing our IHI nanoscaffold-templated 3D stem-cell assembly method, we provide a promising approach to better overcoming the inhibitory microenvironment associated with cartilage injuries and to advance current stem-cell-based tissue engineering.},

  abstract     = {Graphene is the building block of graphite, made of carbon atoms bonded into sheets of hexagonal rings just a single atom thick. Although such isolated sheets had been predicted for many decades to exist, and had been grown on other surfaces, interest in this material exploded after the discovery in 2004 that single sheets could be made easily and cheaply by separating them mechanically from graphite flakes (a process called exfoliation). Although graphene is often advertised as a ‘wonder material’—electronically conducting, transparent and extremely strong and flexible—much of the interest in it is more fundamental. As a 2D conductor, graphene shows unusual electronic and magnetic properties that enable the study of quantum-mechanical effects of confinement and of correlations between electron motions—some of which might find applications in electronic devices. The excitement of this discovery was reflected in the award of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics to two pioneers in the field: Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov of the University of Manchester in the UK. This rich behavior is broadened still further when two graphene sheets are brought close enough to interact with one another. In particular, the electronic properties may then depend on the relative orientation of the sheets: how aligned the two ‘honeycomb’ lattices are. Two grids superimposed on one another may create ‘superlattices’: regularities at larger scales than the grid spacing, due to registry (commensurability) between the two at certain angles. This so-called moiré effect is sometimes evident for two closely spaced grid-like fences seen from afar. Experimentally exploring the electronic properties of such ‘twisted bilayer graphene’ requires an ability to precisely control the position and orientation of the two sheets. These phenomena are now recognized as generic to other 2D materials, such as hexagonal sheets of boron nitride. They have revealed a fertile playground for condensed-matter physics. In particular, striking electronic properties appear at certain ‘magic-angle’ twists of the layers. NSR spoke to two of the leading experts in the study of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG): experimentalist Pablo Jarillo-Herrero of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and theorist Allan MacDonald of the University of Texas at Austin.},

Transmission characteristics of Delta variant were analysed for 153 confirmed cases and two complete transmission chains with seven generations were fully presented. A rapid transmission occurred in five generations within 10 days. The basic reproduction number (R 0 ) was 3.60 (95% confidence interval: 2.50–5.30). After redefining the concept of close contact, the proportion of confirmed cases discovered from close contacts increased from 43% to 100%. With the usage of a yellow health code, the potential exposed individuals were self-motivated to take a nucleic acid test and regained public access with a negative testing result. Facing the massive requirement of screening, novel facilities like makeshift inflatable laboratories were promptly set up as a vital supplement and 17 cases were found, with 1 pre-symptomatic. The dynamic adjustment of these three interventions resulted in the decline of Rt from 5.00 to 1.00 within 9 days.

  abstract     = {Recent investigations have revealed that dynamics of complex networks and systems are crucially dependent on the temporal structures. Accurate detection of the time instant at which a system changes its internal structures has become a tremendously significant mission, beneficial to fully understanding the underlying mechanisms of evolving systems, and adequately modeling and predicting the dynamics of the systems as well. In real-world applications, due to a lack of prior knowledge on the explicit equations of evolving systems, an open challenge is how to develop a practical and model-free method to achieve the mission based merely on the time-series data recorded from real-world systems. Here, we develop such a model-free approach, named temporal change-point detection (TCD), and integrate both dynamical and statistical methods to address this important challenge in a novel way. The proposed TCD approach, basing on exploitation of spatial information of the observed time series of high dimensions, is able not only to detect the separate change points of the concerned systems without knowing, a priori, any information of the equations of the systems, but also to harvest all the change points emergent in a relatively high-frequency manner, which cannot be directly achieved by using the existing methods and techniques. Practical effectiveness is comprehensively demonstrated using the data from the representative complex dynamics and real-world systems from biology to geology and even to social science.},

We used scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to study the electron-doped copper oxide compound Sr 1− x Nd x CuO 2 , which has only bare cations separating the CuO 2 planes and thus the simplest infinite-layer structure of all cuprate superconductors. Tunneling conductance spectra of the major CuO 2 planes in the superconducting state revealed direct evidence for a nodeless pairing gap, regardless of variation of its magnitude with the local doping of trivalent neodymium. Furthermore, three distinct bosonic modes are observed as multiple peak-dip-hump features outside the superconducting gaps and their respective energies depend little on the spatially varying gaps. As well as the bosonic modes, with energies identical to those of the external, bending and stretching phonons of copper oxides, our findings reveal the origin of the bosonic modes in lattice vibrations rather than spin excitations.},

  abstract     = {In the spread of SARS-CoV-2, there have been multiple waves of replacement between strains, each of which having a distinct set of mutations. The first wave is a group of four mutations (C241T, C3037T, C14408T and A23403G [this being the amino acid change D614G]; all designated 0 to 1 below). This DG (D614G) group, fixed at the start of the pandemic, is the foundation of all subsequent waves of strains. Curiously, the DG group is absent in early Asian samples but present (and likely common) in Europe from the beginning. European data show that the high fitness of DG1111 requires the synergistic effect of all four mutations. However, the European strains would have had no time to evolve the four DG mutations (0 to 1), had they come directly from the early Asian DG0000 strain. Very likely, the European DG1111 strain had acquired the highly adaptive DG mutations in pre-pandemic Europe and had been spreading in parallel with the Asian strains. Two recent reports further support this twin-beginning interpretation. There was a period of two-way spread between Asia and Europe but, by May 2020, the European strains had supplanted the Asian strains globally. This large-scale replacement of one set of mutations for another has since been replayed many times as COVID-19 progresses.},

The terminally borne ovule is apparently acupulate (without cupule) and has four radially arranged wing-like integumentary lobes that are extensively fused, and folded lengthwise and inwards. Guazia provides evidence that not all Devonian seeds possess a cupule and it increases their diversity in integumentary lobes.

  abstract     = {Human bodily movements are primarily controlled by the contractions of skeletal muscles. Unlike joint or skeletal movements that are generally performed in the large displacement range, the contractions of the skeletal muscles that underpin these movements are subtle in intensity yet high in frequency. This subtlety of movement makes it a formidable challenge to develop wearable and durable soft materials to electrically monitor such motions with high fidelity for the purpose of, for example, muscle/neuromuscular disease diagnosis. Here we report that an intrinsically fragile ultralow-density graphene-based cellular monolith sandwiched between silicone rubbers can exhibit a highly effective stress and strain transfer mechanism at its interface with the rubber, with a remarkable improvement in stretchability (&gt;100%). In particular, this hybrid also exhibits a highly sensitive, broadband-frequency electrical response (up to 180 Hz) for a wide range of strains. By correlating the mechanical signal of muscle movements obtained from this hybrid material with electromyography, we demonstrate that the strain sensor based on this hybrid material may provide a new, soft and wearable mechanomyography approach for real-time monitoring of complex neuromuscular–skeletal interactions in a broad range of healthcare and human–machine interface applications. This work also provides a new architecture-enabled functional soft material platform for wearable electronics.},

Our novel observation of reflected body waves (e.g. P 410 P and P 660 P ) retrieved from ambient noise interferometry sheds new light on the massive foundered lithosphere currently near the bottom of the mantle transition zone beneath southeastern Tibet. By integrating the novel seismic and pre-existing geochemical observations, we highlight a linkage between massive lithospheric delamination shortly after the onset of hard collision and activation of continental extrusion along the Ailao Shan-Red River fault. This information provides critical insight into the early-stage evolution of the India-Asia collision in southeastern Tibet, which has significant implications for continental collision and its intracontinental response.},

  abstract     = {Behavioral plasticity and the underlying neuronal plasticity represent a fundamental capacity of animals to cope with environmental stimuli. Behavioral plasticity is controlled by complex molecular networks that act under different layers of regulation. While various molecules have been found to be involved in the regulation of plastic behaviors across species, less is known about how organisms orchestrate the activity of these molecules as part of a coherent behavioral response to varying environments. Here we discover a mechanism for the regulation of animal behavioral plasticity involving molecular sulfation in the brain, a modification of substrate molecules by sulfotransferase (ST)-catalyzed addition of a sulfonate group (SO 3 ) from an obligate donor, 3 ′ -phosphoadenosine 5 ′ -phosphosulfate (PAPS) to the substrates. We investigated aggregation behaviors of migratory locusts, which are well-known for extreme phase change plasticity triggered by population density. The processes of PAPS biosynthesis acted efficiently on induction of locust behavioral transition: Inhibition of PAPS synthesis solicited a behavioral shift from gregarious to solitarious states; external PAPS dosage, by contrast, promoted aggregation in solitarious locusts. Genetic or pharmacological intervention in the sulfation catalyzation resulted into pronounced solitarizing effects. Analysis of substrate-specific STs suggests a widespread involvement of sulfated neurotransmitters in the behavioral response. Dopamine in the brain was finally identified to be actively sulfate conjugated, and the sulfate conjugation enhanced the free DA-mediated behavioral aggregation. Similar results in Caenorhabditis elegans and mice indicate that sulfation may be involved more broadly in the modulation of animal aggregation. These findings reveal a general mechanism that effectively regulates animal social-like behavioral plasticity, possibly through sulfation-mediated modification of neural networks.},

Thus, it is necessary to determine dominating factors affecting the interannual variability of the carbon sink to improve our capability of predicting future terrestrial carbon sinks. Using global datasets derived from machine-learning methods and process-based ecosystem models, this study reveals that the interannual variability of the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was significantly negatively correlated with net ecosystem production (NEP) and substantially impacted the interannual variability of the atmospheric CO 2 growth rate (CGR). Further analyses found widespread constraints of VPD interannual variability on terrestrial gross primary production (GPP), causing VPD to impact NEP and CGR. Partial correlation analysis confirms the persistent and widespread impacts of VPD on terrestrial carbon sinks compared to other environmental variables. Current Earth system models underestimate the interannual variability in VPD and its impacts on GPP and NEP. Our results highlight the importance of VPD for terrestrial carbon sinks in assessing ecosystems’ responses to future climate conditions.},

  abstract     = {Ambipolar polymer semiconductors are potentially serviceable for logic circuits, light-emitting field-effect transistors (LFETs) and polymer solar cells (PSCs). Although several high-performance ambipolar polymers have been developed, their optoelectronic devices are generally processed from toxic chlorinated solvents. To achieve the commercial applications of organic FETs (OFETs), the polymers should be processed from nonchlorinated solvents, instead of chlorinated solvents. However, most conjugated polymers show poor solubility in nonchlorinated solvents. It is of great importance to develop ambipolar polymers that can be processed from nonchlorinated solvents. Here, we develop a nonchlorinated solvent processed polymer named poly[7-fluoro-N, N ′ -di(4-decyltetradecyl)-7 ′ -azaisoindigo-6 ′ ,6 ″ -(thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2,5-diyl)-7‴-fluoro-N ″ , N‴-di(4-decyltetradecyl)-7 ″ -azaisoindigo-6,6‴-([2,2 ″ -bithiophene]-5,5 ″ -diyl)] (PITTI-BT) by designing a monomer with a large molar mass. The polymer displays good solubility in p-xylene (PX). Well-aligned films of PITTI-BT are achieved by an off-center spin-coating (SC) method. Based on the high-quality films, the OFETs fabricated from PX solution achieve record ambipolar performance with hole and electron mobilities of 3.06 and 2.81 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , respectively. The combination of nonchlorinated solvents and good alignment process offers an effective and eco-friendly approach to obtain high-performance ambipolar transistors.},

In the large intestine, ‘endogenous’ I3C and DIM can form, respectively, from couplings of formaldehyde with one and two molecules of indole (a tryptophan catabolite).

The ferromagnetism in these 2D materials is microscopically revealed from p electrons of halogen atoms.

  abstract     = {CO 2 is an abundant and renewable C1 feedstock. Electrochemical transformation of CO 2 can integrate CO 2 fixation with renewable electricity storage, providing an avenue to close the anthropogenic carbon cycle. As a new type of green and chemically tailorable solvent, ionic liquids (ILs) have been proposed as highly promising alternatives for conventional electrolytes in electrochemical CO 2 conversion. This review summarizes major advances in the electrochemical transformation of CO 2 into value-added carbonic fuels and chemicals in IL-based media in the past several years. Both the direct CO 2 electroreduction (CO 2 ER) and CO 2 -involved electroorganic transformation (CO 2 EOT) are discussed, focusing on the effect of electrocatalysts, IL components, reactor configurations and operating conditions on catalytic activity, selectivity and reusability. The reasons for the enhanced CO 2 conversion performance by ILs are also discussed, providing guidance for the rational design of novel IL-based electrochemical processes for CO 2 conversion. Finally, the critical challenges remaining in this research area and promising directions for future research are proposed.},

  abstract     = {Ever since the University of Science and Technology of China started the Special Class for the Gifted Young in 1978, many Chinese universities have set up their own honor classes under different names such as Gifted Young Class, Basic Science Class, Experimental Class or Elite Class. These are often small classes; some emphasize mathematics and physics, aiming to cultivate talents with broad basic knowledge, while others focus on a particular discipline, such as computer science. In 2011, the Chinese Ministry of Education started the Experimental Program for the Cultivation of Top Talents in Basic Sciences, which boosted a new round of honor classes. How do these classes cultivate their students? Which kinds of special strategies are employed? Have they indeed fostered outstanding graduates? How did the students develop after graduation? On the other hand, are these classes a violation of the spirit of ‘equity in education’? Trying to answer these questions, in this NSR forum chaired by Professor Zhenjiang Hu, educators from four Chinese universities exchanged their experiences, views and perspectives on running the honor classes.

Using one of the largest prospective surgical cohorts for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with multi-region sampling, we sequenced whole genomes and paired transcriptomes from 67 HCC patients (331 samples). We found that while genomic ITH was rather constant across stages, phenotypic ITH had a very different trajectory and quickly diversified in stage II patients. Most strikingly, 30% of patients were found to contain more than one transcriptomic subtype within a single tumor. Such phenotypic ITH was found to be much more informative in predicting patient survival than genomic ITH and explains the poor efficacy of single-target systemic therapies in HCC. Taken together, we not only revealed an unprecedentedly dynamic landscape of phenotypic heterogeneity in HCC, but also highlighted the importance of studying phenotypic evolution across cancer types.},

In this work, by studying the catalytic functions of natural NADH oxidase (NOX), we devised and synthesized a porous carbon-supported cobalt catalyst (Co/C) to mimic NOX. The Co/C can catalyze dehydrogenation of NADH and transfers electrons to O 2 to produce H 2 O 2 . Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Co/C can catalyze O 2 reduction to H 2 O 2 or H 2 O considerably. The Co/C can also mediate electron transfer from NADH to heme protein cytochrome c, thereby exhibiting cytochrome c reductase-like activity. The Co/C nanoparticles can deplete NADH in cancer cells, induce increase of the reactive oxygen species, lead to impairment of oxidative phosphorylation and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, and cause ATP production to be damaged. This ‘domino effect’ facilitates the cell to approach apoptosis.},

Although these commonly used strategies can improve anode performance, they simultaneously induce specific issues. In this study, through the combination of structural design, interface modification, and electrolyte optimization, an ‘all-in-one’ (AIO) electrode was developed. Compared to the three-dimensional (3D) anode in routine liquid electrolytes, the new AIO electrode can greatly suppress gas evolution and the occurrence of side reactions induced by active water molecules, while retaining the merits of a 3D anode. Moreover, the integrated AIO strategy achieves a sufficient electrode/electrolyte interface contact area, so that the electrode can promote electron/ion transfer, and ensure a fast and complete redox reaction. As a result, it achieves excellent shelving-restoring ability (60 hours, four times) and 1200 cycles of long-term stability without apparent polarization. When paired with two common cathode materials used in ZIBs ( α -MnO 2 and NH 4 V 4 O 10 ), full batteries with the AIO electrode demonstrate high capacity and good stability. The strategy of the ‘all-in-one’ architectural design is enlightened to solve the issues of zinc anodes in advanced Zn-based batteries.},

A lack of precipitation, excessive snow melt and strong evaporation resulted in dry soil and exiguous spring vegetation. A super-strong Mongolian cyclone developed on the bare and loose ground, and easily blew and transported large amounts of sand particles into North China. Furthermore, top-ranking anomalies (sea ice shift in the Barents and Kara Sea, and sea surface temperatures in the east Pacific and northwest Atlantic) were found to induce the aforementioned tremendous climate anomalies in the dust source area. Analyses, based on large-ensemble Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, yield results identical to the reanalysis data. Thus, the climate variabilities at different latitudes and synoptic disturbances jointly facilitated the strongest spring sandstorm over the last decade.},

Herein, we designed a cascade-responsive ROS nanobomb (ZnO 2 @Ce6/CaP@CPPO/BSA, designated as Z@Ce6/CaP@CB) with domino effect and without external stimulation for the specific generation of multiple powerful ROS storms at the tumor site. The calcium phosphate shell and ZnO 2 core gradually degrade and release Ca 2+ , Zn 2+ and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) under acid stimulation. On the one hand, Zn 2+ can enhance the generation of endogenous superoxide anions (·O 2 – ) and H 2 O 2 through the inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. On the other hand, the generation of large amounts of exogenous H 2 O 2 can cause oxidative damage to tumor cells and further activate bis[2,4,5-trichloro-6-(pentyloxycarbonyl)phenyl] oxalate (CPPO)-mediated chemiexcited photodynamic therapy. In addition, the oxidative stress caused by the generated ROS can lead to the uncontrolled accumulation of Ca 2+ in cells and further result in Ca 2+ overload-induced cell death. Therefore, the introduction of Z@Ce6/CaP@CB nanobombs triggered the ‘domino effect’ that caused multiple heavy ROS storms and Ca 2+ overload in tumors and effectively activated anti-tumor immune response.},

  abstract     = {The recycling of supracrustal materials, and in particular hydrated rocks, has a profound impact on mantle composition and thus on the formation of continental crust, because water modifies the physical properties of lithological systems and the mechanisms of partial melting and fractional fractionation. On the modern Earth, plate tectonics offers an efficient mechanism for mass transport from the Earth&#39;s surface to its interior, but how far this mechanism dates back in the Earth&#39;s history is still uncertain. Here, we use zircon oxygen (O) isotopes to track recycling of supracrustal materials into the magma sources of early Archean igneous suites from the Kaapvaal Craton, southern Africa. The mean δ 18 O values of zircon from TTG (tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite) rocks abruptly increase at the Paleo-Mesoarchean boundary (ca. 3230 million years ago; Ma), from mantle zircon values of 5‰–6‰ to approaching 7.1‰, and this increase occurs in ≤3230 Ma rocks with elevated Dy/Yb ratios. The 18 O enrichment is a unique signature of low-temperature water–rock interaction on the Earth&#39;s surface. Because the later phase was emplaced into the same crustal level as the older one and TTG magmas would derive from melting processes in the garnet stability field (&gt;40 km depth), we suggest that this evident shift in TTG zircon O isotopic compositions records the onset of recycling of the mafic oceanic crust that underwent seawater hydrothermal alteration at low temperature. The onset of the enhanced recycling of supracrustal materials may also have developed elsewhere in other Archean cratons and reflects a significant change in the tectonic realm during craton formation and stabilization, which may be important processes for the operation of plate tectonics on early Earth.},

Here, we used whole-genome sequencing of 92 individuals with high coverage (30–60×) to systematically investigate genomic diversity in the Uyghurs living in Xinjiang, China (XJU), an admixed population of both European-like and East-Asian-like ancestry. The XJU population shows greater genetic diversity, especially a higher proportion of rare variants, compared with their ancestral source populations, corresponding to greater phenotypic diversity of XJU. Admixture-induced functional variants in EDAR were associated with the diversity of facial morphology in XJU. Interestingly, the interaction of functional variants between SLC24A5 and OCA2 likely influences the diversity of skin pigmentation. Notably, selection has seemingly been relaxed or canceled in several genes with significantly biased ancestry, such as HERC2 – OCA2 . Moreover, signatures of post-admixture adaptation in XJU were identified, including genes related to metabolism (e.g. CYP2D6 ), digestion (e.g. COL11A1 ), olfactory perception (e.g. ANO2 ) and immunity (e.g. HLA ). Our results demonstrated population admixture as a driving force, locally or globally, in shaping human genetic and phenotypic diversity as well as in adaptive evolution.},

Attributing past changes to causes provides a scientific foundation for national and international climate policies. Here, we review recent progress in attributing the observed climate changes over past decades in China. Anthropogenic forcings, dominated by greenhouse gas emissions, are the main drivers for observed increases in mean and extreme temperatures. Evidence of the effect of anthropogenic forcings on precipitation is emerging. Human influence has increased the probability of extreme heat events, and has likely changed the occurrence probabilities for some heavy precipitation events.

  abstract     = {The brain network is notably cost-efficient, while the fundamental physical and dynamic mechanisms underlying its economical optimization in network structure and activity have not been determined. In this study, we investigate the intricate cost-efficient interplay between structure and dynamics in biologically plausible spatial modular neuronal network models. We observe that critical avalanche states from excitation-inhibition balance under modular network topology with less wiring cost can also achieve lower costs in firing but with strongly enhanced response sensitivity to stimuli. We derive mean-field equations that govern the macroscopic network dynamics through a novel approximate theory. The mechanism of low firing cost and stronger response in the form of critical avalanches is explained as a proximity to a Hopf bifurcation of the modules when increasing their connection density. Our work reveals the generic mechanism underlying the cost-efficient modular organization and critical dynamics widely observed in neural systems, providing insights into brain-inspired efficient computational designs.},

  abstract     = {Iron-based superconductors have been identified as a novel platform for realizing Majorana zero modes (MZMs) without heterostructures, due to their intrinsic topological properties and high- T c superconductivity. In the two-dimensional limit, the FeTe 1− x Se x monolayer, a topological band inversion has recently been experimentally observed. Here, we propose to create MZMs by applying an in-plane magnetic field to the FeTe 1− x Se x monolayer and tuning the local chemical potential via electric gating. Owing to the anisotropic magnetic couplings on edges, an in-plane magnetic field drives the system into an intrinsic high-order topological superconductor phase with Majorana corner modes. Furthermore, MZMs can occur at the domain wall of chemical potentials at either one edge or certain type of tri-junction in the two-dimensional bulk. Our study not only reveals the FeTe 1− x Se x monolayer as a promising Majorana platform with scalability and electrical tunability and within reach of contemporary experimental capability, but also provides a general principle to search for realistic realization of high-order topological superconductivity.},

The underlying genetic architecture and evolutionary mechanism of these phenotypes remain a long-term mystery. We conducted whole genome deep sequencing of 81 Cambodian aborigines from eight ethnic groups. Through a genome-wide scan of selective sweeps, we discovered key genes harboring Cambodian-enriched mutations that may contribute to their phenotypes, including two hair morphogenesis genes ( TCHH and TCHHL1 ), one nasal morphology gene ( PAX3 ) and a set of genes (such as ENTPD1-AS1 ) associated with short stature. The identified new genes and novel mutations suggest an independent origin of the distinct phenotypes in Cambodian aborigines through parallel evolution, refuting the long-standing argument on the common ancestry of these phenotypes among the worldwide rainforest hunter-gatherers. Notably, our discovery reveals that various types of molecular mechanisms, including antisense transcription and epigenetic regulation, contribute to human morphogenesis, providing novel insights into the genetics of human environmental adaptation.},

The review discusses the Na-S-energy-storage chemistry, highlighting its promise, key challenges and potential strategies for large-scale energy storage systems. Specifically, we review the electrochemical principles and the current technical challenges of RT-Na-S batteries, and discuss the strategies to address these obstacles. In particular, we give a comprehensive review of recent progresses in cathodes, anodes, electrolytes, separators and cell configurations, and provide a forward-looking perspective on strategies toward robust high-energy-density RT-Na-S batteries.},

Fragments from the CE-5 regolith are classified into igneous clasts (mostly basalt), agglutinate and glass. A few breccias were also found. The minerals and compositions of CE-5 soils are consistent with mare basalts and can be classified as low-Ti/low-Al/low-K type with lower rare-earth-element contents than materials rich in potassium, rare earth element and phosphorus. CE-5 soils have high FeO and low Mg index, which could represent a new class of basalt.},

Here, by simulating the multi-scale cognitive observation process of humans, we design a scalable algorithm to detect clusters hierarchically hidden in massive datasets. The observation scale changes, following the Weber–Fechner law to capture the gradually emerging meaningful grouping structure. We validated our approach in real datasets with up to a billion records and 2000 dimensions, including taxi trajectories, single-cell gene expressions, face images, computer logs and audios.

Herein, we propose an in situ phase transitional strategy on vaccine manufacturing to maximally enhance lymph node drainage while ensuring adequate dendritic cell uptake. The phase transitional vaccines, with dynamic size modulation property, retain a small size (24.4 ± 3.1 nm) during lymph node draining then transform into larger particles (483.0 ± 41.6 nm) on-site by external signal input. Results show that this strategy induced rapid and robust immune response in a mouse melanoma tumor model. Furthermore, a stronger humoral immune response was observed in mice when immunized with MHC-II restricted antigen, which demonstrated that lymph node-targeted cancer vaccine delivery could be effectively manipulated through dynamic size modulation.},

Many materials are being researched for battery applications, with layered transition metal oxides (LTMO) the dominating cathode candidate with remarkable electrochemical performance. Yet, daunting challenges persist in the quest for further battery developments targeting lower cost, longer lifespan, improved energy density and enhanced safety. This is, in part, because of the intrinsic complexity of real-world batteries, featuring sophisticated interplay among microstructural, compositional and chemical heterogeneities, which has motivated tremendous research efforts using state-of-the-art analytical techniques. In this research field, synchrotron techniques have been identified as a suite of effective methods for advanced battery characterization in a non-destructive manner with sensitivities to the lattice, electronic and morphological structures. This article provides a holistic overview of cutting-edge developments in synchrotron-based research on LTMO battery cathode materials. We discuss the complexity and evolution of LTMO’s material properties upon battery operation and review recent synchrotron-based research works that address the frontier challenges and provide novel insights in this field. Finally, we formulate a perspective on future directions of synchrotron-based battery research, involving next-generation X-ray facilities and advanced computational developments.},

Carboxylate ligands are coordinated to the surface metal ions and the first monolayer of water molecules is found to bond to the carboxylate groups of alkanoate ligands through hydrogen bonds. Additional monolayer(s) of water molecules can further be adsorbed through hydrogen bonds to the first monolayer of water molecules. The nearly ideal environment for hydrogen bonding at the inorganic–organic interface of alkanoate-coated nanocrystals helps to rapidly and stably enrich the interface-bonded water molecules, most of which are difficult to remove through vacuum treatment, thermal annealing and chemical drying.

These adaptive phenotypes have been hypothesized to arise from a panda-unique single-nucleotide mutation in the dual-oxidase 2 ( DUOX2 ) gene, involved in thyroid hormone synthesis. To test this hypothesis, we created genome-edited mice carrying the same point mutation as the panda and investigated its effect on metabolic phenotype. Homozygous mice were 27% smaller than heterozygous and wild-type ones, had 13% lower body mass-adjusted food intake, 55% decreased physical activity, lower mass of kidneys (11%) and brain (5%), lower serum thyroxine (T4: 36%), decreased absolute (12%) and mass-adjusted (5%) daily energy expenditure, and altered gut microbiota. Supplementation with T4 reversed the effects of the mutation. This work uses a state-of-the-art genome editing approach to demonstrate the link between a single-nucleotide mutation in a key endocrine-related gene and profound adaptive changes in the metabolic phenotype, with great importance in ecology and evolution.},

  abstract     = {Widespread soil acidification due to atmospheric acid deposition and agricultural fertilization may greatly accelerate soil carbonate dissolution and CO 2 release. However, to date, few studies have addressed these processes. Here, we use meta-analysis and nationwide-survey datasets to investigate changes in soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stocks in China. We observe an overall decrease in SIC stocks in topsoil (0–30 cm) (11.33 g C m –2 yr –1 ) from the 1980s to the 2010s. Total SIC stocks have decreased by ∼8.99 ± 2.24% (1.37 ± 0.37 Pg C). The average SIC losses across China (0.046 Pg C yr –1 ) and in cropland (0.016 Pg C yr –1 ) account for ∼17.6%–24.0% of the terrestrial C sink and 57.1% of the soil organic carbon sink in cropland, respectively. Nitrogen deposition and climate change have profound influences on SIC cycling. We estimate that ∼19.12%–19.47% of SIC stocks will be further lost by 2100. The consumption of SIC may offset a large portion of global efforts aimed at ecosystem carbon sequestration, which emphasizes the importance of achieving a better understanding of the indirect coupling mechanisms of nitrogen and carbon cycling and of effective countermeasures to minimize SIC loss.},

Achieving this objective is challenging, due to the conflicting requirements of the localization necessary for the sizable band gap and delocalization necessary for a low charging energy. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy experiments and first-principles calculations, we realized exotic quinary charge states of solitary defects in two-dimensional intermetallic semiconductor Sn 2 Bi. We also observed an ultralow defect charging energy that increases sublinearly with charge number rather than displaying the usual quadratic behavior. Our work suggests a promising route for constructing multiple defect-charge states by designing intermetallic semiconductors, and opens new opportunities for developing quantum devices with charge-based quantum states.},

To reach a robust conclusion, independent probes with accuracy at percent levels are crucial. Gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence events can be formulated into the standard siren approach to provide an independent Hubble parameter measurement. The future space-borne gravitational wave observatory network, such as the LISA-Taiji network, will be able to measure the gravitational wave signals in the millihertz bands with unprecedented accuracy. By including several statistical and instrumental noises, we show that, within a five-year operation time, the LISA-Taiji network is able to constrain the Hubble parameter within |$1\%$| accuracy, and possibly beats the scatters down to |$0.5\%$| or even better.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic chemistry is the art of molecules. By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives. Among all chemical bonds, the carbon-hydrogen (C–H) bond is one of the most common, and is present in almost every organic compound. Breaking C–H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals—from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C–H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C–H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu (余金权) from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field. His group developed a number of C–H activation catalysts—often consisting of metal centers and elaborately designed ligands—that drastically shorten the synthesis steps of diverse functional molecules and provide high reactivity and selectivity. Here, Professor Yu discussed with NSR the interesting field of C–H activation, as well as sharing reflections on his own research.},

  abstract     = {Appropriate flowering time is critical for the reproductive success of plant species. Emerging evidence indicates that calcium may play an important role in the regulation of flowering time. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that calcium-dependent protein kinase 32 (CPK32) regulates flowering time by affecting the alternative polyadenylation of FLOWERING CONTROL LOCUS A ( FCA ) and altering the transcription of FLOWERING LOCUS C ( FLC ), a central repressor of flowering time. The knockdown of CPK32 results in an obvious late flowering phenotype and dramatically enhanced FLC transcription. CPK32 interacts with FCA, and phosphorylates the serine 592 of FCA in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner. Moreover, the ratio of abundance of the FCA transcripts ( FCA-D and FCA-P ) changes significantly in the cpk32 mutant, which subsequently affects FLC expression and consequently regulates floral transition. The present evidence demonstrates that CPK32 modulates flowering time by regulating FCA alternative polyadenylation and consequent FLC expression.},

Exploring new forms of carbon has been the eternal theme of scientific research. Herein, we report on amorphous (AM) carbon materials with a high fraction of sp 3 bonding recovered from compression of fullerene C 60 under high pressure and high temperature, previously unexplored. Analysis of photoluminescence and absorption spectra demonstrates that they are semiconducting with a bandgap range of 1.5–2.2 eV, comparable to that of widely used AM silicon. Comprehensive mechanical tests demonstrate that synthesized AM-III carbon is the hardest and strongest AM material known to date, and can scratch diamond crystal and approach its strength. The produced AM carbon materials combine outstanding mechanical and electronic properties, and may potentially be used in photovoltaic applications that require ultrahigh strength and wear resistance.},

A ‘cytokine storm’ in the lungs of H7N9 patients has been linked to a poor prognosis and death; however, the underlying mechanism that triggers the cytokine storm is unknown. Here, we found that efficient replication of the H7N9 virus in mouse lungs activates gasdermin E (GSDME)-mediated pyroptosis in alveolar epithelial cells, and that the released cytosolic contents then trigger a cytokine storm. Knockout of Gsdme switched the manner of death of A549 and human primary alveolar epithelial cells from pyroptosis to apoptosis upon H7N9 virus infection, and Gsdme knockout mice survived H7N9 virus lethal infection.

  abstract     = {We propose a theoretical mechanism and new coding strategy to realize extremely accurate manipulations of nonlinear electromagnetic harmonics in ultrawide frequency band based on a time-domain digital coding metasurface (TDCM). Using the proposed mechanism and coding strategy, we design and fabricate a millimeter-wave (mmWave) TDCM, which is composed of reprogrammable meta-atoms embedded with positive-intrinsic-negative diodes. By controlling the duty ratios and time delays of the digital coding sequences loaded on a TDCM, experimental results show that both amplitudes and phases of different harmonics can be engineered at will simultaneously and precisely in broad frequency band from 22 to 33 GHz, even when the coding states are imperfect, which is in good agreement with theoretical calculations. Based on the fabricated high-performance TDCM, we further propose and experimentally realize a large-capacity mmWave wireless communication system, where 256 quadrature amplitude modulation, along with other schemes, is demonstrated. The new wireless communication system has a much simpler architecture than the currently used mmWave wireless systems, and hence can significantly reduce the hardware cost. We believe that the proposed method and system architecture can find vast application in future mmWave and terahertz-wave wireless communication and radar systems.},

It has been a long-standing challenge to efficiently utilize dispersed vibration energy, especially within the high-frequency range, since the amplitudes of high-frequency vibrations in local parts of objects are relatively weak. Here, for the first time, we propose a soft and disordered hyperuniform elastic metamaterial (DHEM), achieving a remarkable concentration of vibrations in broad frequency bands by a maximum enhancement factor of ∼4000 at 1930 Hz. The DHEM, with rational sizes from ∼1 cm to ∼1000 cm, covers a broad range of frequencies from ∼10 Hz to ∼10 kHz, which are emitted by many vibration sources including domestic appliances, factories and transportation systems, for example. Moreover, the performance of the soft DHEM under deformation is validated, enabling conformal attachments on uneven objects. Our findings lay the groundwork for reducing traditional energy consumption by recovering some of the energy dissipated by devices in the working world.},

  abstract     = {Wear-free sliding between two contacted solid surfaces is the ultimate goal in the effort to extend the lifetime of mechanical devices, especially when it comes to inventing new types of micro-electromechanical systems where wear is often a major obstacle. Here we report experimental observations of wear-free sliding for a micrometer-sized graphite flake on a diamond-like-carbon (DLC) surface under ambient conditions with speeds up to 2.5 m/s, and over a distance of 100 km. The coefficient of friction (COF) between the microscale graphite flake, a van der Waals (vdW) layered material and DLC, a non-vdW-layered material, is measured to be of the order of 10 − 3 ⁠ , which belongs to the superlubric regime. Such ultra-low COFs are also demonstrated for a microscale graphite flake sliding on six other kinds of non-vdW-layered materials with sub-nanometer roughness. With a synergistic analysis approach, we reveal the underlying mechanism to be the combination of interfacial vdW interaction, atomic-smooth interfaces and the low normal stiffness of the graphite flake. These features guarantee a persistent full contact of the interface with weak interaction, which contributes to the ultra-low COFs. Together with the extremely high in-plane strength of graphene, wear-free sliding is achieved. Our results broaden the scope of superlubricity and promote its wider application in the future.},

However, little is known about how urban changes operate and affect environments across multiple scales. Focusing on China, we found urbanization was indeed massive from 2000 to 2015, but it was also very uneven, exhibiting high internal city dynamics. Urban areas in China as a whole became less green, warmer, and had exacerbated PM 2.5 pollution. However, environmental impacts differed in newly developed versus older areas of cities. Adverse impacts were prominent in newly urbanized areas, while old urban areas generally showed improved environmental quality. In addition, regional environmental issues are emerging as cities expand, connect and interact to form urban megaregions. To turn urbanization into an opportunity for, rather than an obstacle to, sustainable development, we must move beyond documenting urban expansion to understand the environmental consequences of both internal city dynamics and the formation of urban megaregions.},

  abstract     = {Cropland redistribution to marginal land has been reported worldwide; however, the resulting impacts on environmental sustainability have not been investigated sufficiently. Here we investigated the environmental impacts of cropland redistribution in China. As a result of urbanization-induced loss of high-quality croplands in south China (∼8.5 t ha –1 ), croplands expanded to marginal lands in northeast (∼4.5 t ha –1 ) and northwest China (∼2.9 t ha –1 ) during 1990–2015 to pursue food security. However, the reclamation in these low-yield and ecologically vulnerable zones considerably undermined local environmental sustainability, for example increasing wind erosion (+3.47%), irrigation water consumption (+34.42%), fertilizer use (+20.02%) and decreasing natural habitats (−3.11%). Forecasts show that further reclamation in marginal lands per current policies would exacerbate environmental costs by 2050. The future cropland security risk will be remarkably intensified because of the conflict between food production and environmental sustainability. Our research suggests that globally emerging reclamation of marginal lands should be restricted and crop yield boost should be encouraged for both food security and environmental benefits.},

  abstract     = {Cretaceous rift basin evolution was an important part of the tectonic history of northeast Asia in the late Mesozoic. Three types of rift basins are identified—active, passive and wide rift basins—and they developed in different regions. Passive rift basins in the eastern North China craton are thought to be the consequence of crustal stretching and passive asthenospheric upwelling. Wide rift basins in the eastern Central Asian orogen are assumed to originate from gravitational collapse of the thickened and heated orogenic crust. Active rift basins in the northern North China craton are attributed to uprising of asthenospheric materials along a lithospheric-scale tear fault. Slab tearing of the subducting paleo-Pacific plate is postulated and well explains the spatial distribution of different types of rift basins and the eastward shifting of magmatism in the northern North China craton. The Late Cretaceous witnessed a period of mild deformation and weak magmatism, which was possibly due to kinematic variation of the paleo-Pacific plate.},

Early research interest focused on the synthetic and structural chemistry of MCSC-based porous semiconductor materials with different cluster sizes/compositions and their applications in adsorption-based separation and optoelectronics. More recently, focus has shifted to the cluster chemistry of MCSCs to establish atomically precise structure–composition–property relationships, which are critical for regulating the properties and expanding the applications of MCSCs. Importantly, MCSCs are similar to II–VI or I–III–VI semiconductor nanocrystals (also called quantum dots, QDs) but avoid their inherent size polydispersity and structural ambiguity. Thus, discrete MCSCs, especially those that are solution-processable, could provide models for understanding various issues that cannot be easily clarified using QDs. This review covers three decades of efforts on MCSCs, including advancements in MCSC-based open frameworks (reticular chemistry), the precise structure–property relationships of MCSCs (cluster chemistry), and the functionalization and applications of MCSC-based microcrystals. An outlook on remaining problems to be solved and future trends is also presented.},

Here, we report a facile synthesis of a thermally stable atomically dispersed Ir/α-MoC catalyst with metal loading as high as 4 wt%, an unusually high value for carbide supported metal catalysts. The strong interaction between Ir and the α-MoC substrate enables high dispersion of Ir on the α-MoC surface, and modulates the electronic structure of the supported Ir species. Using quinoline hydrogenation as a model reaction, we demonstrate that this atomically dispersed Ir/α-MoC catalyst exhibits remarkable reactivity, selectivity and stability, for which the presence of high-density isolated Ir atoms is the key to achieving high metal-normalized activity and mass-specific activity. We also show that the water-promoted quinoline hydrogenation mechanism is preferred over the Ir/α-MoC, and contributes to high selectivity towards 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline. The present work demonstrates a new strategy in constructing a high-loading atomically dispersed catalyst for the hydrogenation reaction.},

As proof of concept, we also show that this system can be further applied in bioimaging, temperature measurement and HClO sensing.

Despite tremendous experimental efforts in the study of quantum error correction, to date, there has been no demonstration in the realisation of universal quantum error-correcting code, with the subsequent verification of all key features including the identification of an arbitrary physical error, the capability for transversal manipulation of the logical state and state decoding. To address this challenge, we experimentally realise the [5, 1, 3] code, the so-called smallest perfect code that permits corrections of generic single-qubit errors. In the experiment, having optimised the encoding circuit, we employ an array of superconducting qubits to realise the [5, 1, 3] code for several typical logical states including the magic state, an indispensable resource for realising non-Clifford gates. The encoded states are prepared with an average fidelity of 57.1 ( 3 ) % while with a high fidelity of 98.6 ( 1 ) % in the code space. Then, the arbitrary single-qubit errors introduced manually are identified by measuring the stabilisers. We further implement logical Pauli operations with a fidelity of 97.2 ( 2 ) % within the code space. Finally, we realise the decoding circuit and recover the input state with an overall fidelity of 74.5 ( 6 ) % ⁠ , in total with 92 gates. Our work demonstrates each key aspect of the [5, 1, 3] code and verifies the viability of experimental realisation of quantum error-correcting codes with superconducting qubits.},
