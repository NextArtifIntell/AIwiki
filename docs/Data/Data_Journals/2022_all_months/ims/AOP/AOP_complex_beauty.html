  abstract     = {The present work is devoted to the study of the large time behaviour of a critical Brownian diffusion in two dimensions, whose drift is divergence-free, ergodic and given by the curl of the 2-dimensional Gaussian free field. We prove the conjecture, made in (J. Stat. Phys. 147 (2012) 113–131), according to which the diffusion coefficient D(t) diverges as logt for t→∞. Starting from the fundamental work by Alder and Wainwright (Phys. Rev. Lett. 18 (1967) 988–990), logarithmically superdiffusive behaviour has been predicted to occur for a wide variety of out-of-equilibrium systems in the critical spatial dimension d=2. Examples include the diffusion of a tracer particle in a fluid, self-repelling polymers and random walks, Brownian particles in divergence-free random environments and, more recently, the 2-dimensional critical Anisotropic KPZ equation. Even if in all of these cases it is expected that D(t)∼logt, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first instance in which such precise asymptotics is rigorously established.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the phenomenon of duality for interacting particle systems, we introduce two classes of Pfaffian kernels describing a number of Pfaffian point processes in the “bulk” and at the “edge.” Using the probabilistic method due to Mark Kac, we prove two Szegő-type asymptotic expansion theorems for the corresponding Fredholm Pfaffians. The idea of the proof is to introduce an effective random walk with transition density determined by the Pfaffian kernel, express the logarithm of the Fredholm Pfaffian through expectations with respect to the random walk, and analyse the expectations using general results on random walks. We demonstrate the utility of the theorems by calculating asymptotics for the empty interval and noncrossing probabilities for a number of examples of Pfaffian point processes: coalescing/annihilating Brownian motions, massive coalescing Brownian motions, real zeros of Gaussian power series and Kac polynomials, and real eigenvalues for the real Ginibre ensemble.},

  abstract     = {We consider the classical Yaglom limit theorem for a branching Markov process X=(Xt,t≥0), with nonlocal branching mechanism in the setting that the mean semigroup is critical, that is, its leading eigenvalue is zero. In particular, we show that there exists a constant c(f) such that Law(⟨f,Xt⟩ t|⟨1,Xt⟩&gt;0)→ec(f),t→∞, where ec(f) is an exponential random variable with rate c(f) and the convergence is in distribution. As part of the proof, we also show that the probability of survival decays inversely proportionally to time. Although Yaglom limit theorems have recently been handled in the setting of branching Brownian motion in a bounded domain and superprocesses, (Probab. Theory Related Fields 173 (2019) 999–1062; Electron. Commun. Probab. 23 (2018) 42), these results do not allow for nonlocal branching which complicates the analysis. Our approach and the main novelty of this work is based around a precise result for the scaled asymptotics for the kth martingale moments of X (rather than the Yaglom limit itself). We then illustrate our results in the setting of neutron transport for which the nonlocality is essential, complementing recent developments in this domain (Ann. Appl. Probab. 30 (2020) 2573–2612; Ann. Appl. Probab. 30 (2020) 2815–2845; SIAM J. Appl. Math. 81 (2021) 982–1001; Cox et al. (2021); J. Stat. Phys. 176 (2019) 425–455).},

The regularity obtained is consistent with the optimal regularity derived for the deterministic porous medium equation in (J. Eur. Math. Soc. 23 (2021) 425–465, Anal.

We establish cutoff for the more general asymmetric riffle shuffles in which one cuts the deck into differently sized parts. The value of the cutoff point confirms a conjecture of Lalley from 2000 (Ann. Appl. Probab. 10 1302–1321). Some appealing consequences are that asymmetry always slows mixing and that total variation mixing is strictly faster than separation and L∞ mixing.},

Moreover, we give two different Cayley graphs of the same virtually free group such that the FUSF has infinitely many trees in one, but is connected in the other, answering a question of Lyons and Peres (Probability on Trees and Networks (2016) Cambridge Univ.

It is a system of N particles which move as independent Brownian motions in Rd and independently branch at rate 1, and, crucially, at each branching event, the particle which is the furthest away from the origin is removed to keep the population size constant. In the present work we prove that, as N→∞, the behaviour of the particle system is well approximated by the solution of a free boundary problem (which is the subject of a companion paper (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 374 (2021) 6269–6329)), the hydrodynamic limit of the system. We then show that for this model the so-called selection principle holds; that is, that as N→∞, the equilibrium density of the particle system converges to the steady-state solution of the free boundary problem.},

After showing that this latter property requires the chains to be upward skip-free, we first establish a gateway intertwining relation between the semigroup of such chains and the one of spectrally negative self-similar Markov processes on R+. As a by-product, we prove that each of these Markov chains, after an appropriate scaling, converge in the Skorohod metric to the associated self-similar Markov process. By a linear perturbation of the generator of these Markov chains, we obtain a class of ergodic Markov chains which are nonreversible. By means of intertwining relations and their strengthened interweaving versions, we derive several deep analytical properties of such ergodic chains, including the description of the spectrum, the spectral expansion of their semigroups and the study of their convergence to equilibrium in the Φ-entropy sense as well as their hypercontractivity property.},

Informally, viewing the graph of the Lévy excursion in the plane, each jump of the process is “cut open” and replaced by a circle, and then all points on the graph at equal height, which are not separated by a jump, are identified. We show that the shredded spheres arise as scaling limits of models of causal random planar maps with large faces introduced by Di Francesco and Guitter. We also establish that their Hausdorff dimension is almost surely equal to α. Point identification in the shredded spheres is intimately connected to the presence of decrease points in stable spectrally positive Lévy processes, as studied by Bertoin in the 1990s.},

The multinomial tiling model is a natural probability measure on such configurations (it is the uniform measure on standard tilings of the corresponding “blow-up” of G). In the limit of large multiplicities, we compute the asymptotic growth rate of the number of multinomial tilings. We show that the individual tile densities tend to a Gaussian field defined by an associated discrete Laplacian. We also find an exact discrete Coulomb gas limit when we vary the multiplicities. For tilings of Zd with translates of a single tile and a small density of defects, we study a crystallization phenomenon when the defect density tends to zero, and give examples of naturally occurring quasicrystals in this framework.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider coalescing random walks on a general connected graph G=(V,E). We set up a unified framework to study the leading order of the decay rate of Pt, the expectation of the fraction of occupied sites at time t, particularly for the ‘Big Bang’ regime where t≪tcoal:=E(inf{s:There is only one particle at time s}). Our results show that Pt satisfies certain ‘mean-field behaviors’ if the graphs satisfy certain ‘transience-like’ conditions. We apply this framework to two families of graphs: (1) graphs given by the configuration model whose degree distribution is supported in the interval [3,d¯] for some d¯≥3, and (2) finite and infinite transitive graphs. In the first case, we show that for 1≪t≪|V|, Pt decays in the order of t−1, and (tPt)−1 is approximately the probability that two particles starting from the root of the corresponding unimodular Galton–Watson tree never collide after one of them leaves the root. The number (tPt)−1 is also roughly |V|/(2tmeet), where tmeet is the mean meeting time of two independent walkers. By taking the local weak limit, we prove convergence of tPt as t→∞ for the corresponding unimodular Galton–Watson tree. For the second family of graphs, we consider a growing sequence of finite transitive graphs Gn=(Vn,En), satisfying that tmeet=O(|Vn|) and the inverse of the spectral gap trel is o(|Vn|). We show that trel≪t≪tcoal, (tPt)−1 is approximately the probability that two random walks never meet before time t, and it is also roughly |V|/(2tmeet). In addition, we define a natural ‘uniform transience’ condition, and show that in the transitive setup it implies the above estimates of tPt for all 1≪t≪tcoal. Estimates of tPt are also obtained for all infinite transient transitive unimodular graphs, in particular, all transient transitive amenable graphs.},

Integration by parts also allows us to deduce the density of this location in terms of the second derivative of the variance of the KPZ fixed point. In the stationary regime, we find the same density related to limit fluctuations of a second-class particle.

The stochastic process of gaps between the particles in the infinite Atlas model does not have a unique stationary distribution and in fact for every a≥0, πa:=⨂ i=1∞Exp(2+ia) is a stationary measure for the gap process. We say that an initial distribution of gaps is in the weak domain of attraction of the stationary measure πa if the time averaged laws of the stochastic process of the gaps, when initialized using that distribution, converge to πa weakly in the large time limit. We provide general sufficient conditions on the initial gap distribution of the Atlas particles for it to lie in the weak domain of attraction of πa for each a≥0. The cases a=0 and a&gt;0 are qualitatively different as is seen from the analysis and the sufficient conditions that we provide. Proofs are based on the analysis of synchronous couplings, namely, couplings of the ranked particle systems started from different initial configurations, but driven using the same set of Brownian motions.},

This model has originally been introduced to investigate the behavior of a homopolymer dipped in a poor solvent and adsorbed along a horizontal hard wall. It is known to undergo a collapse transition between an extended phase, inside which typical configurations of the polymer have a large horizontal extension (comparable to their total size), and a collapsed phase inside which the polymer looks like a globule. It is conjectured in the physics literature (see, e.g., (Phys. A, Stat. Mech. Appl. 318 (2002) 171) or (Phys. Rev. E 65 (2002) 056124)) that inside the collapsed phase, a surface transition occurs between an adsorbed-collapsed regime where the bottommost layer of the globule is pinned at the hard wall, and a desorbed-collapsed regime where the globule wanders away from the wall. In the present paper, we consider a simplified “single-bead” version of the model, for which we establish rigorously the existence of the surface transition and exhibit its associated critical curve. To that aim, we display some sharp asymptotics of the partition function of this simplified model within the collapsed phase.},

The presence of the substrate affects the interface at the spatial sites in which the interface height is close to zero. This corresponds to the Hamiltonian ∑x∈Zd(βωx+h)δx, where δx= 1[−1,1](ϕ(x)), and (ωx)x∈Zd is an i.i.d. centered field. A transition takes place when the average pinning potential h goes past a threshold hc(β): from a delocalized phase hhc(β) where the field sticks to the substrate. In (J. Eur. Math. Soc.

Here, we obtain the sharp critical behavior of the free energy approaching criticality: limu↘0 d(β,hc(β)+u) u2=1 2Var(eβω−λ(β)). Moreover, we give a precise description of the trajectories of the field in the same regime: to leading order as h↘hc(β) the absolute value of the field is 2σd2|log(h−hc(β))| except on a vanishing fraction of sites (σd2 is the single site variance of the free field).},

  abstract     = {Baxter permutations, plane bipolar orientations, and a specific family of walks in the nonnegative quadrant, called tandem walks, are well-known to be related to each other through several bijections. We introduce a further new family of discrete objects, called coalescent-walk processes and we relate it to the three families mentioned above. We prove joint Benjamini–Schramm convergence (both in the annealed and quenched sense) for uniform objects in the four families. Furthermore, we explicitly construct a new random measure on the unit square, called the Baxter permuton and we show that it is the scaling limit (in the permuton sense) of uniform Baxter permutations. In addition, we relate the limiting objects of the four families to each other, both in the local and scaling limit case. The scaling limit result is based on the convergence of the trajectories of the coalescent-walk process to the coalescing flow—in the terminology of Le Jan and Raimond (Ann. Probab. 32 (2004) 1247–1315)—of a perturbed version of the Tanaka stochastic differential equation.

  abstract     = {We explore the geometric meaning of the so-called zeta-regularized determinant of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on a compact surface, with or without boundary. We relate the (−c/2)th power of the determinant of the Laplacian to the appropriately regularized partition function of a Brownian loop soup of intensity c on the surface. This means that, in a certain sense, decorating a random surface by a Brownian loop soup of intensity c corresponds to weighting the law of the surface by the (−c/2)th power of the determinant of the Laplacian. Next, we introduce a method of regularizing a Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surface (with some matter central charge parameter c) to produce a smooth surface. And we show that weighting the law of this random surface by the (−c′/2)th power of the Laplacian determinant has precisely the effect of changing the matter central charge from c to c+c′. Taken together with the earlier results, this provides a way of interpreting an LQG surface of matter central charge c as a pure LQG surface decorated by a Brownian loop soup of intensity c. Building on this idea, we present several open problems about random planar maps and their continuum analogs. Although the original construction of LQG is well defined only for c≤1, some of the constructions and questions also make sense when c&gt;1.},

We also characterize the limiting multipoint statistics of the solution, when the points are chosen on appropriate scales, in similar terms.

  abstract     = {We show that, when one draws a simple conformal loop ensemble (CLEκ for κ∈(8/3,4)) on an independent κ-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surface and explores the CLE in a natural Markovian way, the quantum surfaces (e.g., corresponding to the interior of the CLE loops) that are cut out form a Poisson point process of quantum disks. This construction allows us to make direct links between CLE on LQG, (4/κ)-stable processes, and labeled branching trees. The ratio between positive and negative jump intensities of these processes turns out to be −cos(4π/κ) which can be interpreted as a “density” of CLE loops in the CLE on LQG setting. Positive jumps correspond to the discovery of a CLE loop (where the LQG length of the loop is given by the jump size) and negative jumps correspond to the moments where the discovery process splits the remaining to be discovered domain into two pieces. Some consequences of this result are the following: (i) It provides a construction of a CLE on LQG as a patchwork/welding of quantum disks. (ii) It allows us to construct the “natural quantum measure” that lives in a CLE carpet. (iii) It enables us to derive some new properties and formulas for SLE processes and CLE themselves (without LQG) such as the exact distribution of the trunk of the general SLEκ(κ−6) processes. The present work deals directly with structures in the continuum and makes no reference to discrete models, but our calculations match those for scaling limits of O(N) models on planar maps with large faces and CLE on LQG. Indeed, our Lévy-tree descriptions are exactly the ones that appear in the study of the large-scale limit of peeling of discrete decorated planar maps, such as in recent work of Bertoin, Budd, Curien and Kortchemski. The case of nonsimple CLEs on LQG is studied in another paper.},

These inequalities are applied to the statistical mechanics problem of estimating the fluctuations of random surfaces of the ∇φ type. The classical Brascamp–Lieb inequality bounds the fluctuations whenever the interaction potential is uniformly convex. We extend these bounds to the case of convex potentials whose second derivative vanishes only on a zero measure set, when the underlying graph is a d-dimensional discrete torus. The result applies, in particular, to potentials of the form U(x)=|x|p with p&gt;1 and answers a question discussed by Brascamp–Lieb–Lebowitz (In Statistical Mechanics (1975) 379–390, Springer). Additionally, new tail probability bounds are obtained for the family of potentials U(x)=|x|p+x2, p&gt;2. This result answers a question mentioned by Deuschel and Giacomin (Stochastic Process.

We establish estimates that depend on global parameters of the underlying function, which take into account analytic and statistical measures, such as the variance and the L1-norms of its partial derivatives. This leads to dimension-dependent bounds for small ball and lower small deviation estimates for seminorms when the linear structure is appropriately chosen to optimize the aforementioned parameters. Our bounds are best possible up to numerical constants. In all regimes, ‖G‖∞=maxi≤n|gi| arises as an extremal case in this study. The proofs exploit the convexity and hypercontractivity properties of the Gaussian measure.},

That is, for all s&gt;0 there is a deterministic exponential decay rate such that all mean-zero Hs passive scalars decay in H−s at this same rate with probability one. This is equivalent to what is known as quenched correlation decay for the Lagrangian flow in the dynamical systems literature. This is a follow-up to our previous work, which establishes a positive Lyapunov exponent for the Lagrangian flow—in general, almost-sure exponential mixing is much stronger than this. Our methods also apply to velocity fields evolving according to finite-dimensional models, for example, Galerkin truncations of Navier–Stokes or the Stokes equations with very degenerate forcing. For all 0≤k&lt;∞, this exhibits many examples of CtkCx∞ random velocity fields that are almost-sure exponentially fast mixers.},
