  abstract     = {We consider phylogeny estimation under a two-state model of sequence evolution by site substitution on a tree. In the asymptotic regime where the sequence lengths tend to infinity, we show that for any fixed k no statistically consistent phylogeny estimation is possible from k-mer counts over the full leaf sequences alone. Formally, we establish that the joint distribution of k-mer counts over the entire leaf sequences on two distinct trees have total variation distance bounded away from 1 as the sequence length tends to infinity. Our impossibility result implies that statistical consistency requires more sophisticated use of k-mer count information, such as block techniques developed in previous theoretical work.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by nanoscale growth of ultra-thin films, we study a model of deposition, on an interval substrate, of particles that perform Brownian motions until any two meet, when they nucleate to form a static island, which acts as an absorbing barrier to subsequent particles. This is a continuum version of a lattice model studied in the applied literature. We show that the associated interval-splitting process converges in the sparse deposition limit to a Markovian process (in the vein of Brennan and Durrett) governed by a splitting density with a compact Fourier series expansion but, apparently, no simple closed form. We show that the same splitting density governs the fixed deposition rate, large time asymptotics of the normalized gap distribution, so these asymptotics are independent of deposition rate. The splitting density is derived by solving an exit problem for planar Brownian motion from a right-angled triangle, extending work of Smith and Watson.},

  abstract     = {We study an optimal-control problem of polling systems with large switchover times, when a holding cost is incurred on the queues. In particular, we consider a stochastic network with a single server that switches between several buffers (queues) according to a pre-specified order, assuming that the switchover times between the queues are large relative to the processing times of individual jobs. Due to its complexity, computing an optimal control for such a system is prohibitive, and so we instead search for an asymptotically optimal control. To this end, we first solve an optimal control problem for a deterministic relaxation (namely, for a fluid model), that is represented as a hybrid dynamical system. We then “translate” the solution to that fluid problem to a binomial-exhaustive policy for the underlying stochastic system, and prove that this policy is asymptotically optimal in a large-switchover-time scaling regime, provided a certain uniform integrability (UI) condition holds. Finally, we demonstrate that the aforementioned UI condition holds in the following cases: (i) the holding cost has (at most) linear growth, and all service times have finite second moments; (ii) the holding cost grows at most at a polynomial rate (of any degree), and the service-time distributions possess finite moment generating functions.},

  abstract     = {This paper is to study the properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of high-dimensional sample correlation matrices. We first improve the result of Jiang (Sankhyā 66 (2004) 35–48), Xiao and Zhou (J. Theoret. Probab. 23 (2010) 1–20) and the Theorem 1 of El Karoui (Ann. Appl. Probab. 19 (2009) 2362–2405), both concerning the limiting spectral distribution and the extreme eigenvalues of sample correlation matrices, by allowing a more general fourth moment condition. Then, we establish a central limit theorem (CLT) for the linear statistics of the eigenvectors of large sample correlation matrices. We discover that the difference between the functional CLT of the sample covariance matrix and the sample correlation matrix is fundamentally influenced by the direction of a nonrandom projection vector. In the special case where the square root of the correlation matrix is identity, the difference will be determined by the sum of the fourth powers of the entries of the projection vector. These results also indicate that the eigenmatrix of sample correlation matrices is not asymptotically Haar if the underlying distribution is Gaussian. In other words, the normalization based on the sample variances affects the asymptotic properties of the eigenmatrix of the Wishart matrix. Furthermore, we establish a theorem concerning CLT for the linear statistics of the eigenvectors of large sample covariance matrices. This theorem improves the main results in Bai, Miao and Pan (Ann. Probab. 35 (2007) 1532–1572), which requires the assumption that the fourth moment of the underlying variable matches the one of Gaussian distribution, as well as Theorem 1.3 in Pan and Zhou (Ann. Appl. Probab. 18 (2008) 1232–1270), which relaxed the Gaussian like fourth moment requirement but assumes the maximum entries of the projection vector converge to 0 uniformly. We illustrate the usefulness of the theoretical results through an application in communications.},

We treat persistence diagrams as a point process and establish their limit theorems in the sparse regime: nrnd→0, n→∞. In this setting, we show that the asymptotics of the kth persistence diagram depends on the limit value of the sequence nk+2rnd(k+1). If nk+2rnd(k+1)→∞, the scaled persistence diagram converges to a deterministic Radon measure almost surely in the vague metric. If rn decays faster so that nk+2rnd(k+1)→c∈(0,∞), the persistence diagram weakly converges to a limiting point process without normalization. Finally, if nk+2rnd(k+1)→0, the sequence of probability distributions of a persistence diagram should be normalized, and the resulting convergence will be treated in terms of the M0-topology.},

The corresponding rate function is defined in terms of a family of auxiliary periodic spectral problems. It is shown that the corresponding Lagrangian is a convex function of velocity that has a superlinear growth at infinity. However, neither the Lagrangian nor the corresponding Hamiltonian need not be strictly convex, we only claim their strict convexity in some neighbourhood of infinity. It then depends on the profile of the generator kernel whether the Lagrangian is strictly convex everywhere or not.},

Various well-studied stochastic volatility models with and without self-exciting price/volatility co-jumps are obtained as special cases under different scaling regimes. We analyze the impact of external shocks on the market dynamics, especially their impact on jump cascades and show in a mathematically rigorous manner that many small external shocks may trigger endogenous jump cascades in asset returns and stock price volatility.},

The enumeration of root ancestral configurations—ancestral configurations at the species-tree root—assists in describing the complexity of gene-tree probability calculations in evolutionary biology. Assuming that the gene tree and species tree match in topology, we study the distribution of the number of root ancestral configurations of a random labeled tree topology under the uniform and Yule–Harding models. We employ analytic combinatorics, considering ancestral configurations in the context of additive tree parameters and using singularity analysis to evaluate asymptotic growth of the coefficients of generating functions. For both models, we obtain asymptotic lognormal distributions for the number of root ancestral configurations. For Yule–Harding random trees, we also obtain the asymptotic mean (∼1.425n) and variance (∼2.045n) of the number of root ancestral configurations, paralleling previous results for the uniform model (mean (4/3)n, variance ∼1.822n). A methodological innovation is that to obtain the Yule–Harding asymptotic variance, singularity analysis is conducted from the Riccati differential equation that the generating function satisfies—without possessing the generating function itself.},

  abstract     = {We propose and study a new model for competitions, specifically sports multi-player leagues where the initial strengths of the teams are independent i.i.d. random variables that evolve during different days of the league according to independent ergodic processes. The result of each match is random: the probability that a team wins against another team is determined by a function of the strengths of the two teams in the day the match is played. Our model generalizes some previous models studied in the physical and mathematical literature and is defined in terms of different parameters that can be statistically calibrated. We prove a quenched—conditioning on the initial strengths of the teams—law of large numbers and a quenched central limit theorem for the number of victories of a team according to its initial strength. To obtain our results, we prove a theorem of independent interest. For a stationary process ξ=(ξi)i∈Z&gt;0 satisfying a mixing condition and an independent sequence of i.i.d. random variables (si)i∈Z&gt;0, we prove a quenched—conditioning on (si)i∈Z&gt;0—central limit theorem for sums of the form ∑ i=1ng(ξi,si), where g is a bounded measurable function. We highlight that the random variables g(ξi,si) are not stationary conditioning on (si)i∈Z &gt;0.},

This yields a discrete-time stochastic process in t′≥t, called the distance evolution. We show that there is a tight strip around the function 4loglog(t)−log(log(t′/t)∨1)|log(τ−2)|∨2 that the distance evolution never leaves with high probability as t tends to infinity.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the performance of a bipartite network in which customers arrive at the nodes of the network, but not all nodes are able to serve their customers at all times. Each node can be either active or inactive, and two nodes connected by a bond cannot be active simultaneously. This situation arises in wireless random-access networks where, due to destructive interference, stations that are close to each other cannot use the same frequency band. We consider a model where the network is bipartite, the active nodes switch themselves off at rate 1 and the inactive nodes switch themselves on at a rate that depends on time and on which half of the bipartite network they are in. An inactive node cannot become active when one of the nodes it is connected to by a bond is active. The switching protocol allows the nodes to share activity among each other. In the limit as the activation rate becomes large, we compute the crossover time between the two states where one-half of the network is active and the other half is inactive. This allows us to assess the overall activity of the network depending on the switching protocol. Our results make use of the metastability analysis for hard-core interacting particle models on finite bipartite graphs derived in an earlier paper. They are valid for a large class of bipartite networks, subject to certain assumptions. Proofs rely on a comparison with switching protocols that are not time varying, through coupling techniques.},

Realizations of the random path measures Mr exhibit strong localization properties in comparison to their subcritical counterparts in which the diamond fractal has dimension less than two. Whereas two paths p,q∈Γ sampled independently using the pure measure μ have only finitely many intersections with probability one, a realization of the disordered product measure Mr×Mr a.s. assigns positive weight to the set of pairs of paths (p,q) whose intersection sets are uncountable but of Hausdorff dimension zero. We give a more refined characterization of the size of these dimension-zero sets using generalized (logarithmic) Hausdorff measures.

Both methods are based on the introduction of a suitable loss function defined over the parameters of a neural network. This allows the use of machine learning tools, and efficient implementations of stochastic gradient descent in order to perform the optimization. In the first method, the loss function stems directly from the optimal control problem. The second method tackles a generic forward-backward stochastic differential equation system (FBSDE) of McKean–Vlasov type, and relies on suitable reformulation as a mean field control problem. To provide a guarantee on how our numerical schemes approximate the solution of the original mean field control problem, we introduce a new optimization problem, directly amenable to numerical computation, and for which we rigorously provide an error rate. Several numerical examples are provided. Both methods can easily be applied to certain problems with common noise, which is not the case with the existing technology. Furthermore, although the first approach is designed for mean field control problems, the second is more general and can also be applied to the FBSDEs arising in the theory of mean field games.},

Our algorithm is memory-optimal, and outperforms existing algorithms in regimes when n is sufficiently large and the distortion parameter is sufficiently small. In particular, this confirms a conjecture of Ailon and Chazelle, and of Oliveira, in a stronger form. (2) The same construction gives a simple transform with optimal restricted isometry property (RIP) which can be applied in time O(dlogd) for essentially the same range of sparsity as in the best-known such transform due to Ailon and Rauhut. (3) We show that by fixing the angle in the Kac walk to be π/4 throughout, one obtains optimal JL and RIP transforms with almost the same running time, thereby confirming—up to a loglogd factor—a conjecture of Avron, Maymounkov, and Toledo.

In our extension we let two species affected by independent epidemics compete for space, and we allow the epidemic to attack not only giant clusters, but also clusters of smaller order. Our main results show that there are explicit parameter regions where either one species dominates or there is coexistence; this contrasts with the behavior of the model without epidemics, where the fitter species always dominates. We also discuss the survival and extinction regimes for the model with a single species. In both cases we prove convergence to explicit dynamical systems; simulations suggest that their orbits present chaotic behavior.},

  abstract     = {It is well known in biology that ants are able to find shortest paths between their nest and the food by successive random explorations, without any mean of communication other than the pheromones they leave behind them. This striking phenomenon has been observed experimentally and modelled by different mean-field reinforcement-learning models in the biology literature. In this paper, we introduce the first probabilistic reinforcement-learning model for this phenomenon. In this model, the ants explore a finite graph in which two nodes are distinguished as the nest and the source of food. The ants perform successive random walks on this graph, starting from the nest and stopping when they first reach the food; the transition probabilities of each random walk depend on the realizations of all previous walks through some dynamic weighting of the graph. We discuss different variants of this model based on different reinforcement rules and show that slight changes in this reinforcement rule can lead to drastically different outcomes. We prove that the ants indeed eventually find the shortest path(s) between their nest and the food in two variants of this model and when the underlying graph is, respectively, any series-parallel graph and a five-edge nonseries-parallel losange graph. Both proofs rely on the electrical network method for random walks on weighted graphs and on Rubin’s embedding in continuous time. The proof in the series-parallel cases uses the recursive nature of this family of graphs, while the proof in the seemingly simpler losange case turns out to be quite intricate: it relies on a fine analysis of some stochastic approximation, and on various couplings with standard and generalised Pólya urns.},

Second, we propose a new flavour of the algorithm adapted to high-dimensional reaction coordinates, for which the standard approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality. More precisely, the free energy is approximated by a sum of tensor products of one-dimensional functions. The consistency of the tensor approximation is established. Numerical experiments on five-dimensional reaction coordinates demonstrate that the method is indeed able to capture correlations between them.},

  abstract     = {Bifurcating Markov chains (BMC) are Markov chains indexed by a full binary tree representing the evolution of a trait along a population where each individual has two children. We provide a central limit theorem for general additive functionals of BMC, and prove the existence of three regimes. This corresponds to a competition between the reproducing rate (each individual has two children) and the ergodicity rate for the evolution of the trait. This is in contrast with the work of Guyon (Ann. Appl. Probab. 17 (2007) 1538–1569), where the considered additive functionals are sums of martingale increments, and only one regime appears. Our result can be seen as a discrete time version, but with general trait evolution, of results in the time continuous setting of branching particle system from Adamczak and Miłoś (Electron. J. Probab. 20 (2015) 42), where the evolution of the trait is given by an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process.},

  abstract     = {Ballistic annihilation is an interacting system in which particles placed throughout the real line move at preassigned velocities and annihilate upon colliding. The longstanding conjecture that in the symmetric three-velocity setting there exists a phase transition for the survival of middle-velocity particles was recently resolved by Haslegrave, Sidoravicius, and Tournier. We develop a framework based on a mass transport principle to analyze three-velocity ballistic annihilation with asymmetric velocities assigned according to an asymmetric probability measure. We show the existence of a phase transition in all cases by deriving universal bounds. In particular, all middle-speed particles perish almost surely if their initial density is less than 1/5, regardless of the velocities, relative densities, and spacing of initial particles. We additionally prove the continuity of several fundamental statistics as the probability measure is varied.},

  abstract     = {We give a definitive treatment of duality for optimal consumption over the infinite horizon, in a semimartingale incomplete market satisfying no unbounded profit with bounded risk (NUPBR). Rather than base the dual domain on (local) martingale deflators, we use a class of supermartingale deflators such that deflated wealth plus cumulative deflated consumption is a supermartingale for all admissible consumption plans. This yields a strong duality, because the enlarged dual domain of processes dominated by deflators is naturally closed, without invoking its closure. In this way, we automatically reach the bipolar of the set of deflators. We complete this picture by proving that the set of processes dominated by local martingale deflators is dense in our dual domain, confirming that we have identified the natural dual space. In addition to the optimal consumption and deflator, we characterise the optimal wealth process. At the optimum, deflated wealth is a supermartingale and a potential, while deflated wealth plus cumulative deflated consumption is a uniformly integrable martingale. This is the natural generalisation of the corresponding feature in the terminal wealth problem, where deflated wealth at the optimum is a uniformly integrable martingale. We use no constructions involving equivalent local martingale measures. This is natural, given that such measures typically do not exist over the infinite horizon and that we are working under NUPBR, which does not require their existence. The structure of the duality proof reveals an interesting feature compared with the terminal wealth problem. There, the dual domain is L1-bounded, but here the primal domain has this property, and hence many steps in the duality proof show a marked reversal of roles for the primal and dual domains, compared with the proofs of Kramkov and Schachermayer (Ann. Appl. Probab. 9 (1999) 904–950; Ann. Appl. Probab. 13 (2003) 1504–1516).},

A major portion of this article is devoted to the study of a particular growth-fragmentation process, or cell process, which is a type of piecewise-deterministic Markov process (PDMP). This process represents a linearized version of a size-biased sampling from the Ψ-process. We show that this PDMP is ergodic and develop the semigroup theory of it, to show that it describes a linearized version of the Ψ-process. This PDMP has appeared in other contexts, and in some sense we develop its theory under minimal assumptions.},

The interface is subject to two effects going in opposite directions. Contacts between the interface and the substrate are given an energetic bonus while an external force with constant intensity pulls the interface away from the wall. Our interface is modeled by the graph of a one-dimensional nearest-neighbor path on Z+, starting at 0 and ending at 0 after 2N steps, with the wall being the horizontal axis. At equilibrium each path ξ=(ξx)x=02N is given a probability proportional to λH(ξ)exp(σNA(ξ)), where H(ξ):=#{x:ξx=0} and A(ξ) is the area enclosed between the path ξ and the x-axis. We then consider the classical heat-bath dynamics which equilibrates the value of each ξx at a constant rate via corner-flip. Investigating the statics of the model, we derive the full phase diagram in λ and σ of this model, and identify the critical line which separates a localized phase where the pinning force sticks the interface to the wall and a delocalized one, for which the external force stabilizes ξ around a deterministic shape at a macroscopic distance of the wall. On the dynamical side, we identify a second critical line, which separates a rapidly mixing phase (for which the system mixes in polynomial time) to a slow phase where the mixing time grows exponentially. In this slowly mixing regime, we obtain a sharp estimate of the mixing time on the log scale, and provide evidences of a metastable behavior.},

Here the dimensionality of the space tends towards infinity and the target distribution is the multivariate standard normal distribution. For several quantities of interest (angular momentum, first coordinate and negative log-density) the scaling limits show qualitatively very different and rich behaviour. Based on these scaling limits the performance of the two algorithms in high dimensions can be compared. Although for angular momentum both processes require only a computational effort of O(d) to obtain approximately independent samples, the computational effort for negative log-density and first coordinate differ: for these BPS requires O(d2) computational effort whereas ZZ requires O(d). Finally we provide a criterion for the choice of the refreshment rate of BPS.},

We show that, under appropriate scaling, arms in SHL(0) converge to the graph of Brownian motion which has fractal dimension 3/2. Moreover we show that trees with n particles reach a height of order n2/3, corresponding to a numerical prediction of Meakin from 1983 for the gyration radius of DLA growing on a long line segment.},

Specifically, we propose an explicit tamed Euler and tamed Milstein scheme for an interacting particle system associated with the McKean–Vlasov equation. We prove stability and strong convergence of order 1/2 and 1, respectively. To obtain our main results, we employ techniques from calculus on the Wasserstein space. The proof for the strong convergence of the tamed Milstein scheme only requires the coefficients to be once continuously differentiable in the state and measure component. To demonstrate our theoretical findings, we present several numerical examples, including mean-field versions of the stochastic 3/2 volatility model and the stochastic double well dynamics with multiplicative noise.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the stability of traveling-pulse solutions to the stochastic FitzHugh–Nagumo equations with additive noise. Special attention is given to the effect of small noise on the classical deterministically stable fast traveling pulse. Our method is based on adapting the velocity of the traveling wave by solving a scalar stochastic ordinary differential equation (SODE) and tracking perturbations to the wave meeting a system of a scalar stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) coupled to a scalar ordinary differential equation (ODE). This approach has been recently employed by Krüger and Stannat (Nonlinear Anal. 162 (2017) 197–223) for scalar stochastic bistable reaction–diffusion equations such as the Nagumo equation. A main difference in our situation of an SPDE coupled to an ODE is that the linearization has essential spectrum parallel to the imaginary axis and thus only generates a strongly continuous semigroup. Furthermore, the linearization around the traveling wave is not self-adjoint anymore, so that fluctuations around the wave cannot be expected to be orthogonal in a corresponding inner product. We demonstrate that this problem can be overcome by making use of Riesz instead of orthogonal spectral projections as recently employed in a series of papers by Hamster and Hupkes in case of analytic semigroups. We expect that our approach can also be applied to traveling waves and other patterns in more general situations such as systems of SPDEs with linearizations only generating a strongly continuous semigroup. This provides a relevant generalization as these systems are prevalent in many applications.},

We develop exact formulas based on Gaussian integration by parts to relate the cumulants of the free energy, logZn,tθ, to expectations of products of quenched cumulants of the time of the first jump from the boundary into the system, s0. We then use these formulas to obtain estimates for the kth central moment of logZn,tθ as well as the kth annealed moment of s0 for k&gt;2, with nearly optimal exponents (1/3)k+ϵ and (2/3)k+ϵ, respectively. As an application, we derive new high probability bounds for the distance between the polymer path and a straight line connecting the origin to the endpoint of the path.},

The procedure is based on a median-of-means tournament, and is the first procedure that exhibits the optimal statistical performance in heavy tailed situations: we recover the asymptotic rates dictated by the central limit theorem in a nonasymptotic manner once the sample size exceeds some explicitly computable threshold. Additionally, our results apply in the high-dimensional setup, as the threshold sample size exhibits the optimal dependence on the dimension (up to a logarithmic factor). The general setting allows us to recover recent results on multivariate mean estimation and linear regression in heavy-tailed situations and to prove the first sharp, nonasymptotic results for the portfolio optimization problem.},

Interestingly, this power law is heavier than the tail of the limiting in-degree distribution, which goes against the commonly accepted power law hypothesis. This deviation from the power law hypothesis points at the structural differences between the inbound neighborhoods of typical vertices in a preferential attachment graph versus those in static random graph models where the power law hypothesis has been proven to hold (e.g., directed configuration models and inhomogeneous random digraphs). In addition to characterizing the PageRank distribution of a typical vertex, we also characterize the explicit growth rate of the PageRank of the oldest vertex as the network size grows.},

  abstract     = {We consider a nonlinear vertex-reinforced jump process (VRJP(w)) on Z with an increasing measurable weight function w:[1,∞)→[1,∞) and initial weights equal to one. Our main goal is to study the asymptotic behaviour of VRJP(w) depending on the integrability of the reciprocal of w. In particular, we prove that if ∫1∞duw(u)=∞ then the process is recurrent, that is, it visits each vertex infinitely often and all local times are unbounded. On the other hand, if ∫1∞duw(u)0 such that t↦w(t)ρ∫t∞duw(u) is nonincreasing then the process will eventually get stuck on exactly three vertices, and there is only one vertex with unbounded local time. We also show that if the initial weights are all the same, VRJP on Z cannot be transient, that is, there exists at least one vertex that is visited infinitely often. Our results extend the ones previously obtained by Davis and Volkov (Probab. Theory Related Fields 123 (2002) 281–300) who showed that VRJP with linear reinforcement on Z is recurrent.},

  abstract     = {Consider the motion of a Brownian particle in two or more dimensions, whose coordinate processes are standard Brownian motions with zero drift initially, and then at some random/unobservable time, one of the coordinate processes gets a (known) nonzero drift permanently. Given that the position of the Brownian particle is being observed in real time, the problem is to detect the time at which a coordinate process gets the drift as accurately as possible. We solve this problem in the most uncertain scenario when the random/unobservable time is (i) exponentially distributed and (ii) independent from the initial motion without drift. The solution is expressed in terms of a stopping time that minimises the probability of a false early detection and the expected delay of a missed late detection. To our knowledge this is the first time that such a problem has been solved exactly in the literature.},

  abstract     = {We study a single server queue operating under the shortest remaining processing time (SRPT) scheduling policy; that is, the server preemptively serves the job with the shortest remaining processing time first. Since one needs to keep track of the remaining processing times of all jobs in the system in order to describe the evolution, a natural state descriptor for an SRPT queue is a measure valued process in which the state of the system at a given time is the finite nonnegative Borel measure on the nonnegative real line that puts a unit atom at the remaining processing time of each job in system. In this work we are interested in studying the asymptotic behavior of the suitably scaled measure valued state descriptors for a sequence of SRPT queuing systems. Gromoll, Kruk and Puha (Stoch. Syst. 1 (2011) 1–16) have studied this problem under diffusive scaling (time is scaled by r2 and the mass of the measure normalized by r, where r is a scaling parameter approaching infinity). In the setting where the processing time distributions have bounded support, under suitable conditions, they show that the measure valued state descriptors converge in distribution to the process that at any given time is a single atom located at the right edge of the support of the processing time distribution with the size of the atom fluctuating randomly in time. In the setting where the processing time distributions have unbounded support, under suitable conditions, they show that the diffusion scaled measure valued state descriptors converge in distribution to the process that is identically zero. In Puha (Ann. Appl. Probab. 25 (2015) 3381–3404) for the setting where the processing time distributions have unbounded support and light tails, a nonstandard scaling of the queue length process is shown to give rise to a form of state space collapse that results in a nonzero limit. In the current work we consider the case where processing time distributions have finite second moments and regularly varying tails. Results of Puha (Ann. Appl. Probab. 25 (2015) 3381–3404) suggest that the right scaling for the measure valued process is governed by a parameter cr that is given as a certain inverse function related to the tails of the first moment of the processing time distribution. Using this parameter we consider a novel scaling for the measure valued process in which the time is scaled by a factor of r2, the mass is scaled by the factor cr/r and the space (representing the remaining processing times) is scaled by the factor 1/cr. We show that the scaled measure valued process converges in distribution (in the space of paths of measures). In a sharp contrast to results for bounded support and light tailed service time distributions, this time there is no state space collapse and the limiting measures are not concentrated on a single atom. Nevertheless, the description of the limit is simple and given explicitly in terms of a certain R+ valued random field which is determined from a single Brownian motion. Along the way we establish convergence of suitably scaled workload and queue length processes. We also show that as the tail of the distribution of job processing times becomes lighter in an appropriate fashion, the difference between the limiting queue length process and the limiting workload process converges to zero, thereby approaching the behavior of state space collapse.},

While a full answer to this question seems to be out of reach of the current techniques, we establish a regularization by a deterministic vector field. More precisely, we consider the vorticity form of the system perturbed by an additional transport type term. Such a perturbation conserves the enstrophy and therefore a priori it does not imply any smoothing. Our main result is a construction of a deterministic vector field v=v(t,x) which provides the desired regularization of the system and yields global well-posedness for large initial data outside arbitrary small sets. The proof relies on probabilistic arguments developed by Flandoli and Luo, tools from rough path theory by Hofmanová, Leahy and Nilssen and a new Wong–Zakai approximation result, which itself combines probabilistic and rough path techniques.},

At the discrete level, the construction relies on a new point of view on (discrete) inhomogeneous random graphs that involves an embedding into a Galton–Watson forest. The new representation allows us to demonstrate that a process that was already present in the pioneering work of Aldous [Ann. Probab. 25 (1997) 812–854] and Aldous and Limic [Electron. J. Probab. 3 (1998) 1–59] about the multiplicative coalescent actually also essentially encodes the limiting metric. The discrete embedding of random graphs into a Galton–Watson forest is paralleled by an embedding of the encoding process into a Lévy process which is crucial in proving the very existence of the local time functionals on which the metric is based; it also yields a transparent approach to compactness and fractal dimensions of the continuous objects. In a companion paper, we show that the continuous multiplicative graphs are indeed the scaling limit of inhomogeneous random graphs.},

The formal relation to the forward model is given via duality. To make the tree tractable, we prune branches upon mutations, thus reducing it to its informative parts. The hierarchies inherent in the tree are encoded systematically via tripod trees with weighted leaves; this leads to the stratified ancestral selection graph. The latter also satisfies a duality relation with the mutation–selection equation. Each of the dualities provides a stochastic representation of the solution of the differential equation. This allows us to connect the equilibria and their bifurcations to the long-term behaviour of the ancestral process. Furthermore, with the help of the stratified ancestral selection graph, we obtain explicit results about the ancestral type distribution in the case of unidirectional mutation.},

It is assumed that the underlying regime-switching process has countable states and is unobservable. The stochastic control problem is formulated under partial observations of asset prices and sequential default events. By establishing a martingale representation theorem based on incomplete and phasing out filtration, we connect the control problem to a quadratic BSDE with jumps, in which the driver term is nonstandard and carries the conditional filter as an infinite-dimensional parameter. By proposing some truncation techniques and proving uniform a priori estimates, we obtain the existence of a solution to the BSDE using the convergence of solutions associated to some truncated BSDEs. The verification theorem can be concluded with the aid of our BSDE results, which in turn yields the uniqueness of the solution to the BSDE.},

As a preliminary result we derive the new nonlinear stochastic Schrödinger equation, as the limit of the quantum filtering equation describing continuously observed and controlled system of a large number of interacting particles, the result that may have an independent value. We then show that to a control quantum system of interacting particles there corresponds a special system of classical interacting particles with the identical limiting MFG system, defined on an appropriate Riemanian manifold.

  abstract     = {We consider models of growing random trees {Tf(n):n≥1} with model dynamics driven by an attachment function f:Z+→R+. At each stage a new vertex enters the system and connects to a vertex v in the current tree with probability proportional to f(degree(v)). The main goal of this study is to understand the performance of root finding algorithms. A large body of work (e.g., Random Structures Algorithms 50 (2017) 158–172; IEEE Trans. Netw. Sci. Eng. 4 (2017) 1–12; Random Structures Algorithms 52 (2018) 136–157) has emerged in the last few years in using techniques based on the Jordan centrality measure (J. Reine Angew. Math. 70 (1869) 185–190) and its variants to develop root finding algorithms. Given an unlabeled unrooted tree, one computes the Jordan centrality for each vertex in the tree and for a fixed budget K outputs the optimal K vertices (as measured by Jordan centrality). Under general conditions on the attachment function f, we derive necessary and sufficient bounds on the budget K(ε) in order to recover the root with probability at least 1−ε. For canonical examples such as linear preferential attachment and uniform attachment, these general results give matching upper and lower bounds for the budget. We also prove persistence of the optimal K Jordan centers for any K, that is, the existence of an almost surely finite random time n∗ such that for n≥n∗ the identity of the K-optimal Jordan centers in {Tf(n):n≥n∗} does not change, thus describing robustness properties of this measure. Key technical ingredients in the proofs of independent interest include sufficient conditions for the existence of exponential moments for limits of (appropriately normalized) continuous time branching processes within which the models {Tf(n):n≥1} can be embedded, as well as rates of convergence results to these limits.},

  abstract     = {We consider a family of fractional Brownian fields {BH}H∈(0,1) on Rd, where H denotes their Hurst parameter. We first define a rich class of normalizing kernels ψ and we rescale the normalised field by the square-root of the gamma function Γ(H), such that the covariance of XH(x)=Γ(H)12(BH(x)−∫RdBH(u)ψ(u,x)du), converges to the covariance of a log-correlated Gaussian field when H↓0. We then use Berestycki’s “good points” approach (Electron. Commun. Probab. 22 (2017) Paper No. 27) in order to derive the convergence of the exponential measure of the fractional Brownian field MγH(dx)=eγXH(x)−γ22E[XH(x)2]dx, towards a Gaussian multiplicative chaos, as H↓0 for all γ∈(0,γ∗(d)), where γ∗(d)&gt; 7 4d. As a corollary we establish the L2 convergence of MγH over the sets of “good points”, where the field XH has a typical behaviour. As a by-product of the convergence result, we prove that for log-normal rough volatility models with small Hurst parameter, the volatility process is supported on the sets of “good points” with probability close to 1. Moreover, on these sets the volatility converges in L2 to the volatility of multifractal random walks.},

  abstract     = {We consider the supermarket model in the usual Markovian setting where jobs arrive at rate nλn for some λn&gt;0, with n parallel servers each processing jobs in its queue at rate 1. An arriving job joins the shortest among dn≤n randomly selected service queues. We show that when dn→∞ and λn→λ∈(0,∞), under natural conditions on the initial queues, the state occupancy process converges in probability, in a suitable path space, to the unique solution of an infinite system of constrained ordinary differential equations parametrized by λ. Our main interest is in the study of fluctuations of the state process about its near equilibrium state in the critical regime, namely when λn→1. Previous papers, for example, (Stoch. Syst. 8 (2018) 265–292) have considered the regime dn nlogn→∞ while the objective of the current work is to develop diffusion approximations for the state occupancy process that allow for all possible rates of growth of dn. In particular, we consider the three canonical regimes (a) dn/n→0; (b) d n/n→c∈(0,∞) and, (c) d n/n→∞. In all three regimes, we show, by establishing suitable functional limit theorems, that (under conditions on λ n) fluctuations of the state process about its near equilibrium are of order n−1/2 and are governed asymptotically by a one-dimensional Brownian motion. The forms of the limit processes in the three regimes are quite different; in the first case, we get a linear diffusion; in the second case, we get a diffusion with an exponential drift; and in the third case we obtain a reflected diffusion in a half space. In the special case dn/(nlogn)→∞, our work gives alternative proofs for the universality results established in (Stoch. Syst. 8 (2018) 265–292).},

These assumptions on the interaction seem to be sharp and cover quantum mechanical models like the Nelson model and the polaron problem with ultraviolet cut off (both carrying bounded spatial interactions with power law decay in time) as well as the Fröhlich polaron with a short range interaction in time but carrying Coulomb singularity in space. In this set up, we develop a unified approach for proving a central limit theorem for the rescaled process of increments for any coupling parameter and obtain an explicit expression for the limiting variance, which is strictly positive. As a further application, we study the solution of the multiplicative-noise stochastic heat equation in spatial dimensions d≥3. When the noise is mollified both in time and space, we show that the averages of the diffusively rescaled solutions converge pointwise to the solution of a diffusion equation whose coefficients are homogenized in this limit.},

Among the obtained results, we prove that the error between on the one hand the average of the Milstein scheme without Lévy area and its σ-antithetic version build on the finer grid, and on the other hand, the coarse approximation stably converges in distribution with a rate of order 1. We also prove that the error between the Milstein scheme without Lévy area and its σ-antithetic version stably converges in distribution with a rate of order 1/2. More precisely, we have a functional limit theorem on the asymptotic behavior of the joined distribution of these errors based on a triangular array approach (see, e.g., Jacod (In Séminaire de Probabilités, XXXI (1997) 232–246 Springer). Thanks to this result, we establish a central limit theorem of Lindeberg–Feller type for the antithetic MLMC estimator. The time complexity of the algorithm is analyzed.},

In this work, we consider (a) μN being the empirical measure of N-samples from μ, and the other case in which (b) μN is the empirical measure of marginal laws of the particle system of a McKean–Vlasov PDE (μt)t. The main result of this paper is to show that under suitable regularity conditions, we have |Φ(μ)−EΦ(μN)|=∑j=1k−1Cj Nj+O(1 Nk), for some positive constants C1,…,Ck−1 that do not depend on N, where k corresponds to the degree of smoothness. The case where the samples are i.i.d. is studied using functional derivatives on the space of measures. The case of particle systems relies on an Itô-type formula for the flow of probability measures and is intimately connected to PDEs on the space of measures, called the master equation in the literature of mean-field games. We state general regularity conditions required for each case and analyze the regularity in the case of functionals of the laws of McKean–Vlasov PDEs. Ultimately, this work reveals quantitative estimates of propagation of chaos for interacting particle systems. Furthermore, we are able to provide weak propagation of chaos estimates for ensembles of interacting particles and show that these may have some remarkable properties.},

  abstract     = {This work concerns the asymptotic behavior of solutions to a critical fluid model for a data communication network, where file sizes are generally distributed and the network operates under a fair bandwidth sharing policy, chosen from the family of (weighted) α-fair policies introduced by Mo and Walrand (IEEE/ACM Trans. Netw. 8 (2000) 556–567). Solutions of the fluid model are measure-valued functions of time. Under law of large numbers scaling, Gromoll and Williams (Ann. Appl. Probab. 19 (2009) 243–280) proved that these solutions approximate dynamic solutions of a flow level model for congestion control in data communication networks, introduced by Massoulié and Roberts (Telecommun. Syst. 15 (2000) 185–201). In a recent work (Stoch. Syst. 10 (2020) 251–273), we proved stability of the strictly subcritical version of this fluid model under mild assumptions. In the current work, we study the asymptotic behavior (as time goes to infinity) of solutions of the critical fluid model, in which the nominal load on each network resource is less than or equal to its capacity and at least one resource is fully loaded. For this we introduce a new Lyapunov function, inspired by the work of Kelly and Williams (Ann. Appl. Probab. 14 (2004) 1055–1083), Mulvany, Puha and Williams (Queueing Syst. 93 (2019) 351–397) and Paganini et al. (IEEE Trans. Automat. Control 57 (2012) 579–591). Using this, under moderate conditions on the file size distributions, we prove that critical fluid model solutions converge uniformly to the set of invariant states as time goes to infinity, when started in suitable relatively compact sets. We expect that this result will play a key role in developing a diffusion approximation for the critically loaded flow level model of Massoulié and Roberts (Telecommun. Syst. 15 (2000) 185–201). Furthermore, the techniques developed here may be useful for studying other stochastic network models with resource sharing.},

The main novelties are that we do not assume a Markovian nature of the game nor a particular structure of the information available to the players. This allows us to go beyond the variational methods (based on PDEs) developed in the literature on Dynkin games in continuous time with partial/asymmetric information. Instead, we focus on a probabilistic and functional analytic approach based on the general theory of stochastic processes and Sion’s min-max theorem (Pacific J. Math. 8 (1958) 171–176).

This extends previous results known for two time scale diffusions to two time scale mean-field models with jumps. Our proof is based on the method of stochastic exponentials. We characterise the rate function by studying a certain variational problem associated with an exponential martingale.},

  abstract     = {We study non-Markovian stochastic epidemic models (SIS, SIR, SIRS, and SEIR), in which the infectious (and latent/exposing, immune) periods have a general distribution. We provide a representation of the evolution dynamics using the time epochs of infection (and latency/exposure, immunity). Taking the limit as the size of the population tends to infinity, we prove both a functional law of large number (FLLN) and a functional central limit theorem (FCLT) for the processes of interest in these models. In the FLLN, the limits are a unique solution to a system of deterministic Volterra integral equations, while in the FCLT, the limit processes are multidimensional Gaussian solutions of linear Volterra stochastic integral equations. In the proof of the FCLT, we provide an important Poisson random measures representation of the diffusion-scaled processes converging to Gaussian components driving the limit process.},

We establish some explicit and sharp estimates of the spectral gap and logarithmic Sobolev constants uniform in the number of particles.

We add a polynomial drift to the corresponding stochastic differential equation to incorporate frequency-dependent selection. A decomposition of the drift allows us to approximate the solution of the stochastic differential equation by a sequence of Moran models. The genealogical structure underlying the Moran model leads in the large population limit to a generalisation of the ancestral selection graph of Krone and Neuhauser. Building on this object, we construct a continuous-time Markov chain and relate it to the forward process via a new form of duality, which we call Bernstein duality. We adapt classical methods based on the moment duality to determine the time to absorption and criteria for the accessibility of the boundaries; this extends a recent result by González Casanova and Spanò. An intriguing feature of the construction is that the same forward process is compatible with multiple backward models. In this context we introduce suitable notions for minimality among the ancestral processes and characterise the corresponding parameter sets. In this way we recover classic ancestral structures as minimal ones.},

While a Chernoff-type distribution is known to appear as the distributional limit in many nonregular statistical estimation problems, the accuracy of Chernoff-type approximations has remained largely unknown. In the present paper, we tackle this problem and derive Berry–Esseen bounds for Chernoff-type limit distributions in the canonical nonregular statistical estimation problem of isotonic (or monotone) regression. The derived Berry–Esseen bounds match those of the oracle local average estimator with optimal bandwidth in each scenario of possibly different Chernoff-type asymptotics, up to multiplicative logarithmic factors. Our method of proof differs from standard techniques on Berry–Esseen bounds, and relies on new localization techniques in isotonic regression and an anti-concentration inequality for the supremum of a Brownian motion with a Lipschitz drift.},

We highlight the crucial role of relaxed controls and randomization hypothesis for this class of models with respect to classical MDP theory. We prove the correspondence between CMKV-MDP and a general lifted MDP on the space of probability measures, and establish the dynamic programming Bellman fixed point equation satisfied by the value function, as well as the existence of ϵ-optimal randomized feedback controls.

If a call arrives to a link xy, connecting stations x and y, which is at capacity, then a third station z is chosen uniformly at random and the call is attempted to be routed via z: if both links xz and zy have spare capacity, then the call is held simultaneously on these two; otherwise the call is lost. We analyse an approximation of this model. We show rigorously that there are three phases according to the traffic intensity α:=λ/K: for α∈(0,αc)∪(1,∞), the system has mixing time logarithmic in the number of links n:=N2; for α∈(αc,1) the system has mixing time exponential in n, the number of links. Here αc:=13(5 10−13)≈0.937 is an explicit critical threshold with a simple interpretation. We also consider allowing multiple rerouting attempts. This has little effect on the overall behaviour; it does not remove the metastability phase. Finally, we add trunk reservation: in this, some number σ of circuits are reserved; a rerouting attempt is only accepted if at least σ+1 circuits are available. We show that if σ is chosen sufficiently large, depending only on α, not K or n, then the metastability phase is removed.},

In this system, the particles (“frogs”) hop over one another in the order given by their labels. Stripped of the labeling, the frog dynamics reduces to a variant of the PushTASEP. In the special case when all symbols of W are distinct, we obtain an explicit formula for the constant γW and a closed-form expression for the stationary distribution of the associated frog dynamics. In addition, we propose new conjectures about the asymptotic of the LCS of a pair of random words. These conjectures are informed by computer experiments using a new heuristic algorithm to compute the LCS. Through our computations, we found periodic words that are more random-like than a random word, as measured by the LCS.},

It forces these so-called “skew-Aztec rectangles” to have cuts on either side. For large sizes of the domain and upon an appropriate scaling of the location of the cuts, one finds split tacnodes between liquid regions with two distinct adjacent frozen phases descending into the tacnode. Zooming about such split tacnodes, filaments appear between the liquid patches evolving in a bricklike sea of dimers of another type. This work shows that the random fluctuations in a neighborhood of the split tacnode are governed asymptotically by the discrete tacnode kernel, providing strong evidence that this kernel is a universal discrete-continuous limiting kernel occurring naturally whenever we have doubly interlacing patterns.

  abstract     = {Large deviations for random graph models has been a topic of significant recent research activity. Much work in this area is focused on the class of dense random graph models (number of edges in the graph scale as n2, where n is the number of vertices) where the theory of graphons has emerged as a principal tool in the study of large deviation properties. These tools do not give a good approach to large deviation problems for random graph models in the sparse regime. The aim of this paper is to study an approach for large deviation problems in this regime by establishing large deviation principles (LDP) on suitable path spaces for certain exploration processes of the associated random graph sequence. Exploration processes are an important tool in the study of sparse random graph models and have been used to understand detailed asymptotics of many functionals of sparse random graphs, such as component sizes, surplus, deviations from trees, etc. In the context of rare event asymptotics of interest here, the point of view of exploration process transforms a large deviation analysis of a static random combinatorial structure to the study of a small noise LDP for certain stochastic dynamical systems with jumps. Our work focuses on one particular class of random graph models, namely the configuration model; however, the general approach of using exploration processes for studying large deviation properties of sparse random graph models has broader applicability. The goal is to study asymptotics of probabilities of nontypical behavior in the large network limit. The first key step for this is to establish a LDP for an exploration process associated with the configuration model. A suitable exploration process here turns out to be an infinite-dimensional Markov process with transition probability rates that diminish to zero in certain parts of the state space. Large deviation properties of such Markovian models is challenging due to poor regularity behavior of the associated local rate functions. Our proof of the LDP relies on a representation of the exploration process in terms of a system of stochastic differential equations driven by Poisson random measures and variational formulas for moments of nonnegative functionals of Poisson random measures. Uniqueness results for certain controlled systems of deterministic equations play a key role in the analysis. Next, using the rate function in the LDP for the exploration process we formulate a calculus of variations problem associated with the asymptotics of component degree distributions. The second key ingredient in our study is a careful analysis of the infinite-dimensional Euler–Lagrange equations associated with this calculus of variations problem. Exact solutions of these systems of nonlinear differential equations are identified which then provide explicit formulas for decay rates of probabilities of nontypical component degree distributions and related quantities.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a new model of correlated randomly growing graphs and study the fundamental questions of detecting correlation and estimating aspects of the correlated structure. The model is simple and starts with any model of randomly growing graphs, such as uniform attachment (UA) or preferential attachment (PA). Given such a model, a pair of graphs (G1,G2) is grown in two stages: until time t⋆ they are grown together (i.e., G1=G2), after which they grow independently according to the underlying growth model. We show that whenever the seed graph has an influence in the underlying graph growth model—this has been shown for PA and UA trees and is conjectured to hold broadly—then correlation can be detected in this model, even if the graphs are grown together for just a single time step. We also give a general sufficient condition (which holds for PA and UA trees) under which detection is possible with probability going to 1 as t⋆→∞. Finally, we show for PA and UA trees that the amount of correlation, measured by t⋆, can be estimated with vanishing relative error as t⋆→∞.},

  abstract     = {We study the mixing time of the Swendsen–Wang dynamics for the ferromagnetic Ising and Potts models on the integer lattice Zd. This dynamics is a widely used Markov chain that has largely resisted sharp analysis because it is nonlocal, that is, it changes the entire configuration in one step. We prove that, whenever strong spatial mixing (SSM) holds, the mixing time on any n-vertex cube in Zd is O(logn), and we prove this is tight by establishing a matching lower bound on the mixing time. The previous best known bound was O(n). SSM is a standard condition corresponding to exponential decay of correlations with distance between spins on the lattice and is known to hold in d=2 dimensions throughout the high-temperature (single phase) region. Our result follows from a modified log-Sobolev inequality, which expresses the fact that the dynamics contracts relative entropy at a constant rate at each step. The proof of this fact utilizes a new factorization of the entropy in the joint probability space over spins and edges that underlies the Swendsen–Wang dynamics, which extends to general bipartite graphs of bounded degree. This factorization leads to several additional results, including mixing time bounds for a number of natural local and nonlocal Markov chains on the joint space, as well as for the standard random-cluster dynamics.},

In a previous paper, the authors found that a certain averaging of height function differences at the rough-smooth interface converged to the extended Airy kernel point process. In this paper, we augment the local geometrical picture at this interface by introducing well-defined lattice paths which are closely related to the level lines of the height function. We show, after suitable centering and rescaling, that a point process from these paths converge to the extended Airy kernel point process provided that the natural parameter associated to the two-periodic Aztec diamond is small enough.},

  abstract     = {The classification of the long-term behavior of dynamical systems is a fundamental problem in mathematics. For both deterministic and stochastic dynamics specific classes of models verify Palis’ conjecture: the long-term behavior is determined by a finite number of stationary distributions. In this paper we consider the classification problem for stochastic models of interacting species. For a large class of three-species, stochastic differential equation models, we prove a variant of Palis’ conjecture: the long-term statistical behavior is determined by a finite number of stationary distributions and, generically, three general types of behavior are possible: 1) convergence to a unique stationary distribution that supports all species, 2) convergence to one of a finite number of stationary distributions supporting two or fewer species, 3) convergence to convex combinations of single species, stationary distributions due to a rock-paper-scissors type of dynamic. Moreover, we prove that the classification reduces to computing Lyapunov exponents (external Lyapunov exponents) that correspond to the average per-capita growth rate of species when rare. Our results stand in contrast to the deterministic setting where the classification is incomplete even for three-dimensional, competitive Lotka–Volterra systems. For these SDE models, our results also provide a rigorous foundation for ecology’s modern coexistence theory (MCT) which assumes the external Lyapunov exponents determine long-term ecological outcomes.},

For example, convex regression and log-concave density estimation are important topics in nonparametric statistics. In stochastic portfolio theory, concave functions on the unit simplex measure the concentration of capital, and their gradient maps define novel investment strategies. The gradient maps may also be regarded as optimal transport maps on the simplex. In this paper we construct and study probability measures supported on spaces of concave functions. These measures may serve as prior distributions in Bayesian statistics and Cover’s universal portfolio, and induce distribution-valued random variables via optimal transport. The random concave functions are constructed on the unit simplex by taking a suitably scaled (mollified, or soft) minimum of random hyperplanes. Depending on the regime of the parameters, we show that as the number of hyperplanes tends to infinity there are several possible limiting behaviors. In particular, there is a transition from a deterministic almost sure limit to a nontrivial limiting distribution that can be characterized using convex duality and Poisson point processes.},

An open problem from a 2009 paper of Angel, Holroyd, and Romik asks for the limiting distribution of the absorbing time of the process as the number of particles goes to infinity. We resolve this question by proving that this random variable satisfies GOE Tracy–Widom asymptotics. As a central ingredient of our proof, we reexamine a distributional identity relating the behavior of the oriented swap process to last passage percolation, conjectured in a recent paper of Bisi, Cunden, Gibbons, and Romik. We use a shift-invariance principle for multispecies TASEPs, obtained by exploiting recent results of Borodin, Gorin, and Wheeler for the stochastic colored six-vertex model, to prove a weakened form of the Bisi et al. conjectural identity, that is nonetheless sufficient for proving the asymptotic result for the absorbing time.},

Alfonsi, Corbetta and Jourdain (Ann. Inst. Henri Poincaré Probab. Stat. 56 (2020) 1706–1729) asked whether the same property is true for the martingale transport problem. This question seems particularly pressing since martingale transport is motivated by robust finance where data is naturally noisy. On a technical level, stability in the martingale case appears more intricate than for classical transport since martingale optimal transport plans are not characterized by a “monotonicity”-property of their supports. In this paper we give a positive answer and establish stability of the martingale transport problem. As a particular case, this recovers the stability of the left curtain coupling established by Juillet (In Séminaire de Probabilités XLVIII (2016) 13–32 Springer). An important auxiliary tool is an unconventional topology which takes the temporal structure of martingales into account. Our techniques also apply to the the weak transport problem introduced by Gozlan, Roberto, Samson and Tetali.},

  abstract     = {We consider sequences of U-processes based on symmetric kernels of a fixed order, that possibly depend on the sample size. Our main contribution is the derivation of a set of analytic sufficient conditions, under which the aforementioned U-processes weakly converge to a linear combination of time-changed independent Brownian motions. In view of the underlying symmetric structure, the involved time-changes and weights remarkably depend only on the order of the U-statistic, and have consequently a universal nature. Checking these sufficient conditions requires calculations that have roughly the same complexity as those involved in the computation of fourth moments and cumulants. As such, when applied to the degenerate case, our findings are infinite-dimensional extensions of the central limit theorems (CLTs) proved in de Jong (J. Multivariate Anal. 34 (1990) 275–289) and Döbler and Peccati (Electron. J. Probab. 22 (2017) Paper No. 2). As important tools in our analysis, we exploit the multidimensional central limit theorems established in Döbler and Peccati (Electron. J. Probab. 24 (2019) Paper No. 5) together with upper bounds on absolute moments of degenerate U-statistics by Ibragimov and Sharakhmetov (Studia Sci. Math. Hungar. 39 (2002) 251–275), and also prove some novel multiplication formulae for degenerate symmetric U-statistics—allowing for different sample sizes—that are of independent interest. We provide applications to random geometric graphs and to a class of U-statistics of order two, whose Gaussian fluctuations have been recently studied by Robins et al. (Stochastic Process. Appl. 126 (2016) 3733–3759), in connection with quadratic estimators in nonparametric models. In particular, our application to random graphs yields a class of new functional central limit theorems for subgraph counting statistics, extending previous findings in the literature. Finally, some connections with invariance principles in changepoint analysis are established.},

  abstract     = {A number of researchers have independently introduced topologies on the set of laws of stochastic processes that extend the usual weak topology. Depending on the respective scientific background this was motivated by applications and connections to various areas (e.g., Plug–Pichler—stochastic programming, Hellwig—game theory, Aldous—stability of optimal stopping, Hoover–Keisler—model theory). Remarkably, all these seemingly independent approaches define the same adapted weak topology in finite discrete time. Our first main result is to construct an adapted variant of the empirical measure that consistently estimates the laws of stochastic processes in full generality. A natural compatible metric for the adapted weak topology is the given by an adapted refinement of the Wasserstein distance, as established in the seminal works of Pflug–Pichler. Specifically, the adapted Wasserstein distance allows to control the error in stochastic optimization problems, pricing and hedging problems, optimal stopping problems, etcetera in a Lipschitz fashion. The second main result of this article yields quantitative bounds for the convergence of the adapted empirical measure with respect to adapted Wasserstein distance. Surprisingly, we obtain virtually the same optimal rates and concentration results that are known for the classical empirical measure wrt. Wasserstein distance.},

Every other vertex has the same bit value as its parent with probability 1−q and the opposite value with probability q, where q∈[0,1]. The broadcasting problem consists in estimating the value of the root bit upon observing the unlabeled tree, together with the bit value associated with every vertex. In a more difficult version of the problem, the unlabeled tree is observed but only the bit values of the leaves are observed. When the underlying tree is a uniform random recursive tree, in both variants of the problem we characterize the values of q for which the optimal reconstruction method has a probability of error bounded away from 1/2. We also show that the probability of error is bounded by a constant times q. Two simple reconstruction rules are analyzed in detail. One of them is the simple majority vote, the other is the bit value of the centroid of the tree. Most results are extended to linear preferential attachment trees as well.},

Specifically, we suppose that one observes an unknown ergodic process and one has access to a family of models consisting of dependent processes. In this context, we consider Gibbs posterior inference, which is a loss-based generalization of standard Bayesian inference. Our main results characterize the asymptotic behavior of the Gibbs posterior distributions on the space of models. Furthermore, we show that in the case of properly specified models our convergence results may be used to establish posterior consistency. Our model processes are defined via the thermodynamic formalism for dynamical systems, and they allow for a large degree of dependence, including both Markov chains of unbounded orders and processes that are not Markov of any order. This work establishes close connections between Gibbs posterior inference and the thermodynamic formalism for dynamical systems, which we hope will lead to new questions and results in both nonparametric Bayesian analysis and the thermodynamic formalism.},

The randomness of the coefficients comes from two aspects: the Brownian motion and the Markov chain. Using Itô’s lemma for Markov chain, we obtain the optimal state feedback control and optimal cost value explicitly via two new systems of extended stochastic Riccati equations (ESREs). We prove the existence and uniqueness of the two ESREs using tools including multidimensional comparison theorem, truncation function technique, log transformation and the John–Nirenberg inequality. These results are then applied to study mean-variance portfolio selection problems with and without short-selling prohibition with random parameters depending on both the Brownian motion and the Markov chain. Finally, the efficient portfolios and efficient frontiers are presented in closed forms.},

On the other hand, we study the zeros of random polynomials that appear to be closely related to the first model. Their behavior far from the origin is shown to depend only on the decaying properties of the probability measure generating the potential. A similar feature is observed for their behavior near the origin. Furthermore, in some cases, the appearance of outliers is observed, and the zeros of random polynomials and the Coulomb gases are seen to exhibit exactly the same behavior, which is related to the unweighted Bergman kernel.},

We give an explicit deterministic condition on the sequence of graphs such that, for any finite time and any initial condition, even dependent on the network, the empirical measure of the system stays close to the solution of the McKean–Vlasov equation associated to the classical mean field limit. Under this condition, we study the long time behavior in the subcritical and in the supercritical regime: in both regimes, the empirical measure stays close to the (possibly degenerate) manifold of stable stationary solutions, up to times which can diverge as fast as the exponential of the size of the system, before large deviation phenomena take over. The condition on the sequence of graphs is derived by means of Grothendieck’s inequality and expressed through a concentration in ℓ∞→ℓ1 norm. It is shown to be satisfied by a large class of graphs, random and deterministic, provided that the average number of neighbors per site diverges, as the size of the system tends to infinity.},

  abstract     = {Given a p-coin that lands heads with unknown probability p, we wish to produce an f(p)-coin for a given function f:(0,1)→(0,1). This problem is commonly known as the Bernoulli factory and results on its solvability and complexity have been obtained in (ACM Trans. Model. Comput. Simul. 4 (1994) 213–219; Ann. Appl. Probab. 15 (2005) 93–115). Nevertheless, generic ways to design a practical Bernoulli factory for a given function f exist only in a few special cases. We present a constructive way to build an efficient Bernoulli factory when f(p) is a rational function with coefficients in R. Moreover, we extend the Bernoulli factory problem to a more general setting where we have access to an m-sided die and we wish to roll a v-sided one; that is, we consider rational functions between open probability simplices. Our construction consists of rephrasing the original problem as simulating from the stationary distribution of a certain class of Markov chains—a task that we show can be achieved using perfect simulation techniques with the original m-sided die as the only source of randomness. In the Bernoulli factory case, the number of tosses needed by the algorithm has exponential tails and its expected value can be bounded uniformly in p. En route to optimizing the algorithm we show a fact of independent interest: every finite, integer valued, random variable will eventually become log-concave after convolving with enough Bernoulli trials.},

In the present work, we give a simpler proof, that works for all times and for all initial profiles for which the limit equation makes sense. In particular, the convexity assumption is dropped. The main new idea is a new viewpoint about “finite speed of propagation” that allows to bypass the need of a priori control of the interface gradients, or equivalently of inter-particle distances.},

However, results presented herein suggest that d&amp;m may be less useful in the emerging area of convergence complexity analysis, which is the study of how the convergence behavior of Monte Carlo Markov chains scales with sample size, n, and/or number of covariates, p. The problem appears to be that minorization can become a serious liability as dimension increases. Alternative methods of constructing convergence rate bounds (with respect to total variation distance) that do not require minorization are investigated. Based on Wasserstein distances and random mappings, these methods can produce bounds that are substantially more robust to increasing dimension than those based on d&amp;m. The Wasserstein-based bounds are used to develop strong convergence complexity results for MCMC algorithms used in Bayesian probit regression and random effects models in the challenging asymptotic regime where n and p are both large.},

Our main results show that the value function and the optimal trading strategy can be characterized by the solution to a semilinear PDE with superlinear gradient, monotone generator and singular terminal value. We also establish an asymptotic analysis of the robust model for small amounts of uncertainty and analyze the effect of robustness on optimal trading strategies and liquidation costs. In particular, in our model ambiguity aversion is observationally equivalent to increased risk aversion. This suggests that ambiguity aversion increases liquidation rates.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we introduce a generalization of the classical Pólya urn scheme (Ann. Inst. Henri Poincaré 1 (1930) 117–161) with colors indexed by a Polish space, say, S. The urns are defined as finite measures on S endowed with the Borel σ-algebra, say, S. The generalization is an extension of a model introduced earlier by Blackwell and MacQueen (Ann. Statist. 1 (1973) 353–355). We present a novel approach of representing the observed sequence of colors from such a scheme in terms an associated branching Markov chain on the random recursive tree. The work presents fairly general asymptotic results for this new generalized urn models. As special cases, we show that the results on classical urns, as well as, some of the results proved recently for infinite color urn models in (Bernoulli 23 (2017) 3243–3267; Statist. Probab. Lett. 92 (2014) 232–240), can easily be derived using the general asymptotic. We also demonstrate some newer results for infinite color urns.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by extreme value theory, max-linear Bayesian networks have been recently introduced and studied as an alternative to linear structural equation models. However, for max-linear systems the classical independence results for Bayesian networks are far from exhausting valid conditional independence statements. We use tropical linear algebra to derive a compact representation of the conditional distribution given a partial observation, and exploit this to obtain a complete description of all conditional independence relations. In the context-specific case, where conditional independence is queried relative to a specific value of the conditioning variables, we introduce the notion of a source DAG to disclose the valid conditional independence relations. In the context-free case, we characterize conditional independence through a modified separation concept, ∗-separation, combined with a tropical eigenvalue condition. We also introduce the notion of an impact graph, which describes how extreme events spread deterministically through the network and we give a complete characterization of such impact graphs. Our analysis opens up several interesting questions concerning conditional independence and tropical geometry.},
