  abstract     = {Abstract In recent years, the related research of entity alignment has mainly focused on entity alignment via knowledge embeddings and graph neural networks; however, these proposed models usually suffer from structural heterogeneity and the large-scale problem of knowledge graph. A novel entity alignment model based on graph isomorphic network and compressed sensing is proposed. First, for the problem of structural heterogeneity, graph isomorphic network encoder is applied in knowledge graph to capture structural similarity of entity relation. Second, for the problem of large scale, key node and community are integrated for priority entity alignment to improve execution speed. However, the exiting node importance ranking algorithm cannot accurately identify key node in knowledge graph. So the compressed sensing is adopted in node importance ranking to improve the accuracy of identifying key node. The authors have carried out several experiments to test the effect and efficiency of the proposed entity alignment model.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Image style transfer (IST) has drawn broad attention recently. At present, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods and generative adversarial network (GAN)-based methods have been broadly utilized in IST. However, the texture of images obtained by most methods presents a lower definition, which leads to insufficient details of IST. To this end, the authors present a new IST method based on an enhanced GAN with a prior circular local binary pattern (LBP). They utilize circular LBP in a GAN generator as a texture prior to improve the detailed textures of the generated style images. Meanwhile, they integrate a dense connection residual block and an attention mechanism into the generator to further improve high-frequency feature extraction. In addition, the total variation (TV) regularizer is integrated into the loss function to smooth the training results and restrain the noise. The qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the metric quality of the generated images can achieve better effects by the proposed strategy compared with other popular approaches.},

In this research work, the issue of food price rise and disease which was trending during the time of the investigation is considered. The novelty of the algorithm lies in the fact that it clusters the association rules without any prior knowledge. The findings from the experimentation suggest different factors impacting the rise of price in food items and diseases such as diabetes, flu, zika virus. The empirical results show the significant improvement when compared with Artificial Bees Colony, Cuckoo Search Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Ant Colony Optimization based clustering algorithms. The proposed method gives an improvement of 81% in terms of DB index, 79% in terms of silhouette index, 85% in terms of C index when compared to other algorithms.},

An ontology framework for images is created semi-automatically. SPARQL query is automatically generated from visual words and retrieve on ontology for semantics image.

Their technology paradigm is based on storing vast quantities of textual information enriched with metadata to support searchability. However, this exhibits limitations as it treats textual information as black box and is based exclusively on user-created metadata, a process that suffers from quality and completeness shortcomings. The use of knowledge graphs in DMS can substantially improve searchability, providing the ability to link data and enabling semantic searching. Recent approaches focus on either creating knowledge graphs from document collections or updating existing ones. In this paper, we introduce Doc2KG (Document-to-Knowledge-Graph), an intelligent framework that handles both creation and real-time updating of a knowledge graph, while also exploiting domain-specific ontology standards. We use DIAVGEIA (clarity), an award winning Greek open government portal, as our case-study and discuss new capabilities for the portal by implementing Doc2KG.},

A lot of research work has been conducted for detecting fake news using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. A large number of deep learning models and their architectural variants have been investigated and many websites are utilizing these models directly or indirectly to detect fake news. However, state-of-the-arts demonstrate the limited accuracy in distinguishing fake news from the original news. We propose a multi-channel deep learning model namely Mc-DNN, leveraging and processing the news headlines and news articles along different channels for differentiating fake or real news. We achieve the highest accuracy of 99.23% on ISOT Fake News Dataset and 94.68% on Fake News Data for Mc-DNN. Thus, we highly recommend the use of Mc-DNN for fake news detection.},

To this end, this paper proposes an improved semantic representation learning by multiple clustering approach, which improves the reliability of pseudo labels for 3D models, so as to achieve class-level semantic alignment. Specifically, this paper first extracts features for 2D images and 3D models.

The alignment-based method generates an alignment word space matrix (AWSM) for the snipped texts according to the generated semantic word spaces. Finally, the degree of sentence semantic similarity is measured using some proposed alignment rules. Four experiments were carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, using two different datasets. The experimental results proved that applying the lemmatization process for the input text and the vector model has a better effect. The degree of correctness of the results reaches 0.7212 which is considered one of the best two results of the published Arabic semantic similarities.},

Researchers put a great emphasis on categorizing the socioeconomic status (SES) of individuals to help predict various findings of interest. Forum uses, hashtags and chatrooms are common tools of conversations grouping. Crowdsourcing involves gathering intelligence to group online user community based on common interest. This paper provides a mechanism to look at writings on social media and group them based on their academic background. We analyzed online forum posts from various geographical regions in the US and characterized the readability scores of users. Specifically, we collected 10,000 tweets from the members of US Senate and computed the Flesch-Kincaid readability score. Comparing the Senators’ tweets to the ones from average internet users, we note 1) US Senators’ readability based on their tweets rate is much higher, and 2) immense difference among average citizen’s score compared to those of US Senators is attributed to the wide spectrum of academic attainment.},

In many of these domains, object recognition is being performed using 3D data against the difficulties posed by illumination, pose variation, scaling, etc present in 2D data. In this work, we propose three data augmentation techniques for 3D data in point cloud representation that use sub-sampling. We then verify that the 3D samples created through data augmentation carry the same information by comparing the Iterative Closest Point Registration Error within the sub-samples, between the sub-samples and their parent sample, between the sub-samples with different parents and the same subject, and finally, between the sub-samples of different subjects. We also verify that the augmented sub-samples have the same characteristics and features as those of the original 3D point cloud by applying the Central Limit Theorem.},

The paper addresses the issue of automatic generation of narratives using a modified transformer approach. Further, due to the unavailability of a relevant annotated dataset for development and testing, the authors also propose a verbalization template approach to generate the same. The input of the transformer is linearized to convert the data-to-text task into text-to-text task. The proposed work is evaluated on a verbalized explained PIMA Indians diabetes dataset and exhibits significant improvement as compared to existing baselines for both manual and automatic evaluation. Also, the narratives provide better comprehensibility to be trusted by human evaluators than the non-NLG counterparts.

Among respondents, 90% did believe that virtual reality technology can serve surgical training, and almost all respondents agreed that there is a gap in the existing neurosurgical training in terms of operating room ergonomics. Adequate education on surgical ergonomics might lead to an improvement in the outcomes for both surgeon and patient. The contribution of the paper is twofold.

The actual solution to this problem is ontology partitioning which is also challenging. This paper presents DeepOM, an ontology matching system to deal with this large-scale heterogeneity problem without partitioning using deep learning techniques. It consists on creating semantic embeddings for concepts of input ontologies using a reference ontology, and use them to train an auto-encoder in order to learn more accurate and less dimensional representations for concepts. The experimental results of its evaluation on large ontologies, and its comparison with different ontology matching systems which have participated to the same test challenge, are very encouraging with a precision score of 0.99. They demonstrate the higher efficiency of the proposed system to increase the performance of the large-scale ontology matching task.},

A huge and ever-increasing amount of information is available to researchers to address these challenges. Unfortunately, it is stored in fragmented ontologies and databases, which use heterogeneous formats and poorly integrated schemas. To overcome these limitations, we propose a linked data approach, based on the formalism of multilayer networks, able to integrate and harmonize biomedical information from multiple sources into a single dense network covering different aspects on Neuroendocrine Neoplasms (NENs). The proposed integration schema consists of three interconnected layers representing, respectively, information on the disease, on the affected genes, on the related biological processes and molecular functions. An easy-to-use client-server application was also developed to browse and search for information on the model supporting multilayer network analysis.},

Subsequently, the effective searching criteria are computed for finding the optimal service on the basis of fitness constraints. The searching criteria are formulated as optimization problems, which are tackled using CS. The proposed CS is designed by integrating CSO with the SSA such that the fitness function is evaluated for the optimal VM migration by considering several parameters, such as delay, cost, bandwidth, and load. Thus, the cloud manager will perform the migration of VM in cloud based on proposed CS-based VM migration approach. The performance of the CS-based VM migration is evaluated in terms of delay, cost, and load. The proposed CS-based VM migration method achieves the minimal delay of 0.146, minimal cost of 0.052, and the minimal load of 0.182.},

The expeditious surge in the collaborative environments, like IoT, cloud computing and SDN, have provided attackers with countless new avenues to benefit from the distributed nature of DDoS attacks. The attackers protect their anonymity by infecting distributed devices and utilizing them to create a bot army to constitute a large-scale attack. Thus, the development of an effective as well as efficient DDoS defense mechanism becomes an immediate goal. In this exposition, we present a DDoS threat analysis along with a few novel ground-breaking defense mechanisms proposed by various researchers for numerous domains. Further, we talk about popular performance metrics that evaluate the defense schemes. In the end, we list prevalent DDoS attack tools and open challenges.},

In order to validate the assumption that the entropy can boost the accuracy of density map generation, a multi-scale entropy map extraction process is imported into the front-end network along with a fine-tuned convolutional feature extraction process, In the back-end network, extracted features are decoded into the density map with a multi-column dilated convolution network. Finally, the decoded density map can be mapped as the estimated counting number. Experimental results indicate that the devised network is capable of accurately estimating the count in extremely high crowd density. Compared to similar structured networks which don’t adapt entropy feature, the proposed network exhibits higher performance. This result proves the feature of information entropy is capable of enhancing the efficiency of density map-based crowd counting approaches.},

Along this line, this paper proposes a scholar recommendation method based on the high-order propagation of knowledge graph (HoPKG), which analyzes the high-order semantic information in the knowledge graph, and generates richer entity representations to obtain users’ potential interest by distinguishing the importance of different entities. On this basis, a dual aggregation method of high-order propagation is proposed to enable entity information to be propagated more effectively.

Under this application, in most of the previously proposed works, networks are deployed without considering the heterogeneity and capacity of the various sensor nodes. This negligence leads to the problem of inefficient data delivery from the sensor nodes deployed on the pipeline to the surface sinks. In addition, the existing path planning algorithms do not consider the network coverage of heterogeneous sensor nodes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Obesity is one of the most pressing issues in society today. Virtual reality has been used in the design of tools that promotes obesity control. However, the design of current VR tools lacks the involvement of prospective users and health practitioners. Such engagement is crucial in gathering semantic information that identifies stakeholders’ needs and ensures that all aspects of health are considered. Therefore, this paper aims to study the sociodemographic factors and individual-level characteristics and preferences that make the design of any obesity-control VR tool effective and satisfactory for a wide range of users. The paper also aims to solicit opinions of health practitioners to identify best health aspects that should be available in the design of any VR tool for obesity control. Organizations, businesses, and people will be able to readily augment such VR technologies on the semantic web, as well as on personal and mobile devices.},

However, an informed consent request does not guarantee having individuals who are aware of what it means to consent and the implications that follow. Consent is often given blindly now, in particular because of information overload from long privacy policies written in legal language and complex interface designs that cause consent fatigue on the users&#39; side. This paper presents a knowledge graph-based user interface for consent solicitation, which uses gamification to raise the legal awareness and ease individual’s comprehension of consent. The knowledge graph models informed consent in a machine-readable format and provides a unified consent model to all entities involved in the data sharing process. The evaluation shows that with the help of gamification, the interface can raise individuals&#39; average legal awareness to 92.86%.},

  abstract     = {Abstract This paper solves the internet of things (IoT) security issues by introducing a chaotic whale crow (CWC) optimization, which is the integration of chaotic whale optimization algorithm (CWOA) in crow search algorithm (CSA). The framework operates on two crucial aspects: one is to select the secure nodes, and the other is to implement secure routing using the selected trusted nodes. First, the selection of trusted nodes is performed based on trust factors like direct, indirect, forwarding rate, integrity, and availability factors. Then, the selected trusted nodes are adapted for trust-based secure routing, which is optimally performed using the proposed CWC, based on the fitness parameters trust and energy. Finally, the proposed CWC is evaluated, which revealed high performance with a minimal delay of 191.46ms, which shows 14.87%, 7.35%, 6.82%, 4.19%, and 5.74% improved performance compared to existing LaSeR, PM Ipv6, secTrust-RPL RISA, and LSDAR techniques. Similarly, the proposed method obtained the maximal energy of 71.25J and maximal throughput of 129.77kbps.},

Since ontologies are represented as data models in a structured format, in this paper, a new modified model of similarity spreading for ontology mapping is proposed. In this approach, the mapping mainly involves with node clustering based on edge affinity, and then the graph matching is achieved by applying coefficient similarity propagation. This process is carried out by iterative manner, and at the end, the similarity score is calculated for iteration. This model is evaluated in terms of precision, recall, and f-measure parameters, and it is found that it outperforms similar systems.},

However, mainstream semantic inference engines cannot be applied to IoT computing devices with limited storage resources and weak computing power and cannot reason about uncertain knowledge. To solve this problem, the authors propose a lightweight semantic inference engine, Tiny-UKSIE, based on the RETE algorithm. The genetic algorithm (GA) is adopted to optimize the Alpha network sequence, and the inference time can be reduced by 8.73% before and after optimization. Moreover, a four-tuple knowledge representation method with probability factors is proposed, and probabilistic inference rules are constructed to enable the inference engine to infer uncertain knowledge. Compared with mainstream inference engines, storage resource usage is reduced by up to 97.37%, and inference time is reduced by up to 24.55%.},

Online education allows students to learn at their own pace and the system. As a consequence, we may say that education has become more dynamic. In the educational system, this changing nature makes user demands difficult to identify. Many instructors suggest using machine learning, artificial intelligence, or ontology to improve traditional teaching methods.

Moreover, a simulation model in which citizens interact to resolve conflicts by considering citizenship competences and conflict resolution styles is also introduced.

Results show that the higher interactions of citizens-conflicts, the higher level of citizenship competences, and the number of conflicts solved is higher when using citizenship competences.},

First, the neural network language model is used to learn the distributed vector representation of the fueling station; then, the average of all the station vectors in each trajectory is taken as the vector representation of the trajectory. Finally, the classic k-means algorithm is used to cluster the trajectory vectors.

In order to achieve an effective reduction for high-dimensional feature data, the NMIFS method is used to select the best feature combination. The best features are sent to the MOP- AQGA classifier for learning and training, and the intrusion detectors are obtained. The data are fed into the detection algorithm to ultimately generate accurate detection results.

There is a lack of a holistic solution for drug knowledge extraction. Moreover, current methods perform poorly in extracting fine-grained interaction relations from drug instructions. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an information extraction framework for drug instructions. The framework proposes deep learning models with fine-tuned pre-training models for entity recognition and relation extraction. In addition, it incorporates an novel entity pair calibration process to promote the performance for fine-grained relation extraction. The framework experiments on more than 60k Chinese drug description sentences from 4000 drug instructions. Empirical results show that the framework can successfully identify drug related entities (F1 3 0.95) and their relations (F1 3 0.83) from the realistic dataset, and the entity pair calibration plays an important role (~5% F1 score improvement) in extracting fine-grained relations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract The intrusion detection system (IDS) has lower speed, less adaptability and lower detection accuracy especially for small samples sets. This paper presents a detection model based on normalized mutual antibodies information feature selection and adaptive quantum artificial immune with cooperative evolution of multiple operators (NMAIFS MOP-AQAI). First, for a high intrusion speed, the NMAIFS is used to achieve an effective reduction for high-dimensional features. Then, the best feature vectors are sent to the MOP-AQAI classifier, in which, vaccination strategy, the quantum computing, and cooperative evolution of multiple operators are adopted to generate excellent detectors. Lastly, the data is fed into NMAIFS MOP-AQAI and ultimately generates accurate detection results. The experimental results on real abnormal data demonstrate that the NMAIFS MOP-AQAI has higher detection accuracy, lower false negative rate and a higher adaptive performance than the existing anomaly detection methods, especially for small samples sets.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Compared with traditional machine learning model, graph neural networks (GNNs) have distinct advantages in processing unstructured data. However, the vulnerability of GNNs cannot be ignored. Graph universal adversarial attack is a special type of attack on graph which can attack any targeted victim by flipping edges connected to anchor nodes. In this paper, we propose the forward-derivative-based graph universal adversarial attack (FDGUA). Firstly, we point out that one node as training data is sufficient to generate an effective continuous attack vector. Then we discretize the continuous attack vector based on forward derivative. FDGUA can achieve impressive attack performance that three anchor nodes can result in attack success rate higher than 80% for the dataset Cora. Moreover, we propose the first graph universal adversarial training (GUAT) to defend against universal adversarial attack. Experiments show that GUAT can effectively improve the robustness of the GNNs without degrading the accuracy of the model.},

On one hand it applies semantic technologies, providing a query service through a SPARQL Point, besides the reuse of shared data by exporting them in different formats. In this sense, it is also based on a European ontology or semantic standard such as CERIF, which facilitates its portability. On the other hand, CRIS also presents an alternative to the lack of a single data system by allowing data from different sources to be integrated and managed.},

A destination-source model works as a deterrent which is applied in the identification of smuggling and trafficking of illegal immigrants. The related results show that the employer penalty and market wage will influence the amount of smuggling and trafficking immigrants. Tax offered by legal unskilled workers at destination countries provides financial support for the inland monitoring of illegal immigrants. The improved SVM (supported vector machine) is proposed to study online textual data used for advertisement classification, with the purpose of discerning underlying human trafficking patterns on the network and recognizing suspicious advertisements, a concern of law-enforcement agencies.},

To further enhance the discriminant ability of feature vector generated by multidirectional shape index schemes, the weight of each block of images is also considered.

The framework accurately describes the elderly users through four dimensions—population, society, consumption, and health—and constructs the user portrait model by embedding tags. The embedded vector of each older man is learned through the deep learning model, and different feature groups are meaningfully expressed in the transformation space. In addition, location context and dynamic interest model are introduced to process embedded vectors, and users&#39; service preferences are predicted according to their dynamic behaviors.

Some of the sliced image features are lost, which results in conflicting network size and classification performance. This article uses key components in the transformer model to propose a new lightweight method, ensuring the lightness of the network and achieving highly accurate classification. First, the transformer model is imitated by using image patch input to enhance feature perception. Second, the Gaussian error linear unit (GELU), commonly used in transformer models, is used to enhance the generalization ability of the network. Finally, the network uses MRI slices as learning data. The depthwise separable convolution makes the network more lightweight. Experiments are carried out on the ADNI public database. The accuracy rate of AD vs. normal control (NC) experiments reaches 98.54%. The amount of network parameters is 1.3% of existing similar networks.},

The model uses ALBERT for migration pre-training and adds perturbation factors to the output matrix of the embedding layer to constitute local adversarial training. BILSTM is used to encode the shared and private features of the task, and the attention mechanism is introduced to capture the characters that focus more on the entities. Finally, the best entity annotation is obtained by CRF. Experiments are conducted on People&#39;s Daily 2004 and Tsinghua University open-source text classification datasets. The experimental results show that compared with the SOTA model, the F1 values of the proposed method in this paper are improved by 7.32 and 7.98 in the two different datasets, respectively, proving that the accuracy of the method in this paper is improved in the Chinese domain.},

However, existing convolutional neural networks have been unable to effectively solve this problem. Aiming at the above-mentioned fine-grained image classification problem, this paper proposes a multi-scale and multi-level ViT model. First, through data augmentation techniques, the accuracy of fine-grained image classification can be effectively improved. Secondly, the small-scale input and large-scale input of the model make the input image have more feature ex-pressions. The subsequent multi-layeredness effectively utilizes the results of the previous layer of ViT, so that the data of the previous layer can be more effectively used in the next layer of ViT. Finally, cross-attention allows the results of two scale inputs to be fused in a reasonable way. The proposed model is competitive with current mainstream state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.},
