  abstract     = {The Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) is the Earth’s largest store of frozen water; understanding how it changed in the past allows us to improve projections of how it, and sea levels, may change. Here, we use previous AIS reconstructions, water isotope ratios from ice cores, and simulator predictions of the relationship between the ice-sheet shape and isotope ratios to create a model of the AIS at the Last Glacial Maximum. We develop a prior distribution that captures expert opinion about the AIS, generate a designed ensemble of potential shapes, run these through the climate model HadCM3, and train a Gaussian process emulator of the link between ice-sheet shape and isotope ratios. To make the analysis computationally tractable, we develop a preferential principal component method that allows us to reduce the dimension of the problem in a way that accounts for the differing importance we place in reconstructions, allowing us to create a basis that reflects prior uncertainty. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo to sample from the posterior distribution, finding shapes for which HadCM3 predicts isotope ratios closely matching observations from ice cores. The posterior distribution allows us to quantify the uncertainty in the reconstructed shape, a feature missing in other analyses.},

  abstract     = {Product return data, such as warranty claims, are usually subject to two layers of right censoring. The first layer, called warranty censoring, applies to the product lifetime due to a fixed warranty limit. The second layer, called end-of-study censoring, applies to the sum of the sales lag and the lifetime due to the end-of-study date for the data collection. The two-layer censoring in the product return data renders traditional nonparametric methods for right-censored data inapplicable. This study develops a generic method for the two-layer censored data using acyclic phase-type distributions (APHDs) in the canonical form. The APHD estimators can be regarded as nonparametric sieve estimators since the family of APHDs is dense in the field of all positive-valued distributions. Based on the property that the class of APHDs is closed under convolution, a dedicated expectation-maximisation algorithm is proposed to compute the maximum likelihood estimators. Comprehensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method and compare it with the inverse probability of censoring weighted approach, which is applicable in the absence of warranty censoring. Two real examples from production-delivery supply chains are analysed by the proposed method to provide guidance on warranty reserve management for the manufacturers.},

We introduce an individual-based model for the epidemic, with the state of the model determining which individuals are colonised by the bacteria. The transmission rate of the epidemic takes into account both individuals’ locations, individuals’ covariates, seasonality, and environmental effects. The state of our model is only partially observed, with data consisting of test results from individuals from a sample of households. Fitting our model to data is challenging due to the large state space of our model. We develop an efficient SMC 2 algorithm to estimate parameters and compare models for the transmission rate. We implement this algorithm in a computationally efficient manner by using the scale invariance properties of the underlying epidemic model. Our motivating application focuses on the dynamics of community-acquired extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae , using data collected as part of the Drivers of Resistance in Uganda and Malawi project. We infer the parameters of the model and learn key epidemic quantities such as the effective reproduction number, spatial distribution of prevalence, household cluster dynamics, and seasonality.},

Key to these quantitative assessments is the ability to rapidly and robustly measure the speed with which an epidemic is growing or decaying. Frequently, epidemiological trends are addressed in terms of the (time-varying) reproductive number R . Here, we take a more parsimonious approach and calculate the exponential growth rate, r , using a Bayesian hierarchical model to fit a Gaussian process to the epidemiological data. We show how the method can be employed when only case data from positive tests are available, and the improvement gained by including the total number of tests as a measure of the heterogeneous testing effort. Although the methods are generic, we apply them to SARS-CoV-2 cases and testing in England, making use of the available high-resolution spatio-temporal data to determine long-term patterns of national growth, highlight regional growth, and spatial heterogeneity.},

Both model fit, and detection and classification accuracy of the proposed methods are evaluated on two real cases and a simulated dataset, and show promising results.},

It is implemented through a permutation test based on a test statistic obtained via a functional M -estimator. The performance of the RoFANOVA is demonstrated through an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study, where it is compared with some alternatives already presented in the literature, and a motivating real-case study related to the analysis of spatter ejections in an additive manufacturing process. The RoFANOVA method is implemented in the R package rofanova , available online on CRAN.},

  abstract     = {Networks of low-cost environmental sensors are becoming ubiquitous, but often suffer from poor accuracies and drift. Regular colocation with reference sensors allows recalibration but is complicated and expensive. Alternatively, the calibration can be transferred using low-cost, mobile sensors. However, inferring the calibration (with uncertainty) becomes difficult. We propose a variational approach to model the calibration across the network. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic and real air pollution data and find it can perform better than the state-of-the-art (multi-hop calibration). In Summary: The method achieves uncertainty-quantified calibration, which has been one of the barriers to low-cost sensor deployment.},

Our methods formulate complex longitudinal treatments with multiple start/stop switches as the recurrent events with discontinuous intervals of treatment eligibility. We derive the weights in continuous time to handle a complex longitudinal data set without the need to discretise or artificially align the measurement times. We further use machine learning models designed for censored survival data with time-varying covariates and the kernel function estimator of the baseline intensity to efficiently estimate the continuous-time weights. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods provide better bias reduction and nominal coverage probability when analysing observational longitudinal survival data with irregularly spaced time intervals, compared to conventional methods that require aligned measurement time points. We apply the proposed methods to a large-scale COVID-19 data set to estimate the causal effects of several COVID-19 treatments on the composite of in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission relative to findings from randomised trials.},

We leverage mark distributions justified by extreme-value theory, and specifically propose ‘sub-asymptotic’ distributions to flexibly model landslide sizes from low to high quantiles. The use of intrinsic conditional autoregressive priors, and a customised adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, allow for fast fully Bayesian inference. We show that sub-asymptotic mark distributions provide improved predictions of large landslide sizes, and use our model for risk assessment and hazard mapping.},

  abstract     = {In molecular biology, just as in many other fields of science, data often come in the form of matrices or contingency tables with many observations (rows) for a set of variables (columns). While projection methods like principal component analysis or correspondence analysis (CA) can be applied for obtaining an overview of such data, in cases where the matrix is very large the associated loss of information upon projection into two or three dimensions may be dramatic. However, when the set of variables can be grouped into clusters, this opens up a new angle on the data. We focus on the question of which observations are associated to a cluster and distinguish it from other clusters. CA employs a geometry geared towards answering this question. We exploit this feature in order to introduce Association Plots for visualizing cluster-specific observations in complex data. Regardless of the data matrix dimensionality Association Plots are two-dimensional and depict the observations associated to a cluster of variables. We demonstrate our method on two small data sets and then use it to study a challenging genomic data set comprising &gt;10,000 samples. We show that Association Plots can clearly highlight those observations which characterise a cluster of variables.},

  abstract     = {Sometimes classification tasks have to be based on multivariate time series data collected for each class. In these situations the data for each class might exhibit non-stationary behaviour together with complex dependence structures. We propose a vine copula-based approach to capture these features in each class before applying a Bayesian classifier. Vine copulas have been very successful in modelling asymmetric tail dependence among variables and are coupled with non-stationary univariate time series to model the multivariate time series data for each class. We illustrate this classification approach using data from a neural activity experiment using electroencephalography, where we want to classify the eye state. The level of neural activity was collected over time for multiple locations on the scalp. Our approach is able to identify relevant locations and allows for a model-based interpretation of the data generating process. A cross-validation study with comparison to competitor classifiers for this data set shows good performance of the proposed classifier.},

  abstract     = {In recent sequential multiple assignment randomized trials, outcomes were assessed multiple times to evaluate longer-term impacts of the dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs). Q-learning requires a scalar response to identify the optimal DTR. Inverse probability weighting may be used to estimate the optimal outcome trajectory, but it is inefficient, susceptible to model mis-specification, and unable to characterize how treatment effects manifest over time. We propose modified Q-learning with generalized estimating equations to address these limitations and apply it to the M-bridge trial, which evaluates adaptive interventions to prevent problematic drinking among college freshmen. Simulation studies demonstrate our proposed method improves efficiency and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Identification of taxa can significantly be assisted by statistical classification based on trait measurements either individually or by phylogenetic (clustering) methods. In this article, we present a general Bayesian approach for classifying species individually based on measurements of a mixture of continuous and ordinal traits, and any type of covariates. The trait vector is derived from a latent variable with a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Decision rules based on supervised learning are presented that estimate model parameters through blocked Gibbs sampling. These decision regions allow for uncertainty (partial rejection), so that not necessarily one specific category (taxon) is output when new subjects are classified, but rather a set of categories including the most probable taxa. This type of discriminant analysis employs reward functions with a set-valued input argument, so that an optimal Bayes classifier can be defined. We also present a way of safeguarding against outlying new observations, using an analogue of a p -value within our Bayesian setting. We refer to our Bayesian set-valued classifier as the Karlsson–Hössjer method, and it is illustrated on an original ornithological data set of birds. We also incorporate model selection through cross-validation, exemplified on another original data set of birds.},

We use supervised autoencoders (SAEs) to improve predictive performance in this context, describe the conditions where SAEs improve predictions, and provide modelling constraints to ensure biological relevance. We experimentally validate our approach by finding a network associated with stress that aligns with a previous stimulation protocol and characterizing a genotype associated with bipolar disorder.},

This work is motivated by an interest in determining the causal impact of directly observed therapy on the successful treatment of Tuberculosis. We focus on propensity score regression and covariate adjustment to balance the treatment allocation. We discuss the need to include latent local-level random effects in the propensity score model to reduce bias in the estimation of causal effects. A simulation study suggests that accounting for the multilevel nature of the data with latent structures in both the outcome and propensity score models has the potential to reduce bias in the estimation of causal effects.},

These nodal centralities together encode different connectivity profiles in the brain network. Nodal attributes may be grouped together for each node, motivating us to introduce group sparsity for feature selection, and radial basis function (RBF)-nets are used to quantify the regression effects. An efficient computation algorithm is developed. Applying our proposed method to Human Connectome Project data, we obtain several interesting findings related to cognitive functioning.},

  abstract     = {Statistical extreme value models allow estimation of the frequency, magnitude, and spatio-temporal extent of extreme temperature events in the presence of climate change. Unfortunately, the assumptions of many standard methods are not valid for complex environmental data sets, with a realistic statistical model requiring appropriate incorporation of scientific context. We examine two case studies in which the application of routine extreme value methods result in inappropriate models and inaccurate predictions. In the first scenario, incorporating random effects reflects shifts in unobserved climatic drivers that led to record-breaking US temperatures in 2021, permitting greater accuracy in return period prediction. In scenario two, a Gaussian mixture model fit to ice surface temperatures in Greenland improves fit and predictive abilities, especially in the poorly-defined upper tail around 0 ∘ C.},

Buildings hit by pluvial flooding is a key manifestation of this risk, giving rise to compensations for the induced physical damages and business interruptions. In this work, we establish a nationwide, building-specific risk score for water damage associated with pluvial flooding in Norway. We fit a generalised additive model that relates the number of water damages to a wide range of explanatory variables that can be categorised into building attributes, climatological variables, and topographical characteristics. The model assigns a risk score to every location in Norway, based on local topography and climate, which is not only useful for insurance companies but also for city planning. Combining our model with an ensemble of climate projections allows us to project the (spatially varying) impacts of climate change on the risk of pluvial flooding towards the middle and end of the 21st century.},

Adding a few four-level factors allows for the inclusion of multi-level categorical factors or quantitative factors with possible quadratic or third-order effects. Three examples motivated us to generate a large catalogue of designs with two-level factors as well as four-level factors. To create the catalogue, we considered three methods. In the first method, we select designs using a search table, and in the second method, we use a procedure that selects candidate designs based on the properties of their projections into fewer factors. The third method is actually a benchmark method, in which we use a general orthogonal array enumeration algorithm. We compare the efficiencies of the new methods for generating complete sets of nonisomorphic designs. Finally, we use the most efficient method to generate a catalogue of designs with up to three four-level factors and up to 20 two-level factors for run sizes 16, 32, 64, and 128. In some cases, a complete enumeration was infeasible. For these cases, we used a bounded enumeration strategy instead. We demonstrate the usefulness of the catalogue by revisiting the motivating examples.},

  abstract     = {A Bayesian feature allocation model (FAM) is presented for identifying cell subpopulations based on multiple samples of cell surface or intracellular marker expression level data obtained by cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF). Cell subpopulations are characterized by differences in marker expression patterns, and cells are clustered into subpopulations based on their observed expression levels. A model-based method is used to construct cell clusters within each sample by modeling subpopulations as latent features, using a finite Indian buffet process. Non-ignorable missing data due to technical artifacts in mass cytometry instruments are accounted for by defining a static missingship mechanism. In contrast with conventional cell clustering methods, which cluster observed marker expression levels separately for each sample, the FAM-based method can be applied simultaneously to multiple samples, and also identify important cell subpopulations likely to be otherwise missed. The proposed FAM-based method is applied to jointly analyse three CyTOF datasets to study natural killer (NK) cells. Because the subpopulations identified by the FAM may define novel NK cell subsets, this statistical analysis may provide useful information about the biology of NK cells and their potential role in cancer immunotherapy which may lead, in turn, to development of improved NK cell therapies.},

  abstract     = {Considering the inevitable correlation among different datasets within the same subject, we propose a framework of variable selection on multiply imputed data with penalized weighted least squares (PWLS–MI). The methodological development is motivated by an epidemiological study of A/H7N9 patients from Zhejiang province in China, where nearly half of the variables are not fully observed. Multiple imputation is commonly adopted as a missing data processing method. However, it generates correlations among imputed values within the same subject across datasets. Recent work on variable selection for multiply imputed data does not fully address such similarities. We propose PWLS–MI to incorporate the correlation when performing the variable selection. PWLS–MI can be considered as a framework for variable selection on multiply imputed data since it allows various penalties. We use adaptive LASSO as an illustrating example. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to compare PWLS–MI with recently developed methods and the results suggest that the proposed approach outperforms in terms of both selection accuracy and deletion accuracy. PWLS–MI is shown to select variables with clinical relevance when applied to the A/H7N9 database.},

In a phase 1b expansion cohort trial, one or more doses of a new investigational drug identified from phase 1a are tested for initial antitumour activities in patients with different indications (cancer types and/or biomarker status). Each dose–indication combination defines an arm, and patients are enrolled in parallel cohorts to all the arms. The MUCE design is based on a class of Bayesian hierarchical models that adaptively borrow information across arms. Specifically, we employ a latent probit model that allows for different degrees of borrowing across doses and indications. Statistical inference is directly based on the posterior probability of each arm being efficacious, facilitating the decision making that decides which arm to select for further testing. The MUCE design also incorporates interim looks, based on which the nonpromising arms will be stopped early due to futility. Through simulation studies, we show that MUCE exhibits superior operating characteristics. We also compare the performance of MUCE with that of Simon’s two-stage design and some existing Bayesian designs for multiarm trials. To our knowledge, MUCE is the first Bayesian method for phase 1b expansion cohort trials with multiple doses and indications.},

Such data can help characterise the ocean wavefield by modelling the frequency-direction spectrum. State-of-the-art methods for estimating the parameters of such models do not make use of the full spatiotemporal content of the buoy observations due to unnecessary assumptions and smoothing. We explain how the multivariate debiased Whittle likelihood can be used to jointly estimate all parameters of such frequency-direction spectra directly from recorded time series. We apply the method to North Sea buoy data and discuss challenging practical issues.},

Over 65’s constitute 42\% of elective admissions and 43\% of emergency admissions to hospitals. Increasingly, people are turning to technology to help improve health and care of the elderly. There is mixed evidence of the success of wearables in older populations with a key barrier being adoption. In contrast, passive sensors such as infra-red motion and plug sensors have had more success. These passive sensors give us a sequence of categorical “trigger” events throughout the day. This paper proposes a method for detecting subtle changes in sequences while taking account of the natural day-to-day variability and differing numbers of “trigger” events per day.},

Using approximately linear INGARCH models, the unified and flexible spatio-temporal (B)INGARCH framework for modelling unbounded (bounded) counts is proposed. These models combine negative dependencies with kinds of a long memory. They are easily adapted to special marginal features or cross-dependencies: When modelling precipitation data (counts of rainy hours), we account for zero-inflation, while for cloud-coverage data (counts of okta), we deal with missing data and additional cross-correlation.

Our approach can estimate optimal regimes in the presence of time-varying confounding, censoring, and correlated outcomes. Through simulation studies, we examine the operating characteristics of our approach under flexible modelling approaches.

However, these methods are not translation-invariant (TI) and thus cannot handle different times of arrivals of the disease, nor can they consider external covariates and so are unable to adjust for the population risk factors of each region. We propose a novel three steps clustering method to circumvent these issues. First, feature extraction is performed by TI wavelet decomposition, which permits to deal with the different onsets. Then, single-index regression is used to neutralize disparities caused by population risk factors. Finally, a nonparametric mixture is fitted on the regression residuals to achieve the region clustering.},

Limits of quantification could account for negative samples based on Bayesian model comparison. Inpatients represented the tail of the shedding profile with a half-life of 34 hours (28–43 95\% credible interval), suggesting that WBE can be a leading indicator for clinical presentation.

  abstract     = {Predicting the future performance of young runners is an important research issue in experimental sports science and performance analysis. We analyse a dataset with annual seasonal best performances of male middle distance runners for a period of 14 years and provide a modelling framework that accounts for both the fact that each runner has typically run in 3 distance events (800, 1,500, and 5,000 m) and the presence of periods of no running activities. We propose a latent class matrix-variate state space model and we empirically demonstrate that accounting for missing data patterns in runners’ careers improves the out of sample prediction of their performances over time. In particular, we demonstrate that for this analysis, the missing data patterns provide valuable information for the prediction of runner’s performance.},

Monte Carlo simulation of these models can enable forecasting of collections, where computational complexity arises from the very large number of heterogeneous accounts. We aim to solve 2 problems: efficient allocation of computational resources and quantification of uncertainty. We show that robust estimators of population-level variance can be constructed using unbiased estimators of the variance of individual accounts. The proposed methods are demonstrated through application to a model similar to those used in practice.},

We introduce a Bayesian spatial interaction model which provides probabilistic estimates on location-specific revenues and then formulate a mathematical framework to simultaneously identify the location and design of new facilities that maximise revenue. To solve the allocation optimisation problem, we develop a hierarchical search algorithm and associated sampling techniques that explore geographic regions of varying spatial resolution. We demonstrate the approach by producing optimal facility locations and corresponding designs for two large-scale applications in the supermarket and pub sectors of Greater London.},

This setting involves many thousands of heterogeneous customers and items. Models developed are fully Bayesian, interpretable and multi-scale, with hierarchical forms overlaid on the inherent structure of the retail setting. Customer behavior is modelled at several levels of aggregation, and information flows from aggregate to individual levels. Methodological innovations include extensions of Bayesian dynamic mixture models, their integration into multi-scale systems, and forecast evaluation with context-specific metrics. The use of simultaneous predictors from multiple hierarchical levels improves forecasts at the customer-item level of main interest.},

However, heterogeneity might have a pattern not accommodated by transformation and modelling the variance laws is an appealing alternative. This work extends the multivariate dynamic Gaussian model by defining the process as a scale mixture with the scale depending on covariates. State-space equations define the temporal dynamics, resulting in feasible inference and prediction. Various simulations studies show that the parameters are identifiable and our proposal recovers simpler structures. The analyses of temperature and ozone illustrate the improvement in quantifying the uncertainty of predictions.},

The proposed methodology separates substation aggregated loads into estimated mean consumption curves, called typical curves, including information given by explanatory variables. In addition, a model-based clustering approach for substations is proposed based on the similarity of their consumers’ typical curves and covariance structures. The methodology is applied to a real substation load monitoring dataset from the UK and tested in eight simulated scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Statistical calibration using regression is a useful statistical tool with many applications. For confidence sets for x -values associated with infinitely many future y -values, there is a consensus in the statistical literature that the confidence sets constructed should guarantee a key property . While it is well known that the confidence sets based on the simultaneous tolerance intervals (STIs) guarantee this key property conservatively, it is desirable to construct confidence sets that satisfy this property exactly. Also, there is a misconception that the confidence sets based on the pointwise tolerance intervals (PTIs) also guarantee this property . This paper constructs the weighted simultaneous tolerance intervals (WSTIs) so that the confidence sets based on the WSTIs satisfy this property exactly if the future observations have the x -values distributed according to a known specific distribution F ( ⋅ ) ⁠ . Through the lens of the WSTIs, convincing counter examples are also provided to demonstrate that the confidence sets based on the PTIs do not guarantee the key property in general and so should not be used. The WSTIs have been applied to real data examples to show that the WSTIs can produce more accurate calibration intervals than STIs and PTIs.},

We compare the performance of our proposed method to existing methods on simulated data designed to mimic real microbiome data. We then illustrate results obtained for our motivating dataset, a clinical study aimed at characterizing the tumour microbiome of pancreatic cancer patients.},

We explore a particular periodogram for the irregularly observed time series. We identify the potential periods by implementing the saddlepoint approximation, as a faster and more accurate alternative to the simulation based methods that are currently used.
