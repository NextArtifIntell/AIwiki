  abstract     = {Cancer incidence numbers are routinely recorded by national or regional population-based cancer registries (PBCRs). However, in most southern European countries, the local PBCRs cover only a fraction of the country. Therefore, national cancer incidence can be only obtained through estimation methods. In this paper, we predict incidence rates in areas without cancer registry using multivariate spatial models modelling jointly cancer incidence and mortality. To evaluate the proposal, we use cancer incidence and mortality data from all the German states. We also conduct a simulation study by mimicking the real case of Spain considering different scenarios depending on the similarity of spatial patterns between incidence and mortality, the levels of lethality, and varying the amount of incidence data available. The new proposal provides good interval estimates in regions without PBCRs and reduces the relative error in estimating national incidence compared to one of the most widely used methodologies.},

  abstract     = {Instrumental variables (IVs) are extensively used to handle unmeasured confounding. However, weak IVs may cause problems. Many matched studies have considered strengthening an IV through discarding some of the sample. It is widely accepted that strengthening an IV tends to increase the power of non-parametric tests and sensitivity analyses. We re-evaluate this conventional wisdom and offer new insights. First, we evaluate the trade-off between IV strength and sample size assuming a valid IV and exhibit conditions under which strengthening an IV increases power. Second, we derive a criterion for checking the validity of a sensitivity analysis model with a continuous dose and show that the widely used Γ sensitivity analysis model, which was used to argue that strengthening an IV increases the power of sensitivity analyses in large samples, does not work for continuous IVs. Third, we quantify the bias of the Wald estimator with a possibly invalid IV and leverage it to develop a valid sensitivity analysis framework and show that strengthening an IV may or may not increase the power of sensitivity analyses. We use our framework to study the effect on premature babies of being delivered in a high technology/high volume neonatal intensive care unit.},

Seroprevalence surveys estimate the proportion of individuals who have detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, serologic assays are prone to misclassification error, and non-probability sampling may induce selection bias. In this paper, non-parametric and parametric seroprevalence estimators are considered that address both challenges by leveraging validation data and assuming equal probabilities of sample inclusion within covariate-defined strata. Both estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal, and consistent variance estimators are derived. Simulation studies are presented comparing the estimators over a range of scenarios. The methods are used to estimate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroprevalence in New York City, Belgium, and North Carolina.},

  abstract     = {Surveys face difficult choices in managing cost-error trade-offs. Stopping rules for surveys have been proposed as a method for managing these trade-offs. A stopping rule will limit effort on a select subset of cases to reduce costs with minimal harm to quality. Previously proposed stopping rules have focused on quality with an implicit assumption that all cases have the same cost. This assumption is unlikely to be true, particularly when some cases will require more effort and, therefore, more costs than others. We propose a new rule that looks at both predicted costs and quality. This rule is tested experimentally against another rule that focuses on stopping cases that are expected to be difficult to recruit. The experiment was conducted on the 2020 data collection of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We test both Bayesian and non-Bayesian (maximum-likelihood or ML) versions of the rule. The Bayesian version of the prediction models uses historical data to establish prior information. The Bayesian version led to higher-quality data for roughly the same cost, while the ML version led to small reductions in quality with larger reductions in cost compared to the control rule.},

  abstract     = {In New York City, neighbourhood policing was adopted at the police precinct level over the years 2015–2018, and it is of interest to both (1) evaluate the impact of the policy, and (2) understand what types of communities are most impacted by the policy, raising questions of heterogeneous treatment effects. We develop novel statistical approaches that are robust to unmeasured confounding bias to study the causal effect of policies implemented at the community level. We find that neighbourhood policing decreases discretionary arrests in certain areas of the city, but has little effect on crime or racial disparities in arrest rates.},

  abstract     = {In network meta-analysis, some of the collected studies may deviate markedly from the others, for example, having very unusual effect sizes. These deviating studies can be regarded as outlying with respect to the rest of the network and can be influential on the pooled results. Thus, it could be inappropriate to synthesise those studies without further investigation. In this paper, we propose two Bayesian methods to detect outliers in a network meta-analysis via: (a) a mean-shifted outlier model and (b) posterior predictive p -values constructed from ad-hoc discrepancy measures. The former method uses Bayes factors to formally test each study against outliers while the latter provides a score of outlyingness for each study in the network, allowing to numerically quantify the uncertainty associated with being outlier. Furthermore, we present a simple method based on informative priors as part of the network meta-analysis model to down-weight the detected outliers. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology while comparing it to some alternative outlier detection tools. Two case studies are then used to demonstrate our methods in practice.},

  abstract     = {In the field of ecological epidemiological studies, accurate estimation of the long-term health effects of air pollution is crucial. Two-step models that involve exposure assessment and health effects estimation are often used for this purpose. However, the accuracy of exposure assessment is uncertain and may not accurately reflect true exposure. Despite several proposed methods to manage this uncertainty, the impact of different approaches on air pollution inferences remains uncertain. In this study, we conduct a simulation study to compare the inferences of air pollution impact from various exposure uncertainty propagation models while investigating their health effects. The results suggest that the Without-uncertainty model and the Multi-set method are preferable to the prior method and pollution-health jointly model (without cut-off). Moreover, a case study further reinforces the evidence of a link between mortality and PM 2.5 concentrations, showing that an increase of 1 μ g ⋅ m − 3 in PM 2.5 concentration is likely to increase all-cause deaths in Scotland by 4.51\% [95\% credible interval (CI), 3.42\%, 5.49\%] to 7.51\% (95\% CI, 6.28\%, 8.80\%). These findings have important implications for policymakers and public health officials seeking to mitigate the harmful effects of air pollution.},

The use of random weight models offer a potential solution. In addition to uncertainty quantification, these models are extremely computationally efficient as they do not require optimisation through stochastic gradient descent. We show how this approach can be used to account for informative sampling of survey data through the use of a pseudo-likelihood. We illustrate the effectiveness of this methodology through simulation and data application involving American National Election Studies data.},

  abstract     = {Assessing sensitivity to unmeasured confounding is an important step in observational studies, which typically estimate effects under the assumption that all confounders are measured. In this paper, we develop a sensitivity analysis framework for balancing weights estimators, an increasingly popular approach that solves an optimization problem to obtain weights that directly minimizes covariate imbalance. In particular, we adapt a sensitivity analysis framework using the percentile bootstrap for a broad class of balancing weights estimators. We prove that the percentile bootstrap procedure can, with only minor modifications, yield valid confidence intervals for causal effects under restrictions on the level of unmeasured confounding. We also propose an amplification—a mapping from a one-dimensional sensitivity analysis to a higher dimensional sensitivity analysis—to allow for interpretable sensitivity parameters in the balancing weights framework. We illustrate our method through extensive real data examples.},

  abstract     = {Even in a carefully designed randomised trial, outcomes for some study participants can be missing, or more precisely, ill defined, because participants had died prior to outcome collection. This problem, known as truncation by death, means that the treated and untreated are no longer balanced with respect to covariates determining survival. Therefore, researchers often utilise principal stratification and focus on the Survivor Average Causal Effect (SACE). We present matching-based methods for SACE identification and estimation. We provide identification results motivating the use of matching and discuss practical issues, including the choice of distance measures, matching with replacement, and post-matching estimators. Because the assumptions needed for SACE identification can be too strong, we also present sensitivity analysis techniques and illustrate their use in real data analysis.},

  abstract     = {The Covid-19 pandemic has required most countries to implement complex sequences of non-pharmaceutical interventions, with the aim of controlling the transmission of the virus in the population. To be able to take rapid decisions, a detailed understanding of the current situation is necessary. Estimates of time-varying, instantaneous reproduction numbers represent a way to quantify the viral transmission in real time. They are often defined through a mathematical compartmental model of the epidemic, like a stochastic SEIR model, whose parameters must be estimated from multiple time series of epidemiological data. Because of very high dimensional parameter spaces (partly due to the stochasticity in the spread models) and incomplete and delayed data, inference is very challenging. We propose a state-space formalization of the model and a sequential Monte Carlo approach which allow to estimate a daily-varying reproduction number for the Covid-19 epidemic in Norway with sufficient precision, on the basis of daily hospitalization and positive test incidences. The method was in regular use in Norway during the pandemics and appears to be a powerful instrument for epidemic monitoring and management.},

  abstract     = {We propose a general Bayesian approach to modelling epidemics such as COVID-19. The approach grew out of specific analyses conducted during the pandemic, in particular, an analysis concerning the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in reducing COVID-19 transmission in 11 European countries. The model parameterises the time-varying reproduction number R t through a multilevel regression framework in which covariates can be governmental interventions, changes in mobility patterns, or other behavioural measures. Bayesian multilevel modelling allows a joint fit across regions, with partial pooling to share strength. This innovation was critical to our timely estimates of the impact of lockdown and other NPIs in the European epidemics: estimates from countries at later stages in their epidemics informed those of countries at earlier stages. Originally released as Imperial College Reports, the validity of this approach was borne out by the subsequent course of the epidemic. Our framework provides a fully generative model for latent infections and derived observations, including deaths, cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and seroprevalence surveys. In this article, we additionally explore the confounded nature of NPIs and mobility. Versions of our model were used by New York State, Tennessee, and Scotland to estimate the current epidemic situation and make policy decisions.},

The main focus and motivation for this paper is to assess the issue of competitive balance in the context of the English First Division / Premier League over more than 40 seasons.

There are contexts where the network might be considered a reflection of underlying dynamics in some latent space, whereby nodes are associated with dynamic locations and their relative distances drive their interaction tendencies. As time passes, nodes can change their locations assuming new configurations, with different interaction patterns. The aim of this manuscript is to define a dynamic latent space relational event model. We then develop a computationally efficient method for inferring the locations of the nodes. We make use of the expectation maximization algorithm, which embeds an extension of the universal Kalman filter. Kalman filters are known for being effective tools in the context of tracking objects in the space, with successful applications in fields such as geolocalization. We extend its application to dynamic networks by filtering the signal from a sequence of adjacency matrices and recovering the hidden movements. Besides the latent space, our formulation includes also more traditional fixed and random effects, thereby achieving a general model that can suit a large variety of applications.},

  abstract     = {Social network data are relational data recorded among a group of actors, interacting in different contexts. Often, the same set of actors can be characterised by multiple social relations, captured by a multidimensional network. A common situation is that of colleagues working in the same institution, whose social interactions can be defined on professional and personal levels. In addition, individuals in a network tend to interact more frequently with similar others, naturally creating communities. Latent space models for network data are useful to recover clustering of the actors, as they allow to represent similarities between them by their positions and relative distances in an interpretable low-dimensional social space. We propose the infinite mixture latent position cluster model for multidimensional network data, which enables model-based clustering of actors interacting across multiple social dimensions. The model is based on a Bayesian non-parametric framework that allows to perform automatic inference on the clustering allocations, the number of clusters, and the latent social space. The method is tested on extensive simulated data experiments. It is also employed to investigate the presence of communities in two multidimensional workplace social networks recording relations of different types among colleagues.},

The proposed extension consists in the introduction of covariates and in the adoption of a hierarchical Bayesian inferential approach that shows advantages in the specific application. For Bayesian inference we rely on a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that produces samples from the posterior distribution of the model parameters. The application is based on original data on patient referral relations among 127 hospitals serving a large regional community of patients in Italy from 2014 to 2018. Results indicate that interhospital collaborative behaviours are primarily local and that collaborative attitudes vary at different time occasions of the considered period and in accordance with the level of competition faced by hospital organisations.},

  abstract     = {Social network data are often constructed by incorporating reports from multiple individuals. However, it is not obvious how to reconcile discordant responses from individuals. There may be particular risks with multiply reported data if people’s responses reflect normative expectations—such as an expectation of balanced, reciprocal relationships. Here, we propose a probabilistic model that incorporates ties reported by multiple individuals to estimate the unobserved network structure. In addition to estimating a parameter for each reporter that is related to their tendency of over- or under-reporting relationships, the model explicitly incorporates a term for ‘mutuality’, the tendency to report ties in both directions involving the same alter. Our model’s algorithmic implementation is based on variational inference, which makes it efficient and scalable to large systems. We apply our model to data from a Nicaraguan community collected with a roster-based design and 75 Indian villages collected with a name-generator design. We observe strong evidence of ‘mutuality’ in both datasets, and find that this value varies by relationship type. Consequently, our model estimates networks with reciprocity values that are substantially different than those resulting from standard deterministic aggregation approaches, demonstrating the need to consider such issues when gathering, constructing, and analysing survey-based network data.},

  abstract     = {Assessing novel methods for increasing power system resilience against cyber-physical hazards requires real power grid data or high-quality synthetic data. However, for security reasons, even basic connection information for real power grid data are not publicly available. We develop a randomised model for generating realistic synthetic power networks based on the Delaunay triangulation and demonstrate that it captures important features of real power networks. To validate our model, we introduce a new metric for network similarity based on topological data analysis. We demonstrate the utility of our approach in application to IEEE test cases and European power networks. We identify the model parameters for two IEEE test cases and two European power grid networks and compare the properties of the generated networks with their corresponding benchmark networks.},

During the last years, several authors proposed sophisticated approaches to help authorities implement new policies. These models were usually developed considering a set of socio-economic variables and ignoring the measurement error, which can bias the statistical inference. This paper presents a Bayesian model to analyse car crash occurrences at the network-lattice level, taking into account measurement error in the spatial covariate. The suggested methodology is exemplified by considering the collisions in the road network of Leeds (UK) during 2011–2019. Traffic volumes are approximated using an extensive set of counts obtained from mobile devices and the estimates are adjusted using a spatial measurement error correction.},

These component models are combined in a statistically coherent manner to provide measures of the imminence of an attack by the terrorist group. Domain knowledge provides the structures of the models, values of parameters and prior distributions over latent variables. Inference of the values is performed using time-series of observed data and the statistical dependencies assumed between said data and model variables.

The two components of this new measure of cultural distance show different correlations with measures of geographical, historical, economic, and political distance among countries and with the similarity in the topologies of the countries cultural networks.},

A top income share is the ratio of the total income held by the top income group divided by total personal income (the ‘income control total’). We compare two approaches to estimating income control totals: the ‘external’ approach used by the World Inequality Database, and an augmented ‘internal’ approach. We argue in favour of the latter, with reference to five desirable properties that a top share series would ideally possess. The choice matters: our augmented ‘internal’ approach yields estimates of the UK top 1\% share that are around 2\% points higher than the ‘external’ approach.},

Group-based approaches comparing group-specific means do not account for intra-group heterogeneity. Yet, traditional approaches based on additive decompositions splitting total inequality in its within- and between-group components fail to elucidate the groups’ relative performance. Here, we develop a third approach based on pairwise comparisons to evaluatenot only the variability that might exist across individuals within and between groups, but also the relative performance of the different groups vis-a-vis each other—thus integrating both perspectives into a coherent framework.},

  abstract     = {Despite an increasing reliance on fully-automated algorithmic decision-making in our day-to-day lives, humans still make consequential decisions. While the existing literature focuses on the bias and fairness of algorithmic recommendations, an overlooked question is whether they improve human decisions. We develop a general statistical methodology for experimentally evaluating the causal impacts of algorithmic recommendations on human decisions. We also examine whether algorithmic recommendations improve the fairness of human decisions and derive the optimal decision rules under various settings. We apply the proposed methodology to the first-ever randomized controlled trial that evaluates the pretrial Public Safety Assessment in the United States criminal justice system. Our analysis of the preliminary data shows that providing the PSA to the judge has little overall impact on the judge’s decisions and subsequent arrestee behaviour.},

In our social network model, the commuting flows are explained by the distances between the municipalities, i.e., the nodes, in a 3-dimensional space, where the 2 actual geographical coordinates and the third latent variable are modelled through a Gaussian mixture.},

Allowing for modest misclassification, we find overall mobility has been remarkably low: at least 65\% of poor households remained poor or at-risk of being poor between 2005 and 2012. We also find Muslims, lower caste groups, and rural households are in a more disadvantageous position compared to Hindus, upper caste groups, and urban households. These findings cast doubt on the conventional wisdom that marginalized households in India are catching up.},

  abstract     = {Opioid misuse is a national epidemic and a significant drug-related threat to the United States. While the scale of the problem is undeniable, estimates of the local prevalence of opioid misuse are lacking, despite their importance to policy-making and resource allocation. This is due, in part, to the challenge of directly measuring opioid misuse at a local level. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal abundance model that integrates indirect county-level data on opioid-related outcomes with state-level survey estimates on prevalence of opioid misuse to estimate the latent county-level prevalence and counts of people who misuse opioids. A simulation study shows that our integrated model accurately recovers the latent counts and prevalence. We apply our model to county-level surveillance data on opioid overdose deaths and treatment admissions from the state of Ohio. Our proposed framework can be applied to other applications of small area estimation for hard to reach populations, which is a common occurrence with many health conditions such as those related to illicit behaviours.},

  abstract     = {We propose a multivariate dynamic statistical model of the global carbon budget (GCB) as represented in the annual data set made available by the Global Carbon Project, covering the sample period 1959–2020. The model connects four main objects of interest: atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ⁠ ) concentrations, anthropogenic CO 2 emissions, the absorption of CO 2 by the terrestrial biosphere (land sink), and by the ocean and marine biosphere (ocean sink). The model captures the GCB equation, which states that emissions not absorbed by either land or ocean sinks must remain in the atmosphere and constitute a flow to the stock of atmospheric concentrations. Emissions depend on global economic activity as measured by World Gross Domestic Product while sink activities depend on the level of atmospheric concentrations and the Southern Oscillation Index. We derive the time series properties of atmospheric concentrations from the model, showing that they contain one unit root and a near-second unit root. The statistical system allows for the estimation of key parameters of the global carbon cycle and for the assessment of estimation uncertainty. It also allows for the estimation and the uncertainty assessment of related variables such as the airborne fraction and the sink rate. We provide short-term forecasts of the components of the GCB.},

  abstract     = {The ‘multistate lifetable’ is a widely used model for the long-term health impacts of public health interventions. It requires estimates of the incidence, case fatality, and sometimes also remission rates, for multiple diseases by age and gender. The case fatality is the rate of death from a disease for people with a disease, and is commonly not observed directly. Instead, we often observe the mortality in the general population. Similarly, we might know the disease prevalence, but not the incidence. This paper presents Bayesian continuous-time multistate models for estimating transition rates between disease states based on incomplete data. It unifies and extends two previous methods, by using a formal statistical model, with more efficient computational algorithms. This allows rates for different ages, areas, and time periods to be related in more flexible ways, and allows models to be formally checked and compared. The methods are made more widely usable through an R package. The models are used to estimate case fatality for multiple diseases in the city regions of England, based on incidence, prevalence, and mortality data from the Global Burden of Disease study. The estimates can be used to inform health impact models relating to those diseases and areas.},
