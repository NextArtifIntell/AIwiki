  abstract     = {Atmospheric water harvesting is an emerging strategy for decentralized and potable water supplies. However, water nucleation and microdroplet coalescence on condensing surfaces often result in surface flooding owing to the lack of a sufficient directional driving force for shedding. Herein, inspired by the fascinating properties of lizards and catfish, we present a condensing surface with engineered hydrogel patterns that enable rapid and sustainable water harvesting through the directional pumping and drag-reduced sliding of water droplets. The movement of microscale condensed droplets is synergistically driven by the surface energy gradient and difference in Laplace pressure induced by the arch hydrogel patterns. Meanwhile, the superhydrophilic hydrogel surface can strongly bond inner-layer water molecules to form a lubricant film that reduces drag and facilitates the sliding of droplets off the condensing surface. Thus, this strategy is promising for various water purification techniques based on liquid–vapor phase-change processes.},

  abstract     = {Enzymes, as paramount protein catalysts, occupy a central role in fostering remarkable progress across numerous fields. However, the intricacy of sequence-function relationships continues to obscure our grasp of enzyme behaviors and curtails our capabilities in rational enzyme engineering. Generative artificial intelligence (AI), known for its proficiency in handling intricate data distributions, holds the potential to offer novel perspectives in enzyme research. Generative models could discern elusive patterns within the vast sequence space and uncover new functional enzyme sequences. This review highlights the recent advancements in employing generative AI for enzyme sequence analysis. We delve into the impact of generative AI in predicting mutation effects on enzyme fitness, catalytic activity and stability, rationalizing the laboratory evolution of de novo enzymes, and decoding protein sequence semantics and their application in enzyme engineering. Notably, the prediction of catalytic activity and stability of enzymes using natural protein sequences serves as a vital link, indicating how enzyme catalysis shapes enzyme evolution. Overall, we foresee that the integration of generative AI into enzyme studies will remarkably enhance our knowledge of enzymes and expedite the creation of superior biocatalysts.},

Here, we describe the synthesis of two different types of stable complexes with five coplanar M–C σ bonds, and examine the stability of such complexes which use rigid conjugated carbon chains to chelate with the metal center. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the M–C σ bonds in these complexes have primarily a covalent character. Besides the σ nature, there are also a π conjugation component among the metal center and carbons, which causes delocalization. This work expanded the coplanar M–C σ bonds to five.},

The large number of degrees of freedom and the intricate symmetry adaption pose a big challenge to accurately representing potential energy surfaces (PESs) for polyatomic reactions. Recently, our group has made substantial progress in this direction by developing the fundamental invariant-neural network (FI-NN) approach. Here, we review these advances, demonstrating that the FI-NN approach can represent highly accurate, global, full-dimensional PESs for reactive systems with even more than 10 atoms. These multi-channel reactions typically involve many intermediates, transition states, and products. The complexity and ruggedness of this potential energy landscape present even greater challenges for full-dimensional PES representation. These PESs exhibit a high level of complexity, molecular size, and accuracy of fit. Dynamics simulations based on these PESs have unveiled intriguing and novel reaction mechanisms, providing deep insights into the intricate dynamics involved in combustion, atmospheric, and organic chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Sleep deprivation (SD) is a severe public health threat that can cause systemic inflammation and nerve damage. Few effective and side-effect-free drugs are available to address SD. However, the bidirectional communications between the brain and gut provide new strategies for anti-SD therapeutics. Here we explored oral delivery of fullerene nano-antioxidants (FNAO) in the SD model to improve sleep by regulating abnormal intestinal barrier and systemic inflammation via the brain-gut axis. SD caused excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and hyperactive inflammatory responses in the intestines of zebrafish and mouse models, leading to disturbed sleep patterns and reduced brain nerve activity. Of note, based on the property of the conjugated π bond of the C 60 structure to absorb unpaired electrons, oral FNAO efficiently reduced the excessive ROS in the intestines, maintained redox homeostasis and intestinal barrier integrity, and ameliorated intestinal and systemic inflammation, resulting in superior sleep improvement. Our findings suggest that maintaining intestinal homeostasis may be a promising avenue for SD-related nerve injury therapy.},

  abstract     = {A biological potassium channel is &gt;1000 times more permeable to K + than to Na + and exhibits a giant permeation rate of ∼10 8 ions/s. It is a great challenge to construct artificial potassium channels with such high selectivity and ion conduction rate. Herein, we unveil a long-overlooked structural feature that underpins the ultra-high K + /Na + selectivity. By carrying out massive molecular dynamics simulation for ion transport through carbonyl-oxygen-modified bi-layer graphene nanopores, we find that the twisted carbonyl rings enable strict potassium selectivity with a dynamic K + /Na + selectivity ratio of 1295 and a K + conduction rate of 3.5 × 10 7 ions/s, approaching those of the biological counterparts. Intriguingly, atomic trajectories of K + permeation events suggest a dual-ion transport mode, i.e. two like-charged potassium ions are successively captured by the nanopores in the graphene bi-layer and are interconnected by sharing one or two interlayer water molecules. The dual-ion behavior allows rapid release of the exiting potassium ion via a soft knock-on mechanism, which has previously been found only in biological ion channels. As a proof-of-concept utilization of this discovery, we propose a novel way for ionic power generation by mixing KCl and NaCl solutions through the bi-layer graphene nanopores, termed potassium-permselectivity enabled osmotic power generation (PoPee-OPG). Theoretically, the biomimetic device achieves a very high power density of &gt;1000 W/m 2 with graphene sheets of &lt;1% porosity. This study provides a blueprint for artificial potassium channels and thus paves the way toward next-generation electric-eel-mimetic ionic power generation.},

  abstract     = {Limiting climate change to 1.5°C and achieving net-zero emissions would entail substantial carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere by the mid-century, but how much CDR is needed at country level over time is unclear. The purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed description of when and how much CDR is required at country level in order to achieve 1.5°C and how much CDR countries can carry out domestically. We allocate global CDR pathways among 170 countries according to 6 equity principles and assess these allocations with respect to countries’ biophysical and geophysical capacity to deploy CDR. Allocating global CDR to countries based on these principles suggests that CDR will, on average, represent ∼4% of nations’ total emissions in 2030, rising to ∼17% in 2040. Moreover, equitable allocations of CDR, in many cases, exceed implied land and carbon storage capacities. We estimate ∼15% of countries (25) would have insufficient land to contribute an equitable share of global CDR, and ∼40% of countries (71) would have insufficient geological storage capacity. Unless more diverse CDR technologies are developed, the mismatch between CDR liabilities and land-based CDR capacities will lead to global demand for six GtCO 2 carbon credits from 2020 to 2050. This demonstrates an imperative demand for international carbon trading of CDR.},

  abstract     = {High energy density and high safety are incompatible with each other in a lithium battery, which challenges today&#39;s energy storage and power applications. Ni-rich layered transition metal oxides (NMCs) have been identified as the primary cathode candidate for powering next-generation electric vehicles and have been extensively studied in the last two decades, leading to the fast growth of their market share, including both polycrystalline and single-crystal NMC cathodes. Single-crystal NMCs appear to be superior to polycrystalline NMCs, especially at low Ni content (≤60%). However, Ni-rich single-crystal NMC cathodes experience even faster capacity decay than polycrystalline NMC cathodes, rendering them unsuitable for practical application. Accordingly, this work will systematically review the attenuation mechanism of single-crystal NMCs and generate fresh insights into valuable research pathways. This perspective will provide a direction for the development of Ni-rich single-crystal NMC cathodes.},

  abstract     = {Mei-yu is an important weather phenomenon in the middle-lower Yangtze River valley (YRV) region. This study investigates the changes in the characteristics of Mei-yu under global warming and the potential reasons based on observation and reanalysis data during 1961–2022. Notable increasing long-term trends are detected in the number of days without rainfall (NDWOR), the intensity of rainfall events, and the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events (EPEs) in the YRV region during the Mei-yu period (15 June–10 July) over past decades. The increasing trend in NDWOR is attributed to decreased relative humidity over land surface and a longer time for the air to be replenished with moisture after rainfall events in a warming climate. The increasing trends in the intensity of rainfall events and frequency/intensity of EPEs are attributed to the strengthened transient water vapor convergence and convection in the atmosphere under global warming. Furthermore, the response of Mei-yu to 2°C of global warming with respect to the pre-industrial climate is analysed using CMIP6 models. The results suggest that the NDWOR, intensity of rainfall events and frequency of EPEs will increase in the YRV region during the Mei-yu period under the 2°C warming scenario, which implies a more challenging climate risk management in the future. Overall, the intensity of rainfall events during the Mei-yu period has the most significant response to climate change in observations and projections. The model results have a relatively large uncertainty.},

However, past models largely overlooked the spatial and chemical inhomogeneity of atmospheric ON p and were thus deficient in assessing global ON p impacts. We constructed a comprehensive global model of atmospheric gaseous and particulate organic nitrogen (ON), including the latest knowledge on emissions and secondary formations. Using this model, we simulated global atmospheric ON p abundances consistent with observations. Our estimated global atmospheric ON deposition was 26 Tg N yr −1 , predominantly in the form of ON p (23 Tg N yr −1 ) and mostly from wildfires (37%), oceans (22%) and aqueous productions (17%). Globally, ON p contributed as much as 40% to 80% of the total N deposition downwind of biomass-burning regions. Atmospheric ON p deposition thus constituted the dominant external N supply to the N-limited boreal forests, tundras and the Arctic Ocean, and its importance may be amplified in a future warming climate.},

  abstract     = {N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) is a critical regulator in the fate of RNA, but whether and how m 6 A executes its functions in different tissues remains largely obscure. Here we report downregulation of a crucial m 6 A reader, YTHDF2, leading to tissue-specific programmed cell deaths (PCDs) upon fluorene-9-bisphenol (BHPF) exposure. Currently, Bisphenol A (BPA) substitutes are widely used in plastic manufacturing. Interrogating eight common BPA substitutes, we detected BHPF in 14% serum samples of pregnant participants. In a zebrafish model, BHPF caused tissue-specific PCDs triggering cardiac and vascular defects. Mechanistically, BHPF-mediated downregulation of YTHDF2 reduced YTHDF2-facilitated translation of m 6 A- gch1 for cardiomyocyte ferroptosis, and decreased YTHDF2-mediated m 6 A- sting1 decay for caudal vein plexus (CVP) apoptosis. The two distinct YTHDF2-mediated m 6 A regulations and context-dependent co-expression patterns of gch1/ythdf2 and tnfrsf1a/ythdf2 contributed to YTHDF2-mediated tissue-specific PCDs, uncovering a new layer of PCD regulation. Since BHPF/YTHDF2-medaited PCD defects were also observed in mammals, BHPF exposure represents a potential health threat.},

  abstract     = {Neuroimmune connections have been revealed to play a central role in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). However, the mechanisms that link the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral immune cells are still mostly unknown. We recently found that specific ablation of the Arf1 gene in hindbrain and spinal cord neurons promoted NDs through activating the NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia via peroxided lipids and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) releasing. Here, we demonstrate that IL-1β with elevated chemokines in the neuronal Arf1-ablated mouse hindbrain and spinal cord recruited and activated γδ T cells in meninges. The activated γδ T cells then secreted IFN-γ that entered into parenchyma to activate the microglia-A1 astrocyte-C3-neuronal C3aR neurotoxic pathway. Remarkably, the neurodegenerative phenotypes of the neuronal Arf1 -ablated mice were strongly ameliorated by IFN- γ or C3 knockout. Finally, we show that the Arf1-reduction-induced neuroimmune- IFN- γ-gliosis pathway exists in human NDs, particularly in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. Together, our results uncover a previously unknown mechanism that links the CNS and peripheral immune cells to promote neurodegeneration.},

The achieved sensitivity is substantially enhanced by integrating with multiple quantum techniques, including real-time-feedback initialization, dynamical decoupling with shaped pulses and repetitive readout via quantum logic.

The series of quenched glasses, including rotation-featured particles, vesicular agglutinates and adhered melts, record multiple-scale impact events. Abundant micro-impact products, like micron- to nano-scale glass droplets or craters, highlight that the regolith is heavily reworked by frequent micrometeorite bombardment. Distinct from Apollo samples, the indigenous ultra-elongated glass fibers drawn from viscous melts and the widespread ultra-thin deposited amorphous rims without nanophase iron particles both indicate a relatively gentle impact environment at the CE-5 landing site.

In large rhesus monkey colonies, we found 10 monkeys spontaneously exhibiting persistent sequential motor behaviors (SMBs) in individual-specific sequences that were repetitive, time-consuming and stable over prolonged periods. Genetic analysis revealed severely damaging mutations in genes associated with OCD risk in humans. Brain imaging showed that monkeys with SMBs had larger gray matter (GM) volumes in the left caudate nucleus and lower fractional anisotropy of the corpus callosum. The GM volume of the left caudate nucleus correlated positively with the daily duration of SMBs. Notably, exposure to a stressor (human presence) significantly increased SMBs. In addition, fluoxetine, a serotonergic medication commonly used for OCD, decreased SMBs in these monkeys. These findings provide a novel foundation for developing better understanding and treatment of OCD.},

  abstract     = {A single-domain protein catenane refers to two mechanically interlocked polypeptide rings that fold synergistically into a compact and integrated structure, which is extremely rare in nature. Here, we report a single-domain protein catenane of dihydrofolate reductase ( cat -DHFR). This design was achieved by rewiring the connectivity between secondary motifs to introduce artificial entanglement and synthesis was readily accomplished through a series of programmed and streamlined post-translational processing events in cells without any additional in vitro reactions. The target molecule contained few exogenous motifs and was thoroughly characterized using a combination of ultra-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, protease cleavage experiments and ion mobility spectrometry–mass spectrometry. Compared with the linear control, cat -DHFR retained its catalytic capability and exhibited enhanced stability against thermal or chemical denaturation due to conformational restriction. These results suggest that linear proteins may be converted into their concatenated single-domain counterparts with almost identical chemical compositions, well-preserved functions and elevated stabilities, representing an entirely new horizon in protein science.},

While prior studies on transgenic mice carrying the human-specific SRGAP2C gene have shown enhanced brain connectivity, the relevance to humans remains unclear due to the significant evolutionary gap between humans and rodents. In this study, to investigate the phenotypic outcome and underlying genetic mechanism of SRGAP2C , we generated transgenic cynomolgus macaques ( Macaca fascicularis ) carrying the human-specific SRGAP2C gene. Longitudinal MRI imaging revealed delayed brain development with region-specific volume changes, accompanied by altered myelination levels in the temporal and occipital regions. On a cellular level, the transgenic monkeys exhibited increased deep-layer neurons during fetal neurogenesis and delayed synaptic maturation in adolescence. Moreover, transcriptome analysis detected neotenic expression in molecular pathways related to neuron ensheathment, synaptic connections, extracellular matrix and energy metabolism. Cognitively, the transgenic monkeys demonstrated improved motor planning and execution skills. Together, our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which the newly evolved gene shapes the unique development and circuitry of the human brain.},

  abstract     = {Oculomotor behavior has been shown to be correlated with mental disorders in clinics, making it promising for disease diagnosis. Here we developed a thorough oculomotor test toolkit, involving saccade, smooth pursuit, and fixation, allowing the examination of multiple oculomotor parameters in monkey models induced by psychoactive drugs. Eye movements were recorded after daily injections of phencyclidine (PCP) (3.0 mg/kg), ketamine (0.8 mg/kg) or controlled saline in two macaque monkeys. Both drugs led to robust reduction in accuracy and increment in reaction time during high cognitive-demanding tasks. Saccades, smooth pursuit, and fixation stability were also significantly impaired. During fixation, the involuntary microsaccades exhibited increased amplitudes and were biased toward the lower visual field. Pupillary response was reduced during cognitive tasks. Both drugs also increased sensitivity to auditory cues as reflected in auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). Thus, our animal model induced by psychoactive drugs produced largely similar abnormalities to that in patients with schizophrenia. Importantly, a classifier based on dimension reduction and machine learning could reliably identify altered states induced by different drugs (PCP, ketamine and saline, accuracy = 93%). The high performance of the classifier was reserved even when data from one monkey were used for training and testing the other subject (averaged classification accuracy = 90%). Thus, despite heterogeneity in baseline oculomotor behavior between the two monkeys, our model allows data transferability across individuals, which could be beneficial for future evaluation of pharmaceutical or physical therapy validity.},

  abstract     = {A high-quality tin oxide electron transport layer (ETL) is a key common factor to achieve high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the conventional annealing technique to prepare high-quality ETLs by continuous heating under near-equilibrium conditions requires high temperatures and a long fabrication time. Alternatively, we present a non-equilibrium, photoexcitation-induced passivation technique that uses multiple ultrashort laser pulses. The ultrafast photoexcitation and following electron–electron and electron–phonon scattering processes induce ultrafast annealing to efficiently passivate surface and bulk defects, and improve the crystallinity of SnO 2 , resulting in suppressing the carrier recombination and facilitating the charge transport between the ETL and perovskite interface. By rapidly scanning the laser beam, the annealing time is reduced to several minutes, which is much more efficient compared with conventional thermal annealing. To demonstrate the university and scalability of this technique, typical antisolvent and antisolvent-free processed hybrid organic–inorganic metal halide PSCs have been fabricated and achieved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.14% and 22.75% respectively, and a 12-square-centimeter module antisolvent-free processed perovskite solar module achieves a PCE of 20.26%, with significantly enhanced performance both in PCE and stability. This study establishes a new approach towards the commercialization of efficient low-temperature manufacturing of PSCs.},

The production of organic carbon can be traced back to as early as ∼4.0 Ga, but the frequency and scale of organic-rich shales have varied markedly over geological time. In this paper, we discuss the organic carbon cycle and the development of black shale from the perspective of Earth System Science. We propose that black shale depositions are the results of interactions among lithospheric evolution, orbital forcing, weathering, photosynthesis and degradation. Black shales can record Earth&#39;s oxygenation process, provide petroleum and metallic mineral resources and reveal information about the driver, direction and magnitude of climate change. Future research on black shales should be expanded to encompass a more extensive and more multidimensional perspective.},

  abstract     = {Crossing certain aridity thresholds in global drylands can lead to abrupt decays of ecosystem attributes such as plant productivity, potentially causing land degradation and desertification. It is largely unknown, however, whether these thresholds can be altered by other key global change drivers known to affect the water-use efficiency and productivity of vegetation, such as elevated CO 2 and nitrogen (N). Using &gt;5000 empirical measurements of plant biomass, we showed that crossing an aridity (1–precipitation/potential evapotranspiration) threshold of ∼0.50, which marks the transition from dry sub-humid to semi-arid climates, led to abrupt declines in aboveground biomass (AGB) and progressive increases in root:shoot ratios, thus importantly affecting carbon stocks and their distribution. N addition significantly increased AGB and delayed the emergence of its aridity threshold from 0.49 to 0.55 ( P &lt; 0.05). By coupling remote sensing estimates of leaf area index with simulations from multiple models, we found that CO 2 enrichment did not alter the observed aridity threshold. By 2100, and under the RCP 8.5 scenario, we forecast a 0.3% net increase in the global land area exceeding the aridity threshold detected under a scenario that includes N deposition, in comparison to a 2.9% net increase if the N effect is not considered. Our study thus indicates that N addition could mitigate to a great extent the negative impact of increasing aridity on plant biomass in drylands. These findings are critical for improving forecasts of abrupt vegetation changes in response to ongoing global environmental change.},

However, the extremely limited number of BioAIEgens extracted from natural sources have retarded their development. Herein, a new class of BioAIEgens based on the natural scaffold of chromene have been facilely synthesized via green reactions in a water system. These compounds show regiostructure-, polymorphism- and substituent-dependent fluorescence, which clearly illustrates the close relationship between the macroscopic properties and hierarchical structure of aggregates. Due to the superior biocompatibility of the natural scaffold, chromene-based BioAIEgens can specifically target the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the introduction of tosyl amide.

  abstract     = {Electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction (ECR) coupled with organic oxidation is a promising strategy to produce high value-added chemicals and improve energy efficiency. However, achieving the efficient redox coupling reaction is still challenging due to the lack of suitable electrocatalysts. Herein, we designed two bifunctional polyimides-linked covalent organic frameworks (PI-COFs) through assembling phthalocyanine (Pc) and porphyrin (Por) by non-toxic hydrothermal methods in pure water to realize the above catalytic reactions. Due to the high conductivity and well-defined active sites with different chemical environments, NiPc-NiPor COF performs efficient ECR coupled with methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) (Faradaic efficiency of CO (FE CO ) = 98.12%, partial current densities of CO (j CO ) = 6.14 mA cm −2 for ECR, FE HCOOH = 93.75%, j HCOOH = 5.81 mA cm −2 for MOR at low cell voltage (2.1 V) and remarkable long-term stability). Furthermore, experimental evidences and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the ECR process mainly conducts on NiPc unit with the assistance of NiPor, meanwhile, the MOR prefers NiPor conjugating with NiPc. The two units of NiPc-NiPor COF collaboratively promote the coupled oxidation-reduction reaction. For the first time, this work achieves the rational design of bifunctional COFs for coupled heterogeneous catalysis, which opens a new area for crystalline material catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Human speech and animal vocalizations are important for social communication and animal survival. Neurons in the auditory pathway are responsive to a range of sounds, from elementary sound features to complex acoustic sounds. For social communication, responses to distinct patterns of vocalization are usually highly specific to an individual conspecific call, in some species. This includes the specificity of sound patterns and embedded biological information. We conducted single-unit recordings in the amygdala of awake marmosets and presented calls used in marmoset communication, calls of other species and calls from specific marmoset individuals. We found that some neurons (47/262) in the amygdala distinguished ‘Phee’ calls from vocalizations of other animals and other types of marmoset vocalizations. Interestingly, a subset of Phee-responsive neurons (22/47) also exhibited selectivity to one out of the three Phees from two different ‘caller’ marmosets. Our findings suggest that, while it has traditionally been considered the key structure in the limbic system, the amygdala also represents a critical stage of socially relevant auditory perceptual processing.},

Using terahertz pump-terahertz probe spectroscopy, we investigate the c -axis nonlinear optical response of a high-temperature superconducting cuprate. After excitation by a single-cycle terahertz pump pulse, the reflectivity of the probe pulse oscillates as the pump-probe delay is varied. Interestingly, the oscillatory central frequency scales linearly with the probe frequency, a fact widely overlooked in pump-probe experiments. By theoretically solving the nonlinear optical reflection problem on the interface, we show that our observation is well explained by the Josephson-type third-order nonlinear electrodynamics, together with the emission coefficient from inside the material into free space. The latter results in a strong enhancement of the emitted signal whose physical frequency is around the Josephson plasma edge. Our result offers a benchmark for and new insights into strong-field terahertz spectroscopy of related quantum materials.},

A resistivity minimum associated with logarithmic temperature dependence in both longitudinal and Hall resistivities are observed in the underdoped Nd 1−x Sr x NiO 2 samples before the superconducting transition. At lower temperatures down to 0.04 K, the resistivities become saturated, following the prediction of the Kondo model.

  abstract     = {Understanding changes in pathogen behavior (e.g. increased virulence, a shift in transmission channel) is critical for the public health management of emerging infectious diseases. Genome degradation via gene depletion or inactivation is recognized as a pathoadaptive feature of the pathogen evolving with the host. However, little is known about the exact role of genome degradation in affecting pathogenic behavior, and the underlying molecular detail has yet to be examined. Using large-scale global avian-restricted Salmonella genomes spanning more than a century, we projected the genetic diversity of Salmonella Pullorum (bvSP) by showing increasingly antimicrobial-resistant ST92 prevalent in Chinese flocks. The phylogenomic analysis identified three lineages in bvSP, with an enhancement of virulence in the two recently emerged lineages (L2/L3), as evidenced in chicken and embryo infection assays. Notably, the ancestor L1 lineage resembles the Salmonella serovars with higher metabolic flexibilities and more robust environmental tolerance, indicating stepwise evolutionary trajectories towards avian-restricted lineages. Pan-genome analysis pinpointed fimbrial degradation from a virulent lineage. The later engineered fim -deletion mutant, and all other five fimbrial systems, revealed behavior switching that restricted horizontal fecal–oral transmission but boosted virulence in chicks. By depleting fimbrial appendages, bvSP established persistent replication with less proinflammation in chick macrophages and adopted vertical transovarial transmission, accompanied by ever-increasing intensification in the poultry industry. Together, we uncovered a previously unseen paradigm for remodeling bacterial surface appendages that supplements virulence-enhanced evolution with increased vertical transmission.},

  abstract     = {Low-cost, high-safety, and broad-prospect aqueous zinc−manganese batteries (ZMBs) are limited by complex interfacial reactions. The solid−liquid interfacial state of the cathode dominates the Mn dissolution/deposition process of aqueous ZMBs, especially the important influence on the mass and charge transfer behavior of Zn 2+ and Mn 2+ . We proposed a quasi-eutectic electrolyte (QEE) that would stabilize the reversible behavior of interfacial deposition and favorable interfacial reaction kinetic of manganese-based cathodes in a long cycle process by optimizing mass and charge transfer. We emphasize that the initial interfacial reaction energy barrier is not the main factor affecting cycling performance, and the good reaction kinetics induced by interfacial deposition during the cycling process is more conducive to the stable cycling of the battery, which has been confirmed by theoretical analysis, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, depth etching X-ray photon-electron spectroscopy, etc. As a result, the QEE electrolyte maintained a stable specific capacity of 250 mAh g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 after 350 cycles in zinc−manganese batteries. The energy density retention rate of the ZMB with QEE increased by 174% compared to that of conventional aqueous electrolyte. Furthermore, the multi-stacked soft-pack battery with a cathodic mass load of 54.4 mg maintained a stable specific capacity of 200 mAh g −1 for 100 cycles, demonstrating its commercial potential. This work proves the feasibility of adapting lean-water QEE to the stable aqueous ZMBs.},

  abstract     = {Host phylogeny and environment have all been implicated in shaping the gut microbiota and host metabolic traits of mammals. However, few studies have evaluated phylogeny-associated microbial assembly and host metabolic plasticity concurrently, and their relationships on both short-term and evolutionary timescales. We report that the branching order of a gut microbial dendrogram was nearly congruent with phylogenetic relationships of seven rodent species, and this pattern of phylosymbiosis was intact after diverse laboratory manipulations. Laboratory rearing, diet or air temperature ( T a ) acclimation induced alterations in gut microbial communities, but could not override host phylogeny in shaping microbial community assembly. A simulative heatwave reduced core microbiota diversity by 26% in these species, and led to an unmatched relationship between the microbiota and host metabolic phenotypes in desert species. Moreover, the similarity of metabolic traits across species at different Tas was not correlated with phylogenetic distance. These data demonstrated that the gut microbial assembly showed strong concordance with host phylogeny and may be shaped by environmental variables, whereas host metabolic traits did not seem to be linked with phylogeny.},

  abstract     = {In confined mesoscopic spaces, the unraveling of a catalytic mechanism with complex mass transfer and adsorption processes such as reactant enrichment is a great challenge. In this study, a hollow nanoarchitecture of MnO x -encapsulated Pt nanoparticles was designed as a nanoreactor to investigate the reactant enrichment in a mesoscopic hollow void. By employing advanced characterization techniques, we found that the reactant-enrichment behavior is derived from directional diffusion of the reactant driven through the local concentration gradient and this increased the amount of reactant. Combining experimental results with density functional theory calculations, the superior cinnamyl alcohol (COL) selectivity originates from the selective adsorption of cinnamaldehyde (CAL) and the rapid formation and desorption of COL in the MnO x shell. The superb performance of 95% CAL conversion and 95% COL selectivity is obtained at only 0.5 MPa H 2 and 40 min. Our findings showcase that a rationally designed nanoreactor could boost catalytic performance in chemoselective hydrogenation, which can be of great aid and potential in various application scenarios.},

Microalgae are fascinating photosynthetic organisms, which can directly convert solar energy into chemical energy and electrical energy. However, microalgal photosynthetic energy has not yet been applied on a large scale due to the limitation of their own characteristics. Researchers have been inspired to couple microalgae with synthetic materials via biomimetic assembly and the resulting microalgae–material hybrids have become more robust and even perform new functions. In the past decade, great progress has been made in microalgae–material hybrids, such as photosynthetic carbon dioxide fixation, photosynthetic hydrogen production, photoelectrochemical energy conversion and even biochemical energy conversion for biomedical therapy. The microalgae–material hybrid offers opportunities to promote artificially enhanced photosynthesis research and synchronously inspires investigation of biotic–abiotic interface manipulation. This review summarizes current construction methods of microalgae–material hybrids and highlights their implication in energy and health. Moreover, we discuss the current problems and future challenges for microalgae–material hybrids and the outlook for their development and applications. This review will provide inspiration for the rational design of the microalgae-based semi-natural biohybrid and further promote the disciplinary fusion of material science and biological science.},

In this work, we design and synthesize two porous aromatic frameworks (PAF) of PAF-CF 3 and PAF-C 2 F 5 using fluorine-containing alkyl based monomers in tetrahedral geometry. Both PAFs exhibit nanosized pores (∼1.0 nm) of high surface areas (over 800 m 2 g −1 ) and good fluorophilicity. Remarkable adsorption capacity (˃740 mg g −1 ) and superior efficiency (˃24 g mg −1 h −1 ) are achieved toward the removal of PFOA with 1 μg L −1 concentration owing to unique C–F···F–C interactions. In particular, PAF-CF 3 and PAF-C 2 F 5 are able to reduce the PFOA concentration in water to 37.9 ng L −1 and 43.3 ng L −1 , below EPA regulations (70 ng L −1 ). The reusability and high efficiency give both PAFs a great potential for sewage treatment.},

  abstract     = {Aziridines derived from bioactive molecules may have unique pharmacological activities, making them useful in pharmacology (e.g. mitomycin C). Furthermore, the substitution of the epoxide moiety in epothilone B with aziridine, an analog of epoxides, yielded a pronounced enhancement in its anticancer efficacy. Thus, there is interest in developing novel synthetic technologies to produce aziridines from bioactive molecules. However, known methods usually require metal catalysts, stoichiometric oxidants and/or pre-functionalized amination reagents, causing difficulty in application. A practical approach without a metal catalyst and extra-oxidant for the aziridination of bioactive molecules is in demand, yet challenging. Herein, we report an electro-oxidative flow protocol that accomplishes an oxidant-free aziridination of natural products. This process is achieved by an oxidative sulfonamide/alkene cross-coupling, in which sulfonamide and alkene undergo simultaneous oxidation or alkene is oxidized preferentially. Further anticancer treatments in cell lines have demonstrated the pharmacological activities of these aziridines, supporting the potential of this method for drug discovery.},

Under a spring warming of +1°C, xylem resumption advances by 2–4 days in trees, but delays by 3–8 days in shrubs. The divergent phenological response to warming was due to shrubs being 3.2 times more sensitive than trees to chilling accumulation. Warmer winters increased the thermal requirement for cambial reactivation in shrubs, leading to a delayed response to warmer springs. Our meta-analysis confirmed such a mechanism across continental scales. The warming-induced phenological mismatch may give a competitive advantage to trees over shrubs, which would provide a new explanation for increasing alpine treeline shifts under the context of climate change.},

Unfortunately, accurately characterizing the direction and lateral extents of the mantle flow field is notoriously difficult, especially in oceanic areas where deployment of ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) is expensive and thus rare. In this study, by applying shear wave splitting analyses to a dataset recorded by an OBS array that we deployed between mid-2019 and mid-2020 in the South China Sea (SCS), we show that the dominant mantle flow field has a NNW–SSE orientation, which can be attributed to mantle flow extruded from the Tibetan Plateau by the ongoing Indian–Eurasian collision. In addition, the results suggest that E–W oriented flow fields observed in South China and the Indochina Peninsula do not extend to the central SCS.},

The structural analyses revealed that 3 and 4 contain a one-coordinate bismuth atom supported by a Bi–C single σ bond. As a consequence, the remaining two Bi 6p orbitals are nearly degenerate, and 3 and 4 possess triplet ground states. Experimental characterizations with multinuclear magnetic resonance, magnetometry and near infrared spectroscopy coupled to wavefunction based ab initio calculations concurred to evidence that there exist giant and positive zero field splittings (&gt;4300 cm –1 ) in their S = 1 ground states.

  abstract     = {In the solar system, oldhamite (CaS) is generally considered to be formed by the condensation of solar nebula gas. Enstatite chondrites, one of the most important repositories of oldhamite, are believed to be representative of the material that formed Earth. Thus, the formation mechanism and the evolution process of oldhamite are of great significance to the deep understanding of the solar nebula, meteorites, the origin of Earth, and the C–O–S–Ca cycles of Earth. Until now, oldhamite has not been reported to occur in mantle rock. However, here we show the formation of oldhamite through the reaction between sulfide-bearing orthopyroxenite and molten CaCO 3 at 1.5 GPa/1510 K, 0.5 GPa/1320 K, and 0.3 GPa/1273 K. Importantly, this reaction occurs at oxygen fugacities within the range of upper-mantle conditions, six orders of magnitude higher than that of the solar nebula mechanism. Oldhamite is easily oxidized to CaSO 4 or hydrolysed to produce calcium hydroxide. Low oxygen fugacity of magma, extremely low oxygen content of the atmosphere, and the lack of a large amount of liquid water on the celestial body&#39;s surface are necessary for the widespread existence of oldhamite on the surface of a celestial body otherwise, anhydrite or gypsum will exist in large quantities. Oldhamites may exist in the upper mantle beneath mid-ocean ridges. Additionally, oldhamites may have been a contributing factor to the early Earth&#39;s atmospheric hypoxia environment, and the transient existence of oldhamites during the interaction between reducing sulfur-bearing magma and carbonate could have had an impact on the changes in atmospheric composition during the Permian–Triassic Boundary.},

  abstract     = {Inorganic aerogels have exhibited many superior characteristics with extensive applications, but are still plagued by a nearly century-old tradeoff between their mechanical and thermal properties. When reducing thermal conductivity by ultralow density, inorganic aerogels generally suffer from large fragility due to their brittle nature or weak joint crosslinking, while enhancing the mechanical robustness by material design and structural engineering, they easily sacrifice thermal insulation and stability. Here, we report a chemically bonded multi-nanolayer design and synthesis of a graphene/amorphous boron nitride aerogel to address this typical tradeoff to further enhance mechanical and thermal properties. Attributed to the chemically bonded interface and coupled toughening effect, our aerogels display a low density of 0.8 mg cm −3 with ultrahigh flexibility (elastic compressive strain up to 99% and bending strain up to 90%), and exceptional thermostability (strength degradation &lt;3% after sharp thermal shocks), as well as the lowest thermal conductivities in a vacuum (only 1.57 mW m −1 K −1 at room temperature and 10.39 mW m −1 K −1 at 500°C) among solid materials to date. This unique combination of mechanical and thermal properties offers an attractive material system for thermal superinsulation at extreme conditions.},

  abstract     = {Open-channel droplet arrays have attracted much attention in the fields of biochemical analysis, biofluid monitoring, biomarker recognition and cell interactions, as they have advantages with regard to miniaturization, parallelization, high-throughput, simplicity and accessibility. Such droplet arrays not only improve the sensitivity and accuracy of a biosensor, but also do not require sophisticated equipment or tedious processes, showing great potential in next-generation miniaturized sensing platforms. This review summarizes typical examples of open-channel microdroplet arrays and focuses on diversified biosensing integrated with multiple signal-output approaches (fluorescence, colorimetric, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), electrochemical, etc.). The limitations and development prospects of open-channel droplet arrays in biosensing are also discussed with regard to the increasing demand for biosensors.},

In particular, bit-level switchable memory that can be switched from rewritable to read-only function would allow end users to prevent important data being tampered with. However, no such switchable memory has been reported. We demonstrate that the rewritable function can be converted into read-only function by applying a sufficiently large current pulse in a U-shaped domain-wall memory, which comprises an asymmetric Pt/Co/Ru/AlO x heterostructure with strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Wafer-scale switchable magnetic domain-wall memory arrays on 4-inch Si/SiO 2 substrate are demonstrated. Furthermore, we confirm that the information can be stored in rewritable or read-only states at bit level according to the security needs of end users. Our work not only provides a solution for personal confidential data, but also paves the way for developing multifunctional spintronic devices.},

How can we encourage students in learning chemistry? How can we improve higher chemistry education so that students can truly grasp the basic chemical principles, increase their chemical skills and apply the learnt knowledge in their future careers?

  abstract     = {Male sterility in plants provides valuable breeding tools in germplasm innovation and hybrid crop production. However, genetic resources for dominant genic male sterility, which hold great promise to facilitate breeding processes, are extremely rare in natural germplasm. Here we characterized the Sanming Dominant Genic Male Sterility in rice and identified the gene SDGMS using a map-based cloning approach. We found that spontaneous movement of a 1978-bp long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon into the promoter region of the SDGMS gene activates its expression in anther tapetum, which causes abnormal programmed cell death of tapetal cells resulting in dominant male sterility. SDGMS encodes a ribosome inactivating protein showing N-glycosidase activity. The activation of SDGMS triggers transcription reprogramming of genes responsive to biotic stress leading to a hypersensitive response which causes sterility. The results demonstrate that an ectopic gene activation by transposon movement can give birth to a novel trait which enriches phenotypic diversity with practical utility.},

Here, we report a new cell type in angiosperms termed ‘contractile cells’ in the stigmas of the flowering plant Chirita pumila with a much-expanded rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Cryo-scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy analyses revealed that the RER is continuously distributed throughout the entirety of cells, confirmed by endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-specific fluorescent labeling, and is distinct from the common feature of plant ER. The RER is water-sensitive and extremely elongated with water absorption. We show that the contractile cells drive circadian stigma closing–bending movements in response to day-to-night moisture changes. RNA-seq analyses demonstrated that contractile cells have distinct molecular components. Furthermore, multiple microstructural changes in stigma movements convert an anti-selfing structure into a device promoting selfing—a unique cellular mechanism of reproductive adaptation for uncertain pollination environments.},

Here, we introduce a class of phase-transforming mechanical metamaterials (PMMs) that integrate the above properties. Periodically arranging basic actuating units according to the designed pattern configuration and positional relationship, PMMs can customize complex and diverse structures and deformations. Liquid–vapor phase transformation provides active reversible large deformation while a silicone matrix offers stretchability. The contained carbonyl iron powder endows PMMs with dynamically controllable shape-locking performance, thereby achieving magnetically assisted shape locking and energy storing in different working modes. We build a theoretical model and finite element simulation to guide the design process of PMMs, so as to develop a variety of PMMs with different functions suitable for different applications, such as a programmed PMM, reconfigurable antenna, soft lens, soft mechanical memory, biomimetic hand, biomimetic flytrap and self-contained soft gripper. PMMs are applicable to achieve various 2D deformations and 2D-to-3D deformations, and integrate multiple properties, including customizable structures and deformations, active reversible deformation, rapid reversible shape locking, adjustable energy storing and stretchability, which could open a new application avenue in soft robotics and flexible electronics.},

  abstract     = {Chemical stabilization of a high-pressure metastable state is a major challenge for the development of advanced materials. Although chemical pressure ( P chem ) can effectively simulate the effect of physical pressure ( P phy ), experimental calibration of the pressure passed to local structural motifs, denoted as local chemical pressure ( P chem- Δ ) which significantly governs the function of solid materials, remains absent due to the challenge of probing techniques. Here we establish an innovative methodology to experimentally calibrate the P chem- Δ and build a bridge between P chem and P phy via an optical probe strategy. Site-selective Bi 3+ -traced RE VO 4 ( RE = Y, Gd) is adopted as a prototype to introduce Bi 3+ optical probes and on-site sense of the P chem- Δ experienced by the RE O 8 motif. The cell compression of RE 0.98 Bi 0.02 VO 4 under P phy is chemically simulated by smaller-ion substitution (Sc 3+ → RE 3+ ) in RE 0.98- x Sc x Bi 0.02 VO 4 . The consistent red shift ( Δλ ) of the emission spectra of Bi 3+ , which is dominated by locally pressure-induced RE O 8 dodecahedral variation in RE 0.98 Bi 0.02 VO 4 ( P phy ) and RE 0.98- x Sc x Bi 0.02 VO 4 ( P chem- Δ ), respectively, is evidence of their similar pressure-dependent local structure evolution. This innovative Δλ -based experimental calibration of P chem- Δ in the crystal-field dimension portrays the anisotropic transmission of P chem to the local structure and builds a bridge between P chem- Δ and P phy to guide a new perspective for affordable and practical interception of metastable states.},

  abstract     = {Weather-adaptive energy harvesting of omnipresent waste heat and rain droplets, though promising in the field of environmental energy sustainability, is still far from practice due to its low electrical output owing to dielectric structure irrationality and unscalability. Here we present atypical upcycling of ambient heat and raindrop energy via an all-in-one non-planar energy harvester, simultaneously increasing solar pyroelectricity and droplet-based triboelectricity by two-fold, in contrast to conventional counterparts. The delivered non-planar dielectric with high transmittance confines the solar irradiance onto a focal hotspot, offering transverse thermal field propagation towards boosted inhomogeneous polarization with a generated power density of 6.1 mW m −2 at 0.2 sun. Moreover, the enlarged lateral surface area of curved architecture promotes droplet spreading/separation, thus travelling the electrostatic field towards increased triboelectricity. These enhanced pyroelectric and triboelectric outputs, upgraded with advanced manufacturing, demonstrate applicability in adaptive sustainable energy harvesting on sunny, cloudy, night, and rainy days. Our findings highlight a facile yet efficient strategy, not only for weather-adaptive environmental energy recovery but also in providing key insights for spatial thermal/electrostatic field manipulation in thermoelectrics and ferroelectrics.},

  abstract     = {Multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) are one of the major causes of male infertility and are characterized by multiple defects. In this study, we found that the coiled-coil domain-containing 189 ( Ccdc189 ) gene was predominantly expressed in mouse testes and that inactivation of the Ccdc189 gene caused male infertility. Histological studies revealed that most sperm from Ccdc189-deficient mice carried coiled, curved or short flagella, which are typical MMAF phenotypes. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that the CCDC189 protein was located at the radial spoke of the first peripheral microtubule doublet in the sperm axoneme. A CCDC189-interacting protein, CABCOCO1 (ciliary-associated calcium-binding coiled-coil protein 1), was discovered via co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, and inactivation of Cabcoco1 caused malformation of sperm flagella, which was consistent with findings obtained with Ccdc189-deficient mice. Further studies revealed that inactivation of CCDC189 caused downregulation of CABCOCO1 protein expression and that both CCDC189 and CABCOCO1 interacted with the radial-spoke-specific protein RSPH1 and intraflagellar transport proteins. This study demonstrated that Ccdc189 is a radial-spoke-associated protein and is involved in sperm flagellum formation through its interactions with CABCOCO1 and intraflagellar transport proteins.},

Although pre-implantation development of SCNT embryos has greatly improved, most SCNT blastocysts are still arrested at the peri-implantation stage, and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we develop a 3D in vitro culture system for SCNT peri-implantation embryos and discover that persistent Wnt signals block the naïve-to-primed pluripotency transition of epiblasts with aberrant H3K27me3 occupancy, which in turn leads to defects in epiblast transformation events and subsequent implantation failure. Strikingly, manipulating Wnt signals can attenuate the pluripotency transition and H3K27me3 deposition defects in epiblasts and achieve up to a 9-fold increase in cloning efficiency. Finally, single-cell RNA-seq analysis reveals that Wnt inhibition markedly enhances the lineage developmental trajectories of SCNT blastocysts during peri-implantation development. Overall, these findings reveal diminished potentials of SCNT blastocysts for lineage specification and validate a critical peri-implantation barrier for SCNT embryos.},

Herein, using monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) as a model system of non-metallic catalyst, the potential drops across the basal plane of MoS 2 (ΔV sem ) and the electric double layer (ΔV edl ) are decoupled quantitatively as a function of applied voltage through in-situ surface potential microscopy. We visualize the evolution of the band structure under liquid conditions and clarify the process of E F keeping moving deep into E c , revealing the formation process of the electrolyte gating effect. Additionally, electron transfer (ET) imaging reveals that the basal plane exhibits high ET activity, consistent with the results of surface potential measurements. The potential-dependent behavior of k f and n s in the ET reaction are further decoupled based on the measurements of ΔV sem and ΔV edl . Comparing the ET and hydrogen evolution reaction imaging results suggests that the low electrocatalytic activity of the basal plane is mainly due to the absence of active sites, rather than its electron transfer ability. This study fills an experimental gap in exploring driving forces for electrocatalysis at the nanoscale and addresses the long-standing issue of the inability to decouple charge transfer from catalytic processes.},

  abstract     = {Oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) involve a multistep proton-coupled electron process accompanied by the conversion of the apodictic spin configuration. Understanding the role of spin configurations of metals in the adsorption and desorption of oxygen intermediates during ORRs is critical for the design of efficient ORR catalysts. Herein, a platinum–rare-earth-metal-based alloy catalyst, Pt 2 Gd, is introduced to reveal the role of spin configurations in the catalytic activity of materials. The catalyst exhibits a unique intrinsic spin reconfiguration because of interactions between the Gd-4f and Pt-5d orbitals. The adsorption and desorption of the oxygen species are optimized by modifying the spin symmetry and electronic structures of the material for increased ORR efficiency. The Pt 2 Gd alloy exhibits a half-wave potential of 0.95 V and a superior mass activity of 1.5 A·mg Pt −1 in a 0.1 M HClO 4 electrolyte, as well as higher durability than conventional Pt/C catalysts. Theoretical calculations have proven that the spin shielding effect of Gd pairs increases the spin symmetry of Pt-5d orbitals and adsorption preferences toward spin-polarized intermediates to facilitate ORR. This work clarifies the impact of modulating the intrinsic spin state of Pt through the interaction with the local high spin 4f orbital electrons in rare-earth metals, with the aim of boosting the spin-related oxygen reduction reaction, thus fundamentally contributing to the understanding of new descriptors that control ORR activity.},

We use a 43-year record (from 1978 to 2020) of Antarctic snow melt seasons from space-borne microwave radiometers with a machine-learning algorithm to show that both the onset and the end of the melt season are being delayed. Granger-causality analysis shows that melt end is delayed due to increased heat flux from the ocean to the atmosphere at minimum sea-ice extent from warming oceans. Melt onset is Granger-caused primarily by the turbulent heat flux from ocean to atmosphere that is in turn driven by sea-ice variability. Delayed snowmelt season leads to a net decrease in the absorption of solar irradiance, as a delayed summer means that higher albedo occurs after the period of maximum solar radiation, which changes Antarctica&#39;s radiation balance more than sea-ice cover.},

  abstract     = {The North Atlantic Ocean hosts the largest volume of global subtropical mode waters (STMWs) in the world, which serve as heat, carbon and oxygen silos in the ocean interior. STMWs are formed in the Gulf Stream region where thermal fronts are pervasive and result in feedback with the atmosphere. However, their roles in STMW formation have been overlooked. Using eddy-resolving global climate simulations, we find that suppressing local frontal-scale ocean-to-atmosphere (FOA) feedback leads to STMW formation being reduced almost by half. This is because FOA feedback enlarges STMW outcropping, attributable to the mixed layer deepening associated with cumulative excessive latent heat loss due to higher wind speeds and greater air-sea humidity contrast driven by the Gulf Stream fronts. Such enhanced heat loss overshadows the stronger restratification induced by vertical eddies and turbulent heat transport, making STMW colder and heavier. With more realistic representation of FOA feedback, the eddy-present/rich coupled global climate models reproduce the observed STMWs much better than the eddy-free ones. Such improvement in STMW production cannot be achieved, even with the oceanic resolution solely refined but without coupling to the overlying atmosphere in oceanic general circulation models. Our findings highlight the need to resolve FOA feedback to ameliorate the common severe underestimation of STMW and associated heat and carbon uptakes in earth system models.},

  abstract     = {The successful development and application in industry of methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process brought about an innovative and efficient route for olefin production via non-petrochemical resources and also attracted attention of C1 chemistry and zeolite catalysis. Molecular sieve catalysts with diversified microenvironments embedding unique channel/cavity structure and acid properties, exhibit demonstrable features and advantages in the shape-selective catalysis of MTO. Especially, shape-selective catalysis over 8-MR and cavity-type zeolites with acidic supercage environment and narrow pore opening manifested special host–guest interaction between the zeolite catalyst and guest reactants, intermediates and products. This caused great differences in product distribution, catalyst deactivation and molecular diffusion, revealing the cavity-controlled methanol conversion over 8-MR and cavity-type zeolite catalyst. Furthermore, the dynamic and complicated cross-talk behaviors of catalyst material (coke)-reaction-diffusion over these types of zeolites determines the catalytic performance of the methanol conversion. In this review, we shed light on the cavity-controlled principle in the MTO reaction including cavity-controlled active intermediates formation, cavity-controlled reaction routes with the involvement of these intermediates in the complex reaction network, cavity-controlled catalyst deactivation and cavity-controlled diffusion. All these were exhibited by the MTO reaction performances and product selectivity over 8-MR and cavity-type zeolite catalysts. Advanced strategies inspired by the cavity-controlled principle were developed, providing great promise for the optimization and precise control of MTO process.},

Achieving sustainability and decarbonization of the downstream industry by integration with a methane-to-chemicals process may provide an opportunity to unlock the future for these technologies. Gas-to-chemicals is an efficient tool to boost the decarbonization potential of renewable energy. While the current implementation of carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies is of great importance for industrial decarbonization, a shift to greener CO 2 -free processes and CO 2 utilization from external sources for manufacturing valuable goods is highly preferred. This review outlines potential options for how a methane-to-chemicals process could support decarbonization of the downstream industry.},

To understand these effects at the molecular level, we systematically investigate the structures and capacitances of electric double layers with a variety of cations as counter charges at Pt(111)-CO ad /water interfaces with ab initio molecular dynamics. It is encouraging to find that the computed Helmholtz capacitances for different cations are in quantitative agreement with experiments, and that the trend of cation effects on capacitances shows clear correlation with the structures of interface cations of differing sizes and hydration energies. More importantly, we demonstrate the Helmholtz capacitance as the key descriptor for measuring the activity of CO-CO dimerization, the rate-determining step for C 2+ formation in electroreduction of CO and CO 2 . Our work provides atomistic insights into cation effects on electric double layers and electrocatalysis that are crucial for optimizing electrode and electrolyte materials.},

Herein, we identify that iridium-doped Sr 2 Fe 1.45 Ir 0.05 Mo 0.5 O 6-δ (SFIrM) perovskite displays a dynamic electrochemical reconstruction feature during CO 2 electrolysis with abundant exsolution of highly dispersed IrFe alloy nanoparticles on the SFIrM surface. The in situ reconstructed IrFe@SFIrM interfaces deliver a current density of 1.46 A cm −2 while maintaining over 99% CO Faradaic efficiency, representing a 25.8% improvement compared with the Sr 2 Fe 1.5 Mo 0.5 O 6-δ counterpart. In situ electrochemical spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations suggest that the improved CO 2 electrolysis activity originates from the facilitated formation of carbonate intermediates at the IrFe@SFIrM interfaces. Our work may open the possibility of using an in situ electrochemical poling method for CO 2 electrolysis in practice.},

  abstract     = {Fractional quantization can emerge in noncorrelated systems due to the parity anomaly, while its condensed matter realization is a challenging problem. We propose that in axion insulators (AIs), parity anomaly manifests a unique fractional boundary excitation: the half-quantized helical hinge currents. These helical hinge currents microscopically originate from the lateral Goos-Hänchen (GH) shift of massless side-surface Dirac electrons that are totally reflected from the hinges. Meanwhile, due to the presence of the massive top and bottom surfaces of the AI, the helical current induced by the GH shift is half-quantized. The semiclassical wave packet analysis uncovers that the hinge current has a topological origin and its half quantization is robust to parameter variations. Lastly, we propose an experimentally feasible six-terminal device to identify the half-quantized hinge channels by measuring the nonreciprocal conductances. Our results advance the realization of the half-quantization and topological magnetoelectric responses in AIs.},

Herein, NAC behavior is reported in palladium diselenide with a large magnitude and wide pressure range. We discover that, apart from the rigid flattening of layers that has been generally recognized, the unexpected giant NAC effect in PdSe 2 largely comes from anomalous elongation of intralayer chemical bonds. Both structural variations are driven by intralayer-to-interlayer charge transfer with enhanced interlayer interactions under pressure. Our work updates the mechanical understanding of this anomaly and establishes a new guideline to explore novel compression-induced properties.},

  abstract     = {The underlying principle of the unique dynamic adaptive adhesion capability of a rock-climbing fish ( Beaufortia kweichowensis ) that can resist a pull-off force of 1000 times its weight while achieving simultaneous fast sliding (7.83 body lengths per second (BL/S)) remains a mystery in the literature. This adhesion-sliding ability has long been sought for underwater robots. However, strong surface adhesion and fast sliding appear to contradict each other due to the need for high surface contact stress. The skillfully balanced mechanism of the tight surface adhesion and fast sliding of the rock-climbing fish is disclosed in this work. The Stefan force (0.1 mN/mm 2 ) generated by micro-setae on pectoral fins and ventral fins leads to a 70 N/m 2 adhesion force by conforming the overall body of the fish to a surface to form a sealing chamber. The pull-off force is neutralized simultaneously due to the negative pressure caused by the volumetric change of the chamber. The rock-climbing fish&#39;s micro-setae hydrodynamic interaction and sealing suction cup work cohesively to contribute to low friction and high pull-off-force resistance and can therefore slide rapidly while clinging to the surface. Inspired by this unique mechanism, an underwater robot is developed with incorporated structures that mimic the functionality of the rock-climbing fish via a micro-setae array attached to a soft self-adaptive chamber, a setup which demonstrates superiority over conventional structures in terms of balancing tight underwater adhesion and fast sliding.},

  abstract     = {Activation of inflammasomes—immune system receptor sensor complexes that selectively activate inflammatory responses—has been associated with diverse human diseases, and many nanomedicine studies have reported that structurally and chemically diverse inorganic nanomaterials cause excessive inflammasome activation. Here, in stark contrast to reports of other inorganic nanomaterials, we find that nickel-cobalt alloy magnetic nanocrystals (NiCo NCs) actually inhibit activation of NLRP3, NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasomes. We show that NiCo NCs disrupt the canonical inflammasome ASC speck formation process by downregulating the lncRNA Neat1 , and experimentally confirm that the entry of NiCo NCs into cells is required for the observed inhibition of inflammasome activation. Furthermore, we find that NiCo NCs inhibit neutrophil recruitment in an acute peritonitis mouse model and relieve symptoms in a colitis mouse model, again by inhibiting inflammasome activation. Beyond demonstrating a highly surprising and apparently therapeutic impact for an inorganic nanomaterial on inflammatory responses, our work suggests that nickel- and cobalt-containing nanomaterials may offer an opportunity to design anti-inflammatory nanomedicines for the therapeutics of macrophage-mediated diseases.},

Ferroelectric ceramics with a high piezoelectric coefficient are inherently brittle, whereas polar polymers exhibit a low piezoelectric coefficient. Here we report a highly stretchable/compressible piezoelectric composite composed of ferroelectric ceramic skeleton, elastomer matrix and relaxor ferroelectric-based hybrid at the ceramic/matrix interface as dielectric transition layers, exhibiting a giant piezoelectric coefficient of 250 picometers per volt, high electromechanical coupling factor k eff of 65%, ultralow acoustic impedance of 3MRyl and high cyclic stability under 50% compression strain. The superior flexibility and piezoelectric properties are attributed to the electric polarization and mechanical load transfer paths formed by the ceramic skeleton, and dielectric mismatch mitigation between ceramic fillers and elastomer matrix by the dielectric transition layer. The synergistic fusion of ultrahigh piezoelectric properties and superior flexibility in these polymer composites is expected to drive emerging applications in flexible smart electronics.},

  abstract     = {The stacking state of atomic layers critically determines the physical properties of twisted van der Waals materials. Unfortunately, precise characterization of the stacked interfaces remains a great challenge as they are buried internally. With conductive atomic force microscopy, we show that the moiré superlattice structure formed at the embedded interfaces of small-angle twisted multilayer graphene (tMLG) can noticeably regulate surface conductivity even when the twisted interfaces are 10 atomic layers beneath the surface. Assisted by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, a theoretical model is proposed to correlate surface conductivity with the sequential stacking state of the graphene layers of tMLG. The theoretical model is then employed to extract the complex structure of a tMLG sample with crystalline defects. Probing and visualizing the internal stacking structures of twisted layered materials is essential for understanding their unique physical properties, and our work offers a powerful tool for this via simple surface conductivity mapping.},

This study provides a detailed description of the heterogeneity of NATs and the differences between NATs and healthy livers and revealed that molecular features of tumor subgroups in HCC were partially reflected in their respective NATs. Proteomic data classified HCC NATs into two subtypes (Subtypes 1 and 2), and Subtype 2 was associated with poor prognosis and high-risk recurrence. The pathway and immune features of these two subtypes were characterized. Proteomic differences between the two NAT subtypes and healthy liver tissues were further investigated using data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry, revealing the early molecular alterations associated with the progression from healthy livers to NATs. This study provides a high-quality resource for HCC researchers and clinicians and may significantly expand the knowledge of tumor NATs to eventually benefit clinical practice.},

  abstract     = {Biophysical cues of the cellular microenvironment tremendously influence cell behavior by mechanotransduction. However, it is still unclear how cells sense and transduce the mechanical signals from 3D geometry to regulate cell function. Here, the mechanotransduction of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) triggered by 3D micropatterns and its effect on the paracrine of MSCs are systematically investigated. Our findings show that 3D micropattern force could influence the spatial reorganization of the cytoskeleton, leading to different local forces which mediate nucleus alteration such as orientation, morphology, expression of Lamin A/C and chromatin condensation. Specifically, in the triangular prism and cuboid micropatterns, the ordered F-actin fibers are distributed over and fully transmit compressive forces to the nucleus, which results in nuclear flattening and stretching of nuclear pores, thus enhancing the nuclear import of YES-associated protein (YAP). Furthermore, the activation of YAP significantly enhances the paracrine of MSCs and upregulates the secretion of angiogenic growth factors. In contrast, the fewer compressive forces on the nucleus in cylinder and cube micropatterns cause less YAP entering the nucleus. The skin repair experiment provides the first in vivo evidence that enhanced MSCs paracrine by 3D geometry significantly promotes tissue regeneration. The current study contributes to understanding the in-depth mechanisms of mechanical signals affecting cell function and provides inspiration for innovative design of biomaterials.},

Recently, metasurfaces have been explored as a prominent technological solution to the current paradigm of spectrum scarcity by opportunistically sharing the spectrum with various users. In general, metasurfaces are passive/dynamic, ultra-compact, multi-functional and programmable structures that are capable of both reciprocal and nonreciprocal signal-wave transmissions. The controllability and programmability of such metasurfaces are governed through DC bias and occasionally a radio-frequency modulation applied to the active components of the unit cells of the metasurface, e.g. diodes and transistors. This article overviews some of the recently proposed passive and dynamic metasurfaces and shows that metasurfaces can enhance the performance of wireless communication systems thanks to their unique physical features such as real-time signal coding, nonreciprocal-beam radiation, nonreciprocal beamsteering amplification and advanced pattern-coding multiple access communication.},

This Review focuses particular attention on five triatomic molecules—H 2 O, H 2 S, CO 2 , OCS and CS 2 . Each shows excitation wavelength-dependent dissociation dynamics, yielding photofragments that populate a range of electronic and (in the case of diatomic fragments) vibrational and rotational quantum states, which can be characterized by different translational spectroscopy methods. The photodissociation of an isolated molecule from a well-defined initial quantum state provides a lens through which one can investigate how and why chemical reactions occur, and provides numerous opportunities for fruitful, synergistic collaborations with high-level ab initio quantum chemists. The chosen molecules, their photofragments and the subsequent chemical reaction networks to which they can contribute are all crucial in planetary atmospheres and in interstellar and circumstellar environments. The aims of this Review are 3-fold: to highlight new photochemical insights enabled by the VUV-FEL at the DCLS, notably the recently recognized central atom elimination process that is shown to contribute in all of these triatomic molecules; to highlight some of the potential implications of this rich photochemistry to our understanding of interstellar chemistry and molecular evolution within the universe; and to highlight other and future research directions in areas related to chemical reaction dynamics and astrochemistry that will be enabled by increased access to VUV-FEL sources.},

Here we report a new type of zerovalent atom catalysts comprised of zerovalent Ir atoms highly dispersed and anchored on graphdiyne (Ir 0 /GDY) wherein the Ir 0 is stabilized by the incomplete charge transfer effect and the confined effect of GDY natural cavity. The Ir 0 /GDY can selectively and efficiently produce styrene oxides (SO) by electro-oxidizing styrene (ST) in aqueous solutions at ambient temperatures and pressures with high conversion efficiency of ∼100%, high SO selectivity of 85.5%, and high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 55%. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results show that the intrinsic activity and stability due to the incomplete charge transfer between Ir 0 and GDY effectively promoted the electron exchange between the catalyst and reactant molecule, and realized the selective epoxidation of ST to SO. Studies of the reaction mechanism demonstrate that Ir 0 /GDY proceeds a distinctive pathway for highly selective and active alkene-to-epoxide conversion from the traditional processes. This work presents a new example of constructing zerovalent metal atoms within the GDY matrix toward selective electrocatalytic epoxidation.},

  abstract     = {The two-dimensional (2D) material family can be regarded as the extreme externalization form of the matter in the planar 2D space. These atomically thin materials have abundant curvature structures, which will significantly affect their atomic configurations and physicochemical properties. Curvature engineering offers a new tuning freedom beyond the thoroughly studied layer number, grain boundaries, stacking order, etc. The precise control of the curvature geometry in 2D materials can redefine this material family. Special attention will be given to this emerging field and highlight possible future directions. With the step-by-step achievement in understanding the curvature engineering effect in 2D materials and establishing reliable delicate curvature controlling strategies, a brand-new era of 2D materials research could be developed.},

Here we developed a deaminase-free glycosylase-based guanine base editor (gGBE) with G editing ability, by fusing Cas9 nickase with engineered N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase protein (MPG). By several rounds of MPG mutagenesis via unbiased and rational screening using an intron-split EGFP reporter, we demonstrated that gGBE with engineered MPG could increase G editing efficiency by more than 1500 fold. Furthermore, this gGBE exhibited high base editing efficiency (up to 81.2%) and high G-to-T or G-to-C (i.e. G-to-Y) conversion ratio (up to 0.95) in both cultured human cells and mouse embryos. Thus, we have provided a proof-of-concept of a new base editing approach by endowing the engineered DNA glycosylase the capability to selectively excise a new type of substrate.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of the Ediacara biota soon after the Gaskiers glaciation ca. 580 million years ago (Ma) implies a possible glacial fuse for the evolution of animals. However, the timing of Ediacaran glaciation remains controversial because of poor age constraints on the ∼30 Ediacaran glacial deposits known worldwide. In addition, paleomagnetic constraints and a lack of convincing Snowball-like cap carbonates indicate that Ediacaran glaciations likely did not occur at low latitudes. Thus, reconciling the global occurrences without global glaciation remains a paradox. Here, we report that the large amplitude, globally synchronous ca. 571–562 Ma Shuram carbon isotope excursion occurs below the Ediacaran Hankalchough glacial deposit in Tarim, confirming a post-Shuram glaciation. Leveraging paleomagnetic evidence for a ∼90° reorientation of all continents due to true polar wander, and a non-Snowball condition that rules out low-latitude glaciations, we use paleogeographic reconstructions to further constrain glacial ages. Our results depict a ‘Great Ediacaran Glaciation’ occurring diachronously but continuously from ca. 580–560 Ma as different continents migrated through polar–temperate latitudes. The succession of radiation, turnover and extinction of the Ediacara biota strongly reflects glacial–deglacial dynamics.},

Herein, a phosphorothioate backbone modification strategy was applied to regulate the biomedical properties of pancreatic cancer cell–targeting aptamer for efficient in vivo drug delivery. Specifically, the CD71- targeting aptamer XQ-2d was modified into a fully thio-substituted aptamer S-XQ-2d, improving the plasma stability of S-XQ-2d and mitomycin C (MMC)-functionalized S-XQ-2d (MFSX), thus considerably prolonging their half-life in mice. Moreover, the binding and uptake capacities of S-XQ-2d were significantly enhanced. MFSX showed the same level of cytotoxicity as that of MMC against targeted cancer cells, but lower toxicity to non-targeted cells, highlighting its specificity and biosafety. Brief mechanistic studies demonstrated that XQ-2d and S-XQ-2d had different interaction modes and internalization pathways with the targeted cells.},

  abstract     = {Despite the mounting attention being paid to vegetation growth and their driving forces for water-limited ecosystems, the relative contributions of atmospheric and soil moisture dryness stress on vegetation growth are an ongoing debate. Here we comprehensively compare the impacts of high vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and low soil water content (SWC) on vegetation growth in Eurasian drylands during 1982–2014. The analysis indicates a gradual decoupling between atmospheric dryness and soil dryness over this period, as the former has expanded faster than the latter. Moreover, the VPD–SWC relation and VPD–greenness relation are both non-linear, while the SWC–greenness relation is near-linear. The loosened coupling between VPD and SWC, the non-linear correlations among VPD–SWC-greenness and the expanded area extent in which SWC acts as the dominant stress factor all provide compelling evidence that SWC is a more influential stressor than VPD on vegetation growth in Eurasian drylands. In addition, a set of 11 Earth system models projected a continuously growing constraint of SWC stress on vegetation growth towards 2100. Our results are vital to dryland ecosystems management and drought mitigation in Eurasia.},

Here, we investigate the resilience of human mobility under the disturbance of the unprecedented ‘720’ Zhengzhou flood in China in 2021 using records of 1.32 billion mobile phone signaling generated by 4.35 million people. We find that although pluvial floods can trigger mobility reductions, the overall structural dynamics of mobility networks remain relatively stable. We also find that the low levels of mobility resilience in female, adolescent and older adult groups are mainly due to their insufficient capabilities to maintain business-as-usual travel frequency during the flood. Most importantly, we reveal three types of counter-intuitive, yet widely existing, resilience patterns of human mobility (namely, ‘reverse bathtub’, ‘ever-increasing’ and ‘ever-decreasing’ patterns), and demonstrate a universal mechanism of disaster-avoidance response by further corroborating that those abnormal resilience patterns are not associated with people’s gender or age. In view of the common association between travel behaviors and travelers’ socio-demographic characteristics, our findings provide a caveat for scholars when disclosing disparities in human travel behaviors during flood-induced emergencies.},

Here we report the experimental detection of dark edge states in photonic quantum walks with spontaneously broken PT symmetry, thus providing a complete description of the topological phenomena therein. We experimentally confirm that the global Berry phase in PT -symmetric quantum-walk dynamics unambiguously defines topological invariants of the system in both the PT -symmetry-unbroken and -broken regimes. Our results establish a unified framework for characterizing topology in PT -symmetric quantum-walk dynamics, and provide a useful method to observe topological phenomena in PT -symmetric non-Hermitian systems in general.},

However, the band structure of a material can be either topologically trivial or non-trivial, depending on how the crystal structure is designed. Here, we propose a second Chern crystal in a four-dimensional parameter space by introducing two extra synthetic translation dimensions. Since the topology of the bulk bands in the synthetic translation space is intrinsically non-trivial, our proposed four-dimensional crystal is guaranteed to be topologically non-trivial regardless of the crystal&#39;s detailed configuration. We derive the topologically protected modes on the lower dimensional boundaries of such a crystal via dimension reduction. Remarkably, we observe the one-dimensional gapless dislocation modes and confirm their robustness in experiments. Our findings provide novel perspectives on topologically non-trivial crystals and may inspire designs of classical wave devices.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent indoor robotics is expected to rapidly gain importance in crucial areas of our modern society such as at-home health care and factories. Yet, existing mobile robots are limited in their ability to perceive and respond to dynamically evolving complex indoor environments because of their inherently limited sensing and computing resources that are, moreover, traded off against their cruise time and payload. To address these formidable challenges, here we propose intelligent indoor metasurface robotics (I2MR), where all sensing and computing are relegated to a centralized robotic brain endowed with microwave perception; and I2MR’s limbs (motorized vehicles, airborne drones, etc.) merely execute the wirelessly received instructions from the brain. The key aspect of our concept is the centralized use of a computation-enabled programmable metasurface that can flexibly mold microwave propagation in the indoor wireless environment, including a sensing and localization modality based on configurational diversity and a communication modality to establish a preferential high-capacity wireless link between the I2MR’s brain and limbs. The metasurface-enhanced microwave perception is capable of realizing low-latency and high-resolution three-dimensional imaging of humans, even around corners and behind thick concrete walls, which is the basis for action decisions of the I2MR’s brain. I2MR is thus endowed with real-time and full -context awareness of its operating indoor environment. We implement, experimentally, a proof-of-principle demonstration at ∼2.4 GHz, in which I2MR provides health-care assistance to a human inhabitant. The presented strategy opens a new avenue for the conception of smart and wirelessly networked indoor robotics.},

  abstract     = {Fabricating highly crystalline macroscopic films with extraordinary electrical and thermal conductivities from graphene sheets is essential for applications in electronics, telecommunications and thermal management. High-temperature graphitization is the only method known to date for the crystallization of all types of carbon materials, where defects are gradually removed with increasing temperature. However, when using graphene materials as precursors, including graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide and pristine graphene, even lengthy graphitization at 3000°C can only produce graphene films with small grain sizes and abundant structural disorders, which limit their conductivities. Here, we show that high-temperature defects substantially accelerate the grain growth and ordering of graphene films during graphitization, enabling ideal AB stacking as well as a 100-fold, 64-fold and 28-fold improvement in grain size, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, respectively, between 2000°C and 3000°C. This process is realized by nitrogen doping, which retards the lattice restoration of defective graphene, retaining abundant defects such as vacancies, dislocations and grain boundaries in graphene films at a high temperature. With this approach, a highly ordered crystalline graphene film similar to highly oriented pyrolytic graphite is fabricated, with electrical and thermal conductivities (∼2.0 × 10 4 S cm −1 ; ∼1.7 × 10 3 W m −1 K −1 ) that are improved by about 6- and 2-fold, respectively, compared to those of the graphene films fabricated by graphene oxide. Such graphene film also exhibits a superhigh electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness of ∼90 dB at a thickness of 10 μm, outperforming all the synthetic materials of comparable thickness including MXene films. This work not only paves the way for the technological application of highly conductive graphene films but also provides a general strategy to efficiently improve the synthesis and properties of other carbon materials such as graphene fibers, carbon nanotube fibers, carbon fibers, polymer-derived graphite and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite.},

  abstract     = {Attempting to couple photochemical CO 2 reduction with N 2 fixation is usually difficult, because the reaction conditions for these two processes are typically incompatible. Here, we report that a light-driven biohybrid system can utilize abundant, atmospheric N 2 to produce electron donors via biological nitrogen fixation, to achieve effective photochemical CO 2 reduction. This biohybrid system is constructed by incorporating molecular cobalt-based photocatalysts into N 2 -fixing bacteria. It is found that N 2 -fixing bacteria can convert N 2 into reductive organic nitrogen and create a localized anaerobic environment, which allows the incorporated photocatalysts to continuously perform photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under aerobic conditions. Specifically, the light-driven biohybrid system displays a high formic acid production rate of over 1.41 × 10 −14 mol h −1 cell −1 under visible light irradiation, and the organic nitrogen content undergoes an over-3-fold increase within 48 hours. This work offers a useful strategy for coupling CO 2 conversion with N 2 fixation under mild and environmentally benign conditions.},

  abstract     = {Non-linear materials are cornerstones of modern optics and electronics. Strong dependence on the intrinsic properties of particular materials, however, inhibits the at-will extension of demanding non-linear effects, especially those second-order ones, to widely adopted centrosymmetric materials (for example, silicon) and technologically important burgeoning spectral domains (for example, terahertz frequencies). Here we introduce a universal route to efficient non-linear responses enabled by exciting non-linear Thomson scattering, a fundamental process in electrodynamics that was known to occur only in relativistic electrons in metamaterial composed of linear materials. Such a mechanism modulates the trajectory of charges, either intrinsically or extrinsically provided in solids, at twice the driving frequency, allowing second-harmonic generation at terahertz frequencies on crystalline silicon with extremely large non-linear susceptibility in our proof-of-concept experiments. By offering a substantially material- and frequency-independent platform, our approach opens new possibilities in the fields of on-demand non-linear optics, terahertz sources, strong field light–solid interactions and integrated photonic circuits.},

However, the remaining challenges still limit their applications in systems with a large number of atoms, especially the complexity of conformational space and the cost of local optimizations for big systems. Here, we introduce a crystal structure prediction method, MAGUS, based on the evolutionary algorithm, which addresses the above challenges with machine learning and graph theory. Techniques used in the program are summarized in detail and benchmark tests are provided. With intensive tests, we demonstrate that on-the-fly machine-learning potentials can be used to significantly reduce the number of expensive first-principles calculations, and the crystal decomposition based on graph theory can efficiently decrease the required configurations in order to find the target structures. We also summarized the representative applications of this method on several research topics, including unexpected compounds in the interior of planets and their exotic states at high pressure and high temperature (superionic, plastic, partially diffusive state, etc.); new functional materials (superhard, high-energy-density, superconducting, photoelectric materials), etc. These successful applications demonstrated that MAGUS code can help to accelerate the discovery of interesting materials and phenomena, as well as the significant value of crystal structure predictions in general.},

However, because of the laborious process of materials data acquisition, ML models encounter the issue of the mismatch between a high dimension of feature space and a small sample size (for traditional ML models) or the mismatch between model parameters and sample size (for deep-learning models), usually resulting in terrible performance. Here, we review the efforts for tackling this issue via feature reduction, sample augmentation and specific ML approaches, and show that the balance between the number of samples and features or model parameters should attract great attention during data quantity governance. Following this, we propose a synergistic data quantity governance flow with the incorporation of materials domain knowledge. After summarizing the approaches to incorporating materials domain knowledge into the process of ML, we provide examples of incorporating domain knowledge into governance schemes to demonstrate the advantages of the approach and applications. The work paves the way for obtaining the required high-quality data to accelerate materials design and discovery based on ML.},

However, the important spatial–temporal characteristic of the precursor liquid still remains obscure because its real-time spreading process has not been directly observed. Here, we report that the spreading ionic liquid precursors in a silicon corner can be directly captured on video using in situ scanning electron microscopy. In situ spreading videos show that the precursor liquid spreads linearly over time ( ⁠ Δ L ∼ Δ T ⁠ ) rather than obeying the classic Lucas–Washburn law ( ⁠ l ∼ t 1 / 2 ⁠ ) and possesses a characteristic width of ∼250–310 nm. Theoretical analyses and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the unique behaviors of precursor liquids originate from the competing effect of van der Waals force and surface energy. These findings provide avenues for directly observing liquid/solid interfacial phenomena on a microscopic level.},

Traditional sustainability efforts often solved problems in one place at the cost of other places, compromising global sustainability. The metacoupling framework offers a conceptual foundation and a holistic approach to integrating human–nature interactions within a place, as well as between adjacent places and between distant places worldwide. Its applications show broad utilities for advancing sustainability science with profound implications for global sustainable development. They have revealed effects of metacoupling on the performance, synergies, and trade-offs of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) across borders and across local to global scales; untangled complex interactions; identified new network attributes; unveiled spatio-temporal dynamics and effects of metacoupling; uncovered invisible feedbacks across metacoupled systems; expanded the nexus approach; detected and integrated hidden phenomena and overlooked issues; re-examined theories such as Tobler&#39;s First Law of Geography; and unfolded transformations among noncoupling, coupling, decoupling, and recoupling. Results from the applications are also helpful to achieve SDGs across space, amplify benefits of ecosystem restoration across boundaries and across scales, augment transboundary management, broaden spatial planning, boost supply chains, empower small agents in the large world, and shift from place-based to flow-based governance. Key topics for future research include cascading effects of an event in one place on other places both nearby and far away. Operationalizing the framework can benefit from further tracing flows across scales and space, uplifting the rigor of causal attribution, enlarging toolboxes, and elevating financial and human resources. Unleashing the full potential of the framework will generate more important scientific discoveries and more effective solutions for global justice and sustainable development.},

Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we discover that the gas molecules induce a transition from STs into 1D chains. Based on density functional theory modeling, we propose that the atomistic mechanism involves the transformation of a stable 3-fold coordination Fe(C3PC) 3 motif to Fe(C3PC) 4 with an axially bonded CO molecule.

  abstract     = {Molecular ferroelectrics that have excellent ferroelectric properties, a low processing temperature, narrow bandgap, and which are lightweight, have shown great potential in the photovoltaic field. However, two-dimensional (2D) perovskite solar cells with high tunability, excellent photo-physical properties and superior long-term stability are limited by poor out-of-plane conductivity from intrinsic multi-quantum-well electronic structures. This work uses 2D molecular ferroelectric film as the absorbing layer to break the limit of multiple quantum wells. Our 2D ferroelectric solar cells achieve the highest open-circuit voltage (1.29 V) and the best efficiency (3.71%) among the 2D (n = 1) Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite solar cells due to the enhanced out-of-plane charge transport induced by molecular ferroelectrics with a strong saturation polarization, high Curie temperature and multiaxial characteristics. This work aims to break the inefficient out-of-plane charge transport caused by the limit of the multi-quantum-well electronic structure and improve the efficiency of 2D ferroelectric solar cells.},

Here, we describe Foxaspis novemura gen. et sp. nov., based on complete articulated remains from a newly discovered Konservat-Lagerstätte in the Early Devonian (Pragian, ∼410 Ma) of Guangxi, South China. F. novemura had a broad, circular dorso-ventrally compressed headshield, slender trunk and strongly asymmetrical hypochordal tail fin comprised of nine ray-like scale-covered digitations. This tail morphology contrasts with the symmetrical hypochordal tail fin of Tujiaaspis vividus , evidencing disparity in galeaspid postcranial anatomy. Analysis of swimming speed reveals galeaspids as moderately fast swimmers, capable of achieving greater cruising swimming speeds than their more derived jawless and jawed relatives. Our analyses reject the hypothesis of a driven trend towards increasingly active food acquisition which has been invoked to characterize early vertebrate evolution.},

Stable methanol space-time-yield (STY) of 12.8 mmol g cat -1 h -1 and methanol selectivity of 89.5% are simultaneously achieved at a relatively low reaction temperature of 513 K, making Cu@FAU a potential methanol synthesis catalyst from CO 2 hydrogenation. With zeolite-encaged mononuclear Cu centers as the destined active sites, the unique reaction pathway of stepwise CO 2 hydrogenation over Cu@FAU is illustrated. This work provides a clear example of catalytic reaction with explicit structure-activity relationship and highlights the power of zeolite catalysis in complex chemical transformations.},

Concurrent incorporation of both in-chain cleavable and functional groups into the PE chain is an effective pathway to overcome the non-degradable and non-polar issue; however, the method for achieving this pathway remains elusive. Here, we report a strictly non-alternating (&gt;99%) terpolymerization of ethylene with CO and fundamental polar monomers via a coordination–insertion mechanism using late transition metal catalysts, which effectively prevents the formation of undesired chelates originating from both co-monomers under a low CO concentration. High-molecular-weight linear PEs with both in-chain isolated keto (&gt;99%) and main-chain functional groups are prepared. The incorporation of key low-content isolated keto groups makes PEs photodegradable while retaining their desirable bulk material properties, and the introduction of polar functional groups considerably improves their surface properties.},

  abstract     = {Facing the need for transdisciplinary research to promote ecological restoration that achieves both social and ecological benefits, research on past restoration efforts that have directly or indirectly contributed to regional or national sustainable development warrants reassessment. Using China as an example, in this review, we address three basic research questions that can be summarized as follows: ecological restoration—of what, for whom and to what purpose? Accordingly, a ‘landscape pattern—ecosystem service—sustainable development’ co-evolutionary framework is proposed here to describe landscape-scale ecological restoration and its impact on landscape patterns and ecological processes, ecosystem services for human well-being, sustainable livelihoods and socioeconomic development. From the strategic pattern of national ecological security to the pattern of major projects to protect and restore major national ecosystems, the spatial pattern of China&#39;s ecological restoration is more geographically integrative. From major function-oriented zoning to systematic ecological protection and restoration, and for the purpose of achieving the Beautiful China Initiative, there are three stages of ecosystem services management: classification, synergy and integration, respectively. The difference in geographic processes should be considered in the key requirements of ecological restoration for China&#39;s five national strategies for regional sustainable-development strategies. Deepening understanding of the relationship between humans and nature in different geographical contexts is a scientific prerequisite to support policymaking related to ecological restoration. To promote greater harmony between humans and nature, we propose four important research directions: (i) understanding coupling processes among key components, (ii) identifying ecosystem service flows, (iii) evaluating social-ecological benefits and (iv) supporting adaptive management for regional sustainable development.},

To reconcile the needs for both human prosperity and healthy ecosystems, a more integrated understanding of key biophysical and adaptation processes is paramount in such dynamic and deeply entangled social and environmental contexts. Interdisciplinary research utilizing a network perspective provides a novel methodological and theoretical approach to that end. We review and synthesize recent network-centric studies, and use this network perspective to show how rangeland managers in a dynamic pastoral region in the Qinghai Province of China form social relationships based on geographic proximity, social status and shared grazing areas. The results indicate that adaption to biophysical and socioeconomic changes is partly a social process in that rangeland managers develop their adaptive capacity jointly and in concert with others they trust and with whom they share grazing areas. Avenues for further development of this network perspective, in terms of how it might contribute important new insights about how to sustainably use land in dynamic landscapes undergoing rapid change, are suggested.},

However, the complex relationship between the AFM signal and the investigated system makes it difficult to determine the atomic structure of such a complex system from AFM images alone. Using machine learning, we achieved precise identification of the atomic structures of interfacial water/ionic hydrates based on AFM images, including the position of each atom and the orientations of water molecules. Furthermore, it was found that structure prediction of ionic hydrates can be achieved cost-effectively by transfer learning using neural network trained with easily available interfacial water data. Thus, this work provides an efficient and economical methodology that not only opens up avenues to determine atomic structures of more complex systems from AFM images, but may also help to interpret other scientific studies involving sophisticated experimental results.},

We report new experimental constraints on two exotic spin-dependent interactions at the micrometer scale based on ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. A thin layer of NV electronic spin ensembles is synthesized as the solid-state spin quantum sensor, and a lead sphere is taken as the interacting nucleon source. Our result establishes new bounds for two types of exotic spin interactions at the micrometer scale. For an exotic parity-odd spin- and velocity-dependent interaction, improved bounds are set within the force range from 5 to 500 μm. The upper limit of the corresponding coupling constant |$g_A^eg_V^N$| at 330 μm is more than 1000-fold more stringent than the previous constraint. For the P, T -violating scalar-pseudoscalar nucleon-electron interaction, improved constraints are established within the force range from 6 to 45 μm. The limit of the corresponding coupling constant |$g_S^Ng_P^e$| is improved by more than one order of magnitude at 30 μm. This work demonstrates that a solid-state NV ensemble can be a powerful platform for probing exotic spin-dependent interactions.},

However, over the past few years, such an approach has been questioned due to several potential drawbacks, including the stringent parameter requirements, fundamental resolution limits and noise. Here, exploring the consequence of nonlinear gain saturation in exceptional singularities of non-Hermitian systems, we offer a feasible scheme to overcome all the above difficulties. We provide a simple and intuitive example by demonstrating with both theory and circuit experiments an ‘exceptional nexus’ (‘EX’), a HOEP with an ultra-enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), in only two coupled resonators with the aid of nonlinear gain. The tedious parameter tuning in a six-dimensional hyper-dimensional space is reduced to two dimensions. The feedback mechanism of nonlinear saturable gain can give a solution to the ongoing debate on the SNR of EPs in other linear systems. Our findings advance the fundamental understanding of the peculiar topology of nonlinear non-Hermitian systems, significantly reduce the practical difficulty in EP sensing and possibly open new avenues for applications.},

The subwavelength superscatterer is constructed by multi-layered concentric cylinders with an inhomogeneous depth profile. The superscatterer breaks the long-held single-channel scattering limit by several times and thus significantly enhances the total scattering strength. The underlying mechanism originates from the near degeneracy of the resonances of multiple channels. We fabricate the superscatterer prototype and experimentally measure the near-field patterns, which are consistent with theoretical prediction and numerical simulation.

  abstract     = {Sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx), a new generation of click chemistry, was first presented by Sharpless, Dong and co-workers in 2014. Owing to the high stability and yet efficient reactivity of the S VI –F bond, SuFEx has found widespread applications in organic synthesis, materials science, chemical biology and drug discovery. A diverse collection of SuFEx linkers has emerged, involving gaseous SO 2 F 2 and SOF 4 hubs; SOF 4 -derived iminosulfur oxydifluorides; O -, N - and C -attached sulfonyl fluorides and sulfonimidoyl fluorides; and novel sulfondiimidoyl fluorides. This review summarizes the progress of these SuFEx connectors, with an emphasis on analysing the advantages and disadvantages of synthetic strategies of these connectors based on the SuFEx concept, and it is expected to be beneficial to researchers to rapidly and correctly understand this field, thus inspiring further development in SuFEx chemistry.},

Mg 3 Sb 2 -based alloys have recently attracted considerable interest from the thermoelectric community due to their nontoxic nature, abundance of constituent elements and excellent mechanical and thermoelectric properties. However, robust modules based on Mg 3 Sb 2 have progressed less rapidly. Here, we develop multiple-pair thermoelectric modules consisting of both n-type and p-type Mg 3 Sb 2 -based alloys. Thermoelectric legs based on the same parent fit into each other in terms of thermomechanical properties, facilitating module fabrication and ensuring low thermal stress. By adopting a suitable diffusion barrier layer and developing a new joining technique, an integrated all-Mg 3 Sb 2 -based module demonstrates a high efficiency of 7.5% at a temperature difference of 380 K, exceeding the state-of-the-art same-parent thermoelectric modules. Moreover, the efficiency remains stable during 150 thermal cycling shocks (∼225 h), demonstrating excellent module reliability.},

  abstract     = {Human gastric cancer is a highly lethal disease, but the underlying multiomic molecular signatures remain largely unclear. Here, we performed multi-regional sampling, parallel single-cell multiomics sequencing and integrated analyses of human gastric cancer. We identified common transcriptomic alterations of gastric cancer cells, such as aberrant down-regulation of genes associated with normal stomach function and up-regulation of KRT7, PI3, S100A4 , etc. Surprisingly, aberrant and prevalent up-regulation of genes highly expressed in normal colorectal epithelial cells were also identified in cancer cells, which may be partially regulated by promoter chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation levels. We revealed the single-cell DNA methylome landscape of gastric cancer, and identified candidate DNA methylation biomarkers, such as hypermethylated promoters of TMEM240 and HAGLROS , and hypomethylated promoters of TRPM2-AS and HRH1. Additionally, the relationships between genetic lineages, DNA methylation and transcriptomic clusters were systematically revealed at single-cell level. We showed that DNA methylation heterogeneities were mainly among different genetic lineages of cancer cells. Moreover, we found that DNA methylation levels of cancer cells with poorer differentiation states tend to be higher than those of cancer cells with better differentiation states in the primary tumor within the same patient, although still lower than in normal gastric epithelial cells. Cancer cells with poorer differentiation states also prevalently down-regulated MUC1 expression and immune-related pathways, and had poor infiltration of CD8 + T cells. Our study dissected the molecular signatures of intratumoral heterogeneities and differentiation states of human gastric cancer using integrative single-cell multiomics analyses.},

  abstract     = {Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has exhibited great utility in the early and rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2. However, the efficacy of wastewater surveillance under China&#39;s previous strict epidemic prevention policy remains to be described. We collected the WBE data of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the Third People&#39;s Hospital of Shenzhen and several communities to determine the significant effectiveness of routine wastewater surveillance in monitoring the local spread of SARS-CoV-2 under tight containment of the epidemic. The results of 1 month of continuous wastewater surveillance showed that positive signals for SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected in the wastewater samples, and a significant positive correlation was observed between the virus concentration and the number of daily cases. In addition, the community&#39;s domestic wastewater surveillance results were confirmed even 3 days before, or simultaneously with, the infected patient being confirmed as having the virus. Meanwhile, an automated sewage virus detection robot, ShenNong No.1 robot, was developed, showing a high degree of agreement with experimental data, offering the possibility of large-scale multi-point surveillance. Overall, our results illustrated the clear indicative role of wastewater surveillance in combating COVID-19 and provided a practical basis for rapidly expanding the feasibility and value of routine wastewater surveillance for future emerging infectious diseases.},

Here we construct ternary OSCs by introducing an asymmetric small molecule acceptor AITC into PBDB-TCl : BTP-eC9 system and demonstrate the effectiveness in simultaneously decreasing energy disorder and non-radiative voltage losses. It is found that the introduction of AITC can modify domain size and increase the degree of crystallinity, which enhances open-circuit voltage and power conversion efficiency (19.1%, certified as 18.9%). Inspiringly, an output efficiency of 20.6% of the constructed tandem OSCs based on PBDB-TCl : AITC : BTP-eC9 ternary active layer output a recorded efficiency of 20.6% (certified as 20.3%), which is the highest value in OSCs field to date. This work demonstrates that decreasing the voltage losses by ternary strategy and constructing of tandem architecture are effective approaches towards improving photovoltaic performance.},

  abstract     = {Thermally activated ultrafast diffusion, collision and combination of metal atoms comprise the fundamental processes of synthesizing burgeoning subnanometer metal clusters for diverse applications. However, so far, no method has allowed the kinetically controllable synthesis of subnanometer metal clusters without compromising metal loading. Herein, we have developed, for the first time, a graphene-confined ultrafast radiant heating (GCURH) method for the synthesis of high-loading metal cluster catalysts in microseconds, where the impermeable and flexible graphene acts as a diffusion-constrained nanoreactor for high-temperature reactions. Originating from graphene-mediated ultrafast and efficient laser-to-thermal conversion, the GCURH method is capable of providing a record-high heating and cooling rate of ∼10 9 °C/s and a peak temperature above 2000°C, and the diffusion of thermally activated atoms is spatially limited within the confinement of the graphene nanoreactor. As a result, due to the kinetics-dominant and diffusion-constrained condition provided by GCURH, subnanometer Co cluster catalysts with high metal loading up to 27.1 wt% have been synthesized by pyrolyzing a Co-based metal-organic framework (MOF) in microseconds, representing one of the highest size-loading combinations and the quickest rate for MOF pyrolysis in the reported literature. The obtained Co cluster catalyst not only exhibits an extraordinary activity similar to that of most modern multicomponent noble metal counterparts in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction, but is also highly convenient for catalyst recycling and refining due to its single metal component. Such a novel GCURH technique paves the way for the kinetically regulated, limited diffusion distance of thermally activated atoms, which in turn provides enormous opportunities for the development of sophisticated and environmentally sustainable metal cluster catalysts.},

These models can meet the needs of multiscale interaction studies with different computational costs. Here we describe the progress of SW-HRESMs development, with an overview of the major advancements made by the international Earth science community in HR-ESMs. We also show the preliminary results of SW-HRESMs with regard to capturing major weather-climate extremes in the atmosphere and ocean, stressing the importance of permitted clouds and ocean submesoscale eddies in modeling tropical cyclones and eddy-mean flow interactions, and paving the way for further model development to resolve finer scales with even higher resolution and more realistic physics. Finally, in addition to increasing model resolution, the development procedure for a non-hydrostatic cloud and ocean submesoscale resolved ESM is discussed, laying out the major scientific directions of such a huge modeling advancement.},

During its first 110 sols, Zhurong investigated and categorized surface targets into igneous rocks, lithified duricrusts, cemented duricrusts, soils and sands. The lithified duricrusts, analysed by using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy onboard Zhurong, show elevated water contents and distinct compositions from those of igneous rocks. The cemented duricrusts are likely formed via water vapor–frost cycling at the atmosphere–soil interface, as supported by the local meteorological conditions. Soils and sands contain elevated magnesium and water, attributed to both hydrated magnesium salts and adsorbed water. The compositional and meteorological evidence indicates potential Amazonian brine activities and present-day water vapor cycling at the soil–atmosphere interface. Searching for further clues to water-related activities and determining the water source by Zhurong are critical to constrain the volatile evolution history at the landing site.},

We show that coal records were associated with a median temperature of 25°C and precipitation of 1300 mm yr −1 before 250 Ma. Afterwards, coal records appeared with temperatures between 0°C and 21°C and precipitation of 900 mm yr −1 . Evaporite records were associated with a median temperature of 27°C and precipitation of 800 mm yr −1 . The most remarkable result is that net precipitation associated with coal and evaporite records remained constant across time. The results here have important implications for quantifying climate conditions for other lithologic indicators of climate and for predicting exogenetic ore deposits.},

We directly observed dual radicals for a single crystal using high-field/-frequency (∼13.3 T and ∼360 GHz) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy along the c -axis, which was further confirmed by angle-dependent Q-band EPR spectroscopy. Moreover, a conductive anomaly close to the VT transition temperature was observed only when probes were attached at the ab plane of the single crystal, indicative of synergy between valence tautomerism and conductivity. Structural anisotropy studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that this synergy is due to electron transfer associated with valence tautomerism. This study presents the first example of dual-radical-based molecular anisotropy and charge-transfer-induced conductive anisotropy in a photoswitchable coordination polymer.},

Mott insulator-to-metal transition can be driven by chemical doping, external pressure, temperature and gate voltage, which is often seen in transition metal oxides with 3d electrons near the Fermi energy (e.g. cuprate superconductor). In 4f -electron systems, however, the insulator-to-metal transition is mostly driven by Kondo hybridization and the Mott physics has rarely been explored in experiments. Here, by combining the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and strongly correlated band structure calculations, we show that an unusual Mott instability exists in YbInCu 4 accompanying its mysterious first-order valence transition. This contrasts with the prevalent Kondo picture and demonstrates that YbInCu 4 is a unique platform to explore the Mott physics in Kondo lattice systems.

However, the ability to manipulate coherent structures in turbulent flows is much less explored. This article reviews a recently discovered mechanism of tuning turbulent heat transport via coherent structure manipulation. We first show how this mechanism can be realized by applying simple geometrical confinement to a classical thermally driven turbulence, which leads to the condensation of elementary coherent structures and significant heat-transport enhancement, despite the resultant slower flow. Some potential applications of this new paradigm in passive heat management are also discussed. We then explain how the heat transport behaviors in seemingly different turbulence systems can be understood by this unified framework of coherent structure manipulation. Several future directions in this research area are also outlined.},

  abstract     = {Sulfur-based aqueous batteries (SABs) are deemed promising candidates for safe, low-cost, and high-capacity energy storage. However, despite their high theoretical capacity, achieving high reversible value remains a great challenge due to the thermodynamic and kinetics problems of elemental sulfur. Here, the reversible six-electron redox electrochemistry is constructed by activating the sulfur oxidation reaction (SOR) process of the elaborate mesocrystal NiS 2 (M-NiS 2 ). Through the unique 6e − solid-to-solid conversion mechanism, SOR efficiency can reach an unprecedented degree of ca. 96.0%. The SOR efficiency is further revealed to be closely associated with the kinetics feasibility and thermodynamic stability of the M-NiS 2 intermedium in the formation of elemental sulfur. Benefiting from the boosted SOR, compared with the bulk electrode, the M-NiS 2 electrode exhibits a high reversible capacity (1258 mAh g −1 ), ultrafast reaction kinetics (932 mAh g −1 at 12 A g −1 ), and long-term cyclability (2000 cycles at 20 A g −1 ).

  abstract     = {Starting from Landau’s kinetic equation, we show that an electronic liquid in d = 2, 3 spatial dimensions depicted by a Landau-type effective theory will become incompressible on condition that the Landau parameters satisfy either (i) 1 + F 1 s / d = 0 or (ii) F 0 s → + ∞ ⁠ . Condition (i) is the Pomeranchuk instability in the current channel and suggests a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state with a spinon Fermi surface; while condition (ii) means that the strong repulsion in the charge channel leads to a conventional charge and thermal insulator. In the collisionless regime (ωτ ≫ 1) and the hydrodynamic regime (ωτ ≪ 1), the zero and first sound modes have been studied and classified by symmetries, including the longitudinal and transverse modes in d = 2, 3 and the higher angular momentum modes in d = 3. The sufficient (and/or necessary) conditions of these collective modes have been revealed. It has been demonstrated that some of these collective modes will behave in quite different manners under incompressibility condition (i) or (ii). Possible nematic QSL states and a hierarchy structure for gapless QSL states have been proposed in d = 3.},

  abstract     = {Acoustic metamaterials have been widely investigated over the past few decades and have realized acoustic parameters that are not achievable using conventional materials. After demonstrating that locally resonant acoustic metamaterials are capable of acting as subwavelength unit cells, researchers have evaluated the possibility of breaking the classical limitations of the material mass density and bulk modulus. Combined with theoretical analysis, additive manufacturing and engineering applications, acoustic metamaterials have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities, including negative refraction, cloaking, beam formation and super-resolution imaging. Owing to the complexity of impedance boundaries and mode transitions, there are still challenges in freely manipulating acoustic propagation in an underwater environment. This review summarizes the developments in underwater acoustic metamaterials over the past 20 years, which include underwater acoustic invisibility cloaking, underwater beam formation, underwater metasurfaces and phase engineering, underwater topological acoustics and underwater acoustic metamaterial absorbers. With the evolution of underwater metamaterials and the timeline of scientific advances, underwater acoustic metamaterials have demonstrated exciting applications in underwater resource development, target recognition, imaging, noise reduction, navigation and communication.},

Species diversity, genetic diversity and phylogenetic diversity, which reflect the number, evolutionary potential and evolutionary history of species in ecosystem functioning, are three important dimensions of biodiversity. Marine-protected areas have been demonstrated as an effective area-based tool for protecting marine biodiversity, but only 2.8% of the ocean has been fully protected. It is urgent to identify global conservation priority areas and percentage of the ocean across multiple dimensions of biodiversity based on Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. Here, we investigate the spatial distribution of marine genetic and phylogenetic diversity using 80 075 mitochondrial DNA barcode sequences from 4316 species and a newly constructed phylogenetic tree of 8166 species. We identify that the Central Indo-Pacific Ocean, Central Pacific Ocean and Western Indian Ocean harbor high levels of biodiversity across three dimensions of biodiversity, which could be designated as conservation priority areas. We also find that strategically protecting ∼22% of the ocean would allow us to reach the target of conserving ∼95% of currently known taxonomic, genetic and phylogenetic diversity. Our study provides insights into the spatial distribution pattern of multiple marine diversities and the findings would help to design comprehensive conservation schemes for global marine biodiversity.},

  abstract     = {SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have been thought to originate from bats. In this study, we screened pharyngeal and anal swabs from 13 064 bats collected between 2016 and 2021 at 703 locations across China for sarbecoviruses, covering almost all known southern hotspots, and found 146 new bat sarbecoviruses. Phylogenetic analyses of all available sarbecoviruses show that there are three different lineages—L1 as SARS-CoV-related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs), L2 as SARS-CoV-2-related CoVs (SC2r-CoVs) and novel L-R (recombinants of L1 and L2)—present in Rhinolophus pusillus bats, in the mainland of China. Among the 146 sequences, only four are L-Rs. Importantly, none belong in the L2 lineage, indicating that circulation of SC2r-CoVs in China might be very limited. All remaining 142 sequences belong in the L1 lineage, of which YN2020B-G shares the highest overall sequence identity with SARS-CoV (95.8%). The observation suggests endemic circulations of SARSr-CoVs, but not SC2r-CoVs, in bats in China. Geographic analysis of the collection sites in this study, together with all published reports, indicates that SC2r-CoVs may be mainly present in bats of Southeast Asia, including the southern border of Yunnan province, but absent in all other regions within China. In contrast, SARSr-CoVs appear to have broader geographic distribution, with the highest genetic diversity and sequence identity to human sarbecoviruses along the southwest border of China. Our data provide the rationale for further extensive surveys in broader geographical regions within, and beyond, Southeast Asia in order to find the most recent ancestors of human sarbecoviruses.},

However, its development has been hindered by the inadequate understanding of the synergy between the electrochemical and non-electrochemical steps. In this study, we unravel the NOR mechanism for the primary alcohol/vicinal diol electrooxidation on NiO. Thereinto, the electrochemical step is the generation of Ni 3+ -(OH) ads , and the spontaneous reaction between Ni 3+ -(OH) ads and nucleophiles is an electrocatalyst-induced non-electrochemical step. We identify that two electrophilic oxygen-mediated mechanisms (EOMs), EOM involving hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and EOM involving C–C bond cleavage, play pivotal roles in the electrooxidation of primary alcohol to carboxylic acid and the electrooxidation of vicinal diol to carboxylic acid and formic acid, respectively. Based on these findings, we establish a unified NOR mechanism for alcohol electrooxidation and deepen the understanding of the synergy between the electrochemical and non-electrochemical steps during NOR, which can guide the sustainable electrochemical synthesis of organic chemicals.},

Synthetic Chromosome Rearrangement and Modification by LoxP-mediated Evolution (SCRaMbLE) is an evolutionary system intrinsic to the synthetic yeast genome that can rapidly drive structural variations. Here, we detect over 260 000 rearrangement events after the SCRaMbLEing of a yeast strain harboring 5.5 synthetic yeast chromosomes (synII, synIII, synV, circular synVI, synIXR and synX). Remarkably, we find that the rearrangement events exhibit a specific landscape of frequency. We further reveal that the landscape is shaped by the combined effects of chromatin accessibility and spatial contact probability. The rearrangements tend to occur in 3D spatially proximal and chromatin-accessible regions. The enormous numbers of rearrangements mediated by SCRaMbLE provide a driving force to potentiate directed genome evolution, and the investigation of the rearrangement landscape offers mechanistic insights into the dynamics of genome evolution.},

  abstract     = {Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is an important part in the research of modern luminescent materials and photoelectric devices. Usually, chiral molecules or chiral structures are the key factors to induce CPL spontaneous emission. In this study, a scale-effect model based on scalar theory was proposed to better understand the CPL signal of luminescent materials. Besides chiral structures being able to induce CPL, achiral ordered structures can also have a significant influence on CPL signals. These achiral structures are mainly reflected in the particle scale in micro-order or macro-order, i.e. the CPL signal measured under most conditions depends on the scale of the ordered medium, and does not reflect the inherent chirality of the excited state of the luminescent molecule. This kind of influence is difficult to be eliminated by simple and universal strategies in macro-measurement. At the same time, it is found that the measurement entropy of CPL detection may be the key factor to determine the isotropy and anisotropy of the CPL signal. This discovery would bring new opportunities to the research of chiral luminescent materials. This strategy can also greatly reduce the development difficulty of CPL materials and show high application potential in biomedical, photoelectric information and other fields.},

Proof-of-concept experiments using C 3 N 4 nanosheets as a representative piezoelectric catalyst with wide band gap and high biosafety have verified that sonocatalytically generated H 2 and holes rapidly penetrate into biofilm to inhibit bacterial energy metabolism and oxidatively deprive polysaccharides/NADH in biofilm to destroy the bacterial membrane/electron transport chain, respectively, inside/outside-cooperatively eradicating biofilm. A bacteria-infected diabetic wound model is used to confirm the excellent in vivo antibacterial performance of sonocatalytic hydrogen/hole-combined therapy, remarkably improving bacteria-infected diabetic wound healing. The proposed strategy of sonocatalytic hole/hydrogen-combined ‘inside/outside-cooperation’ will make a highway for treatment of deep-seated biofilm infection.},

  abstract     = {The spontaneous formation of self-assembly monolayer (SAM) on various substrates represents an effective strategy for interfacial engineering of optoelectronic devices. Hole-selective SAM is becoming popular among high-performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the presence of strong acidic anchors (such as –PO 3 H 2 ) in state-of-the-art SAM is detrimental to device stability. Herein, we report for the first time that acidity-weakened boric acid can function as an alternative anchor to construct efficient SAM-based hole-selective contact (HSC) for PSCs. Theoretical calculations reveal that boric acid spontaneously chemisorbs onto indium tin oxide (ITO) surface with oxygen vacancies facilitating the adsorption progress. Spectroscopy and electrical measurements indicate that boric acid anchor significantly mitigates ITO corrosion. The excess boric acid containing molecules improves perovskite deposition and results in a coherent and well-passivated bottom interface, which boosts the fill factor (FF) performance for a variety of perovskite compositions. The optimal boric acid-anchoring HSC ( MTPA-BA ) can achieve power conversion efficiency close to 23% with a high FF of 85.2%. More importantly, the devices show improved stability: 90% of their initial efficiency is retained after 2400 h of storage (ISOS-D-1) or 400 h of operation (ISOS-L-1), which are 5-fold higher than those of phosphonic acid SAM-based devices. Acidity-weakened boric acid SAMs, which are friendly to ITO, exhibits well the great potential to improve the stability of the interface as well as the device.},

  abstract     = {Identifying the thresholds of drought that, if crossed, suppress vegetation functioning is vital for accurate quantification of how land ecosystems respond to climate variability and change. We present a globally applicable framework to identify drought thresholds for vegetation responses to different levels of known soil-moisture deficits using four remotely sensed vegetation proxies spanning 2001–2018. The thresholds identified represent critical inflection points for changing vegetation responses from highly resistant to highly vulnerable in response to drought stress, and as a warning signal for substantial vegetation impacts. Drought thresholds varied geographically, with much lower percentiles of soil-moisture anomalies in vegetated areas covered by more forests, corresponding to a comparably stronger capacity to mitigate soil water deficit stress in forested ecosystems. Generally, those lower thresholds are detected in more humid climates. State-of-the-art land models, however, overestimated thresholds of soil moisture (i.e. overestimating drought impacts), especially in more humid areas with higher forest covers and arid areas with few forest covers. Based on climate model projections, we predict that the risk of vegetation damage will increase by the end of the twenty-first century in some hotspots like East Asia, Europe, Amazon, southern Australia and eastern and southern Africa. Our data-based results will inform projections on future drought impacts on terrestrial ecosystems and provide an effective tool for drought management.},

  abstract     = {A decade ago, a group of researchers from academia and industry identified a dichotomy between the industrial and academic state-of-the-art in upper-limb prosthesis control, a widely used bio-robotics application. They proposed that four key technical challenges, if addressed, could bridge this gap and translate academic research into clinically and commercially viable products. These challenges are unintuitive control schemes, lack of sensory feedback, poor robustness and single sensor modality. Here, we provide a perspective review on the research effort that occurred in the last decade, aiming at addressing these challenges. In addition, we discuss three research areas essential to the recent development in upper-limb prosthetic control research but were not envisioned in the review 10 years ago: deep learning methods, surface electromyogram decomposition and open-source databases. To conclude the review, we provide an outlook into the near future of the research and development in upper-limb prosthetic control and beyond.},

  abstract     = {Physical characteristics of terrains, such as softness and friction, provide essential information for legged robots to avoid non-geometric obstacles, like mires and slippery stones, in the wild. The perception of such characteristics often relies on tactile perception and vision prediction. Although tactile perception is more accurate, it is limited to close-range use; by contrast, establishing a supervised or self-supervised contactless prediction system using computer vision requires adequate labeled data and lacks the ability to adapt to the dynamic environment. In this paper, we simulate the behavior of animals and propose an unsupervised learning framework for legged robots to learn the physical characteristics of terrains, which is the first report to manage it online, incrementally and with the ability to solve cognitive conflicts. The proposed scheme allows robots to interact with the environment and adjust their cognition in real time, therefore endowing robots with the adaptation ability. Indoor and outdoor experiments on a hexapod robot are carried out to show that the robot can extract tactile and visual features of terrains to create cognitive networks independently; an associative layer between visual and tactile features is created during the robot’s exploration; with the layer, the robot can autonomously generate a physical segmentation model of terrains and solve cognitive conflicts in an ever-changing environment, facilitating its safe navigation.},

Although about 100 binary borides have been explored, only a few of them show superconductivity with relatively low T c . In this work, we report the discovery of superconductivity up to 32 K, which is the highest T c in transition-metal borides, in MoB 2 under pressure. The T c of MoB 2 in the α phase can be well explained by theoretical calculations in the framework of electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, the coupling between the d electrons of Mo and the out-of-plane Mo-phonon modes are the main driving force of the 32 K superconductivity of MoB 2 . Our study sheds light on the exploration of high- T c superconductors in transition metal borides.},

This is known as bacteria-mediated cancer therapy (BMCT). Tumor invasion, colonization and tumor regression are major biological events, which are directly associated with antitumor effects and are uncontrollable due to the influence of tumor microenvironments during the BMCT process. Here, we developed a genetic circuit for dynamically programming bacterial lifestyles (planktonic, biofilm or lysis), to precisely manipulate the process of bacterial adhesion, colonization and drug release in the BMCT process, via hierarchical modulation of the lighting power density of near-infrared (NIR) light. The deep tissue penetration of NIR offers us a modality for spatio-temporal and non-invasive control of bacterial genetic circuits in vivo . By combining computational modeling with a high-throughput characterization device, we optimized the genetic circuits in engineered bacteria to program the process of bacterial lifestyle transitions by altering the illumination scheme of NIR. Our results showed that programming intratumoral bacterial lifestyle transitions allows precise control of multiple key steps throughout the BMCT process and therapeutic efficacy can be greatly improved by controlling the localization and dosage of therapeutic agents via optimizing the illumination scheme.},

How vegetation responds to natural and human activity still needs to be well established, quantified and understood. Recent satellite missions providing hydrologic and ecological indicators enable better monitoring of Earth system changes, yet there is no automatic way to address this issue directly from observations. Here, we develop an observation-based methodology to capture evidence of changes in global terrestrial ecosystems and attribute these changes to natural or anthropogenic activity. We use the longest time record of global microwave L-band soil moisture and vegetation optical depth as satellite data and build spatially explicit maps of change in soil and vegetation water content and biomass reflecting large ecosystem changes during the last decade, 2010–20. Regions of prominent trends (from |$-8\%$| to 9% per year) are observed, especially in humid and semi-arid climates. We further combine such trends with land cover change maps, vegetation greenness and precipitation variability to assess their relationship with major documented ecosystem changes. Several regions emerge from our results. They cluster changes according to human activity drivers, including deforestation (Amazon, Central Africa) and wildfires (East Australia), artificial reforestation (South-East China), abandonment of farm fields (Central Russia) and climate shifts related to changes in precipitation variability (East Africa, North America and Central Argentina). Using the high sensitivity of soil and vegetation water content to ecosystem changes, microwave satellite observations enable us to quantify and attribute global vegetation responses to climate or anthropogenic activities as a direct measure of environmental changes and the mechanisms driving them.},

  abstract     = {Continental deep subduction after the closure of large oceanic basins is commonly ascribed to the gravitational pull of the subducting oceanic slab. However, it is not clear how continental lithosphere adjacent to small oceanic basins was subducted to mantle depths. The Sesia Zone in the Western Alps provides an excellent target for exploration of subduction dynamics in such a tectonic setting. Here we report the first finding of coesite in a jadeite-bearing orthogneiss from the Sesia Zone, providing the first evidence for deep subduction of the continental crust to mantle depths for ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphism in this zone. Three coesite inclusions were identified by laser Raman spectroscopy in two garnet grains. Based on zircon U-Pb dating and trace element analysis, the UHP metamorphic age was constrained to be 76.0 ± 1.0 Ma. The phase equilibrium modeling yields peak metamorphic pressures of 2.8–3.3 GPa, demonstrating the continental deep subduction to mantle depths of &gt;80 km. The subducted continental crust was a rifted hyperextended continental margin, which was converted to the passive continental margin during seafloor spreading and then deeply subducted during the oblique convergence between the Adria microplate and Eurasian plate in the Late Cretaceous. Because the slab pull could only play a limited role in closing small oceanic basins for continental collision, the distal push of either continental breakup or seafloor spreading is suggested as the major driving force for the deep subduction of continental crust in the Western Alps. Therefore, deep subduction of the continental crust bordering small oceanic basins would have been induced by the far-field stress of compression, whereas that bordering large oceanic basins was spontaneous due to the oceanic slab pull. This provides a new insight into the geodynamic mechanism of continental deep subduction.},

Realization of the scheme is within reach of current technology in cavity electromagnonics and magnomechanics. Our work provides a new and practicable approach for producing squeezed vacuum states of electromagnetic fields, and may find promising applications in quantum information processing and quantum metrology.},

  abstract     = {Momentum-space polarization vortices centered at symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum of a periodic structure, e.g. photonic crystal slab, provide a novel nonlocal approach to generate vortex beams. This approach enjoys a great convenience of no precise alignment requirements, although the generation efficiency of the nonlocal generators requires further optimization before the practical application. In this work, we propose a temporal-coupled-mode-theory-based guideline for high-efficiency nonlocal reflection-type vortex generator design. The conversion efficiency of the vortex beam is found to be limited by the ratio of the radiative loss to the intrinsic absorption in practical systems. To increase this ratio through mode selection and structure design, the photonic crystal slabs are theoretically designed and experimentally characterized, showing a maximum on-resonance conversion efficiency of up to 86%. Combining high efficiency with simple fabrication and no requirement for precise alignment, reflection-type photonic crystal slabs could offer a new and competitive way to generate vortex beams flexibly.},

  abstract     = {Elastic wave manipulation is important in a wide variety of applications, including information processing in small elastic devices and noise control in large solid structures. The recent emergence of topological materials has opened new avenues for modulating elastic waves in solids. However, because of the full-vector feature and the complicated couplings of the longitudinal and transverse components of elastic waves, manipulating elastic waves is generally difficult compared with manipulating acoustic waves (scalar waves) and electromagnetic waves (vectorial waves but transverse only). To date, topological materials, including insulators and semimetals, have been used for acoustic and electromagnetic waves. Although topological materials with elastic waves have also been reported, the observed topological edge modes lie on the domain wall. A natural question arises: Is there an elastic metamaterial with topological edge modes on its own boundary? Here, we report a 3D metal-printed bilayer metamaterial that topologically insulates elastic waves. By introducing chiral interlayer couplings, the spin–orbit couplings for elastic waves are induced, which give rise to nontrivial topological properties. Helical edge states with vortex features were demonstrated on the boundary of the single topological phase. We further show a heterostructure of the metamaterial that exhibits tunable edge transport. Our findings could be used in devices based on elastic waves in solids.},

  abstract     = {The onset of various kidney diseases has been reported after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination. However, detailed clinical and pathological features are lacking. We screened and analyzed patients with newly diagnosed kidney diseases after inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in Peking University First Hospital from January 2021 to August 2021, and compared them with the reported cases in the literature. We obtained samples of blood, urine and renal biopsy tissues. Clinical and laboratory information, as well as light microscopy, immunostaining and ultrastructural observations, were described. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleoprotein were stained using the immunofluorescence technique in the kidney biopsy samples. SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were tested using magnetic particle chemiluminescence immunoassay. The study group included 17 patients with a range of conditions including immune-complex-mediated kidney diseases (IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy and lupus nephritis), podocytopathy (minimal change disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) and others (antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-antibody-associated vasculitis, anti-glomerular basement membrane nephritis, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis and thrombotic microangiopathy). Seven patients (41.18%) developed renal disease after the first dose and ten (58.82%) after the second dose. The kidney disease spectrum as well as clinicopathological features are similar across different types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We found no definitive evidence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or nucleoprotein deposition in the kidney biopsy samples. Seropositive markers implicated abnormal immune responses in predisposed individuals. Treatment and follow-up (median = 86 days) showed that biopsy diagnosis informed treatment and prognosis in all patients. In conclusion, we observed various kidney diseases following SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administration, which show a high consistency across different types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Our findings provide evidence against direct vaccine protein deposition as the major pathomechanism, but implicate abnormal immune responses in predisposed individuals. These findings expand our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine renal safety.},

Here, we made the first effort to analyze the expression profiles of highly differentiated genes with eastern and western origins in 90 Uyghurs using whole-genome (30× to 60×) and transcriptome data. We screened 921 872 east–west highly differentiated genetic variants, of which ∼4.32% were expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), ∼0.12% were alternative splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs), and ∼0.12% showed allele-specific expression (ASE). The 8305 highly differentiated eQTLs of strong effects appear to have undergone natural selection, associated with immunity and metabolism. European-origin alleles tend to be more biasedly expressed; highly differentiated ASEs were enriched in diabetes-associated genes, likely affecting the diabetes susceptibility in the Uyghurs. We proposed an admixture-induced expression model to dissect the highly differentiated expression profiles. We provide new insights into the genetic basis of phenotypic differentiation between Western and Eastern populations, advancing our understanding of the impact of genetic admixture.},

Investigation of the mechanism revealed that the ME coupling effect is realized through electron transfer from the Cl 2 An to the Fe ion. Measurement of the magnetodielectric (MD) coefficient of 1 indicated a positive MD of up to ∼12% at 10 3. 0 Hz and 370 K, which is very different from that of ME materials with conventional electron transfer for which the MD is generally negative.

  abstract     = {High-nuclear lanthanide clusters have shown great potential for the administration of high-dose mononuclear gadolinium chelates in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The development of high-nuclear lanthanide clusters with excellent solubility and high stability in water or solution has been challenging and is very important for expanding the performance of MRI. We used N -methylbenzimidazole-2-methanol (HL) and LnCl 3 ·6H 2 O to synthesize two spherical lanthanide clusters, Ln 32 (Ln = Ho, Ho 32 ; and Ln = Gd, Gd 32 ), which are highly stable in solution. The 24 ligands L − are all distributed on the periphery of Ln 32 and tightly wrap the cluster core, ensuring that the cluster is stable. Notably, Ho 32 can remain highly stable when bombarded with different ion source energies in HRESI-MS or immersed in an aqueous solution of different pH values for 24 h. The possible formation mechanism of Ho 32 was proposed to be Ho(III), (L) − and H 2 O → Ho 3 (L) 3 /Ho 3 (L) 4 → Ho 4 (L) 4 /Ho 4 (L) 5 → Ho 6 (L) 6 /Ho 6 (L) 7 → Ho 16 (L) 19 → Ho 28 (L) 15 → Ho 32 (L) 24 /Ho 32 (L) 21 /Ho 32 (L) 23 . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the assembly mechanism of spherical high-nuclear lanthanide clusters. Spherical cluster Gd 32 , a form of highly aggregated Gd(III), exhibits a high longitudinal relaxation rate (1 T, r 1 = 265.87 mM −1 ·s −1 ). More notably, compared with the clinically used commercial material Gd-DTPA, Gd 32 has a clearer and higher-contrast T 1 -weighted MRI effect in mice bearing 4T1 tumors. This is the first time that high-nuclear lanthanide clusters with high water stability have been utilized for MRI. High-nuclear Gd clusters containing highly aggregated Gd(III) at the molecular level have higher imaging contrast than traditional Gd chelates; thus, using large doses of traditional gadolinium contrast agents can be avoided.},

  abstract     = {Human lung adenosquamous cell carcinoma (LUAS), containing both adenomatous and squamous pathologies, harbors strong plasticity and is significantly associated with poor prognosis. We established an up-to-date comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic landscape of LUAS in 109 Chinese specimens and demonstrated LUAS development via adeno-to-squamous transdifferentiation. Unsupervised transcriptomic clustering and dynamic network biomarker analysis identified an inflammatory subtype as the critical transition stage during LUAS development. Dynamic dysregulation of the counteracting lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs), containing adenomatous TFs NKX2-1 and FOXA2, and squamous TFs TP63 and SOX2, finely tuned the lineage transition via promoting CXCL3/5-mediated neutrophil infiltration. Genomic clustering identified the most malignant subtype featured with STK11-inactivation, and targeting LSD1 through genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition almost eradicated STK11-deficient lung tumors.

  abstract     = {Calcite mesocrystals were proposed, and have been widely reported, to form in the presence of polymer additives via oriented assembly of nanoparticles. However, the formation mechanism and the role of polymer additives remain elusive. Here, inspired by the biomineralization process of sea urchin spine comprising magnesium calcite mesocrystals, we show that calcite mesocrystals could also be obtained via attachment of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) nanoparticles in the presence of inorganic zinc ions. Moreover, we demonstrate that zinc ions can induce the formation of temporarily stabilized amorphous nanoparticles of less than 20 nm at a significantly lower calcium carbonate concentration as compared to pure solution, which is energetically beneficial for the attachment and occlusion during calcite growth. The cation-mediated particle attachment crystallization significantly improves our understanding of mesocrystal formation mechanisms in biomineralization and offers new opportunities to bioprocess inspired inorganic ions regulated materials fabrication.},

Although the deep biosphere has been estimated to be the largest reservoir for viruses and their prokaryotic hosts, the biology and ecology of viruses therein remain poorly understood. The deep virosphere is an enigmatic field of study in which many critical questions are still to be answered. Is the deep virosphere simply a repository for deeply preserved, non-functioning virus particles? Or are deep viruses infectious agents that can readily infect suitable hosts and subsequently shape microbial populations and nutrient cycling? Can the cellular content released by viral lysis, and even the organic structures of virions themselves, serve as the source of bioavailable nutrients for microbial activity in the deep biosphere as in other ecosystems? In this review, we synthesize our current knowledge of viruses in the deep biosphere and seek to identify topics with the potential for substantial discoveries in the future.},

  abstract     = {Contrasting views exist on timing and mechanisms of Tertiary crustal uplift in the NE Tibetan Plateau based on different approaches, with many models attributing surface uplift to crustal shortening. We carry out a comprehensive investigation of mid-Tertiary stratigraphy, sedimentology, and volcanism in the West Qinling, Hoh Xil and Qaidam basin, and the results challenge previous views. It was held that the discordance between Oligocene and Miocene strata is an angular unconformity in the West Qinling, but our field observations show that it is actually a disconformity, indicative of vertical crustal uplifting rather than crustal shortening at the Oligocene to Miocene transition. Widespread occurrence of synsedimentary normal faults in mid-Tertiary successions implicates supracrustal stretching. Miocene potassic–ultrapassic and mafic–ultramafic volcanics in the Hoh Xil and West Qinling suggest a crucial role of deep thermomechanical processes in generating crust- and mantle-sourced magmatism. Also noticeable are the continuity of mid-Tertiary successions and absence of volcanics in the Qaidam basin. Based on a holistic assessment of stratigraphic–sedimentary processes, volcanic petrogenesis, and spatial variations of lithospheric thicknesses, we speculate that small-sale mantle convection might have been operating beneath northeast Tibet in the mid-Tertiary. It is assumed that northward asthenospheric flow was impeded by thicker cratonic lithosphere of the Qaidam and Alxa blocks, thereby leading to edge convection. The edge-driven convection could bring about surface uplift, induce supracrustal stretching, and trigger vigorous volcanism in the Hoh Xil and West Qinling in the mid-Tertiary period. This mechanism satisfactorily explains many key geologic phenomena that are hardly reconciled by previous models.},

  abstract     = {Building a more resilient food system for sustainable development and reducing uncertainty in global food markets both require concurrent and near-real-time and reliable crop information for decision making. Satellite-driven crop monitoring has become a main method to derive crop information at local, regional, and global scales by revealing the spatial and temporal dimensions of crop growth status and production. However, there is a lack of quantitative, objective, and robust methods to ensure the reliability of crop information, which reduces the applicability of crop monitoring and leads to uncertain and undesirable consequences. In this paper, we review recent progress in crop monitoring and identify the challenges and opportunities in future efforts. We find that satellite-derived metrics do not fully capture determinants of crop production and do not quantitatively interpret crop growth status; the latter can be advanced by integrating effective satellite-derived metrics and new onboard sensors. We have identified that ground data accessibility and the negative effects of knowledge-based analyses are two essential issues in crop monitoring that reduce the applicability of crop monitoring for decisions on food security. Crowdsourcing is one solution to overcome the restrictions of ground-truth data accessibility. We argue that user participation in the complete process of crop monitoring could improve the reliability of crop information. Encouraging users to obtain crop information from multiple sources could prevent unconscious biases. Finally, there is a need to avoid conflicts of interest in publishing publicly available crop information.},

In this paper, after systematic investigations on the performance of the state-of-the-art high-performance solar cells under thermal cycle and intensive UV irradiation conditions, in situ performance and stability tests of the solar cells in the 35 km stratospheric environment were carried out through a high-altitude balloon uploading. The encapsulated FOSCs with an area of 0.64 cm 2 gave the highest power density of 15.26 mW/cm 2 and an efficiency over 11%, corresponding to a power-per-weight ratio of over 3.32 kW/kg. More importantly, the cells showed stable power output during the 3-h continuous flight at 35 km and only 10% performance decay after return to the lab, suggesting promising stability of the FOSCs in the stratospheric environment.},

  abstract     = {The number and stacking order of layers are two important degrees of freedom that can modulate the properties of 2D van der Waals (vdW) materials. However, the layers’ structures are essentially limited to the known layered 3D vdW materials. Recently, a new 2D vdW material, MoSi 2 N 4 , without known 3D counterparts, was synthesized by passivating the surface dangling bonds of non-layered 2D molybdenum nitride with elemental silicon, whose monolayer can be viewed as a monolayer MoN (-N-Mo-N-) sandwiched between two Si-N layers. This unique sandwich structure endows the MoSi 2 N 4 monolayer with many fascinating properties and intriguing applications, and the surface-passivating growth method creates the possibility of tuning the layer&#39;s structure of 2D vdW materials. Here we synthesized a series of MoSi 2 N 4 (MoN) 4n structures confined in the matrix of multilayer MoSi 2 N 4 . These super-thick monolayers are the homologous compounds of MoSi 2 N 4 , which can be viewed as multilayer MoN (Mo 4n+1 N 4n+2 ) sandwiched between two Si-N layers. First-principles calculations show that MoSi 2 N 4 (MoN) 4 monolayers have much higher Young&#39;s modulus than MoN, which is attributed to the strong Si-N bonds on the surface. Importantly, different from the semiconducting nature of the MoSi 2 N 4 monolayer, the MoSi 2 N 4 (MoN) 4 monolayer is identified as a superconductor with a transition temperature of 9.02 K. The discovery of MoSi 2 N 4 (MoN) 4n structures not only expands the family of 2D materials but also brings a new degree of freedom to tailor the structure of 2D vdW materials, which may lead to unexpected novel properties and applications.},

In previous studies, different mechanisms have been used to understand interface charge transfer processes. However, the charge transfer mechanism at the solid/liquid interface remains a controversial topic. Here, taking TiO 2 as a model, we find and prove, via experiments, the new characteristic of photo-induced bipolarity of the surface layer (reduction faradaic layer and oxidation faradaic layer) on a semiconductor for the first time. Different from energy level positions in the classic surface states transfer mechanism, the potential window of a surface faradaic layer is located out of the forbidden band. Moreover, we find that the reduction faradaic layer and oxidation faradaic layer serve as electron and hole transfer mediators in photocatalysis, while the bipolarity or mono-polarity of the surface layer on a semiconductor depends on the applied potential in photoelectrocatalysis. The new characteristic of bipolarity can also offer new insights into the charge transfer process at the semiconductor/liquid interface for solar energy utilization.},

Here, the electronically asymmetric Cu-Cu/Cu-N-C (Cu/CuNC) interface site is found, by theoretical calculations, to enhance the adsorption of *CO intermediates and decrease the reaction barrier of C-C coupling in ECR, enabling efficient C-C coupling at low overpotential. The catalyst consisting of high-density Cu/CuNC interface sites (noted as ER-Cu/CuNC) is then accordingly designed and constructed in situ on the high-loading Cu-N-C single atomic catalysts. Systematical experiments corroborate the theoretical prediction that the ER-Cu/CuNC boosts electrocatalytic CO 2 -to-ethanol conversion with a Faradaic efficiency toward C 2+ of 60.3% (FE ethanol of 55%) at a low overpotential of −0.35 V.

  abstract     = {The recently discovered nonlinear Hall effect (NHE) in a few non-interacting systems provides a novel mechanism for generating second-harmonic electrical Hall signals under time-reversal-symmetric conditions. Here, we introduce a new approach to engineering an NHE by using twisted moiré structures. We found that the twisted WSe 2 bilayer exhibited an NHE when the Fermi level was tuned to the moiré flat bands. When the first moiré band was half-filled, the nonlinear Hall signal exhibited a sharp peak with a generation efficiency that was at least two orders of magnitude greater than those obtained in previous experiments. We discuss the possible origins of the diverging generation efficiency in twisted WSe 2 based on resistivity measurements, such as moiré-interface-induced correlation effects and mass-diverging-type continuous Mott transition. This study demonstrates not only how interaction effects can combine with Berry curvature dipoles to produce novel quantum phenomena, but also the potential of NHE measurements as a new tool for studying quantum criticality.},

  abstract     = {Cryptography promises four information security objectives, namely, confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation, to support trillions of transactions annually in the digital economy. Efficient digital signatures, ensuring integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation of data with information-theoretical security are highly urgent and intractable open problems in cryptography. Here, we propose a high-efficiency quantum digital signature (QDS) protocol using asymmetric quantum keys acquired via secret sharing, one-time universal 2 hashing and a one-time pad. We just need to use a 384-bit key to sign documents of lengths up to 2 64 with a security bound of 10 −19 . If a one-megabit document is signed, the signature efficiency is improved by more than 10 8 times compared with previous QDS protocols. Furthermore, we build the first all-in-one quantum secure network integrating information-theoretically secure communication, digital signatures, secret sharing and conference key agreement and experimentally demonstrate this signature efficiency advantage. Our work completes the cryptography toolbox of the four information security objectives.},

In practice, however, all decoy-state methods have unavoidable source errors, and the source errors may be non-random, which compromises the security condition of the existing TF-QKD protocols. In this study, we present a general approach for efficiently calculating the SNS protocol’s secure key rate with source errors, by establishing the equivalent protocols through virtual attenuation and the tagged model. This makes the first result for TF QKD in practice where source intensity cannot be controlled exactly. Our method can be combined with the two-way classical communication method such as active odd-parity pairing to further improve the key rate. The numerical results show that if the intensity error is within a few percent, the key rate and secure distance only decrease marginally. The key rate of the recent SNS experiment in the 511-km field fiber is still positive using our method presented here, even if there is a ± 9.5 % intensity fluctuation. This shows that the SNS protocol is robust against source errors.},

Herein, we report the results of our laser cooling experiment in TianGong-2 space lab, which operated for 34 consecutive months in orbit. Over such an extended operation time, the quality of laser cooling did not experience any significant decline, while the properties of laser cooling in orbital microgravity were systematically studied. In particular, we demonstrate magneto-optical trapping and polarization-gradient cooling in orbit and carefully examine their performances. A comparison of the in-orbit and on-ground results indicates that a higher cooling efficiency exists in microgravity, including a smaller loss rate during the trapping and cooling process and lower ultimate temperature of laser-cooled atoms. Our progress has laid the technical foundations for future applications of cold atoms in space missions with operation times of the order of years.},

  abstract     = {Thermomagnetic instability is a crucial issue for the application of superconductors. Effects of edge cracks on the thermomagnetic instability of superconducting thin films are systematically investigated in this work. Dendritic flux avalanches in thin films are well reproduced through electrodynamics simulations, and relevant physical mechanisms are revealed from dissipative vortex dynamics simulations. It is found that edge cracks sharply decrease the threshold field for the thermomagnetic instability of superconducting films. Spectrum analysis shows that the time series of magnetization jumping displays scale-invariance and follows a power law with an exponent around 1.9. In a cracked film, flux jumps more frequently with lower amplitudes compared with its crack-less counterpart. As the crack extends, the threshold field decreases, the jumping frequency gets lower, while its magnitude gets larger. When the crack has extended long enough, the threshold field increases to even larger than that of the crack-less film. This counterintuitive result originates from the transition of the thermomagnetic instability triggered at the crack tip to the one triggered at the center of the crack edges, which is validated by the multifractal spectrum of magnetization jumping sequences. In addition, with the variation of crack lengths, three different modes of vortex motion are found, which explains the different flux patterns formed in the avalanche process.},

However, the development of practical Li-free MX cathodes is plagued by the existing notion of low voltage due to the long-term overlooked voltage-tuning/phase-stability competition. Here, we propose a p-type alloying strategy involving three voltage/phase-evolution stages, of which each of the varying trends are quantitated by two improved ligand-field descriptors to balance the above contradiction. Following this, an intercalation-type 2H-V 1.75 Cr 0.25 S 4 cathode tuned from layered MX 2 family is successfully designed, which possesses an energy density of 554.3 Wh kg −1 at the electrode level accompanied by interfacial compatibility with sulfide solid-state electrolyte. The proposal of this class of materials is expected to break free from scarce or high-cost transition-metal (e.g. Co and Ni) reliance in current commercial cathodes. Our experiments further confirm the voltage and energy-density gains of 2H-V 1.75 Cr 0.25 S 4 . This strategy is not limited to specific Li-free cathodes and offers a solution to achieve high voltage and phase stability simultaneously.},

However, challenges associated with biosafety designs and the intrinsic electrochemistry of ZBs emerge when moving to practice, especially for biomedical devices. Here, we propose a green and programmable electro-cross-linking strategy to in situ prepare a multi-layer hierarchical Zn–alginate polymer electrolyte (Zn–Alg) via the superionic binds between the carboxylate groups and Zn 2+ . Consequently, the Zn–Alg electrolyte provides high reversibility of 99.65% Coulombic efficiency (CE), &gt;500 h of long-time stability and high biocompatibility (no damage to gastric and duodenal mucosa) in the body. A wire-shaped Zn/Zn–Alg/ α -MnO 2 full battery affords 95% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1 A g −1 and good flexibility. The new strategy has three prominent advantages over the conventional methods: (i) the cross-linking process for the synthesis of electrolytes avoids the introduction of any chemical reagents or initiators; (ii) a highly reversible Zn battery is easily provided from a micrometer to large scales through automatic programmable functions; and (iii) high biocompatibility is capable of implanted and bio-integrated devices to ensure body safety.},

However, no shipping policies on carbon mitigation are proposed for the world’s high seas regions, which results in carbon intensive shipping activities. In this paper, we propose a Geographic-based Emission Estimation Model (GEEM) to estimate shipping GHG emission patterns on high seas regions. The results indicate that annual emissions of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 -e) in shipping on the high seas reached 211.60 million metric tonnes in 2019, accounting for about one-third of all shipping emissions globally and exceeding annual GHG emissions of countries such as Spain. The average emission from shipping activities on the high seas is growing at approximately 7.26% per year, which far surpasses the growth rate of global shipping emission at 2.23%. We propose implementation of policies on each high seas region with respect to the main emission driver identified from our results. Our policy evaluation results show that carbon mitigation policies could reduce emissons by 25.46 and 54.36 million tonnes CO 2 -e in the primary intervention stage and overall intervention stage, respectively, with 12.09% and 25.81% reduction rates in comparison to the 2019 annual GHG emissions in high seas shipping.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneously achieving high electrochemical activity and high loading for solid-state batteries has been hindered by slow ion transport within solid electrodes, in particular with an increase in electrode thickness. Ion transport governed by ‘point-to-point’ diffusion inside a solid-state electrode is challenging, but still remains elusive. Herein, synchronized electrochemical analysis using X-ray tomography and ptychography reveals new insights into the nature of slow ion transport in solid-state electrodes. Thickness-dependent delithiation kinetics are spatially probed to identify that low-delithiation kinetics originate from the high tortuous and slow longitudinal transport pathways. By fabricating a tortuosity-gradient electrode to create an effective ion-percolation network, the tortuosity-gradient electrode architecture promotes fast charge transport, migrates the heterogeneous solid-state reaction, enhances electrochemical activity and extends cycle life in thick solid-state electrodes. These findings establish effective transport pathways as key design principles for realizing the promise of solid-state high-loading cathodes.},

However, fabrication of customizable MIMSCs in an extremely small space remains a huge challenge considering key factors such as materials selection, electrolyte confinement, microfabrication and device-performance uniformity. Here, we develop a universal and large-throughput microfabrication strategy to address all these issues by combining multistep lithographic patterning, spray printing of MXene microelectrodes and controllable 3D printing of gel electrolytes. We achieve the monolithic integration of electrochemically isolated micro-supercapacitors in close proximity by leveraging high-resolution micropatterning techniques for microelectrode deposition and 3D printing for precise electrolyte deposition. Notably, the MIMSCs obtained demonstrate a high areal-number density of 28 cells cm −2 (340 cells on 3.5 × 3.5 cm 2 ), a record areal output voltage of 75.6 V cm −2 , an acceptable systemic volumetric energy density of 9.8 mWh cm −3 and an unprecedentedly high capacitance retention of 92% after 4000 cycles at an extremely high output voltage of 162 V. This work paves the way for monolithic integrated and microscopic energy-storage assemblies for powering future microelectronics.},

Systematic studies on the trends and geographical distribution of antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella and dominant serovars have been well studied in European and American countries while not in China. Here, taking the One-Health strategy, we used &gt;35 000 Salmonella enterica isolates to explore the temporal and spatial dynamics of dominant serovars in China. We found that Salmonella Typhimurium was the dominant serovar causing human infection in China, which was consistent with Australia but inconsistent with North American and European countries. The proportion of Salmonella serovars Typhimurium, London, Rissen, Corvallis, Meleagridis, Kentucky, and Goldcoast showed an increasing trend during 2006–2019. We randomly selected 1962 isolates for comparative genomics and antimicrobial resistance studies and found that the number of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) per isolate increased 1.84 and 2.69 times of human and non-human origins, respectively, spanning 14 years. The proportion of antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella isolates had an increasing trend during 2006–2019, especially beta-lactam, quinolone, tetracycline, and rifampicin resistance. Moreover, we found that higher diversity of sequence types (STs) in S . Typhimurium than in other serovars, ST34 from pig and ST19 from chicken origin, were mainly associated with isolates causing child and adult gastro-infection, respectively. Our results fill in the data gap on the trends of dominant serovars and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella enterica in China. These data provide useful information for public health decision-makers prioritizing interventions for foodborne diseases and food safety.},

  abstract     = {Topological order is a new quantum phase that is beyond Landau’s symmetry-breaking paradigm. Its defining features include robust degenerate ground states, long-range entanglement and anyons. It was known that R and F matrices, which characterize the fusion-braiding properties of anyons, can be used to uniquely identify topological order. In this article, we explore an essential question: how can the R and F matrices be experimentally measured? We show that the braidings, i.e. the R matrices, can be completely determined by the half braidings of boundary excitations due to the boundary-bulk duality and the anyon condensation. The F matrices can also be measured by comparing the quantum states involving the fusion of three anyons in two different orders. Thus we provide a model-independent experimental protocol to uniquely identify topological order. By using quantum simulations based on a toric code model with boundaries encoded in three- and four-qubit systems and state-of-the-art technology, we obtain the first experimental measurement of R and F matrices by means of an NMR quantum computer at room temperature.},

We find that andesites from mature continental arcs with crustal thickness of &gt;45 km have systematically higher Mg# than those from oceanic arcs with crustal thickness of &lt;30 km. The elevated Mg# in continental arc lavas results from strong Fe depletion during high-pressure differentiation favored in thick crusts. This proposal is reinforced by our compiled melting/crystallization experiment data. We show that the Mg# characteristics of continental arc lavas match that of the continental crust. These findings suggest that the formation of many high-Mg# andesites and the continental crust may not require slab-melt/peridotite interactions. Instead, the high Mg# of the continental crust can be explained by intracrustal calc-alkaline differentiation processes in magmatic orogens.},

  abstract     = {This study, via combined analysis of geophysical and geochemical data, reveals a lithospheric architecture characterized by crust–mantle decoupling and vertical heat-flow conduits that control orogenic gold mineralization in the Ailaoshan gold belt on the southeastern margin of Tibet. The mantle seismic tomography indicates that the crust–mantle decoupled deformation, defined from previous seismic anisotropy analysis, was formed by upwelling and lateral flow of the asthenosphere, driven by deep subduction of the Indian continent. Our magnetotelluric and seismic images show both a vertical conductor across the Moho and high Vp/Vs anomalies both in the uppermost mantle and lowest crust, suggesting that crust–mantle decoupling promotes ponding of mantle-derived basic melts at the base of the crust via a heat-flow conduit. Noble gas isotope and halogen ratios of gold-related ore minerals indicate a mantle source of ore fluid. A rapid decrease in Cl/F ratios of lamprophyres under conditions of 1.2 GPa and 1050°C suggests that the ore fluid was derived from degassing of the basic melts. Similar lithospheric architecture is recognized in other orogenic gold provinces, implying analogous formational controls.},

In the electrocatalytic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), the Janus carbon electrocatalyst exhibits superior activity than their single counterparts and simple physical mixtures.

The promise of fusion energy is to constrain the motion of high-temperature plasma by the high magnetic field generated by superconducting magnets, and then achieve controllable thermonuclear fusion. Fusion power is proportional to the fourth power of the magnetic field strength. Thus, future commercial fusion reactors need a higher magnetic field as the basis for sustainable development [ 1 ]. In order to verify the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion energy, China, the United States, the European Union, Russia et al . have jointly participated in the construction of the International Thermonuclear Fusion Test Reactor (ITER), which is expected to produce the first plasma discharge by 2025 [ 2 ]. Currently, China is leading the world in many fields of fusion energy research. For example, the experimental advanced superconducting Tokamak (EAST) whole-superconducting Tokamak located at the Institute of Plasma Physics in the Chinese Academy of Sciences has achieved a repeatable world record of stable plasma operation at 120 million degrees Celsius for 101 seconds, which provides a solid foundation for ITER and also China&#39;s future Independent Building Fusion Reactor ( https://www.cas.cn/syky/202105/t20210528_4790357.shtml ). Prof. Jiangang Li, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, participated in and completed the design and construction of EAST plasma facing componments (PFCs) engineering by the support of the national ‘9th five-year plan’ major scientific and technological infrastructure, and presided over the completion of the national ‘11th five-year plan’ major scientific and technological infrastructure—EAST auxiliary heating system project. He also hosted the national ‘13th five-year plan’ major scientific and technological infrastructure—Integrated Research Facility for Critical Systems of fusion reactor comprehensive research facility for fusion technology (CRAFT). Many important scientific and technological problems have been solved and overcome by Prof. Li and his co-workers, which puts China&#39;s plasma physics research and fusion engineering technology at the forefront of global engineering.},

Taking benzenoid units as 2D superatoms, polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons and C 60 can be seen as superatomic molecules consisting of bonded superatoms, resulting in local aromaticity. In superatomic molecules, π electrons are not totally delocalized, but localized in a single superatom forming superatomic lone pairs or shared by two atoms forming a superatomic bond, mimicking rules in classical valence bond theory. Moreover, two 2D superatomic crystals (C 18 H 6 and C 54 H 18 ) are predicted to have fairly large band gaps (∼1.8 eV), although the π electrons are conjugated and delocalized. The proposed superatomic-molecule theory provides generalized chemical insights into the nature of local aromaticity, which can be qualitatively evaluated by the chemical intuition given by superatomic Lewis structures.},

Elucidating these states requires atomic-scale characterization and delicate control capabilities. Herein, spectroscopic imaging-scanning tunneling microscopy was employed to investigate the correlated states residing in 1D electrons of the monolayer and bilayer MoSe 2 mirror twin boundary (MTB). The Coulomb energies, determined by the wire length, drive the MTB into two types of ground states with distinct respective out-of-phase and in-phase charge orders. The two ground states can be reversibly converted through a metastable zero-energy state with in situ voltage pulses, which tune the electron filling of the MTB via a polaronic process, substantiated by first-principles calculations. Our Hubbard model calculation with an exact diagonalization method reveals the ground states as correlated insulators from an on-site U-originated Coulomb interaction, dubbed the Hubbard-type Coulomb blockade effect.

  abstract     = {Why one chemical is more stable than another is not always easy to understand. A unified answer for metal clusters has led to the establishment of the superatom concept, which rationalizes the delocalization of electrons; however, cluster stability based on superatom theory has not been confirmed unambiguously for any metal other than the s- and p-blocks of the periodic table of elements. Here, we have prepared pure niobium clusters and observed their reactions with CO under sufficient gas collision conditions. We find prominent inertness of Nb 12 + , which survives CO attack. Comprehensive theoretical calculation results reveal that the inertness of Nb 12 + is associated with its cage structure and well-organized superatomic orbitals, giving rise to energetic superiority among the studied clusters. It is revealed that not only the 5s but also the 4d electrons of Nb delocalize in the cluster and significantly contribute to the superatomic state, resulting in reasonable cage aromaticity. This hollow-cage cluster, which we have called a ‘niobespherene’, provides a clue with regard to designing new materials of all-metal aromaticity and Nb-involved catalysts free of CO poisoning.},

  abstract     = {The Altaids is generally considered to be the largest Phanerozoic accretionary orogen on Earth, but it is unclear whether it was associated with extensive continental crustal growth and whether there is a link between the crustal growth and ore mineralization. This paper reviews whole-rock Nd and zircon Hf isotope data for felsic–intermediate–mafic igneous rocks in the Altaids and presents Nd + Hf isotopic contour maps for this region. The maps highlight the 3D lithospheric compositional architecture of the Altaids and make it possible to quantitatively evaluate the crustal growth and its relationship with ore deposits. The Altaids hosts ∼4 107 350 km 2 and ∼184 830 750 km 3 (assuming a crustal thickness of 40–50 km) juvenile crust ( ϵ Nd ( t ) &gt; 0), accounting for 58% by isotope-mapped area (∼7 010 375 km 2 ) of almost all outcrops of the Altaids (∼8 745 000 km 2 ) and formed during 1000–150 Ma (mainly 600–150 Ma). The juvenile crustal, slightly juvenile-reworked crustal and slightly reworked crustal provinces controlled the Cu–Au, the Pb–Zn–Ag and the Li–Be, Nb–Ta and W–Sn ore deposits. According to the crustal architecture and background of deep compositions, we propose that the ore deposits can be grouped into three types: juvenile crust-related, mixed-source (or slightly juvenile crust)-related and reworked crust-related. This highlights the close relationship between accretion, continental growth and mineralization, and will facilitate exploration for specific ore-deposit types in the Altaids.},

  abstract     = {Chronic pain is a significant problem that afflicts individuals and society, and for which the current clinical treatment is inadequate. In addition, the neural circuit and molecular mechanisms subserving chronic pain remain largely uncharacterized. Herein we identified enhanced activity of a glutamatergic neuronal circuit that encompasses projections from the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL Glu ) to the glutamatergic neurons of the hindlimb primary somatosensory cortex (S1HL Glu ), driving allodynia in mouse models of chronic pain. Optogenetic inhibition of this VPL Glu →S1HL Glu circuit reversed allodynia, whereas the enhancement of its activity provoked hyperalgesia in control mice. In addition, we found that the expression and function of the HCN2 (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 2) were increased in VPL Glu neurons under conditions of chronic pain. Using in vivo calcium imaging, we demonstrated that downregulation of HCN2 channels in the VPL Glu neurons abrogated the rise in S1HL Glu neuronal activity while alleviating allodynia in mice with chronic pain. With these data, we propose that dysfunction in HCN2 channels in the VPL Glu →S1HL Glu thalamocortical circuit and their upregulation occupy essential roles in the development of chronic pain.},

Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite ferroelectrics (HOIPFs), as a class of molecule-based ferroelectrics, have diverse functionalities owing to their unique structure and have become a hot spot in molecular ferroelectrics research. Therefore, they are extremely attractive in the field of ferroelectrics. However, there seems to be a lack of systematic review of their design, performance and potential applications. Herein, we review the recent development of HOIPFs from lead-based, lead-free and metal-free perovskites, and outline the versatility of these ferroelectrics, including piezoelectricity for mechanical energy-harvesting and optoelectronic properties for photovoltaics and light detection. Furthermore, a perspective view of the challenges and future directions of HOIPFs is also highlighted.},

  abstract     = {Assembly of a complete Y chromosome is a significant challenge in animals with an XX/XY sex-determination system. Recently, we created YY-supermale yellow catfish by crossing XY males with sex-reversed XY females, providing a valuable model for Y-chromosome assembly and evolution. Here, we assembled highly homomorphic Y and X chromosomes by sequencing genomes of the YY supermale and XX female in yellow catfish, revealing their nucleotide divergences with only less than 1% and with the same gene compositions. The sex-determining region (SDR) was identified to locate within a physical distance of 0.3 Mb by F ST scanning. Strikingly, the incipient sex chromosomes were revealed to originate via autosome–autosome fusion and were characterized by a highly rearranged region with an SDR downstream of the fusion site. We found that the Y chromosome was at a very early stage of differentiation, as no clear evidence of evolutionary strata and classical structure features of recombination suppression for a rather late stage of Y-chromosome evolution were observed. Significantly, a number of sex-antagonistic mutations and the accumulation of repetitive elements were discovered in the SDR, which might be the main driver of the initial establishment of recombination suppression between young X and Y chromosomes. Moreover, distinct three-dimensional chromatin organizations of the Y and X chromosomes were identified in the YY supermales and XX females, as the X chromosome exhibited denser chromatin structure than the Y chromosome, while they respectively have significantly spatial interactions with female- and male-related genes compared with other autosomes. The chromatin configuration of the sex chromosomes as well as the nucleus spatial organization of the XX neomale were remodeled after sex reversal and similar to those in YY supermales, and a male-specific loop containing the SDR was found in the open chromatin region. Our results elucidate the origin of young sex chromosomes and the chromatin remodeling configuration in the catfish sexual plasticity.},

  abstract     = {We compare and contrast the materials and mechanisms of continental crustal growth in the largest preserved regions of Phanerozoic and Archean juvenile additions to the crust, to test for similarities or differences in the formation of continents through time. We accomplish this through a comparison of map patterns, lithological contents, and structural and metamorphic evolution of the Phanerozoic Altaid orogenic system of Asia, with the Archean Superior Province of the North American Craton, using a method termed comparative orotomy. Both orogenic systems consist of collages of curvilinear belts of eroded arcs, some older continental slivers, and vast tracts of former subduction/accretionary complexes. These contain numerous shreds of portions of the ophiolite suite, slivers of island and continental arcs, and accreted oceanic plateau, all intruded by multiple magmatic suites during or between multiple deformation events, then sliced by large transcurrent fault systems and bent into large oroclinal structures. We make this comparison because the Superior Province is a typical Archean craton that was later, in the Paleoproterozoic, incorporated into the larger North American Craton, and has occupied a central position in several supercontinents (e.g. Kenorland and Nuna, which then formed the core of Columbia, Rodinia, Laurentia and Pangea) during its longevity. Since it is the largest single fragment of Archean continental cratonic lithosphere preserved on Earth, the Superior Province is widely regarded as a testing ground for how Earth&#39;s continental crust was formed. Likewise, the Altaids encompass the largest region of crustal growth for the Phanerozoic. Our comparison with the Altaids is needed, as in recent years many myths about how the planet may have responded to higher heat production and flow in the Archean have emerged, because of trends in the science where regional geology is ignored in favor of numerical models, isotopic proxies for assumed models of chemical behavior for crust-forming or tectonic processes, or comparisons with other-worldly bodies that bear little resemblance to our hydrous Earth. Thus, we return to the geological record, and here describe the map patterns, lithological associations, structural patterns and evolution of both the Altaids and Superior Province, showing how comparative tectonics, orotomy, is useful in the absence of meaningful paleomagnetic or biostratigraphic data. We pay particular attention to the style of preservation of disaggregated members of the ophiolite suite (ophirags) and their relationships with other tectonic units, and to the widespread but largely overlooked role of late-stage major transcurrent motions and structural slicing of both Archean and Phanerozoic orogenic systems in defining the present-day architecture of both orogenic systems.},

  abstract     = {A single-crystalline Ni-rich (SCNR) cathode with a large particle size can achieve higher energy density, and is safer, than polycrystalline counterparts. However, synthesizing large SCNR cathodes (&gt;5 μm) without compromising electrochemical performance is very challenging due to the incompatibility between Ni-rich cathodes and high temperature calcination. Herein, we introduce Vegard&#39;s Slope as a guide for rationally selecting sintering aids, and we successfully synthesize size-controlled SCNR cathodes, the largest of which can be up to 10 μm. Comprehensive theoretical calculation and experimental characterization show that sintering aids continuously migrate to the particle surface, suppress sublattice oxygen release and reduce the surface energy of the typically exposed facets, which promotes grain boundary migration and elevates calcination critical temperature. The dense SCNR cathodes, fabricated by packing of different-sized SCNR cathode particles, achieve a highest electrode press density of 3.9 g cm −3 and a highest volumetric energy density of 3000 Wh L −1 . The pouch cell demonstrates a high energy density of 303 Wh kg −1 , 730 Wh L −1 and 76% capacity retention after 1200 cycles. SCNR cathodes with an optimized particle size distribution can meet the requirements for both electric vehicles and portable devices. Furthermore, the principle for controlling the growth of SCNR particles can be widely applied when synthesizing other materials for Li-ion, Na-ion and K-ion batteries.},

OASCLR nanoparticles could effectively kill various clinic common pathogens and antibacterial efficiency was &gt;99.97%. Importantly, OASCLR could modulate lung microbiota, increasing the overall richness and diversity of microbiota by decreasing pathogens and increasing probiotic and commensal bacteria. Additionally, OASCLR could target inflammatory macrophages by the interaction of OASCLR with the macrophage binding site of CD44 and alleviate overactive immune responses for hyperactive immunocompetent pneumonia. Surprisingly, OASCLR could break the state of the macrophage&#39;s poor phagocytic ability by upregulating the expression of the extracellular matrix assembly, immune activation and fibroblast activation in immunocompromised pneumonia. The macrophage&#39;s phagocytic ability was increased from 2.61% to 12.3%.

  abstract     = {This paper reviews published and presents new data on U-Pb detrital zircon ages, and petrographic, geochemical and isotope (Sm-Nd, Lu-Hf) compositions obtained from greywacke sandstones of Kazakhstan in order to reconstruct fossil intra-oceanic arcs that once existed at Pacific-type convergent margins of the Paleo-Asian Ocean (PAO) in Paleozoic time. We focus on orogenic belts of central Kazakhstan (Itmurundy and Tekturmas) and eastern Kazakhstan (Zharma and Char) in the western Central Asian Orogenic belt. These orogenic belts host accretionary complexes with greywacke sandstones of early Paleozoic (central Kazakhstan) and middle-late Paleozoic (eastern Kazakhstan) ages. First, we evaluate general perspectives for studying sandstones to reconstruct survived and disappeared magmatic arcs, taking into account episodes of subduction erosion. Then we discuss the analytical data from sandstones to make conclusions about the ages and formation settings of their igneous protoliths and define maximum deposition ages. Finally, we discuss the role of serpentinite mélanges in tectonic reconstructions. We argue that sandstones hosted by accretionary complexes are typically greywackes deposited close to their igneous sources and buried rapidly. The provenances of the studied greywacke sandstones of central and eastern Kazakhstan were dominated by mafic to andesitic igneous protoliths derived from juvenile mantle sources. The igneous rocks in the provenances were emplaced in an intra-oceanic arc setting. The sandstones were deposited in fore-arc/trench basins or, to a lesser degree, in back-arc basins. The data from both sandstones and serpentinite mélanges reconstruct middle-late-Cambrian, Ordovician, late-Devonian and Carboniferous arcs of the western PAO. The middle-late Cambrian arcs were fully destroyed by subduction erosion, whereas the Ordovician and Carboniferous arcs survived. The late-Devonian arcs were also eroded, but partly. Both the early and late Paleozoic active margins of the PAO were characterized by alternating periods of accretionary growth and subduction erosion.},

  abstract     = {A major impediment to industrial urea synthesis is the lack of catalysts with high selectivity and activity, which inhibits the efficient industrial production of urea. Here, we report a new catalyst system suitable for the highly selective synthesis of industrial urea by in situ growth of graphdiyne on the surface of cobalt–nickel mixed oxides. Such a catalyst is a multi-heterojunction interfacial structure resulting in the obvious incomplete charge-transfer phenomenon between a graphdiyne and metal oxide interface and multiple intermolecular interactions. These intrinsic characteristics are the origin of the high performance of the catalyst. Studies on the mechanism reveal that the catalyst could effectively optimize the adsorption/desorption capacities of the intermediate and promote direct C–N coupling by significantly suppressing by-product reactions toward the formation of H 2 , CO, N 2 and NH 3 . The catalyst can selectively synthesize urea directly from nitrite and carbon dioxide in water at room temperature and pressure, and exhibits a record-high Faradaic efficiency of 64.3%, nitrogen selectivity (N urea -selectivity) of 86.0%, carbon selectivity (C urea -selectivity) of ∼100%, as well as urea yield rates of 913.2 μg h −1 mg cat −1 and remarkable long-term stability.},

Herein, we demonstrate the in situ resource utilization of lunar soil for extraterrestrial fuel and oxygen production, which may power up our solely natural satellite and supply respiratory gas. Specifically, the lunar soil is loaded with Cu species and employed for electrocatalytic CO 2 conversion, demonstrating significant production of methane. In addition, the selected component in lunar soil (i.e. MgSiO 3 ) loaded with Cu can reach a CH 4 Faradaic efficiency of 72.05% with a CH 4 production rate of 0.8 mL/min at 600 mA/cm 2 . Simultaneously, an O 2 production rate of 2.3 mL/min can be achieved. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our developed process starting from catalyst preparation to electrocatalytic CO 2 conversion is so accessible that it can be operated in an unmmaned manner via a robotic system. Such a highly efficient extraterrestrial fuel and oxygen production system is expected to push forward the development of mankind&#39;s civilization toward an extraterrestrial settlement.},

Here, we identify the spatial heterostructure of the bamboo node via multiscale imaging strategies and investigate its mechanical properties by multimodal mechanical tests. We find three kinds of hierarchical fiber reinforcement schemes that originate from the bamboo node, including spatially tightened interlocking, triaxial interconnected scaffolding and isotropic intertwining. These reinforcement schemes, built on porous vascular bundles, microfibers and more-refined twist-aligned nanofibers, govern the structural stability of the bamboo via hierarchical toughening. In addition, the spatial liquid transport associated with these multiscale fibers within the bamboo node is experimentally verified, which gives perceptible evidence for life-indispensable multidirectional fluid exchange. The functional integration of mechanical reinforcement and liquid transport reflects the fact that the bamboo node has opted for elaborate structural optimization rather than ingredient richness. This study will advance our understanding of biological materials and provide insight into the design of fiber-reinforced structures and biomass utilization.},

So far, metadevices have enabled analogous black holes to trap light or sound in laboratory spacetime. However, trapping heat in a conductive environment is still challenging because diffusive behaviors are directionless. Inspired by black holes, we construct graded heat-conduction metadevices to achieve thermal trapping, resorting to the imitated advection produced by graded thermal conductivities rather than the trivial solution of using insulation materials to confine thermal diffusion. We experimentally demonstrate thermal trapping for guiding hot spots to diffuse towards the center. Graded heat-conduction metadevices have advantages in energy-efficient thermal regulation because the imitated advection has a similar temperature field effect to the realistic advection that is usually driven by external energy sources. These results also provide an insight into correlating transformation thermotics with other disciplines, such as cosmology, for emerging heat control schemes.},

Before iron-based catalysts were exploited in the current industrial Haber–Bosch process, uranium-based materials served as effective catalysts for production of NH 3 from N 2 . Although some molecular uranium complexes are known to be capable of combining with N 2 , further hydrogenation with H 2 forming NH 3 has not been reported to date. Here, we describe the first example of N 2 cleavage and hydrogenation with H 2 to NH 3 with a molecular uranium complex. The N 2 cleavage product contains three uranium centers that are bridged by three imido μ 2 -NH ligands and one nitrido μ 3 -N ligand. Labeling experiments with 15 N demonstrate that the nitrido ligand in the product originates from N 2 . Reaction of the N 2 -cleaved complex with H 2 or H + forms NH 3 under mild conditions. A synthetic cycle has been established by the reaction of the N 2 -cleaved complex with trimethylsilyl chloride. The isolation of this trinuclear imido-nitrido product implies that a multi-metallic uranium assembly plays an important role in the activation of N 2 .},

Our experimental results show that the robust crosslinking interaction of the iron-catechol complexes, as well as high-density hydrogen bonding, are responsible for the ultra-high interfacial adhesion strength. The embedding effect of the hydrophobic solvent-free network of poly(disulfides) further enhances the water-resistance. The dynamic covalent poly(disulfides) network also makes the resulting materials reconfigurable, thus enabling reusability via repeated heating and cooling.

  abstract     = {Acidic water electrolysis is of great importance for boosting the development of renewable energy. However, it severely suffers from the trade-off between high activity and long lifespan for oxygen evolution catalysts on the anode side. This is because the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction necessitates the application of a high overpotential to achieve considerable current, which inevitably drives the catalysts far away from their thermodynamic equilibrium states. Here we demonstrate a new oxygen evolution model catalyst-hierarchical palladium (Pd) whose performance even surpasses the benchmark Ir- and Ru-based materials. The Pd catalyst displays an ultralow overpotential (196 mV), excellent durability and mitigated degradation (66 μV h −1 ) at 10 mA cm −2 in 1 M HClO 4 . Tensile strain on Pd (111) facets weakens the binding of oxygen species on electrochemical etching-derived hierarchical Pd and thereby leads to two orders of magnitudes of enhancement of mass activity in comparison to the parent Pd bulk materials. Furthermore, the Pd catalyst displays the bifunctional catalytic properties for both oxygen and hydrogen evolutions and can deliver a current density of 2 A cm –2 at a low cell voltage of 1.771 V when fabricated into polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyser.},

  abstract     = {Functional nucleic acids (FNAs), such as aptamers, nucleic acid enzymes and riboswitches play essential roles in various fields of life sciences. Tailoring of ingenious chemical moieties toward FNAs can enhance their biomedical properties and/or confer them with exogenic biological functions that, in turn, can considerably expand their biomedical applications, or even improve their clinical translations. Herein, we report the first example of a general chemical tailoring strategy that enables the divergent ligation of DNA sequences. By applying this technology, different types of aptamers and single-stranded nucleic acids of various lengths could be efficiently tailored to deliver the designed circular bivalent aptamers (CBApts) and cyclized DNA sequences with high yields. It is worth noting that CBApts exhibited significantly enhanced nuclease resistance, as well as considerably improved binding, targeting and tumor tissue enrichment abilities, which may pave the way for different investigations for biomedical purposes.},

Future projections of R s based on climate models have large uncertainties that interfere with the efficient deployment of solar energy to achieve China&#39;s carbon-neutrality goal. Here we assess 24 models in the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 with historical observations in China and find systematic biases in simulating historical R s values likely due to model biases in cloud cover and clear-sky radiation, resulting in largely uncertain projections for future changes in R s . Based on emergent constraints, we obtain credible R s with narrowed uncertainties by ∼56% in the mid-twenty-first century and show that the mean R s change during 2050–2069 relative to 1995–2014 is 30% more brightening than the raw projections. Particularly in North China and Southeast China with higher power demand, the constrained projections present more significant brightening, highlighting the importance of considering the spatial changes in future R s when locating new solar energy infrastructures.},

Although MTB were discovered over half a century ago, the study of the magnetosome biogenesis and organization remains limited to a few cultured MTB strains. Here, we present an integrative genomic and phenomic analysis to investigate the genetic basis of magnetosome biomineralization in both cultured and uncultured strains from phylogenetically diverse MTB groups. The magnetosome gene contents/networks of strains are correlated with magnetic particle morphology and chain configuration.

  abstract     = {High-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity is a growing epidemic and major health concern. While excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a common symptom of HFD-induced obesity, preliminary findings suggest that reduced wakefulness could be improved with time-restricted feeding (TRF). At present, however, the underlying neural mechanisms remain largely unknown. The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) plays a role in maintaining wakefulness. We found that chronic HFD impaired the activity of PVT neurons. Notably, inactivation of the PVT was sufficient to reduce and fragment wakefulness during the active phase in lean mice, similar to the sleep–wake alterations observed in obese mice with HFD-induced obesity. On the other hand, enhancing PVT neuronal activity consolidated wakefulness in mice with HFD-induced obesity. We observed that the fragmented wakefulness could be eliminated and reversed by TRF. Furthermore, TRF prevented the HFD-induced disruptions on synaptic transmission in the PVT, in a feeding duration-dependent manner. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that ad libitum access to a HFD results in inactivation of the PVT, which is critical to impaired nocturnal wakefulness and increased sleep, while TRF can prevent and reverse diet-induced PVT dysfunction and excessive sleepiness. We establish a link between TRF and neural activity, through which TRF can potentially serve as a lifestyle intervention against diet/obesity-related EDS.},

Here, we report massive CH 4 -rich fluid inclusions in well-zoned garnet from eclogites in Western Tianshan, China. Petrological characteristics and carbon–hydrogen isotopic compositions confirm the abiotic origin of this CH 4 . Reconstructed P–T– f O 2 –fluid trajectories and Deep Earth Water modeling imply that massive abiotic CH 4 was generated during cold subduction at depths of 50–120 km, whereas CO 2 was produced during exhumation. The massive production of abiotic CH 4 in eclogites may result from multiple mechanisms during prograde high pressure-ultrahigh pressure metamorphism. Our flux calculation proposes that abiotic CH 4 that has been formed in HP-UHP eclogites in cold subduction zones may represent one of the largest, yet overlooked, sources of abiotic CH 4 on Earth.},

In this paper, we report a strategy to transform an artificial muscle into a new muscle with a different morphology by thermodynamic-twist coupling, and illustrate its structural evolution during actuation. The muscle length can be continuously modulated over a large temperature range, and actuation occurs by continuously changing the temperature. This strategy is applicable to different actuation modes, including tensile elongation, tensile contraction and torsional rotation. This is realized by twist insertion into a fibre to produce torsional stress. Fibre annealing causes partial thermodynamic relaxation of the spiral molecular chains, which serves as internal tethering and inhibits fibre twist release, thus producing a self-supporting artificial muscle that actuates under heating. At a sufficiently high temperature, further relaxation of the spiral molecular chains occurs, resulting in a new muscle with a different length. A structural study provides an understanding of the thermodynamic-twist coupling. This work provides a new design strategy for intelligent materials.},

Of particular interest with these technologies are their thin geometries, flexible/stretchable physical properties and unique form factors, to enable conformal and gentle contacts with soft, curved and dynamic surfaces of living tissues. Commercial embodiments of skin-integrated devices with clinical-grade monitoring capabilities are just now becoming widely available not only in developed countries but also in the most resource-constrained areas of the globe. A specific example is in skin-like—sometimes referred to as ‘epidermal’—wireless electronics for continuous monitoring of essential markers of physiological health status, with accuracy and reliability comparable to that of expensive, wired-based systems currently used with patients in intensive care units, but cost-effectively and applicable in any setting—in hospitals, health clinics, work environments or in the home. These technologies have the potential to revolutionize diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the care of patients.

With distinct molecular and physiological features, BLA SCT+ cells projected to the medial prefrontal cortex and were necessary and sufficient for promoting social investigation behaviors, whilst other basolateral amygdala neurons were anxiogenic and antagonized social behaviors. Moreover, the exogenous application of secretin effectively promoted social interest in both healthy and autism spectrum disorder model mice. These results collectively demonstrate a previously unrecognized group of amygdala neurons for mediating social behaviors and suggest promising strategies for social deficits.},

  abstract     = {Emerging van der Waals (vdW) magnets provide a paradise for the exploration of magnetism in the ultimate two-dimensional (2D) limit, and the construction of integrated spintronic devices, and have become a research frontier in the field of low-dimensional materials. To date, prototypical vdW magnets based on metals of the first transition series (e.g. V, Cr, Mn and Fe) and chalcogen elements suffer from rapid oxidation restricted by the Hard-Soft-Acid-Base principle, as well as low Curie temperatures ( T C ), which has become a generally admitted challenge in 2D spintronics. Here, starting from air-unstable Cr 2 Ge 2 Te 6 vdW thin flakes, we synthesize Ge-embedded PtTe 2 (namely PtTe 2 Ge 1/3 ) with superior air stability, through the displacement reaction in the Cr 2 Ge 2 Te 6 /Pt bilayer. In this process, the anomalous substitution of Cr with Pt in the thermal diffusion is inverse to the metal activity order, which can be attributed to the compatibility between soft-acid (Pt) and soft-base (Te) elements. Meanwhile, the layered uniform insertion of Ge unbalances Pt–Te bonds and introduces long-range ordered ferromagnetism with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and a Curie temperature above room temperature. Our work demonstrates the anti-metal-activity-order reaction tendency unique in 2D transition-metal magnets and boosts progress towards practical 2D spintronics.},

Nowadays, separated stretchable functional parts have been well developed and are approaching practical usage. However, the production of whole stretchable devices with full functions still faces a huge challenge: the integration of different components, which was hindered by the mechanical mismatch and stress/strain concentration at the connection interfaces. To avoid connection failure in stretchable devices, a new research focus is to improve the interfacial binding strength between different components. In this review, recent developments to enhance interfacial strength in wearable/implantable electronics are introduced and catalogued into three major strategies: (i) covalent bonding between different device parts, (ii) molecular interpenetration or mechanical interlocking at the interfaces and (iii) covalent connection between the human body and devices. Besides reviewing current methods, we also discuss the existing challenges and possible improvements for stretchable devices from the aspect of interfacial connections.},

Herein, we demonstrate benzobisthiazole-based covalent organic frameworks as a superior photocatalyst for hydrogen production. The product features high crystallinity with ordered 2.5-nm-wide cylindrical mesopores and great water wettability. These structural advantages afford our polymeric photocatalyst with fast charge carrier dynamics as evidenced by a range of spectroscopic characterizations and excellent catalytic performances when suspended in solution or supported on melamine foams. Under visible-light irradiation, it enables efficient and stable hydrogen evolution with a production rate of 487 μmol h −1 (or a mass-specific rate of 48.7 mmol g −1 h −1 )—far superior to the previous state of the art. We also demonstrate that hydrogen production can be stoichiometrically coupled with the oxidation conversion of biomass as exemplified by the conversion of furfuryl alcohol to 2-furaldehyde.},

The everyday life of a human body produces considerable mechanical energies and, in the meantime, the human body communicates mainly through mechanical signals, such as sound, body gestures and muscle movements. Therefore, the TENG has been intensively studied to serve as either wearable sources or wearable self-powered sensors.

  abstract     = {Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent regulated cell death process driven by excessive lipid peroxides, can enhance cancer vulnerability to chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy. As an essential upstream process for ferroptosis activation, lipid peroxidation of biological membranes is expected to be primarily induced by intrabilayer reactive oxygen species (ROS), indicating a promising strategy to initiate peroxidation by improving the local content of diffusion-limited ROS in the lipid bilayer. Herein, liposomes embedded with PEG-coated 3 nm γ-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles in the bilayer (abbreviated as Lp-IO) were constructed to promote the intrabilayer generation of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) from hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), and the integration of amphiphilic PEG moieties with liposomal bilayer improved lipid membrane permeability to H 2 O 2 and •OH, resulting in efficient initiation of lipid peroxidation and thus ferroptosis in cancer cells. Additionally, Lp-IO enabled traceable magnetic resonance imaging and pH/ROS dual-responsive drug delivery. Synergistic antineoplastic effects of chemotherapy and ferroptosis, and alleviated chemotherapeutic toxicity, were achieved by delivering doxorubicin (capable of xCT and glutathione peroxidase inhibition) with Lp-IO. This work provides an efficient alternative for triggering therapeutic lipid peroxidation and a ferroptosis-activating drug delivery vehicle for combination cancer therapies.},

However, the worst lattice oxygen escape at the high-voltage region easily causes structural instability, rapid capacity fading and safety issues upon cycling. Here, we report a dual-track strategy to fully restrain the escape of lattice oxygen from Ni-rich cathodes within 2.7–4.5 V by one-step Ta doping and CeO 2 coating according to their different diffusion energy barriers. The doped Ta can alleviate the charge compensation of oxygen anions as a positive charge centre to reduce the lattice oxygen escape and induce the formation of elongated primary particles, significantly inhibiting microcrack generation and propagation. Additionally, the layer of CeO 2 coating effectively captures the remaining escaped oxygen and then the captured oxygen feeds back into the lattice during subsequent discharge. The resultant Ni-rich cathode enables a capacity of 231.3 mAh g −1 with a high initial coulombic efficiency of 93.5%. A pouch-type full cell comprising this cathode and a graphite anode exhibits &gt;1000 times life cycles at 1C in the 2.7–4.5 V range, with 90.9% capacity retention.},

As an intriguing and active format, light control of droplets, typically induced by photochemistry, photomechanics, light-induced Marangoni effects or light-induced electric fields, enables remote and contactless control with remarkable spatial and temporal accuracy. However, current light control of droplets suffers from poor performance and limited reliability. Here we develop a new superamphiphobic material that integrates the dual merits of light and electric field by rationally preparing liquid metal particles/poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) polymer composites with photo-induced charge generation capability in real time, enabling light control of droplets on the basis of photo-induced dielectrophoretic force. We demonstrate that this photo-induced charged surface (PICS) imparts a new paradigm for controllable droplet motion, including high average velocity (∼35.9 mm s −1 ), unlimited distance, multimode motions (e.g. forward, backward and rotation) and single-to-multiple droplet manipulation, which are otherwise unachievable in conventional strategies. We further extend light control of droplets to robotic and bio-applications, including transporting a solid cargo in a closed tube, crossing a tiny tunnel, avoiding obstacles, sensing the changing environment via naked-eye color shift, preparing hydrogel beads, transporting living cells and reliable biosensing. Our PICS not only provides insight into the development of new smart interface materials and microfluidics, but also brings new possibilities for chemical and biomedical applications.},

Here, we report a lithium-plasmon-based low-powered dynamic color display with intrinsic dual functionality (plasmonic display and energy recycling unit) which is a result of the electric-field-driven transformation of nanostructured lithium metals. Dynamic color displays are enabled by plasmonic transformation through electrodeposition (electrostripping) of lithium metals during the charging (discharging) process, while the consumed energy for coloring can be retrieved in the inverse process respectively. Energy recycling of lithium metals brings energy consumption down to 0.390 mW cm −2 (0.105 mW cm −2 ) for the active (static) coloration state of a proof-of-concept display/battery device, which approaches nearly-zero-energy-consumption in the near-100%-energy-efficiency limit of commercial lithium batteries.

Exciton polaritons as bosonic quasiparticles have enabled studies of non-equilibrium quantum gases and superfluidity. Exciton–polariton condensates in artificial lattices intuitively emulate energy-band structures and quantum many-body effects of condensed matter, underpinning constructing vortex lattices and controlling quantum fluidic circuits. Here, we harness exciton–polariton quantum fluids of light in a frustrated kagome lattice based on robust metal–halide perovskite microcavities, to demonstrate vortex lasing arrays and modulate their configurations at room temperature. Tomographic energy–momentum spectra unambiguously reveal massless Dirac bands and quenched kinetic-energy flat bands coexisting in kagome lattices, where polariton condensates exhibit prototypical honeycomb and kagome spatial patterns. Spatial coherence investigations illustrate two types of phase textures of polariton condensates carrying ordered quantized-vortex arrays and π-phase shifts, which could be selected when needed using lasing emission energy. Our findings offer a promising platform on which it is possible to study quantum-fluid correlations in complex polaritonic lattices and highlight feasible applications of structured light.},

  abstract     = {The glycoproteome has emerged as a prominent target for screening biomarkers, as altered glycosylation is a hallmark of cancer cells. In this work, we incorporated tandem mass tag labeling into quantitative glycoproteomics by developing a chemical labeling-assisted complementary dissociation method for the multiplexed analysis of intact N -glycopeptides. Benefiting from the complementary nature of two different mass spectrometry dissociation methods for identification and multiplex labeling for quantification of intact N -glycopeptides, we conducted the most comprehensive site-specific and subclass-specific N -glycosylation profiling of human serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) to date. By analysing the serum of 90 human patients with varying severities of liver diseases, as well as healthy controls, we identified that the combination of IgG1-H3N5F1 and IgG4-H4N3 can be used for distinguishing between different stages of liver diseases. Finally, we used targeted parallel reaction monitoring to successfully validate the expression changes of glycosylation in liver diseases in a different sample cohort that included 45 serum samples.},

  abstract     = {Photoacoustic imaging, an acoustic imaging modality with potentially optical resolution in an optical turbid medium, has attracted great attention. However, the convergence of wavefront optimization and raster scanning in computational photoacoustic imaging leads to the challenge of fast mapping, especially for a spatial resolution approaching the acoustic deep-subwavelength regime. As a sparse sampling paradigm, compressive sensing has been applied in numerous fields to accelerate data acquisition without significant quality losses. In this work, we propose a dual-compressed approach for photoacoustic surface tomography that enables high-efficiency imaging with 3D spatial resolution unlimited by the acoustics in a turbid environment. The dual-compressed photoacoustic imaging with single-pixel detection, enabled by spatially optical modulation with synchronized temporally photoacoustic coding, allows decoding of the fine optical information from the modulated acoustic signal even when the variance of original photoacoustic signals is weak. We perform a proof-of-principle numerical demonstration of dual-compressed photoacoustic imaging, that resolves acoustic sub-acoustic-wavelength details with a significantly reduced number of measurements, revealing the potential for dynamic imaging. The dual-compressed concept, which transforms unobtrusive spatial difference into spatio-temporal detectable information, can be generalized to other imaging modalities to realize efficient, high-spatial-resolution imaging.},

  abstract     = {A photonic-crystal slab can support bound states in the continuum (BICs) that have infinite lifetimes but are embedded into the continuous spectrum of optical modes in free space. The formation of BICs requires a total internal reflection (TIR) condition at both interfaces between the slab and the free space. Here, we show that the TIR of Bloch waves can be directly obtained based on the generalized Fresnel equations proposed. If each of these Bloch waves picks up a phase with integer multiples of 2π for traveling a round trip, light can be perfectly guided in the slab, namely forming a BIC. A BIC solver with low computational complexity and fast convergence speed is developed, which can also work efficiently at high frequencies beyond the diffraction limit where multiple radiation channels exist. Two examples of multi-channel BICs are shown and their topological nature in momentum space is also revealed. Both can be attributed to the coincidence of the topological charges of far-field radiations from different radiation channels. The concept of the generalized TIR and the TIR-based BIC solver developed offer highly effective approaches for explorations of BICs that could have many potential applications in guided-wave optics and enhanced light–matter interactions.},
