  abstract     = {In this work, a novel technique to train machine learning models is introduced, which is based on digital simulations of certain types of quantum systems. This represents a drastic departure from the standard approach of quantum machine learning which, to this day, is based on the use of actual physical quantum systems. To provide a clear context, the field of quantum inspired machine learning is first provided. Then, we proceed with a detailed description of our proposed method. To conclude, some preliminary, yet compelling, results are presented and discussed. Although at a seminal stage, the author firmly believes that this approach could represent a valid and robust alternative to the way machine learning models are trained today.},

  abstract     = {River (fluvial), surface water (pluvial) and coastal flooding pose a significant risk to the United Kingdom. Therefore, it is important to assess flood risk particularly as the impacts of flooding are projected to increase due to climate change. Here we present a high resolution combined fluvial and pluvial flood susceptibility map of England. This flood susceptibility model is created by using past flood events and a series of meaningful hydrological parameters to a training machine learning model. We tested the relative performance of different machine learning algorithms, including Classification and Regression Trees, Random Forest and XGBoost and found the XGBoost performed the best, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.93. We also found the model performed well on unseen areas, and we discuss the possibility of extending to regions that has no information on past flood events. Additionally, to aid in understanding what factors may impact flood risk to a particular area, we used Shapley additive explanations which allowed us to investigate the sensitivity of the predicted flood probability to flood factors at a given location.},

  abstract     = {Users of e-commerce websites review different aspects of a product in the comment section. In this research, an approach is proposed for opinion aspect extraction and recognition in selling systems. We have used the users&#39; opinions from the Digikala website ( www.Digikala.com ), which is an Iranian e-commerce company. In this research, a language-independent framework is proposed that is adjustable to other languages. In this regard, after necessary text processing and preparation steps, the existence of an aspect in an opinion is determined using deep learning algorithms. The proposed model combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and long-short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning approaches. CNN is one of the best algorithms for extracting latent features from data. On the other hand, LSTM can detect latent temporal relationships among different words in a text due to its memory ability and attention model. The approach is evaluated on six classes of opinion aspects. Based on the experiments, the proposed model&#39;s accuracy, precision, and recall are 70%, 60%, and 85%, respectively. The proposed model was compared in terms of the above criteria with CNN, Naive Bayes, and SVM algorithms and showed satisfying performance.},

This paper aims to utilize machine learning classifiers to predict transactions flagged as a fraud in mobile money transfers. The data for this study were obtained from real-time transactions that simulate a well-known mobile transfer fraud scheme. Logistic regression is used as the baseline model and is compared with ensemble and gradient descent models. The results indicate that the logistic regression model still showed reasonable performance while not performing as well as the other models. Among all the measures, the random forest classifier exhibited outstanding performance. The amount of money transferred emerged as the top feature for predicting money laundering transactions in mobile money transfers. These findings suggest that further research is needed to enhance the logistic regression model, and the random forest classifier should be explored as a potential tool for law enforcement and financial institutions to detect money laundering activities in mobile money transfers.},

  abstract     = {Patents show how technology evolves in most scientific fields over time. The best way to use this valuable knowledge base is to use efficient and effective information retrieval and searches for related prior art. Patent classification, that is, assigning a patent to one or more predefined categories, is a fundamental step towards synthesizing the information content of an invention. To this end, architectures based on Transformers, especially those derived from the BERT family have already been proposed in the literature and they have shown remarkable results by setting a new state-of-the-art performance for the classification task. Here, we study how domain adaptation can push the performance boundaries in patent classification by rigorously evaluating and implementing a collection of recent transfer learning techniques, for example, domain-adaptive pretraining and adapters. Our analysis shows how leveraging these advancements enables the development of state-of-the-art models with increased precision, recall, and F 1-score. We base our evaluation on both standard patent classification datasets derived from patent offices-defined code hierarchies and more practical real-world use-case scenarios containing labels from the agrochemical industrial domain. The application of these domain adapted techniques to patent classification in a multilingual setting is also examined and evaluated.},

  abstract     = {Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder which is prevalent in individuals around the world, where diagnosis methods for this disorder are done via a combination of interview style questioning of the patient alongside a review of their medical record; but these methods have been largely criticised for being subjective between psychiatrists and largely unreplicable. Schizophrenia also occurs in adolescent individuals who have been said to be even more challenging to diagnose largely due to delusions being mistaken for childhood fantasies, and established methods for adult patients being applied to diagnose adolescents. This work investigates the use of electroencephalography (EEG) signals acquired from adolescent patients in the age range of 10–14 years, alongside signal processing methods and machine learning modelling towards the diagnosis of adolescent schizophrenia. The results from the machine learning modelling showed that the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and fine K-nearest neighbour (KNN) produced the best recognition results for models with easy and hard interpretability, respectively. Additionally, a computational method was applied towards contrasting the neuroanatomical activation patterns in the brain of the schizophrenic and normal adolescents, where it was seen that the neural activation patterns of the normal adolescents showed a greater consistency when compared with the schizophrenics.},
