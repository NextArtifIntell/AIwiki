These edges serve as observable conduits that may help practitioners and researchers better understand how vulnerabilities diffuse through SPNs. We apply network theory to analyze data from over 12 years of records extracted from the National Vulnerability Database. We contribute novel measures established using machine learning to gauge the properties influencing vulnerability diffusion within an SPN. We observed an SPN having a discernable shape that changed over time via network updates. We propose hypotheses and find empirical evidence that vulnerability diffusion is influenced by edge dynamics, developer responses, and their interaction. Implications for practice are that increased developer responses reduce software vulnerability diffusion attributed to edge dynamics.},

Fast fashion delivers fashion trends to consumers quickly and cheaply but has detrimental effects on the environment (e.g., waste accumulation, water pollution). To mitigate these harmful effects, we examine how different points of customer involvement in mass customization affect the anticipated number of months to product disposal and willingness-to-pay for mass-customized products. We employ a series of experiments and find that consumer perceptions of the degree of customization increase as the point of customer involvement shifts upstream from Use to Assembly to Fabrication to Design and that the anticipated number of months to disposal and willingness-to-pay increase as the point of customer involvement shifts upstream to Design . We also find that the implementation of customer involvement in mass customization matters. Overall, these results provide evidence that mass customization via Design may not only help slow fast fashion down, which has major sustainability implications, but it may also present a win-win opportunity for both the environment and firms (in terms of the bottom line—provided, of course, that it does not have any major cost disadvantages).},

  abstract     = {In a service exchange setting, the supply management literature generally assumes, with notable exceptions, the availability of complete information regarding supplier reliability. Highlighting the information asymmetry in supplier evaluation and using signaling theory, we argue that for a focal buyer, a supplier&#39;s downstream ego-network instability, that is, other buyers&#39; turnover in a supplier&#39;s network from one period to the next, acts as a signal of supplier unreliability, thereby reducing the price that the buyer pays to the supplier in a service exchange. Furthermore, we suggest that focal buyer–supplier relationship strength and structural equivalence weaken the negative effect of instability because the buyer has a more direct and positive experience with the supplier. Using a dataset of 3263 unique dyads formed by 260 buyers (shipoperators) and 493 suppliers (shipowners) during the 2000–2018 period in the container shipping charter market, we find support for our hypotheses, except for the contingent effect of structural equivalence. Our study contributes to signaling literature and network research by developing a supplier&#39;s downstream ego-network instability as a salient heuristic for a focal buyer&#39;s pricing decisions. These findings equip buyer managers who may not accurately foresee supplier service quality in the charter market with a new supplier evaluation tool: a supplier&#39;s downstream ego-network instability.},

We analyze data from a radiology workflow platform that connects off-site radiologists with hospitals. These radiologists select tasks from a common pool, while service level is defined by priority-specific turnaround time targets. However, imbalances between pay and workload of different tasks could result in higher priority tasks with low pay-to-workload ratio receiving poorer service. We investigate this hypothesis, showing turnaround time is decreasing in pay-to-workload for lower priority tasks, whereas it is increasing in workload for high-priority tasks. Crucially, we find evidence of an externality effect: Having many economically attractive tasks with low priority can lead to longer turnaround times for higher priority tasks, increasing their likelihood of delay, thus partially defeating the purpose of the priority classes.},

  abstract     = {The cost of medical supplies represents a significant portion of hospital spending. Hospitals manage different types of medical supplies, such as general medical supplies and physician preference items. General medical supplies tend to be numerous and relatively low cost, while physician preference items tend to be less numerous and more expensive. Strong physician preference for certain medical supplies can limit the options available to reduce inventory costs. The use of consignment inventory is one way in which hospitals seek to reduce inventory costs for both general supplies as well as physician preference items. However, the use of consignment reduces the level of oversight that hospitals have on consigned inventories, thereby potentially increasing the likelihood of shrinkage. The impact of consignment on shrinkage cost has received limited attention. We investigate this issue by drawing upon the precepts of agency theory and by analyzing hospital data that span multiple years. Our results suggest that the use of consignment increases shrinkage and spend. We develop empirically informed analytical models to better understand the impact of an unforeseen increase in shrinkage on the cost associated with general and physician preference items. The analytical investigation suggests that the impact on general and physician preference items differ depending on the type of consignment contract negotiated between a hospital and a vendor. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of our findings.},

We focus on near-miss bias: (1) the preference for near-miss events, that is, risky production quantities that reach the target but narrowly avoid disruption; and (2) riskier decision-making due to such preferences. We propose a reference-dependent behavioral model that explains the near-miss bias. The findings of a laboratory experiment show that production quantities are evaluated based on realized profits and are below the optimal model prediction. Contracts associated with lower perceived severity, that is, the ratio of flat penalty to wholesale price, result in lower production quantities than those with higher perceived severity, even though the standard model does not predict any effect. A structural estimation analysis indicates that the behavioral model performs better than the standard model in terms of predictive accuracy and goodness of fit. Our analysis provides insights for managers who design supply chain contracts in settings with considerable risk of disruption due to a shortage of critical parts.},

This work describes an application of the Theory of Constraints (TOC) to the judicial system for the purpose of designing an intervention to alleviate court congestion – an intervention that won the 2012 Goldratt Foundation New Knowledge Award. In cooperation with the Jerusalem District Court in Israel, the judicial process was reviewed through the lens of TOC, and a set of operational changes was implemented to reduce case processing time. Data collected before and after this intervention indicate the potential of achieving lead-time reduction by applying TOC to judicial environments.},

Our work solves an industrial-sized problem faced by practitioners, with the reality of implementation motivating us to develop a tailored reinforcement learning approach. Our approach proceeds in two steps. First, a recommended average discount is computed with a reinforcement learning algorithm. Then, the recommended average discount is turned into a capacity allocation through a linear program. This approach overcomes the challenges of characterizing demand and estimating cancellations, and it facilitates hotel managers&#39; acceptance of the revenue management system. We implement this approach in the hotel chain in a pilot study and assess its effectiveness using synthetic control methods. Our approach improves the key operational performance measure—revenue per available room—by 11.80\%. There is heterogeneity in how the pilot hotels improve their revenue per available room. Some mainly increase their occupancy rate, some mainly increase the average daily room rate, while others experience significant increases in both. Further analysis shows that our approach uncovers the individual sources of suboptimal performance in pilot hotels and correspondingly improves decision-making. Our work demonstrates that a reinforcement learning approach for hotel revenue management is promising.},

While prior research has focused mainly on hospital-specific factors and their impact on patient mortality, surgeon risk factors and patient outcomes, such as readmission risk, have received less attention. We study three drivers of CABG readmission risk—hospital and surgeon case volume, variation in surgeon volume, and surgeon familiarity with hospitals. Drawing on unique patient data sets of CABG surgeries spanning 3 years, we study the relationships between hospital and surgeon case volume, readmission risk, and postoperative length of stay (PLOS). We find evidence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between case volume and readmission risk and a U-shaped relationship with PLOS. Our results also indicate that surgeon volume variation moderates the relationship between surgeon volume and readmission risk, where readmission risk increases with greater variation in surgeon volume. We observe that the impact of surgeon experience on readmission risk at the focal hospital outweighs their experience at other hospitals. Our study has significant implications for hospital resource management as it highlights the role of surgeon and hospital experience in improving patient outcomes after CABG surgery.},

In this research, we undertake a fine-grained, unit-level analysis to understand the relationships between nurse staffing, nurse turnover, and pressure ulcers, the latter of which is a key nursing-sensitive care quality indicator. We examine these relationships within two types of hospital units: intensive care units (ICUs) and medical-surgical (MedSurg) units, which have unique patient mixes and needs. Using hospital unit-level data between 2008 and 2017, we show that nurse staffing primarily affects nurse turnover in ICUs, and that the adverse effects of nurse turnover on care quality tend to be stronger in ICUs than in MedSurg units. These findings provide important theoretical insights into the varying roles of staffing, turnover, and quality across organizational units. The findings suggest that hospital administrators may prioritize staffing needs for ICUs over MedSurg units to maintain strong quality performance on measures such as pressure ulcers. Further, our study reveals that staffing requirements for ICUs may be inadequate compared with MedSurg units. Thus, there is a need to evaluate existing guidelines on ICU staffing.},

Home shopping networks adopt promotional tactics to pitch sales and even encourage consumers&#39; impulse buying. Marketing and sales management often assume that home shoppers&#39; impulse buying will increase sales and profits, not considering the possibility that a significant number of impulse purchases could be canceled or returned. In general, product shortages driven by consumers&#39; impulse buying may create a phantom stockout condition whereas non-impulsive consumers are deprived of purchasing opportunities while products are in the process of being canceled or returned. This is the first large-scale empirical study that addresses the relationship between impulse buying and product shortages in a network retail context. Based on actual transaction data, a novel research plan is developed to measure the impact of consumers&#39; impulse buying on the retailer&#39;s revenue and product shortages. The findings indicate that impulse buying may cause product shortages directly. We conduct a post hoc analysis to investigate the differences in the impact of impulse buying between newly introduced and existing products and between hedonic and utilitarian products. Based on the empirical findings, we provide managerial implications for home shopping network retailers.},

We conducted a longitudinal study of four networks to deliver vital services into a large project. We identified how the choice of network governance form was based on task complexity. A shared governance form was chosen for networks developed to deliver routine services, whereas a lead organization governance form was chosen for networks set up to deliver complex services. However, findings showed that the selection of an appropriate governance form was not sufficient for ensuring high performance. The network orchestrator&#39;s mode of coordination (formal or informal), the intensity of coordination (active or passive), and fit with the form of governance form (shared or lead organization governed) was important in driving performance.},

  abstract     = {Trust is considered essential to interfirm knowledge acquisition across borders. However, recent studies indicate that interfirm collaboration can thrive even in low trust situations. This study proposes that low trust can facilitate supplier knowledge acquisition (SKA) across borders if it is aligned with the other party&#39;s trust. Rather than high trust from a single party, trust congruence—similar levels of trust from buyers and suppliers regardless of their levels—may be more predictive of successful knowledge acquisition across borders. We further propose that different types of trust congruence have distinct effects on SKA across borders. Last, we propose that the influence of trust congruence on SKA is conditional on the presence of effective knowledge appropriability mechanisms (KAMs) and institutional distance between buyer and supplier home countries in cross-border transactions. Data are collected from 648 managers working for 162 matched dyads of manufacturing suppliers in China and buyers from 24 OECD countries. The findings support the propositions and suggest that supply chain managers should pay attention to aligning trust levels with their partners in cross-border transactions, and especially do so when lacking effective KAMs and when buyers and suppliers are from similar institutional environments.},

However, our understanding of the multilevel nature of technology workarounds and their performance implications remains limited. Drawing upon the multilevel theory of system usage and adaptive structuration theory, the current study examines the conditions under which group technology workarounds affect group performance, individual technology workarounds, and individual performance. Based on two studies with different research designs, we find that group technology workarounds have distinctive effects on short- and on long-term group performance. Specifically, while the impact of group technology workarounds on group performance is significantly positive in the short term, such effect diminishes over time. System failure and competition intensity strengthen the positive effect of group technology workarounds on short-term performance, whereas system failure and task nonroutineness lessen the negative effect of group technology workarounds on long-term performance. Our study further confirms the multilevel nature of technology workarounds, finding that group technology workarounds can influence individual technology workarounds and thereby individual performance. Our results support the view that technology workarounds as a group action should be considered alongside individual technology workarounds, as well as their positive and negative effects on both group and individual performance, in both the short- and long-term.},

  abstract     = {Although prior research in operations management has explored the working capital—firm performance relationship, the results from these studies remain inconclusive, with studies finding positive, curvilinear, or even insignificant relationships. This is largely due to contingent factors that make this relationship both complex and idiosyncratic. To strengthen the beneficial effect of working capital on performance, firms must therefore make appropriate investments that would foster more objective, informed, and firm-specific working capital choices. This article examines one such investment, namely in information technology (IT), that can allow firms to optimize the working capital–firm performance relationship. This is important, as the role of IT in this relationship is yet to be explored. Using proprietary IT data from the Harte Hanks database, and based on a sample of 1,054 US-based manufacturing firms during 2011–2013, we find that IT investment positively moderates the performance effects of inventory, payables, and receivables cycles, and that these moderating effects vary by the type of IT investment, namely IT infrastructure and IT labor. Drawing on the theory of the Smart Machine, we explain how IT infrastructure and IT labor perform distinct roles that can help automate (i.e., use technology to increase the speed and accuracy of process execution) and/or informate (i.e., use technology to create new information), thereby moderating the working capital–firm performance relationship. We argue and find evidence that, due to the largely transactional nature of working capital processes, IT infrastructure has a relatively stronger moderating effect on performance than IT labor.},

This paper investigates how deadline orientation (an individual-level preference of developers for completing work close to deadlines) and architectural modularity (a characteristic of products) influence central outcomes in software development. We argue that architectural modularity positively interacts with deadline orientation to influence software quality and the job satisfaction of developers. Our empirical analyses, using rare and high-quality data from 131 software developers and 29 product owners working at a captive software development center in India of a leading global software firm, confirm our hypotheses. We contribute to the literature on software development by showing that the fit between the technological characteristics of the software product (i.e., architectural modularity) and people factors (i.e., the temporal work style preferences of developers) plays an important role in shaping both software quality and job satisfaction. Our study has wider implications for the literature on software development, temporal work styles, and architectural modularity. It is instructive for practitioners tasked with hiring or allocating software developers for software products with varying technological characteristics in their digital transformation efforts.},

  abstract     = {Digital technology has enabled significant productivity gains in many industries. Manufacturers have benefited from robotics, and service businesses have benefited from self-service technologies. An area that has seen only meager productivity gains is professional services, such as healthcare, consulting, legal services, and higher education. Despite the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and other new technologies, professional services continue to be labor intensive with high labor costs. In 2021, Sampson published an empirically-based framework suggesting that emerging technologies would allow professional services to improve productivity by automating some tasks with self-service technologies, outsourcing some tasks to remote professionals, and delegating some tasks to semiprofessional workers. The underlying theory was that this restructuring hinges on the creative and interpersonal skill requirements of various tasks. Our research builds on Sampson&#39;s framework by modeling a professional service operation and studying the influence of task offloading on costs and quality. Our model involves discrete event simulation parameterized by empirical data. We consider labor costs, managerial costs, delay costs (including customer balking), and assessment costs. Results show contexts wherein increased task offloading can reduce costs with negligible impact on quality, suggesting great opportunities for reengineering professional services through increased automation, offshore outsourcing, and task delegation.},

The vision of Industry 4.0 is to mobilize industry to seek out these possibilities for improvement and to close the gap between opportunity and reality. However, when compared with more established improvement opportunities such as lean manufacturing, the digitalization of manufacturing lacks in both paradigmatic examples and an understanding of how to achieve the benefits. This lack is a complication of concern: Without an appropriate operations strategy to capture the value of digitalization, manufacturing companies will be unable to focus on technological investments and operational changes. To address this concern, operations management academics must develop new theory through active engagement in the practice of digitalization in manufacturing. This research presents a paradigmatic example, based on engaged scholarship, focused on effectively combining novel object-interactive and conventional manufacturing syntax for benefiting from digitalization in internal operations and the wider supply chain. The contribution to literature is a novel operations strategy—hybrid digital manufacturing—for capturing the value of Industry 4.0 technologies.},

This motivates us to examine how surge pricing causally affects driver earnings and labor supply by leveraging a unique quasi-experiment, in which a leading ride-sharing company in China introduced surge pricing in two cities at different times. Using a difference-in-differences design with the causal forest method, we find that surge pricing led to increases in drivers&#39; weekly revenue. Decomposing the weekly revenue into “intensive margin” and “extensive margin” factors, we discover two countervailing effects at play: a cherry-picking effect and a competition effect, and the daily revenue decreased because the latter dominated. Consequently, the increased weekly revenue can be explained by the extensive margin: drivers worked on more days to compensate for the decreased daily revenue, a result consistent with the income targeting behavior. Finally, we examine heterogeneous treatment effects across drivers, and find that surge pricing enticed more part-time drivers to flood the market and crowd out full-time drivers, and that the increase in the drivers&#39; weekly revenue was primarily driven by part-time drivers. Therefore, the benefit of surge pricing was unevenly distributed across drivers.},

These insights are derived through a multiple case study approach involving 61 semi-structured interviews with managers from eight sharing economy platforms (DiDi, Uber China, Huochebang, Yunmanman, OfO, Mobike, Evcard, and Zhida) across four sharing economy industries in China (ride-sharing, logistics-sharing, bike-sharing, and car-sharing). The findings highlight the importance of exchange and collaboration with stakeholders (allies) in the network, as well as the effective response to emerging issues through the adaptation of the business models. In addition, mergers and acquisitions, and the role of government are identified as critical components in aiding platforms in their progression toward institutionalization. Further cognitive, regulative, and normative factors are found to represent valuable institutional pillars that serve as a fertile foundation throughout the institutionalization process. Overall, the findings provide an intriguing insight into the journey of Chinese sharing economy platforms toward institutionalization.},

We leverage theoretical tenets on two-sided markets and on spatial pricing and capacity management in the sharing economy to inform a set of empirical and simulation models. Empirically, we use data on 156,520 observations of dynamic pricing and capacity distribution within Uber&#39;s San Francisco region. Estimation of a spatial econometric model reveals that the number of active drivers in neighboring zones negatively impacts the price in focal zones. Simultaneously, we find that spatial proximity is a significant factor in determining the distribution of prices when service demand levels are sufficiently high. We leverage this simultaneity finding to advance the literature on the sharing economy by incorporating operational considerations such as distributed capacity into service design. We link these econometric results with profit and welfare using a simulation that tests a variety of DSD pricing strategies under varying elasticity and revenue-sharing conditions. Our findings offer guidance to firms managing two-sided sharing economy platforms on tracking demand- and supply side price elasticity levels as well as revenue sharing spread when seeking to maximize profit, welfare, or both.},

This research draws on the asset orchestration perspective to examine incumbents&#39; asset orchestration (i.e., operational and governance actions) as they respond to threats from the sharing economy and the effectiveness of these actions in curbing a sharing economy firm&#39;s performance. We also analyze how the sharing economy firm&#39;s competitive moves counteract incumbents&#39; asset orchestration responses. Our longitudinal empirical analysis in the accommodation industry demonstrates that the growth of sharing economy increases incumbent hotels&#39; asset-based operational actions, which reduce the sharing economy&#39;s performance. Although incumbents&#39; asset governance actions increase as the local sharing economy grows, they do not seem to hinder sharing economy&#39;s performance. This research highlights the role of asset orchestration in the competition between incumbents and the sharing economy and contributes to the operations and sharing economy literature.},

We start by recapping the characteristics that distinguish field experiments from other common types of experiments and organizing the relevant OM studies by topic. Corresponding to the commonly overlooked issues in field experiment-based OM studies, we then provide a detailed roadmap, ranging from experimental design and implementation to post-experiment analysis. We further outline the methodological and practical issues as well as corresponding solutions when applying field experiments.

We attempt to fill this gap by conducting a literature review of recent developments in supervised ML in OM to identify vacancies in the extant literature, shedding light on how ML applications can move beyond problem-solving into theory building, and formulating a procedure to help OM scholars leverage ML for exploratory theory development. Our procedure employs the random forest with well-developed properties and inference toolkits that are crucial for empirical research. We then expand the boundary of ML usage and connect supervised ML to the explanatory modeling and hypothesis testing employed by OM empiricists for decades, and discuss the use of supervised ML for causal inference from observational data. We posit that contemporary ML can facilitate pattern exploration and enhance the validity of theory testing.

  abstract     = {Business models designed to serve those at the “base of the pyramid” are an effective means to create employment and improve quality of life. However, the effect that poverty has on the performance of such businesses is not well-understood. We address this gap through the context of “mobile money,” an electronic currency ecosystem designed as a secure, reliable way for those at the base of the pyramid to store and transfer money. Using data from Kenya and Uganda, and instrumenting for potentially endogenous regressors, we examine the effect poverty has on operational decisions (inventory and price transparency) and market dimensions (network density and demand). Our results suggest that mobile money, as a base of the pyramid business model, is well-positioned to serve those in poverty up to a point, with demand increasing in poverty when the concentration of poverty is sufficiently low. However, our results indicate that, where poverty is more pervasive, inventory costs increase in poverty while per agent demand and agent network density both decrease. In short, the business case for mobile money degenerates in regions where it, arguably, is needed the most. We conclude with thoughts on how to buttress mobile money&#39;s business case in these high poverty settings.},

Based on a sample of US buyer–supplier pairs from 1982 to 2017, we find that DO benefits buyer performance, but not supplier performance. The results support the view that DO mainly provides greater control for the buyer. Furthermore, we find that the performance effects of DO are moderated by firm characteristics that engender dependence. The beneficial influence of DO on a buyer&#39;s performance is more pronounced when the buyer is more innovative or operates in a more competitive environment. Our examination of the effects of DO on the operations of suppliers and buyers finds that suppliers in buyer–supplier relationships (BSRs) with higher DO invest more in relationship-specific assets (R&amp;D), provide more trade credits, and have lower gross profit margins. Buyers in BSRs with higher DO receive more trade credits and have lower cost of goods sold when the purchases of the buyer from the supplier make up a high proportion of the buyer&#39;s cost of goods sold. Overall, these results suggest that DO primarily benefits the buyer at the expense of the supplier, a finding that is consistent with the effects of bargaining and control power of the buyer. We discuss the implications of these findings for practitioners and for extensions to both relational and resource dependence theories.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the capacity decisions of complementary suppliers who produce different components of a final product. The suppliers solicit private forecast information from a buyer who has more precise information regarding the market as compared to the suppliers. In this context, the lowest capacity built among suppliers—termed as effective capacity —represents the bottleneck of a supply chain, which in turn determines the throughput of the entire channel. The standard analysis based on full rationality posits that the capacity decisions of suppliers are based on their prior belief of demand, with no consideration of the buyer&#39;s information dissemination or the number of peer suppliers. We test the predictions experimentally, and our laboratory observations reject the prediction of rational model. Then, we develop a behavioral model based on suppliers&#39; heterogeneity in the processing of demand information provided by the buyer. Our behavioral model indicates that suppliers lower their capacity levels when the number of suppliers increases, thereby exacerbating the supplier bottleneck. While the buyer may exaggerate the market demand to ensure abundant supply, interestingly, the inflation can benefit suppliers by increasing their capacity levels. In this manner, the inflation of the buyer can serve to mitigate the supplier bottleneck, thereby resulting in a win–win outcome for both the suppliers and the buyer.},

Here, we apply the lens of positivist agency theory to study four cases of technology management and agency in multi-tier outsourced logistics services. Our findings suggest that while ICT remedies some information asymmetry, it also creates new information asymmetry—and gives rise to user privacy concerns. Furthermore, the setting of multi-tier subcontracted logistics services appears to be a critical factor in designing governance mechanisms for effective technology management. In addition to our theoretical contributions to technology management in multi-tier outsourcing, we offer an empirical account of agency, proposals for future research, and practical suggestions to help managers tackle agency issues that arise from information asymmetry.},

Our study makes use of such dramatic changes in demand and supply during the pandemic to examine resource dependence and power balancing/unbalancing issues in buyer–supplier relationships. Specifically, we investigate the effect of customer and supplier concentrations on firm resilience during the pandemic. Drawing on resource-dependence theory (RDT), we theorize that shifts in demand and supply in different pandemic stages influence the effect of customer and supplier concentrations on firm resilience by altering the power dynamics between focal firms and their concentrated customers and suppliers. Central to our theorizing is that the worsening power imbalance is more detrimental. Measuring firm resilience by loss and recovery (i.e., change) in productivity, our analysis of 23,440 Chinese listed firms&#39; quarter observations from 2019 to 2020 shows that customer concentration is negatively related to firm resilience in the disruption stage but has no effect in the restoration stage. Supplier concentration is positively related to firm resilience in the disruption stage but undermines firm resilience in the restoration stage. These findings largely confirm our theoretical propositions. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications.},

An analysis of data from a Chinese e-commerce platform using operational indicators finds that integration between the e-commerce platform and suppliers in terms of information sharing, joint planning and logistics cooperation has positive impacts on supply chain resilience, while procurement automation has the opposite effect. Furthermore, product flexibility positively moderates the impacts of information sharing, joint planning and logistics cooperation. The results enhance current understandings of the factors that contribute to the development of supply chain resilience and reveal that the relationship between integration and resilience should be examined within a contingency framework.

We find that imposing COVID-19 anti-contagion policies on firms and their suppliers or customers significantly increases their operating revenue volatility, slows their recovery, and has repercussions on their supply chains. WFH enhances firms&#39; resistance capacity by reducing the effect of COVID-19 on their operating revenue volatility and disruptions to their supply chain partners; however, it also decreases their recovery capacity by extending the time taken to return to normal. Firm attributes, along with workers&#39; occupations, education, and experience, have an impact on the effect of WFH on firm resilience.

Companies from various industries responded to the urgent need for these potentially life-saving products by adopting ad hoc supply chains in an exceptionally short time: They found new suppliers, developed the products, ramped-up production, and distributed to new customers within weeks or even days. We define these supply chains as ad hoc supply chains that are built for a specific need, an immediate need, and a time-limited need. By leveraging a unique sampling, we examined how companies realize supply chain agility when building ad hoc supply chains. We develop an emergent theoretical model that proposes dynamic capabilities to enable companies building ad hoc supply chains in response to a specific need, moderated by an entrepreneurial orientation allowing firms to leverage dynamic capabilities at short notice and a temporary orientation that increases a company&#39;s focus on exploiting the short-term opportunity of ad hoc supply chains.},

Through an event study of 1357 Chinese manufacturing companies, we find that the government&#39;s emergency response policy triggered statistically significant positive abnormal returns for manufacturers. However, we also find that there exists a negative impact on abnormal returns for manufacturers that are labor-intensive, giving rise to arguments based in resource dependence theory. In addition, the results indicate the positive role played by operational slack (e.g., financial and inventory slack) in helping manufacturers maintain operations and business continuity, effectively mitigating risks and adding to the manufacturers&#39; resilience. With these findings, we contribute to operations and supply chain management by calling attention to the importance of human resource redundancy while at the same time identifying financial slack and inventory as supply chain resilience strategies that were able to mitigate pandemic-related risks.},

  abstract     = {The coronavirus/SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak has caused severe supply chain disruptions in practically all industries worldwide. Online e-commerce platforms, which interact directly with various industries and service numerous consumers, have become remarkable interfaces to observe the impacts of the pandemic on supply chains. Using quantitative operational data obtained from JD.com https://www.jd.com ., this study analyzes the impact of the pandemic on supply chain resilience, summarizes the challenging scenarios that retailing supply chains experienced in China, and presents the practical response of JD.com throughout the pandemic. To summarize, the pandemic caused exceptional demand and severe logistical disruptions in China, and JD.com has handled well its supply chain management in response based on its integrated supply chain structure and comprehensive intelligent platforms. In particular, the existing intelligent platforms and the delivery procedures were modified slightly but promptly to deal with specific disruptions. Moreover, the entire market scenario in China was effectively controlled through the joint efforts of multiple firms, the government, and the entire Chinese society. Our study provides an example of using practical operational indicators to analyze supply chain resilience, and suggests firms pay attention to operational flexibility and collaboration beyond supply chains to deal with a large-scale supply chain disruption, such as the COVID-19 outbreak.},

  abstract     = {New product development (NPD) is a risky and expensive endeavor. Therefore, discontinuing less promising NPD projects, based on their development trajectories, is very important, yet firms face challenges when deciding whether and when to discontinue NPD projects. This article examines how characteristics of a firm&#39;s prior success and failure experiences, such as the number of launched and discontinued past projects, their attributes (i.e., the codification and quality of the knowledge underlying these past projects), and their level of relatedness (i.e., similarity) to current projects, influence the risks of continuing and discontinuing NPD projects, thus impacting their future discontinuation decisions. We adopt a mixed method approach, where we formally model and empirically test the influence of prior experiences on future decision-making. A formal model enables us to offer reasoning that considers the risks of continuing a project versus discontinuing that project as the basis for theoretical arguments for a set of proposed testable relationships. We then empirically test these relationships on 2938 new drug development projects of biopharma firms worldwide. We find that firms with a greater amount of success and failure experiences tend to discontinue less promising NPD projects sooner than firms with less success and failure experiences. Also, we find that while the attributes (particularly knowledge codification) of successful experiences predominantly helped firms decide on timely discontinuation, failure experiences influenced firms&#39; decision on timely discontinuation only when the projects were closely related to their failure experiences.},

  abstract     = {There is mixed evidence on the effectiveness of voluntary environmental programs. We evaluate a voluntary program aimed at reducing transportation emissions, that is, the U.S. EPA SmartWay Program. We construct a novel database of the physical assets used by firms before and after they joined SmartWay and compare changes in the age of their assets with that of firms that did not join SmartWay. Our results show that firms that participated in SmartWay operate substantially newer (i.e., cleaner) trucks compared with non-SmartWay participants, indicating that SmartWay participation is a credible signal of a firm&#39;s reduced emissions footprint emanating from truck operations. After the start of SmartWay, firms that joined invested in newer trucks relative to firms that did not, with about a year reduction in average truck age several years after the program began. SmartWay had a larger effect on firms that own their trucks compared with firms that outsource ownership, and sustained participation increased the program&#39;s effectiveness. We estimate that the SmartWay Program has reduced commercial transportation emissions from operations by 25.2 million metric tons of CO 2 by increasing the incentive to invest in newer, cleaner trucks. Our study provides insight into factors that make voluntary environmental programs effective.},

  abstract     = {Understanding negotiators&#39; decision-making processes in buyer–supplier relationships has been of key interest to behavioral operations and supply chain management researchers. We hypothesize that through the exposure to various counterparts in the supply chain network, negotiators&#39; behaviors are influenced by others&#39; behaviors and prone to behavioral contagion —where the target adopts the behavior he/she is subjected to and exhibits it toward a nonpartisan counterpart. This paper examines such contagion where targets turn into actors of honesty and deception across buyer–supplier negotiations. We analyzed text responses from two studies employing scenario-based negotiation experiments with 350 and 424 individuals with B2B sales experience and tested for the effects of previously received behavior (honesty/deception) and different frequency levels of the received behavior. Our results show contagion effects for honesty and deception in both studies. These effects are largely independent from the frequency with which the behaviors have been received, suggesting that a low stimulus frequency suffices to induce contagion of honest and deceptive behaviors across buyer–supplier negotiations. Interestingly, in contrast to our hypothesized key mechanism based on the extant literature, neither injunctive nor descriptive social norms mediated the relationship between received and acted behaviors. We offer alternative explanations and discuss implications for theory and practice.},

  abstract     = {Refurbishing has promising economic potential, yet firms remain wary of its potential cannibalization effect on new product sales. Firms need to make strategic choices in competitive settings, involving varying brand strengths and collection constraints. The current study provides an empirical characterization of consumer behavior in such complex settings, which in turn informs an analytical model of optimal pricing policies. The results show that cannibalization (or switching) in a competitive environment has a linear relationship with price discounts, unlike the inverted U-shaped relationship observed in monopolistic settings. The experimental results also highlight the relevance of cross-cannibalization, especially for weaker firms (with low brand value) that compete with stronger firms to sell refurbished products. Our subsequent analytical results reveal how both competitors should adjust their refurbished product prices when internal and cross-cannibalization coefficients change. Weaker firms should focus on surpassing stronger competitors in terms of collection and refurbishing efforts, which implies a predominant focus on operations. Finally, we show that refurbished product prices are a function of, and profits are concave in relation to, the number of core products collected by firms.},

  abstract     = {As more firms look to implement omnichannel strategies to mitigate the inherent information barriers between online and offline channels, understanding the outcomes of these initiatives is critical. This study empirically examines the impact of the decision to share brick-and-mortar (B&amp;M) store product availability information with customers, specifically focusing on the scenario where a discrepancy exists in the product assortment of online and offline channels. We investigate the impact of this information sharing strategy on customer research shopping trajectories using a proprietary dataset collected from a leading North American retailer. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that this strategy helps boost the overall sales from customers who reside within the trade area of a retail store. At the channel level, the policy induces customers to migrate from the B&amp;M channel to the online channel after learning that the product selection offered at their local retail store may not meet their needs, resulting in a significant increase in online sales, but a slight decrease in B&amp;M sales. From an operational perspective, our empirical evidence suggests that sharing retail store product availability information leads to more customers using the expedited shipping service when shopping online. Furthermore, we also discover a slight increase in the overall return rate. We conclude by providing managerial implications on the functionality of the online and B&amp;M channels and how retailers can coordinate services offered by both channels to improve the utility customers receive from the brand.},

  abstract     = {The rise of omni-channel retailing poses challenges for e-marketplace platforms. To retain third-party sellers in the face of competitive pressure from rivals, e-marketplace platforms are compelled to provide support for online-offline channel integration (OOCI). However, the provision of OOCI support can adversely affect an OOCI-enabled platform&#39;s product sales growth by encouraging consumers to switch to brick-and-mortar stores operated by third-party sellers. To ascertain how the OOCI-enabled platform can outperform under such circumstances, we analyzed data on sales of 51,409 products on a dominant Chinese e-marketplace platform as well as inter-platform function usage difference across 209 third-party sellers. Combining propensity score matching with hierarchical linear modeling, we discovered that informational OOCI (e.g., concurrent availability of a product on both online and offline channels) negatively influences the OOCI-enabled platform&#39;s product sales growth, whereas the effect of physical OOCI (e.g., the option of store pickup for online purchases) is not significant. Additionally, we found that the three constituent sub-dimensions of third-party sellers&#39; inter-platform function usage difference (i.e., volume difference, category orientation specialization, and uniqueness) moderate the impact of OOCI on the OOCI-enabled platform&#39;s product sales growth differently. Findings from this study thus yield actionable guidelines for e-marketplace platforms pursuing omni-channel retailing strategies.},

Drawing on the political embeddedness perspective, we propose a negative association between political ties and operational efficiency and examine how this association is moderated by environmental and firm-level factors. Using panel data of listed private firms in China, we show that political ties are negatively correlated with operational efficiency. In addition, this negative relationship is stronger when firms operate in regions with less developed factor markets and in highly competitive industries. However, the negative relationship is weaker for firms with high levels of foreign shareholding and customer concentration. These findings caution against the downsides of political ties for operations management and highlight strategies for reducing their negative effect.},

The data comes from Chinese automotive suppliers of a western manufacturer and consists of 154 environmental project portfolios that contain 614 environmental improvement projects as well as firm-level data from Dun &amp; Bradstreet. A data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to estimate the firms&#39; efficiency in transforming resources into environmental outcomes. Then an econometric analysis evaluates the impact of the portfolio effect (i.e., environmental project portfolio composition) on the firm&#39;s efficiency in improving the environment. The empirical results show that when firms reduce the heterogeneity in the types of environmental projects in their portfolios (i.e., a more focused portfolio), they can more efficiently improve environmental outcomes. However, firms may want to introduce diversity in the types of environmental projects in their portfolio (i.e., reducing the focus).The analysis shows that more environmentally capable firms can increase the diversity of the projects in their portfolios without negatively impacting outcomes. In addition, firms can better manage diversity in their portfolios when they balance socially oriented projects with technically oriented projects. This study contributes to the theory of project portfolio roles in improving environmental outcomes and offers several novel insights for project portfolio managers working to improve environmental outcomes with limited resources.},

  abstract     = {The growing popularity of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies is driven by the flexibility in transaction fee offerings, among other factors. To achieve service-level differentiation among their users, many cryptocurrencies allow users to “name your own price,” giving rise to a large variation in fee offerings and hence, variation in confirmation times. Yet, the time it takes a cryptocurrency transaction to be confirmed in the blockchain is not only affected by the fee offered, but also by the contemporaneous congestion level and the inherent randomness in the verification process. Although it is generally expected that higher fees lead to quicker confirmation, the uniqueness of the cryptocurrency setting adds important nuances to the fee-speed relationship. Using Bitcoin—the original and most heavily used cryptocurrency by far—as our empirical context, we stylize the transaction confirmation processes, propose a theoretical framework that maps the causal path from fee to speed, and estimate this framework using Bitcoin transaction data under periods of high volatility. Our results show strong evidence for two characteristics of fee&#39;s impact: congestion dependence and tail shrinkage. Our finding that the speed acceleration effect of fee is particularly strong on the tail of the confirmation time distribution motivates a target service level approach to fee recommendation. To put this finding into practice, we develop an efficient computational procedure that helps Bitcoin users accurately estimate fees based on their confirmation delay preferences. We discuss the implications of our analyses on future cryptocurrency development and the long-term adoption of this revolutionary technology.},

With increasing global volatility, companies open and close plants because of demand shifts, cost and reshoring considerations, and government-induced and market forces. Impacts of plant closures on local communities, employees, suppliers, and other stakeholders have been documented, but plant closure processes have not been extensively studied. This paper describes an engaged research study of Toyota Australia&#39;s manufacturing closure processes. We apply psychological contract theory, particularly of contract breach, to examine the “respectful” approach Toyota used to close its assembly operation in Melbourne. We examined the role that stakeholder theory plays in describing managerial motivations. Toyota allocated resources beyond typical expectations to prepare its workforce for their post-Toyota careers and lives. During the 4-year transition process, employee performance, and engagement improved, supporting propositions that reserves of employee goodwill can come into play when a psychological contract breach occurs. Further, leadership actions can moderate the negative impacts predicted by that theory, beyond outcomes that more transactional views would predict. Our study offers an elaborated model of psychological contract breach that future researchers can apply to plant closures and related operational contexts.},

  abstract     = {Achieving societal climate goals requires rapid reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation. Recent efforts by policymakers have focused on increasing consumer adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). Nevertheless, EV sales remain low. Worse, even if EV market share jumped dramatically, it would take decades to replace the existing vehicle fleet, during which time vehicle GHG emissions would continue, worsening climate change. Consequently, some argue for policies to accelerate the retirement of inefficient fossil-powered vehicles through “cash-for-clunkers” (C4C) programs. We examine C4C policies through a behavioral model of vehicle fleet turnover and EV market development in the United States. We find C4C policies can substantially reduce vehicle fleet emissions at reasonable cost per tonne of CO 2 . To meet emissions reductions goals, C4C policies should apply only when consumers replace their fossil-powered vehicles with EVs. C4C policies incentivizing EVs accelerate cost reductions through scale economies, charging infrastructure deployment, model variety, and consumer awareness, boosting EV adoption beyond the direct effect of vehicle replacement. The result is a substantial synergy amplifying the impact of C4C and lowering unit cost of emissions reductions. C4C is further amplified when deployed together with complementary policies promoting renewable electricity production and a gas tax or carbon price.},

  abstract     = {We examine how Amazon&#39;s decision to vertically integrate its retail platform and last-mile delivery operations can lead to anti-competitive outcomes as a result of a deterioration in the operating efficiency in the routes served by a last-mile transportation firm. Based on an operational analysis of the last-mile transportation firm, we find that Amazon&#39;s decision to vertically integrate increases significantly the mileage necessary to deliver parcels in the ZIP code areas where this integration occurs. Moreover, this increase is significantly amplified by the remoteness and proportion of fast deliveries in these areas. These effects translate, on average, into $1.36 in additional costs necessary to cover extra vehicular and labor expenditures per parcel delivered. Because at the root of these outcomes are interactions among multiple organizations with significant market power asymmetries, we expand on a variety of potential anti-competitive service and pricing outcomes stemming from the impact of Amazon&#39;s vertical integration on the last-mile delivery firm&#39;s costs. We then put forth different public policy remedies that could be implemented to address these potential sources of anti-competitiveness in the last-mile delivery industry.},
