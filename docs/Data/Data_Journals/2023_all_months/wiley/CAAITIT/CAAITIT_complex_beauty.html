  abstract     = {The demand for autonomous motion control of unmanned aerial vehicles in air combat is boosted as taking the initiative in combat appears more and more crucial. Unmanned aerial vehicles inability to manoeuvre autonomously during air combat that features highly dynamic and uncertain manoeuvres of the enemy; however, limits their combat capabilities, which proves to be very challenging. To meet the challenge, this article proposes an autonomous manoeuvre decision model using an expert actor-based soft actor critic algorithm that reconstructs empirical replay buffer with expert experience. Specifically, the algorithm uses a small amount of expert experience to increase the diversity of the samples, which can largely improve the exploration and utilisation efficiency of deep reinforcement learning. And to simulate the complex battlefield environment, a one-to-one air combat model is established and the concept of missile&#39;s attack region is introduced. The model enables the one-to-one air combat to be simulated under different initial battlefield situations. Simulation results show that the expert actor-based soft actor critic algorithm can find the most favourable policy for unmanned aerial vehicles to defeat the opponent faster, and converge more quickly, compared with the soft actor critic algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Lateral interaction in the biological brain is a key mechanism that underlies higher cognitive functions. Linear self-organising map (SOM) introduces lateral interaction in a general form in which signals of any modality can be used. Some approaches directly incorporate SOM learning rules into neural networks, but incur complex operations and poor extendibility. The efficient way to implement lateral interaction in deep neural networks is not well established. The use of Laplacian Matrix-based Smoothing (LS) regularisation is proposed for implementing lateral interaction in a concise form. The authors’ derivation and experiments show that lateral interaction implemented by SOM model is a special case of LS-regulated k-means, and they both show the topology-preserving capability. The authors also verify that LS-regularisation can be used in conjunction with the end-to-end training paradigm in deep auto-encoders. Additionally, the benefits of LS-regularisation in relaxing the requirement of parameter initialisation in various models and improving the classification performance of prototype classifiers are evaluated. Furthermore, the topologically ordered structure introduced by LS-regularisation in feature extractor can improve the generalisation performance on classification tasks. Overall, LS-regularisation is an effective and efficient way to implement lateral interaction and can be easily extended to different models.},

However, most audio-visual wake word spotting models are only suitable for simple single-speaker scenarios and require high computational complexity. Further development is hindered by complex multi-person scenarios and computational limitations in mobile environments. In this paper, a novel audio-visual model is proposed for on-device multi-person wake word spotting. Firstly, an attention-based audio-visual voice activity detection module is presented, which generates an attention score matrix of audio and visual representations to derive active speaker representation. Secondly, the knowledge distillation method is introduced to transfer knowledge from the large model to the on-device model to control the size of our model. Moreover, a new audio-visual dataset, PKU-KWS, is collected for sentence-level multi-person wake word spotting. Experimental results on the PKU-KWS dataset show that this approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {As a necessary process of modern drug development, finding a drug compound that can selectively bind to a specific protein is highly challenging and costly. Exploring drug-target interaction strength in terms of drug-target affinity (DTA) is an emerging and effective research approach for drug development. However, it is challenging to model drug-target interactions in a deep learning manner, and few studies provide interpretable analysis of models. This paper proposes a DTA prediction method (mutual transformer-drug target affinity [MT-DTA]) with interactive learning and an autoencoder mechanism. The proposed MT-DTA builds a variational autoencoders system with a cascade structure of the attention model and convolutional neural networks. It not only enhances the ability to capture the characteristic information of a single molecular sequence but also establishes the characteristic expression relationship for each substructure in a single molecular sequence. On this basis, a molecular information interaction module is constructed, which adds information interaction paths between molecular sequence pairs and complements the expression of correlations between molecular substructures. The performance of the proposed model was verified on two public benchmark datasets, KIBA and Davis, and the results confirm that the proposed model structure is effective in predicting DTA. Additionally, attention transformer models with different configurations can improve the feature expression of drug/protein molecules. The model performs better in correctly predicting interaction strengths compared with state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, the diversity of drug/protein molecules can be better expressed than existing methods such as SeqGAN and Co-VAE to generate more effective new drugs. The DTA value prediction module fuses the drug-target pair interaction information to output the predicted value of DTA. Additionally, this paper theoretically proves that the proposed method maximises evidence lower bound for the joint distribution of the DTA prediction model, which enhances the consistency of the probability distribution between actual and predicted values. The source code of proposed method is available at https://github.com/Lamouryz/Code/tree/main/MT-DTA .},

  abstract     = {Tumour segmentation in medical images (especially 3D tumour segmentation) is highly challenging due to the possible similarity between tumours and adjacent tissues, occurrence of multiple tumours and variable tumour shapes and sizes. The popular deep learning-based segmentation algorithms generally rely on the convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer. The former cannot extract the global image features effectively while the latter lacks the inductive bias and involves the complicated computation for 3D volume data. The existing hybrid CNN-Transformer network can only provide the limited performance improvement or even poorer segmentation performance than the pure CNN. To address these issues, a short-term and long-term memory self-attention network is proposed. Firstly, a distinctive self-attention block uses the Transformer to explore the correlation among the region features at different levels extracted by the CNN. Then, the memory structure filters and combines the above information to exclude the similar regions and detect the multiple tumours. Finally, the multi-layer reconstruction blocks will predict the tumour boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other methods in terms of subjective visual and quantitative evaluation. Compared with the most competitive method, the proposed method provides Dice (82.4% vs. 76.6%) and Hausdorff distance 95% (HD95) (10.66 vs. 11.54 mm) on the KiTS19 as well as Dice (80.2% vs. 78.4%) and HD95 (9.632 vs. 12.17 mm) on the LiTS.},

Imperceptibility is the first and foremost requirement of any steganographic approach. Inspired by the fact that human eyes perceive pixel perturbation differently in different video areas, a novel effective and efficient Deeply-Recursive Attention Network (DRANet) for video steganography to find suitable areas for information hiding via modelling spatio-temporal attention is proposed. The DRANet mainly contains two important components, a Non-Local Self-Attention (NLSA) block and a Non-Local Co-Attention (NLCA) block. Specifically, the NLSA block can select the cover frame areas which are suitable for hiding by computing the correlations among inter- and intra-cover frames. The NLCA block aims to effectively produce the enhanced representations of the secret frames to enhance the robustness of the model and alleviate the influence of different areas in the secret video. Furthermore, the DRANet reduces the model parameters by performing similar operations on the different frames within an input video recursively. Experimental results show the proposed DRANet achieves better performance with fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art competitors.},

The existing registration methods based on the dense deformation fields involve too many parameters, which is not conducive to the exploration of correct spatial correspondence between the float and reference images. Meanwhile, the unidirectional registration may involve the deformation folding, which will result in the change of topology during registration. To address these issues, this work has presented an unsupervised image registration method using the free form deformation (FFD) and the symmetry constraint-based generative adversarial networks (FSGAN). The FSGAN utilises the principle component analysis network-based structural representations of the reference and float images as the inputs and uses the generator to learn the FFD model parameters, thereby producing two deformation fields. Meanwhile, the FSGAN uses two discriminators to decide whether the bilateral registration have been realised simultaneously. Besides, the symmetry constraint is utilised to construct the loss function, thereby avoiding the deformation folding. Experiments on BrainWeb, high grade gliomas, IXI and LPBA40 show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, the FSGAN provides superior performance in terms of visual comparisons and such quantitative indexes as dice value, target registration error and computational efficiency.},

Besides, a self-training method that uses unlabelled test data to fully use knowledge from the new subject and further reduce the domain gap is proposed.

However, there are still two challenges. First, most of the real-word system are multiple relations, where entities are linked by different types of relations, and each relation is a view of the graph network. Second, the rich multi-scale information (structure-level and feature-level) of the graph network can be seen as self-supervised signals, which are not fully exploited. A novel co ntrastive self-supervised representation l earning framework on attributed m ultiplex graph networks with m ulti- s cale (named CoLM 2 S ) information is presented in this study. It mainly contains two components: intra-relation contrast learning and inter-relation contrastive learning. Specifically, the co ntrastive self-supervised representation l earning framework on attributed single-layer graph networks with m ulti- s cale information (CoLMS) framework with the graph convolutional network as encoder to capture the intra-relation information with multi-scale structure-level and feature-level self-supervised signals is introduced first. The structure-level information includes the edge structure and sub-graph structure, and the feature-level information represents the output of different graph convolutional layer. Second, according to the consensus assumption among inter-relations, the CoLM 2 S framework is proposed to jointly learn various graph relations in attributed multiplex graph network to achieve global consensus node embedding. The proposed method can fully distil the graph information. Extensive experiments on unsupervised node clustering and graph visualisation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, and it outperforms existing competitive baselines.},

  abstract     = {Inverse tone mapping technique is widely used to restore the lost textures from a single low dynamic range image. Recently, many stack-based deep inverse tone mapping networks have achieved impressive results by estimating a set of multi-exposure images from a single low dynamic range input. However, there are still some limitations. On the one hand, these methods usually set a fixed length for the estimated multi-exposure stack, which may introduce computational redundancy or cause inaccurate results. On the other hand, they neglect that the difficulties of estimating each exposure value are different and use the identical model to increase or decrease exposure value. To solve these problems, the authors design an exposure decision network to adaptively determine the number of times the exposure of low dynamic range input should be increased or decreased. Meanwhile, the authors decouple the increasing/decreasing process into two sub-modules, exposure adjustment and optional detail recovery, based on the characteristics of different variations of exposure values. With these improvements, this method can fast and flexibly estimate the multi-exposure stack from a single low dynamic range image. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art inverse tone mapping methods.},

  abstract     = {In this study, an observation points-based positive-unlabeled learning algorithm (hence called OP-PUL) is proposed to deal with positive-unlabeled learning (PUL) tasks by judiciously assigning highly credible labels to unlabeled samples. The proposed OP-PUL algorithm has three components. First, an observation point classifier ensemble (OPCE) algorithm is constructed to divide unlabeled samples into two categories, which are temporary positive and permanent negative samples. Second, a temporary OPC (TOPC) is trained based on the combination of original positive samples and permanent negative samples and then the permanent positive samples that are correctly classified with TOPC are retained from the temporary positive samples. Third, a permanent OPC (POPC) is finally trained based on the combination of original positive samples, permanent positive samples and permanent negative samples. An exhaustive experimental evaluation is conducted to validate the feasibility, rationality and effectiveness of the OP-PUL algorithm, using 30 benchmark PU data sets. Results show that (1) the OP-PUL algorithm is stable and robust as unlabeled samples and positive samples are increased in unlabeled data sets and (2) the permanent positive samples have a consistent probability distribution with the original positive samples. Moreover, a statistical analysis reveals that POPC in the OP-PUL algorithm can yield better PUL performances on the 30 data sets in comparison with four well-known PUL algorithms. This demonstrates that OP-PUL is a viable algorithm to deal with PUL tasks.},

  abstract     = {A variety of neural networks have been presented to deal with issues in deep learning in the last decades. Despite the prominent success achieved by the neural network, it still lacks theoretical guidance to design an efficient neural network model, and verifying the performance of a model needs excessive resources. Previous research studies have demonstrated that many existing models can be regarded as different numerical discretizations of differential equations. This connection sheds light on designing an effective recurrent neural network (RNN) by resorting to numerical analysis. Simple RNN is regarded as a discretisation of the forward Euler scheme. Considering the limited solution accuracy of the forward Euler methods, a Taylor-type discrete scheme is presented with lower truncation error and a Taylor-type RNN (T-RNN) is designed with its guidance. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate its performance on statistical language models and emotion analysis tasks. The noticeable gains obtained by T-RNN present its superiority and the feasibility of designing the neural network model using numerical methods.},

In addition, the complex underground space is usually connected with other large space areas and densely populated. Once a fire occurs in the complex underground space, it will cause huge property losses and casualties. In order to reduce the risk of fire, it is necessary to deeply understand the development rules and characteristics of fire in the complex underground space of the city. This article has mainly carried on the following work: (I) A particularly complex model of the multi-storey subway station was built. On this basis, three groups of comparative experiments were conducted to study the effects of fire power, fire location and smoke control system on fire development, and the conclusion that fire location is the most important factor for fire development was obtained; (II) In order to explore the entire space fire and the local space fire, CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) is used to build a large-size fire model and a small-size fire model respectively; (III) Multiple detector data as temperature slices were built, and it is expected to make full use of the simulation data to deduce the important index of fire location in the early stage of fire. All of the works in this paper will provide reference experimental data for the prevention and firefighting of a sudden fire in the complex underground space.},

  abstract     = {Sparse representation plays an important role in the research of face recognition. As a deformable sample classification task, face recognition is often used to test the performance of classification algorithms. In face recognition, differences in expression, angle, posture, and lighting conditions have become key factors that affect recognition accuracy. Essentially, there may be significant differences between different image samples of the same face, which makes image classification very difficult. Therefore, how to build a robust virtual image representation becomes a vital issue. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a novel image classification algorithm. First, to better retain the global features and contour information of the original sample, the algorithm uses an improved non-linear image representation method to highlight the low-intensity and high-intensity pixels of the original training sample, thus generating a virtual sample. Second, by the principle of sparse representation, the linear expression coefficients of the original sample and the virtual sample can be calculated, respectively. After obtaining these two types of coefficients, calculate the distances between the original sample and the test sample and the distance between the virtual sample and the test sample. These two distances are converted into distance scores. Finally, a simple and effective weight fusion scheme is adopted to fuse the classification scores of the original image and the virtual image. The fused score will determine the final classification result. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other typical sparse representation classification methods.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the improvement in AI is mainly related to deep learning techniques that are employed for the classification, identification, and quantification of patterns in clinical images. The deep learning models show more remarkable performance than the traditional methods for medical image processing tasks, such as skin cancer, colorectal cancer, brain tumour, cardiac disease, Breast cancer (BrC), and a few more. The manual diagnosis of medical issues always requires an expert and is also expensive. Therefore, developing some computer diagnosis techniques based on deep learning is essential. Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in females with a rapidly growing percentage. It is estimated that patients with BrC will rise to 70% in the next 20 years. If diagnosed at a later stage, the survival rate of patients with BrC is shallow. Hence, early detection is essential, increasing the survival rate to 50%. A new framework for BrC classification is presented that utilises deep learning and feature optimization. The significant steps of the presented framework include (i) hybrid contrast enhancement of acquired images, (ii) data augmentation to facilitate better learning of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, (iii) a pre-trained ResNet-101 model is utilised and modified according to selected dataset classes, (iv) deep transfer learning based model training for feature extraction, (v) the fusion of features using the proposed highly corrected function-controlled canonical correlation analysis approach, and (vi) optimal feature selection using the modified Satin Bowerbird Optimization controlled Newton Raphson algorithm that finally classified using 10 machine learning classifiers. The experiments of the proposed framework have been carried out using the most critical and publicly available dataset, such as CBIS-DDSM, and obtained the best accuracy of 94.5% along with improved computation time. The comparison depicts that the presented method surpasses the current state-of-the-art approaches.},

In the current industrial environment, mobile robot collaboration scenario, the noise of mobile robots could be easily found by on-board audio-sensing processors and the direction of sound sources can be effectively acquired by sound source estimation algorithms, but the distance estimation of sound sources is difficult. However, in the field of visual perception, the 3D structure information of the scene is relatively easy to obtain, but the recognition and segmentation of moving objects is more difficult. To address these problems, a novel vision-audio fusion method that combines sound source localisation methods with a visual SLAM scheme is proposed, thereby eliminating the effect of dynamic obstacles on multi-agent systems.

To solve this issue, some deep learning methods are proposed to forecast future radar echo images and convert them into rainfall distributions. Prevailing spatiotemporal sequence prediction methods are usually based on a ConvRNN structure that combines a Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network. However, these existing methods ignore the image change prediction, which causes the coherence of the predicted image has deteriorated. Moreover, these approaches mainly focus on complicating model structure to exploit more historical spatiotemporal representations. Nevertheless, they ignore introducing other valuable information to improve predictions. To tackle these two issues, we propose GCMT-ConvRNN, a multi-ask framework of ConvRNN. Except for precipitation nowcasting as the main task, it combines the motion field estimation and sub-regression as auxiliary tasks. In this framework, the motion field estimation task can provide motion information, and the sub-regression task offers future information. Besides, to reduce the negative transfer between the auxiliary tasks and the main task, we propose a new loss function based on the correlation of gradients in different tasks. The experiments show that all models applied in our framework achieve stable and effective improvement.},

  abstract     = {Green Infrastructure (GI) has garnered increasing attention from various regions due to its potential to mitigate urban heat island (UHI), which has been exacerbated by global climate change. This study focuses on the central area of Fuzhou city, one of the “furnace” cities, and aims to explore the correlation between the GI pattern and land surface temperature (LST) in the spring and autumn seasons. The research adopts a multiscale approach, starting from the urban scale and using urban geographic spatial characteristics, multispectral remote sensing data, and morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA). Significant MSPA elements were tested and combined with LST to conduct a geographic weighted regression (GWR) experiment. The findings reveal that the UHI in the central area of Fuzhou city has a spatial characteristic of “high temperature in the middle and low temperature around,” which is coupled with a “central scattered and peripheral concentrated” distribution of GI. This suggests that remote sensing data can effectively be utilised for UHI inversion. Additionally, the study finds that the complexity of GI, whether from the perspective of the overall GI pattern or the classification study based on the proportion of the core area, has an impact on the alleviation of UHI in both seasons. In conclusion, this study underscores the importance of a reasonable layout of urban green infrastructure for mitigating UHI.},

Existing few-shot learning (FSL) methods generally ignore the potential relationships between non-local spatial samples that would better represent the underlying features of HSI. To solve the above issues, a novel deep transformer and few-shot learning (DT-FSL) classification framework is proposed, attempting to realize fine-grained classification of HSI with only a few-shot instances. Specifically, the spatial attention and spectral query modules are introduced to overcome the constraint of the convolution kernel and consider the information between long-distance location (non-local) samples to reduce the uncertainty of classes. Next, the network is trained with episodes and task-based learning strategies to learn a metric space, which can continuously enhance its modelling capability. Furthermore, the developed approach combines the advantages of domain adaptation to reduce the variation in inter-domain distribution and realize distribution alignment. On three publicly available HSI data, extensive experiments have indicated that the proposed DT-FSL yields better results concerning state-of-the-art algorithms.},

In the proposed S3FFT method, spatial attention and efficient channel attention (ECA) modules are employed for the extraction of shallow spatial-spectral features.

  abstract     = {In the past, convolutional neural network (CNN) has become one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, and has been widely used in Hyperspectral image classification tasks. Convolution (Conv) in CNN uses filter weights to extract features in local receiving domain, and the weight parameters are shared globally, which more focus on the high-frequency information of the image. Different from Conv, Transformer can obtain the long-term dependence between long-distance features through modelling, and adaptively focus on different regions. In addition, Transformer is considered as a low-pass filter, which more focuses on the low-frequency information of the image. Considering the complementary characteristics of Conv and Transformer, the two modes can be integrated for full feature extraction. In addition, the most important image features correspond to the discrimination region, while the secondary image features represent important but easily ignored regions, which are also conducive to the classification of HSIs. In this study, a complementary integrated Transformer network (CITNet) for hyperspectral image classification is proposed. Firstly, three-dimensional convolution (Conv3D) and two-dimensional convolution (Conv2D) are utilised to extract the shallow semantic information of the image. In order to enhance the secondary features, a channel Gaussian modulation attention module is proposed, which is embedded between Conv3D and Conv2D. This module can not only enhance secondary features, but suppress the most important and least important features. Then, considering the different and complementary characteristics of Conv and Transformer, a complementary integrated Transformer module is designed. Finally, through a large number of experiments, this study evaluates the classification performance of CITNet and several state-of-the-art networks on five common datasets. The experimental results show that compared with these classification networks, CITNet can provide better classification performance.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the autoencoder (AE) based method plays a critical role in the hyperspectral anomaly detection domain. However, due to the strong generalised capacity of AE, the abnormal samples are usually reconstructed well along with the normal background samples. Thus, in order to separate anomalies from the background by calculating reconstruction errors, it can be greatly beneficial to reduce the AE capability for abnormal sample reconstruction while maintaining the background reconstruction performance. A memory-augmented autoencoder for hyperspectral anomaly detection (MAENet) is proposed to address this challenging problem. Specifically, the proposed MAENet mainly consists of an encoder, a memory module, and a decoder. First, the encoder transforms the original hyperspectral data into the low-dimensional latent representation. Then, the latent representation is utilised to retrieve the most relevant matrix items in the memory matrix, and the retrieved matrix items will be used to replace the latent representation from the encoder. Finally, the decoder is used to reconstruct the input hyperspectral data using the retrieved memory items. With this strategy, the background can still be reconstructed well while the abnormal samples cannot. Experiments conducted on five real hyperspectral anomaly data sets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Most unsupervised or semisupervised hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) methods train background reconstruction models in the original spectral domain. However, due to the noise and spatial resolution limitations, there may be a lack of discrimination between backgrounds and anomalies. This makes it easy for the autoencoder to capture the low-level features shared between the two, thereby increasing the difficulty of separating anomalies from the backgrounds, which runs counter to the purpose of HAD. To this end, the authors map the original spectrums to the fractional Fourier domain (FrFD) and reformulate it as a mapping task in which restoration errors are employed to distinguish background and anomaly. This study proposes a novel frequency-to-spectrum mapping generative adversarial network for HAD. Specifically, the depth separable features of backgrounds and anomalies are enhanced in the FrFD. Due to the semisupervised approach, FTSGAN needs to learn the embedded features of the backgrounds, thus mapping and restoring them from the FrFD to the original spectral domain. This strategy effectively prevents the model from focussing on the numerical equivalence of input and output, and restricts the ability of FTSGAN to restore anomalies. The comparison and analysis of the experiments verify that the proposed method is competitive.},

  abstract     = {Recently, ground coverings change detection (CD) driven by bitemporal hyperspectral images (HSIs) has become a hot topic in the remote sensing community. There are two challenges in the HSI-CD task: (1) attribute feature representation of pixel pairs and (2) feature extraction of attribute patterns of pixel pairs. To solve the above problems, a novel spectral-spatial sequence characteristics-based convolutional transformer (S3C-CT) method is proposed for the HSI-CD task. In the designed method, firstly, an eigenvalue extrema-based band selection strategy is introduced to pick up spectral information with salient attribute patterns. Then, a 3D tensor with spectral-spatial sequence characteristics is proposed to represent the attribute features of pixel pairs in the bitemporal HSIs. Next, a fusion framework of the convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer encoder (TE) is designed to extract high-order sequence semantic features, taking into account both local context information and global sequence dependencies. Specifically, a spatial-spectral attention mechanism is employed to prevent information reduction and enhance dimensional interactivity between the CNN and TE. Finally, the binary change map is determined according to the fully-connected layer. Experimental results on real HSI datasets indicated that the proposed S3C-CT method outperforms other well-known and state-of-the-art detection approaches in terms of detection performance.},

  abstract     = {This study focuses on developing deep learning methods for small and dim target detection. We model infrared images as the union of the target region and background region. Based on this model, the target detection problem is considered a two-class segmentation problem that divides an image into the target and background. Therefore, a neural network called SDDNet for single-frame images is constructed. The network yields target extraction results according to the original images. For multiframe images, a network called IC-SDDNet, a combination of SDDNet and an interframe correlation network module is constructed. SDDNet and IC-SDDNet achieve target detection rates close to 1 on typical datasets with very low false positives, thereby performing significantly better than current methods. Both models can be executed end to end, so both are very convenient to use, and their implementation efficiency is very high. Average speeds of 540+/230+ FPS and 170+/60+ FPS are achieved with SDDNet and IC-SDDNet on a single Tesla V100 graphics processing unit and a single Jetson TX2 embedded module respectively. Additionally, neither network needs to use future information, so both networks can be directly used in real-time systems.

  abstract     = {Arbitrary-oriented object detection is widely used in aerial image applications because of its efficient object representation. However, the use of oriented bounding box aggravates the imbalance between positive and negative samples when using one-stage object detectors, which seriously decreases the detection accuracy. We believe that it is the anchor learning strategy (ALS) used by such detectors that needs to take the responsibility. In this study, three perspectives on ALS design were summarised and ALS—Performance Releaser with Smart Anchor Learning (PRSAL) was proposed. Performance Releaser with Smart Anchor Learning is a dynamic ALS that utilises anchor classification ability as an equivalent indicator to anchor box regression ability, this allows anchors with high detection potential to be filtered out in a more reasonable way. At the same time, PRSAL focuses more on anchor potential and it is able to automatically select a number of positive samples that far exceed that of other methods by activating anchors that previously had a low spatial overlap, thereby releasing the detection performance. We validate the PRSAL using three remote sensing datasets—HRSC2016, DOTA and UCAS-AOD as well as one scene text dataset—ICDAR 2013. The experimental results show that the proposed method gives substantially better results than existing models.},

Some studies propose to train the model with the ranking-based metric (e.g., average precision [AP]), because AP is robust to class imbalance. However, current AP-based methods overlook an important issue: only optimising samples ranking before each positive sample, which is limited by the definition of AP and is prone to local optimum. To achieve global optimisation of AP, a novel method, namely Optimising Samples after positive ones &amp; AP loss (OSAP-Loss) is proposed in this study. Specifically, a novel superior ranking function is designed to make the AP loss differentiable while providing a tighter upper bound. Then, a novel loss called Optimising Samples after Positive ones (OSP) loss is proposed to involve all positive and negative samples ranking after each positive one and to provide a more flexible optimisation strategy for each sample. Finally, a graphics processing unit memory-free mechanism is developed to thoroughly address the non-decomposability of AP optimisation. Extensive experimental results on RSIR as well as conventional image retrieval datasets show the superiority and competitive performance of OSAP-Loss compared to the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Aerial scene recognition (ASR) has attracted great attention due to its increasingly essential applications. Most of the ASR methods adopt the multi-scale architecture because both global and local features play great roles in ASR. However, the existing multi-scale methods neglect the effective interactions among different scales and various spatial locations when fusing global and local features, leading to a limited ability to deal with challenges of large-scale variation and complex background in aerial scene images. In addition, existing methods may suffer from poor generalisations due to millions of to-be-learnt parameters and inconsistent predictions between global and local features. To tackle these problems, this study proposes a scale-wise interaction fusion and knowledge distillation (SIF-KD) network for learning robust and discriminative features with scale-invariance and background-independent information. The main highlights of this study include two aspects. On the one hand, a global-local features collaborative learning scheme is devised for extracting scale-invariance features so as to tackle the large-scale variation problem in aerial scene images. Specifically, a plug-and-play multi-scale context attention fusion module is proposed for collaboratively fusing the context information between global and local features. On the other hand, a scale-wise knowledge distillation scheme is proposed to produce more consistent predictions by distilling the predictive distribution between different scales during training. Comprehensive experimental results show the proposed SIF-KD network achieves the best overall accuracy with 99.68%, 98.74% and 95.47% on the UCM, AID and NWPU-RESISC45 datasets, respectively, compared with state of the arts.},

  abstract     = {With the arrival of new data acquisition platforms derived from the Internet of Things (IoT), this paper goes beyond the understanding of traditional remote sensing technologies. Deep fusion of remote sensing and computer vision has hit the industrial world and makes it possible to apply Artificial intelligence to solve problems such as automatic extraction of information and image interpretation. However, due to the complex architecture of IoT and the lack of a unified security protection mechanism, devices in remote sensing are vulnerable to privacy leaks when sharing data. It is necessary to design a security scheme suitable for computation-limited devices in IoT, since traditional encryption methods are based on computational complexity. Visual Cryptography (VC) is a threshold scheme for images that can be decoded directly by the human visual system when superimposing encrypted images. The stacking-to-see feature and simple Boolean decryption operation make VC an ideal solution for privacy-preserving recognition for large-scale remote sensing images in IoT. In this study, the secure and efficient transmission of high-resolution remote sensing images by meaningful VC is achieved. By diffusing the error between the encryption block and the original block to adjacent blocks, the degradation of quality in recovery images is mitigated. By fine-tuning the pre-trained model from large-scale datasets, we improve the recognition performance of small encryption datasets for remote sensing images. The experimental results show that the proposed lightweight privacy-preserving recognition framework maintains high recognition performance while enhancing security.},

  abstract     = {There are an increasing number of Narrow Band IoT devices being manufactured as the technology behind them develops quickly. The high co-channel interference and signal attenuation seen in edge Narrow Band IoT devices make it challenging to guarantee the service quality of these devices. To maximise the data rate fairness of Narrow Band IoT devices, a multi-dimensional indoor localisation model is devised, consisting of transmission power, data scheduling, and time slot scheduling, based on a network model that employs non-orthogonal multiple access via a relay. Based on this network model, the optimisation goal of Narrow Band IoT device data rate ratio fairness is first established by the authors, while taking into account the Narrow Band IoT network: The multi-dimensional indoor localisation optimisation model of equipment tends to minimize data rate, energy constraints and EH relay energy and data buffer constraints, data scheduling and time slot scheduling. As a result, each Narrow Band IoT device&#39;s data rate needs are met while the network&#39;s overall performance is optimised. We investigate the model&#39;s potential for convex optimisation and offer an algorithm for optimising the distribution of multiple resources using the KKT criterion. The current work primarily considers the NOMA Narrow Band IoT network under a single EH relay. However, the growth of Narrow Band IoT devices also leads to a rise in co-channel interference, which impacts NOMA&#39;s performance enhancement. Through simulation, the proposed approach is successfully shown. These improvements have boosted the network&#39;s energy efficiency by 44.1%, data rate proportional fairness by 11.9%, and spectrum efficiency by 55.4%.},

Moreover, a more practical and challenging scenario with the erroneous position of AM is considered, which brings additional uncertainty to the final position estimation. Therefore, the AMs selection algorithm for the localisation of BMs in the IIoT network is introduced. Only those AMs will participate in the localisation process, which increases the accuracy of the final location estimate. Then, the closed-form expression of the proposed greedy successive anchorization process is derived, which prevents possible local convergence, reduces computation, and achieves Cramér-Rao lower bound accuracy for white Gaussian measurement noise.

  abstract     = {In the event of a fire breaking out or in other complicated situations, a mobile computing solution combining the Internet of Things and wearable devices can actually assist tracking solutions for rescuing and evacuating people in multistory structures. Thus, it is crucial to increase the positioning technology&#39;s accuracy. The sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approach is used in various applications such as target tracking and intelligent surveillance, which rely on smartphone-based inertial data sequences. However, the SMC method has intrinsic flaws, such as sample impoverishment and particle degeneracy. A novel SMC approach is presented, which is built on the weighted differential evolution (WDE) algorithm. Sequential Monte Carlo approaches start with random particle placements and arrives at the desired distribution with a slower variance reduction, like in a high-dimensional space, such as a multistory structure. Weighted differential evolution is included before the resampling procedure to guarantee the appropriate variety of the particle set, prevent the usage of an inadequate number of valid samples, and preserve smartphone user position accuracy. The values of the smartphone-based sensors and BLE-beacons are set as input to the SMC, which aids in fast approximating the posterior distributions, to speed up the particle congregation process in the proposed SMC-based WDE approach. Lastly, the robustness and efficacy of the suggested technique more accurately reflect the actual situation of smartphone users. According to simulation findings, the suggested approach provides improved location estimation with reduced localization error and quick convergence. The results confirm that the proposed optimal fusion-based SMC-WDE scheme performs 9.92% better in terms of MAPE, 15.24% for the case of MAE, and 0.031% when evaluating based on the R2 Score.},

  abstract     = {Evaluation of calligraphic copy is the core of Chinese calligraphy appreciation and inheritance. However, previous aesthetic evaluation studies often focussed on photos and paintings, with few attempts on Chinese calligraphy. To solve this problem, a Siamese regression aesthetic fusion method is proposed, named SRAFE, for Chinese calligraphy based on the combination of calligraphy aesthetics and deep learning. First, a dataset termed Evaluated Chinese Calligraphy Copies (E3C) is constructed for aesthetic evaluation. Second, 12 hand-crafted aesthetic features based on the shape, structure, and stroke of calligraphy are designed. Then, the Siamese regression network (SRN) is designed to extract the deep aesthetic representation of calligraphy. Finally, the SRAFE method is built by fusing the deep aesthetic features with the hand-crafted aesthetic features. Experimental results show that scores given by SRAFE are similar to the aesthetic evaluation label of E3C, proving the effectiveness of the authors’ method.},

  abstract     = {Design change is an inevitable part of the product development process. This study proposes an improved binary multi-objective PSO algorithm guided by problem characteristics (P-BMOPSO) to solve the optimisation problem of complex product change plan considering service performance. Firstly, a complex product multi-layer network with service performance is established for the first time to reveal the impact of change effect propagation on the product service performance. Secondly, the concept of service performance impact (SPI) is defined by decoupling the impact of strongly associated nodes on the service performance in the process of change affect propagation. Then, a triple-objective selection model of change nodes is established, which includes the three indicators: SPI degree, change cost, and change time. Furthermore, an integer multi-objective particle swarm optimisation algorithm guided by problem characteristics is developed to solve the model above. Experimental results on the design change problem of a certain type of Skyworth TV verify the effectiveness of the established optimisation model and the proposed P-BMOPSO algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Target tracking has a wide range of applications in intelligent transportation, real-time monitoring, human-computer interaction and other aspects. However, in the tracking process, the target is prone to deformation, occlusion, loss, scale variation, background clutter, illumination variation, etc., which bring great challenges to realize accurate and real-time tracking. Tracking based on Siamese networks promotes the application of deep learning in the field of target tracking, ensuring both accuracy and real-time performance. However, due to its offline training, it is difficult to deal with the fast motion, serious occlusion, loss and deformation of the target during tracking. Therefore, it is very helpful to improve the performance of the Siamese networks by learning new features of the target quickly and updating the target position in time online. The broad learning system (BLS) has a simple network structure, high learning efficiency, and strong feature learning ability. Aiming at the problems of Siamese networks and the characteristics of BLS, a target tracking method based on BLS is proposed. The method combines offline training with fast online learning of new features, which not only adopts the powerful feature representation ability of deep learning, but also skillfully uses the BLS for re-learning and re-detection. The broad re-learning information is used for re-detection when the target tracking appears serious occlusion and so on, so as to change the selection of the Siamese networks search area, solve the problem that the search range cannot meet the fast motion of the target, and improve the adaptability. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves good results on three challenging datasets and improves the performance of the basic algorithm in difficult scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Accurately identifying defect patterns in wafer maps can help engineers find abnormal failure factors in production lines. During the wafer testing stage, deep learning methods are widely used in wafer defect detection due to their powerful feature extraction capabilities. However, most of the current wafer defect patterns classification models have high complexity and slow detection speed, which are difficult to apply in the actual wafer production process. In addition, there is a data imbalance in the wafer dataset that seriously affects the training results of the model. To reduce the complexity of the deep model without affecting the wafer feature expression, this paper adjusts the structure of the dense block in the PeleeNet network and proposes a lightweight network WM-PeleeNet based on the PeleeNet module. In addition, to reduce the impact of data imbalance on model training, this paper proposes a wafer data augmentation method based on a convolutional autoencoder by adding random Gaussian noise to the hidden layer. The method proposed in this paper has an average accuracy of 95.4% on the WM-811K wafer dataset with only 173.643 KB of the parameters and 316.194 M of FLOPs, and takes only 22.99 s to detect 1000 wafer pictures. Compared with the original PeleeNet network without optimization, the number of parameters and FLOPs are reduced by 92.68% and 58.85%, respectively. Data augmentation on the minority class wafer map improves the average classification accuracy by 1.8% on the WM-811K dataset. At the same time, the recognition accuracy of minority classes such as Scratch pattern and Donut pattern are significantly improved.},

Firstly, the Gaussian noise with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) is added to the data to simulate the different degrees of noise in the actual data acquisition process. The MKPCA is used to project the fault signal with different SNRs in the kernel space to reduce the data dimension and eliminate some noise effects. Finally, the DC-ResNet model is used to further filter the noise effects and fully extract the fault features through the training of the preprocessed data. The proposed algorithm is tested on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and Xi&#39;an Jiaotong University and Changxing Sumyoung Technology Co., Ltd. (XJTU-SY) bearing data sets with different SNR noise. The fault diagnosis accuracy can reach 100% within 30 min, which has better performance than most of the existing methods.

  abstract     = {The forward kinematics of parallel robots is a challenging issue due to its highly coupled non-linear relation among branch chains. This paper presents a novel approach to forward kinematics of parallel robots based on kernel extreme learning machine (KELM). To tackle with the forward kinematics solution of fully parallel robots, the forward kinematics solution of parallel robots is equivalently transformed into a machine learning model first. On this basis, a computational model combining sparrow search algorithm and KELM is then established, which can serve as both regression and classification. Based on SSA-optimised KELM (SSA-KELM) established in this study, a binary discriminator for judging the existence of the forward kinematics solution and a multi-label regression model for predicting the forward kinematics solution are built to obtain the forward kinematics general solution of parallel robots with different structural configurations and parameters. To evaluate the proposed model, a numerical case on this dataset collected by the inverse kinematics model of a typical 6-DOF parallel robot is conducted, followed by the results manifesting that the binary discriminator with the discriminant accuracy of 88.50% is superior over ELM, KELM, support vector machine and logistic regression. The multi-label regression model, with the root mean squared error of 0.06 mm for the position and 0.15° for the orientation, outperforms the double-hidden-layer back propagation (2-BP), ELM, KELM and genetic algorithm-optimised KELM. Furthermore, numerical cases of parallel robots with different structural configurations and parameters are compared with state-of-the-art models. Moreover, these results of numerical simulation and experiment on the host computer demonstrate that the proposed model displays its high precision, high robustness and rapid convergence, which provides a candidate for the forward kinematics of parallel robots.},

Simulating the function from physiological structure of ‘deep fovea’ and ‘shallow fovea’ of hawk eye, the higher resolution reconstruction method in this paper was aimed at accuracy improving. Inspired by adjustment of pupils, the adaptive HDR method was proposed for high dynamic range optimisation and stable perception. In various light conditions, compared with default stereo vision, the accuracy of proposed algorithm was improved by 28.0% evaluated by error ratio, and the stability was improved by 26.56% by disparity accuracy. For fixed distance measurement, the maximum improvement was 78.6% by standard deviation.

A novel multi-scale CNN-LSTM neural network (MSCNN-LSTMNet) is proposed with a residual-CNN denoising module for anti-noise diesel engine misfire diagnosis. First, a residual-CNN module is designed for denoising the original vibration signal measured from the diesel engine cylinder and residual loss for constructing a new loss function is utilised. Considering the essential characteristics of measured vibration signals at different scales, a multi-scale convolutional NN (CNN) block is designed to realize multi-scale feature extraction. Specifically, multiple convolution layers with different branches and different convolution kernel sizes are utilised to extract different time scales features, enhancing the robustness of the model. On this basis, the LSTM is utilised to further extract sequential features for improving anti-noise and generalisation performances. The effectiveness of MSCNN-LSTMNet is validated by experimental results of both one- and hybrid-cylinder diesel engine misfires diagnosis under various noise levels and working conditions. The results demonstrate that MSCNN-LSTMNet achieved much better anti-noise and generalisation performances than the existing methods. Under strong noise conditions (−10 dB signal-to-noise ratio) for four datasets, MSCNN-LSTMNet obtained 97.561% average accuracy, while average accuracy for random forest, deep neural network, CNN and MSCNNNet were 73.828%, 79.544%, 82.247%, and 89.741%, respectively. Moreover, for 11 noise generalisation tasks between different noise levels, MSCNN-LSTMNet obtained at least 96.679%, 97.849%, 98.892%, and 94.010% accuracy on the four datasets, which are much higher than those of the existing methods.},

This paper proposes a Legendre multiwavelet-based neural network model for non-linear wind speed prediction. It combines the excellent properties of Legendre multi-wavelets with the self-learning capability of neural networks, which has rigorous mathematical theory support. It learns input-output data pairs and shares weights within divided subintervals, which can greatly reduce computing costs. We explore the effectiveness of Legendre multi-wavelets as an activation function. Meanwhile, it is successfully being applied to wind speed prediction. In addition, the application of Legendre multi-wavelet neural networks in a hybrid model in decomposition-reconstruction mode to wind speed prediction problems is also discussed. Numerical results on real data sets show that the proposed model is able to achieve optimal performance and high prediction accuracy. In particular, the model shows a more stable performance in multi-step prediction, illustrating its superiority.},

In the second stage, we directly realised the precise positioning of each segment in the lumbar spine space region based on the non-linear regression method, thus effectively eliminating the interference caused by the adjacent spine. The 3D Intersection over Union (3D_IOU) is used as the main evaluation indicator for the positioning accuracy. On an open dataset, 3D_IOU values of 0.8339 ± 0.0990 and 0.8559 ± 0.0332 in the first and second stages, respectively is achieved. In addition, the average time required for the proposed method in the two stages is 0.3274 and 0.2105 s respectively.

The boom of Web services increases software developers&#39; selection burden in developing new service-based systems such as mashups. Timely recommending appropriate component services for developers to build new mashups has become a fundamental problem in service-oriented software engineering. Existing service recommendation approaches are mainly designed for mashup development in the single-round scenario. It is hard for them to effectively update recommendation results according to developers&#39; requirements and behaviours (e.g. instant service selection). To address this issue, the authors propose a service bundle recommendation framework based on deep learning, DLISR, which aims to capture the interactions among the target mashup to build, selected (component) services, and the following service to recommend. Moreover, an attention mechanism is employed in DLISR to weigh selected services when recommending a candidate service. The authors also design two separate models for learning interactions from the perspectives of content and invocation history, respectively, and a hybrid model called HISR. Experiments on a real-world dataset indicate that HISR can outperform several state-of-the-art service recommendation methods to develop new mashups iteratively.},

  abstract     = {Influence maximization, whose aim is to maximise the expected number of influenced nodes by selecting a seed set of k influential nodes from a social network, has many applications such as goods advertising and rumour suppression. Among the existing influence maximization methods, the community-based ones can achieve a good balance between effectiveness and efficiency. However, this kind of algorithm usually utilise the network community structures by viewing each node as a non-overlapping node. In fact, many nodes in social networks are overlapping ones, which play more important role in influence spreading. To this end, an overlapping community-based particle swarm optimization algorithm named OCPSO for influence maximization in social networks, which can make full use of overlapping nodes, non-overlapping nodes, and their interactive information is proposed. Specifically, an overlapping community detection algorithm is used to obtain the information of overlapping community structures, based on which three novel evolutionary strategies, such as initialisation, mutation, and local search are designed in OCPSO for better finding influential nodes. Experimental results in terms of influence spread and running time on nine real-world social networks demonstrate that the proposed OCPSO is competitive and promising comparing to several state-of-the-arts (e.g. CGA, CMA-IM, CIM, CDH-SHRINK, CNCG, and CFIN).},

  abstract     = {The laws and regulations in human history can be revealed by computational models. From 221 before Christ (BC) to 1912 Anno Domini (AD), the unification pattern has dominated the main part of Chinese history for 2132 years. Before the emergence of the first unified empire, the Qin Empire in 221 BC, there existed the Eastern Zhou dynasty (770 BC to 221 BC). This long dynasty has two stages, and here we focus on the first stage. This Spring–Autumn stage was from 770 BC (with 148 states) to 476 BC (with 32 states). The whole country (China) is modelled as a multi-agent system, which contains multiple local states. They behave autonomously under certain action rules (wars and conflicts), which forms the main reason for the annexations and disappearance of most states. Key factors (power, loyalty, bellicosity and alliance) have been considered in our model settings, and simulation outcomes will be monitored and collected. Eventually, an optimal solution is obtained, which well unveils the internal mechanism and statistical features of real big history. Furthermore, counterfactuals are used to explore the non-linear effects of the key factors, which deepens the authors’ understanding of civilisation evolutions in human history.},

  abstract     = {Some types of software systems, like event-based and non-deterministic ones, are usually specified as rules so that we can analyse the system behaviour by drawing inferences from firing the rules. However, when the fuzzy rules are used for the specification of non-deterministic behaviour and they contain a large number of variables, they constitute a complex form that is difficult to understand and infer. A solution is to visualise the system specification with the capability of automatic rule inference. In this study, by representing a high-level system specification, the authors visualise rule representation and firing using fuzzy coloured Petri-nets . Already, several fuzzy Petri-nets-based methods have been presented, but they either do not support a large number of rules and variables or do not consider significant cases like (a) the weight of the premise&#39;s propositions in the occurrence of the rule conclusion, (b) the weight of conclusion&#39;s proposition, (c) threshold values for premise and conclusion&#39;s propositions of the rule, and (d) the certainty factor (CF) for the rule or the conclusion&#39;s proposition. By considering cases (a)–(d), a wider variety of fuzzy rules are supported. The authors applied their model to the analysis of attacks against a part of a real secure water treatment system. In another real experiment, the authors applied the model to the two scenarios from their previous work and analysed the results.},

However, this is still challenging due to two issues: Both the hyperparameter and architecture should be optimised and the optimisation process is computationally expensive. To tackle these two issues, this paper focusses on solving the hyperparameter and architecture optimization problem for the NN and proposes a novel light-weight scale-adaptive fitness evaluation-based particle swarm optimisation (SAFE-PSO) approach. Firstly, the SAFE-PSO algorithm considers the hyperparameters and architectures together in the optimisation problem and therefore can find their optimal combination for the globally best NN. Secondly, the computational cost can be reduced by using multi-scale accuracy evaluation methods to evaluate candidates. Thirdly, a stagnation-based switch strategy is proposed to adaptively switch different evaluation methods to better balance the search performance and computational cost. The SAFE-PSO algorithm is tested on two widely used datasets: The 10-category (i.e., CIFAR10) and the 100−category (i.e., CIFAR100). The experimental results show that SAFE-PSO is very effective and efficient, which can not only find a promising NN automatically but also find a better NN than compared algorithms at the same computational cost.},

The application of pathological images for artificial intelligence-assisted accurate prediction of tumour outcomes is increasing. Thus, the present study constructed a quantitative histological image classifier with tumour nuclear features to predict osteosarcoma outcomes using haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) from 150 osteosarcoma patients. We first segmented eight distinct tissues in osteosarcoma H&amp;E-stained WSIs, with an average accuracy of 90.63% on the testing set. The tumour areas were automatically and accurately acquired, facilitating the tumour cell nuclear feature extraction process. Based on six selected tumour nuclear features, we developed an osteosarcoma histological image classifier (OSHIC) to predict the recurrence and survival of osteosarcoma following standard treatment. The quantitative OSHIC derived from tumour nuclear features independently predicted the recurrence and survival of osteosarcoma patients, thereby contributing to precision oncology. Moreover, we developed a fully automated workflow to extract quantitative image features, evaluate the diagnostic values of feature sets and build classifiers to predict osteosarcoma outcomes. Thus, the present study provides a novel tool for predicting osteosarcoma outcomes, which has a broad application prospect in clinical practice.},

In this study, we introduce a h ierarchical s emantic- e motional m emory module for e motional c onversation generation (called HSEMEC), which can learn abstract semantic conversation patterns and emotional information from the large training corpus.

The direction-of-arrival (DOA) of a sound source is convenient to render spatial sound in the audio metaverse. A multisource localization method in a reverberation environment is proposed based on the angle distribution of time–frequency (TF) points using a first-order ambisonics (FOA) microphone. The method is implemented in three steps. 1) By exploring the angle distribution of TF points, a single-source zone (SSZ) detection method is proposed by using a standard deviation-based measure, which reveals the degree of convergence of TF point angles in a zone. 2) To reduce the effect of outliers on localization, an outlier removal method is designed to remove the TF points whose angles are far from the real DOAs, where the median angle of each detected zone is adopted to construct the outlier set. 3) DOA estimates of multiple sources are obtained by postprocessing of the angle histogram. Experimental results in both the simulated and real scenarios verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in a reverberation environment, which also show that the proposed method outperforms reference methods.},

In order to make up these disadvantages, a multi-domain attention pointer (MDA-Pointer) abstractive summarisation model is proposed in this work. First, the model uses bidirectional long short-term memory to encode, respectively, the word and sentence sequence of source document for obtaining the semantic representations at word and sentence level. Furthermore, the multi-domain attention mechanism between the semantic representations and the summary word is established, and the proposed model can generate summary words under the proposed attention mechanism based on the words and sentences. Then, the words are extracted from the vocabulary or the original word sequences through the pointer network to form the summary, and the coverage mechanism is introduced, respectively, into word and sentence level to reduce the redundancy of summary content. Finally, experiment validation is conducted on CNN/Daily Mail dataset. ROUGE evaluation indexes of the model without and with the coverage mechanism are improved respectively, and the results verify the validation of model proposed by this paper.},

This model uses competitive learning rules and dynamic neurons with information saturation to achieve parameter adjustment and adaptive structure development. Dynamic neurons adjust the information saturation after winning the competition and use this parameter to modulate the neuron parameter adjustment and the division timing. By dividing to generate new neurons, the network not only keeps sensitive to novel features but also can subdivide classes learnt repeatedly. The dynamic neurons with information saturation and division mechanism can simulate the long short-term memory of the human brain, which enables the network to continually learn new samples while maintaining the previous learning results. The parent-child relationship between neurons arising from neuronal division enables the network to simulate the human cognitive process that gradually refines the perception of objects. By setting the clustering layer parameter, users can choose the desired degree of class subdivision. Experimental results on artificial and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model is feasible for unsupervised learning tasks in instance increment and class increment scenarios and outperforms prior structural developmental neural networks.},

  abstract     = {Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) is a supplementary task of single-modality re-identification, which makes up for the defect of conventional re-identification under insufficient illumination. It is more challenging than single-modality ReID because, in addition to difficulties in pedestrian posture, camera shooting angle and background change, there are also difficulties in the cross-modality gap. Existing works only involve coarse-grained global features in the re-ranking calculation, which cannot effectively use fine-grained features. However, fine-grained features are particularly important due to the lack of information in cross-modality re-ID. To this end, the Q-center Multi-granularity K-reciprocal Re-ranking Algorithm (termed QCMR) is proposed, including a Q-nearest neighbour centre encoder (termed QNC) and a Multi-granularity K-reciprocal Encoder (termed MGK) for a more comprehensive feature representation. QNC converts the probe-corresponding modality features into gallery corresponding modality features through modality transfer to narrow the modality gap. MGK takes a coarse-grained mutual nearest neighbour as the dominant and combines a fine-grained nearest neighbour as a supplement for similarity measurement. Extensive experiments on two widely used VI-ReID benchmarks, SYSU-MM01 and RegDB have shown that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Especially, the mAP of SYSU-MM01 is increased by 5.9% in all-search mode.},

  abstract     = {Epilepsy is considered as a serious brain disorder in which patients frequently experience seizures. The seizures are defined as the unexpected electrical changes in brain neural activity, which leads to unconsciousness. Existing researches made an intense effort for predicting the epileptic seizures using brain signal data. However, they faced difficulty in obtaining the patients&#39; characteristics because the model&#39;s distribution turned to fake predictions, affecting the model&#39;s reliability. In addition, the existing prediction models have severe issues, such as overfitting and false positive rates. To overcome these existing issues, we propose a deep learning approach known as Deep dual-patch attention mechanism ( D 2 PAM ) for classifying the pre-ictal signals of people with Epilepsy based on the brain signals. Deep neural network is integrated with D 2 PAM , and it lowers the effect of differences between patients to predict ES. The multi-network design enhances the trained model&#39;s generalisability and stability efficiently. Also, the proposed model for processing the brain signal is designed to transform the signals into data blocks, which is appropriate for pre-ictal classification. The earlier warning of epilepsy with the proposed model obtains the auxiliary diagnosis. The data of real patients for the experiments provides the improved accuracy by D 2 PAM approximation compared to the existing techniques. To be more distinctive, the authors have analysed the performance of their work with five patients, and the accuracy comes out to be 95%, 97%, 99%, 99%, and 99% respectively. Overall, the numerical results unveil that the proposed work outperforms the existing models.},

  abstract     = {In real life, a large amount of data describing the same learning task may be stored in different institutions (called participants), and these data cannot be shared among participants due to privacy protection. The case that different attributes/features of the same instance are stored in different institutions is called vertically distributed data. The purpose of vertical-federated feature selection (FS) is to reduce the feature dimension of vertical distributed data jointly without sharing local original data so that the feature subset obtained has the same or better performance as the original feature set. To solve this problem, in the paper, an embedded vertical-federated FS algorithm based on particle swarm optimisation (PSO-EVFFS) is proposed by incorporating evolutionary FS into the SecureBoost framework for the first time. By optimising both hyper-parameters of the XGBoost model and feature subsets, PSO-EVFFS can obtain a feature subset, which makes the XGBoost model more accurate. At the same time, since different participants only share insensitive parameters such as model loss function, PSO-EVFFS can effectively ensure the privacy of participants&#39; data. Moreover, an ensemble ranking strategy of feature importance based on the XGBoost tree model is developed to effectively remove irrelevant features on each participant. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to 10 test datasets and compared with three typical vertical-federated learning frameworks and two variants of the proposed algorithm with different initialisation strategies. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the classification performance of selected feature subsets while fully protecting the data privacy of all participants.},

  abstract     = {Urgent care clinics and emergency departments around the world periodically suffer from extended wait times beyond patient expectations due to surges in patient flows. The delays arising from inadequate staffing levels during these periods have been linked with adverse clinical outcomes. Previous research into forecasting patient flows has mostly used statistical techniques. These studies have also predominately focussed on short-term forecasts, which have limited practicality for the resourcing of medical personnel. This study joins an emerging body of work which seeks to explore the potential of machine learning algorithms to generate accurate forecasts of patient presentations. Our research uses datasets covering 10 years from two large urgent care clinics to develop long-term patient flow forecasts up to one quarter ahead using a range of state-of-the-art algorithms. A distinctive feature of this study is the use of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tools like Shapely and LIME that enable an in-depth analysis of the behaviour of the models, which would otherwise be uninterpretable. These analysis tools enabled us to explore the ability of the models to adapt to the volatility in patient demand during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and to identify the most impactful variables, resulting in valuable insights into their performance. The results showed that a novel combination of advanced univariate models like Prophet as well as gradient boosting, into an ensemble, delivered the most accurate and consistent solutions on average. This approach generated improvements in the range of 16%–30% over the existing in-house methods for estimating the daily patient flows 90 days ahead.},

  abstract     = {Depression has become one of the most common mental illnesses in the world. For better prediction and diagnosis, methods of automatic depression recognition based on speech signal are constantly proposed and updated, with a transition from the early traditional methods based on hand-crafted features to the application of architectures of deep learning. This paper systematically and precisely outlines the most prominent and up-to-date research of automatic depression recognition by intelligent speech signal processing so far. Furthermore, methods for acoustic feature extraction, algorithms for classification and regression, as well as end to end deep models are investigated and analysed. Finally, general trends are summarised and key unresolved issues are identified to be considered in future studies of automatic speech depression recognition.},

  abstract     = {Initiatives to minimise battery use, address sustainability, and reduce regular maintenance have driven the challenge to use alternative power sources to supply energy to devices deployed in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. As a key pillar of fifth generation (5G) and beyond 5G networks,IoT is estimated to reach 42 billion devices by the year 2025. Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) are solid state energy harvesters which reliably and renewably convert thermal energy into electrical energy. These devices are able to recover lost thermal energy, produce energy in extreme environments, generate electric power in remote areas, and power micro-sensors. Applying the state of the art, the authorspresent a comprehensive review of machine learning (ML) approaches applied in combination with TEG-powered IoT devices to manage and predict available energy. The application areas of TEG-driven IoT devices that exploit as a heat source the temperature differences found in the environment, biological structures, machines, and other technologies are summarised. Based on detailed research of the state of the art in TEG-powered devices, the authors investigated the research challenges, applied algorithms and application areas of this technology. The aims of the research were to devise new energy prediction and energy management systems based on ML methods, create supervised algorithms which better estimate incoming energy, and develop unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches which provide adaptive and dynamic operation. The review results indicate that TEGs are a suitable energy harvesting technology for low-power applications through their scalability, usability in ubiquitous temperature difference scenarios, and long operating lifetime. However, TEGs also have low energy efficiency (around 10%) and require a relatively constant heat source.},

Compared with the existing models, the AVPGNN model has the following advantages: (1) avoids the matrix inverse, which can significantly reduce the computing complexity; (2) introduces the time-derivative of the time-varying parameters in the TVCQP problem by adding an activated variable parameter, enabling the AVPGNN model to achieve a predictive calculation that achieves zero residual error in theory; (3) adopts the activation function to accelerate the convergence rate. To solve the TVCQP problem with the AVPGNN model, the TVCQP problem is transformed into a non-linear equation with a non-linear compensation problem function based on the Karush Kuhn Tucker conditions. Then, a variable parameter with an activation function is employed to design the AVPGNN model. The accuracy and convergence rate of the AVPGNN model are rigorously analysed in theory. Furthermore, numerical experiments are also executed to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model. Moreover, to explore the feasibility of the AVPGNN model, applications to the motion planning of a robotic manipulator and the portfolio selection of marketed securities are illustrated.},

  abstract     = {For linear time varying (LTV) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems with vector relative degree, an open-closed-loop iterative learning control (ILC) strategy is developed in this article, where the time interval of operation is iteration dependent. To compensate the missing tracking signal caused by iteration dependent interval, the feedback control is introduced in ILC design. As the tracking signal of many continuous iterations is lost in a certain interval, the feedback control part can employ the tracking signal of current iteration for compensation. Under the assumption that the initial state vibrates around the desired initial state uniformly in mathematical expectation sense, the expectation of ILC tracking error can converge to zero as the number of iteration tends to infinity. Under the circumstance that the initial state varies around the desired initial state with a bound, as the number of iteration tends to infinity, the expectation of ILC tracking error can be driven to a bounded range, whose upper bound is proportional to the fluctuation. It is revealed that the convergence condition is dependent on the feedforward control gains, while the feedback control can accelerate convergence speed by selecting appropriate feedback control gains. As a special case, the controlled system with integrated high relative degree is also addressed by proposing a simplified iteration dependent interval based open-closed-loop ILC method. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed iteration dependent interval based open-closed-loop ILC is illustrated by a simulation example with two cases on initial state.},

In this study, for investigating tensegrity form-finding problems, a concise and efficient dynamic relaxation-noise tolerant zeroing neural network (DR-NTZNN) form-finding algorithm is established through analysing the physical properties of tensegrity structures. In addition, the non-linear constrained optimisation problem which transformed from the form-finding problem is solved by a sequential quadratic programming algorithm. Moreover, the noise may produce in the form-finding process that includes the round-off errors which are brought by the approximate matrix and restart point calculating course, disturbance caused by external force and manufacturing error when constructing a tensegrity structure. Hence, for the purpose of suppressing the noise, a noise tolerant zeroing neural network is presented to solve the search direction, which can endow the anti-noise capability to the form-finding model and enhance the calculation capability. Besides, the dynamic relaxation method is contributed to seek the nodal coordinates rapidly when the search direction is acquired. The numerical results show the form-finding model has a huge capability for high-dimensional free form cable-strut mechanisms with complicated topology. Eventually, comparing with other existing form-finding methods, the contrast simulations reveal the excellent anti-noise performance and calculation capacity of DR-NTZNN form-finding algorithm.},

Recurrent neural network which is described by dynamic models with parallel processing capability, is a powerful tool for kinematic control of manipulators. Due to physical limitations and actuation saturation of manipulator joints, the involvement of joint constraints for kinematic control of manipulators is essential and critical. However, current existing manipulator control methods based on recurrent neural networks mainly handle with limited levels of joint angular constraints, and to the best of our knowledge, methods for kinematic control of manipulators with higher order joint constraints based on recurrent neural networks are not yet reported. In this study, for the first time, a novel recursive recurrent network model is proposed to solve the kinematic control issue for manipulators with different levels of physical constraints, and the proposed recursive recurrent neural network can be formulated as a new manifold system to ensure control solution within all of the joint constraints in different orders. The theoretical analysis shows the stability and the purposed recursive recurrent neural network and its convergence to solution. Simulation results further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in end-effector path tracking control under different levels of joint constraints based on the Kuka manipulator system. Comparisons with other methods such as the pseudoinverse-based method and conventional recurrent neural network method substantiate the superiority of the proposed method.},

The cost of the dataset with ground-truth labels is much higher than in other domains.

So, a great number of situation information greatly increase, which need to be dealt with in the course of scouting underwater targets. Situation assessment in sea battlefield with a lot of uncertain information is studied, and a new situation assessment method of scouting underwater targets with fixed-wing patrol aircraft is proposed based on the cloud Bayesian network, which overcomes the deficiency of the single cloud model in reasoning ability and the defect of Bayesian network in knowledge representation. Moreover, in the method, the cloud model knowledge deal with the input data of Bayesian network reasoning, and the advantages in knowledge representation of cloud theory and reasoning of Bayesian network are applied; also, the fuzziness and stochasticity of cloud theory in knowledge expression, the reasoning ability of Bayesian network, are combined. Then, the situation assessment model of scouting underwater targets with fixed-wing patrol aircraft is established. Hence, the directed acyclic graph of Bayesian network structure is constructed and the assessment index is determined. Next, the cloud model is used to deal with Bayesian network, and the discrete Bayesian network is obtained. Moreover, after CPT of each node and the transformation between certainty degree and probability are accomplished; the final situation level is obtained through a probability synthesis formula. Therefore, the target type and the operational intention of the other side are deduced to form the battlefield situation. Finally, simulations are carried out, and the rationality and validity of the proposed method are testified by simulation results. By this method, the battlefield situation can be gained. And this method has a wider application range, especially for large sample data processing, and it has better practicability.},

The statistical histogram is introduced to encode and fuse the directional index with the largest feature value on Gabor scales. Secondly, a new hybrid feature selection algorithm chaotic improved atom search optimisation with simulated annealing (CIASO-SA) is presented, which is based on an improved atomic search algorithm and the simulated annealing algorithm. Besides, the CIASO-SA algorithm introduces a chaos mechanism during atomic initialisation, significantly improving the convergence speed and accuracy of the algorithm.

First, dimensionality of the original imbalanced data is reduced using MDS so that distances between any two different samples are preserved as well as possible. Second, a novel OPCE algorithm is applied to classify imbalanced samples by placing optimised observation points in a low-dimensional data space. Third, optimization of the observation point mappings is carried out to obtain a reliable assessment of the unknown samples. Exhaustive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the feasibility, rationality, and effectiveness of the proposed OPCE algorithm using seven benchmark HDIC data sets. Experimental results show that (1) the OPCE algorithm can be trained faster on low-dimensional imbalanced data than on high-dimensional data; (2) the OPCE algorithm can correctly identify samples as the number of optimised observation points is increased; and (3) statistical analysis reveals that OPCE yields better HDIC performances on the selected data sets in comparison with eight other HDIC algorithms. This demonstrates that OPCE is a viable algorithm to deal with HDIC problems.},

  abstract     = {A novel model termed a bipolar complex fuzzy N-soft set (BCFN-SS) is initiated for tackling information that involves positive and negative aspects, the second dimension, and parameterised grading simultaneously. The theory of BCFN-SS is the generalisation of two various theories, that is, bipolar complex fuzzy (BCF) and N-SS. The invented model of BCFN-SS helps decision-makers to cope with the genuine-life dilemmas containing BCF information along with parameterised grading at the same time. Further, various algebraic operations, including the usual type of union, intersection, complements, and a few others types, are invented. Certain primary operational laws for BCFN-SS are also invented. Moreover, a technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach is devised in the setting of BCFN-SS for managing strategic decision-making (DM) dilemmas containing BCFN-SS information. Keeping in mind the usefulness and benefits of the TOPSIS approach, two various types of TOPSIS approaches in the environment of BCFN-SS are devised and then a numerical example for exposing the usefulness of the devised TOPSIS approach is interpreted. To disclose the prominence and benefits of the devised work, the devised approaches with numerous prevailing work are compared.},

  abstract     = {At present, the entity and relation joint extraction task has attracted more and more scholars&#39; attention in the field of natural language processing (NLP). However, most of their methods rely on NLP tools to construct dependency trees to obtain sentence structure information. The adjacency matrix constructed by the dependency tree can convey syntactic information. Dependency trees obtained through NLP tools are too dependent on the tools and may not be very accurate in contextual semantic description. At the same time, a large amount of irrelevant information will cause redundancy. This paper presents a novel end-to-end entity and relation joint extraction based on the multi-head attention graph convolutional network model (MAGCN), which does not rely on external tools. MAGCN generates an adjacency matrix through a multi-head attention mechanism to form an attention graph convolutional network model, uses head selection to identify multiple relations, and effectively improve the prediction result of overlapping relations. The authors extensively experiment and prove the method&#39;s effectiveness on three public datasets: NYT, WebNLG, and CoNLL04. The results show that the authors’ method outperforms the state-of-the-art research results for the task of entities and relation extraction.},

However, general deep learning models cannot achieve very satisfactory classification results on mammographic images because these models are not specifically designed for mammographic images and do not take the specific traits of these images into account. To exploit the essential discriminant information of mammographic images, we propose a novel classification method based on a convolutional neural network. Specifically, the proposed method designs two branches to extract the discriminative features from mammographic images from the mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal (CC) mammographic views. The features extracted from the two-view mammographic images contain complementary information that enables breast cancer to be more easily distinguished. Moreover, the attention block is introduced to capture the channel-wise information by adjusting the weight of each feature map, which is beneficial to emphasising the important features of mammographic images. Furthermore, we add a penalty term based on the fuzzy cluster algorithm to the cross-entropy function, which improves the generalisation ability of the classification model by maximising the interclass distance and minimising the intraclass distance of the samples. The experimental results on The Digital database for Screening Mammography INbreast and MIAS mammography databases illustrate that the proposed method achieves the best classification performance and is more robust than the compared state-of-the-art classification methods.},

Aiming at the shortcomings of face feature dictionary not ‘clean’ and noise interference dictionary not ‘representative’ in sparse representation classification model, a new method named as robust sparse representation is proposed based on adaptive joint dictionary (RSR-AJD). First, a fast low-rank subspace recovery algorithm based on LogDet function (Fast LRSR-LogDet) is proposed for accurate low-rank facial intrinsic dictionary representing the similar structure of human face and low computational complexity. Then, the Iteratively Reweighted Robust Principal Component Analysis (IRRPCA) algorithm is used to get a more precise occlusion dictionary for depicting the possible discontinuous interference information attached to human face such as glasses occlusion or scarf occlusion etc. Finally, the above Fast LRSR-LogDet algorithm and IRRPCA algorithm are adopted to construct the adaptive joint dictionary, which includes the low-rank facial intrinsic dictionary, the occlusion dictionary and the remaining intra-class variant dictionary for robust sparse coding. Experiments conducted on four popular databases (AR, Extended Yale B, LFW, and Pubfig) verify the robustness and effectiveness of the authors’ method.},

  abstract     = {Predicting potential facts in the future, Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) extrapolation remains challenging because of the deep dependence between the temporal association and semantic patterns of facts. Intuitively, facts (events) that happened at different timestamps have different influences on future events, which can be attributed to a hierarchy among not only facts but also relevant entities. Therefore, it is crucial to pay more attention to important entities and events when forecasting the future. However, most existing methods focus on reasoning over temporally evolving facts or mining evolutional patterns from known facts, which may be affected by the diversity and variability of the evolution, and they might fail to attach importance to facts that matter. Hyperbolic geometry was proved to be effective in capturing hierarchical patterns among data, which is considered to be a solution for modelling hierarchical relations among facts. To this end, we propose ReTIN, a novel model integrating real-time influence of historical facts for TKG reasoning based on hyperbolic geometry, which provides low-dimensional embeddings to capture latent hierarchical structures and other rich semantic patterns of the existing TKG. Considering both real-time and global features of TKG boosts the adaptation of ReTIN to the ever-changing dynamics and inherent constraints. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of ReTIN over various baselines. The ablation study further supports the value of exploiting temporal information.},

  abstract     = {Speech emotion recognition (SER) is an important research problem in human-computer interaction systems. The representation and extraction of features are significant challenges in SER systems. Despite the promising results of recent studies, they generally do not leverage progressive fusion techniques for effective feature representation and increasing receptive fields. To mitigate this problem, this article proposes DeepCNN, which is a fusion of spectral and temporal features of emotional speech by parallelising convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a convolution layer-based transformer. Two parallel CNNs are applied to extract the spectral features (2D-CNN) and temporal features (1D-CNN) representations. A 2D-convolution layer-based transformer module extracts spectro-temporal features and concatenates them with features from parallel CNNs. The learnt low-level concatenated features are then applied to a deep framework of convolutional blocks, which retrieves high-level feature representation and subsequently categorises the emotional states using an attention gated recurrent unit and classification layer. This fusion technique results in a deeper hierarchical feature representation at a lower computational cost while simultaneously expanding the filter depth and reducing the feature map. The Berlin Database of Emotional Speech (EMO-BD) and Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) datasets are used in experiments to recognise distinct speech emotions. With efficient spectral and temporal feature representation, the proposed SER model achieves 94.2% accuracy for different emotions on the EMO-BD and 81.1% accuracy on the IEMOCAP dataset respectively. The proposed SER system, DeepCNN, outperforms the baseline SER systems in terms of emotion recognition accuracy on the EMO-BD and IEMOCAP datasets.},

This article presents an approach based on Media Convergence and Graph convolution Encoder Clustering (MCGEC) for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinical data. It feeds modal information and graph structure from media information into a multi-modal graph convolution encoder to obtain the media feature representation learnt from multiple modalities. MCGEC captures latent information from various modalities by fusion and optimises the feature representations and network architecture with learnt clustering labels. The experiment is conducted on real-world multi-modal TCM clinical data, including information like images and text. MCGEC has improved clustering results compared to the generic single-modal clustering methods and the current more advanced multi-modal clustering methods. MCGEC applied to TCM clinical datasets can achieve better results. Integrating multimedia features into clustering algorithms offers significant benefits compared to single-modal clustering approaches that simply concatenate features from different modalities.

Implicit function is suitable for this task because it represents fine shape details and varied topology. Current methods, however, often suffer from artefacts such as broken or disembodied body parts, missing details, or depth ambiguity due to the ambiguity and complexity of human articulation. The main issue observed by the authors is structure-agnostic. To address these problems, the authors fully utilise the skinned multi-person linear (SMPL) model and propose a method using the Skeleton-aware Implicit Function (SIF). To alleviate the broken or disembodied body parts, the proposed skeleton-aware structure prior makes the skeleton awareness into an implicit function, which consists of a bone-guided sampling strategy and a skeleton-relative encoding strategy. To deal with the missing details and depth ambiguity problems, the authors’ body-guided pixel-aligned feature exploits the SMPL to enhance 2D normal and depth semantic features, and the proposed feature aggregation uses the extra geometry-aware prior to enabling a more plausible merging with less noisy geometry. Additionally, SIF is also adapted to the RGB-D input, and experimental results show that SIF outperforms the state-of-the-arts methods on challenging datasets from Twindom and Thuman3.0.},

By designing fully convolutional neural networks, the key anthropometric parameters and the generic HRTF amplitudes were used to predict each individual HRTF amplitude spectrum in the full-space directions, and the interaural time delay (ITD) was predicted by the transformer module. In the amplitude prediction model, the attention mechanism was adopted to better capture the relationship of HRTF amplitude spectra at two distinctive directions with large angle differences in space. Finally, with the minimum phase model, the predicted amplitude spectrum and ITDs were used to obtain a set of individual head-related impulse responses. Besides the separate training of the HRTF amplitude and ITD generation models, their joint training was also considered and evaluated. The root-mean-square error and the log-spectral distortion were selected as objective measurement metrics to evaluate the performance. Subjective experiments further showed that the auditory source localisation performance of the proposed method was better than other methods in most cases.},

Moreover, since music signals are often dual channel data with a high sampling rate, how to model long-sequence data and make rational use of the relevant information between channels is also an urgent problem to be solved. In order to solve the above problems, the performance of the end-to-end music separation algorithm is enhanced by improving the network structure. Our main contributions include the following: (1) A more reasonable densely connected U-Net is designed to capture the long-term characteristics of music, such as main melody, tone and so on. (2) On this basis, the multi-head attention and dual-path transformer are introduced in the separation module. Channel attention units are applied recursively on the feature map of each layer of the network, enabling the network to perform long-sequence separation. Experimental results show that after the introduction of the channel attention, the performance of the proposed algorithm has a stable improvement compared with the baseline system. On the MUSDB18 dataset, the average score of the separated audio exceeds that of the current best-performing music separation algorithm based on the time-frequency domain (T-F domain).},

  abstract     = {Due to strong learning ability, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been developed in image denoising. However, convolutional operations may change original distributions of noise in corrupted images, which may increase training difficulty in image denoising. Using relations of surrounding pixels can effectively resolve this problem. Inspired by that, we propose a robust deformed denoising CNN (RDDCNN) in this paper. The proposed RDDCNN contains three blocks: a deformable block (DB), an enhanced block (EB) and a residual block (RB). The DB can extract more representative noise features via a deformable learnable kernel and stacked convolutional architecture, according to relations of surrounding pixels. The EB can facilitate contextual interaction through a dilated convolution and a novel combination of convolutional layers, batch normalisation (BN) and ReLU, which can enhance the learning ability of the proposed RDDCNN. To address long-term dependency problem, the RB is used to enhance the memory ability of shallow layer on deep layers and construct a clean image. Besides, we implement a blind denoising model. Experimental results demonstrate that our denoising model outperforms popular denoising methods in terms of qualitative and quantitative analysis.

  abstract     = {With the development of intelligent agents pursuing humanisation, artificial intelligence must consider emotion, the most basic spiritual need in human interaction. Traditional emotional dialogue systems usually use an external emotional dictionary to select appropriate emotional words to add to the response or concatenate emotional tags and semantic features in the decoding step to generate appropriate responses. However, selecting emotional words from a fixed emotional dictionary may result in loss of the diversity and consistency of the response. We propose a semantic and emotion-based dual latent variable generation model (Dual-LVG) for dialogue systems, which is able to generate appropriate emotional responses without an emotional dictionary. Different from previous work, the conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) adopts the standard transformer structure. Then, Dual-LVG regularises the CVAE latent space by introducing a dual latent space of semantics and emotion. The content diversity and emotional accuracy of the generated responses are improved by learning emotion and semantic features respectively. Moreover, the average attention mechanism is adopted to better extract semantic features at the sequence level, and the semi-supervised attention mechanism is used in the decoding step to strengthen the fusion of emotional features of the model. Experimental results show that Dual-LVG can successfully achieve the effect of generating different content by controlling emotional factors.},

This enhances the understanding of biological nervous systems and the applicability of the model in various fields. However, the existing DNM suffers from high complexity and limited generalisation capability. To address these issues, a DNM pruning method with dendrite layer significance constraints is proposed. This method not only evaluates the significance of dendrite layers but also allocates the significance of a few dendrite layers in the trained model to a few dendrite layers, allowing the removal of low-significance dendrite layers. The simulation experiments on six UCI datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing pruning methods in terms of network size and generalisation performance.},

Hence, the existing multiple sensitive attributes data publishing fails to fully account for the comprehensive information utility. To acquire a guaranteed information utility, this article defines comprehensive information loss that considers both the suppression of records and the relationship between sensitive attributes. A heuristic method is leveraged to discover the optimal anonymity scheme that has the lowest comprehensive information loss.

Researchers in the field of machine learning have proved that random forest can form better judgements on this kind of problem, and it has an auxiliary role in the prediction of stock trend. This study uses historical trading data of four listed companies in the USA stock market, and the purpose of this study is to improve the performance of random forest model in medium- and long-term stock trend prediction. This study applies the exponential smoothing method to process the initial data, calculates the relevant technical indicators as the characteristics to be selected, and proposes the D-RF-RS method to optimize random forest. As the random forest is an ensemble learning model and is closely related to decision tree, D-RF-RS method uses a decision tree to screen the importance of features, and obtains the effective strong feature set of the model as input. Then, the parameter combination of the model is optimized through random parameter search. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of random forest is increased by 0.17 after the above process optimization, which is 0.18 higher than the average accuracy of light gradient boosting machine model. Combined with the performance of the ROC curve and Precision–Recall curve, the stability of the model is also guaranteed, which further demonstrates the advantages of random forest in medium- and long-term trend prediction of the stock market.},

The use of AI in the daily work of individuals and in shaping the relationship between firms and customers has resulted in increased efficiency and a higher degree of fascination in interaction. There are, however, customers&#39; fears related to the use of AI. Therefore, understanding how AI affects customer trust is worth investigating. This study focuses on the AI applications and their impact on communication quality and customer trust. The features of AI applications investigated in this study include anthropomorphism, empathy response and interaction. A model was first empirically validated through Confirmatory Factor Analysis and tested using Covariance-Based Structural Equation Modelling. Data were then collected from a survey of 507 customers of two banks and two big telecommunication firms in Vietnam. Empirical results indicate that anthropomorphism and interaction do not play critical roles in generating customer trust in AI unless they create communication quality with customers. The ability of empathy response makes customers trust in various service situations. AI application seems to be a good solution for service firms to enhance their relationship with customers in difficult circumstances, including a pandemic crisis. This study delivers implications for enhancing AI adoption in the service firms that intend to innovate their future operations.},

This study proposes a novel video captioning framework (ORMF) based on the object relation graph and multimodal feature fusion. ORMF uses the similarity and Spatio-temporal relationship of objects in video to construct object relation features graph and introduce graph convolution network (GCN) to encode the object relation. At the same time, ORMF also constructs a multimodal features fusion network to learn the relationship between different modal features. The multimodal feature fusion network is used to fuse the features of different modals. Furthermore, the proposed model calculates the length loss of the caption, making the caption get richer information.

First, the algorithm uses the biological visual attention mechanism to quickly and accurately obtain the face salient target and constructs the visual salient dictionary. Then, a block cooperation framework is presented to perform sparse coding for different local structures of human face, and the weighted regular term is introduced in the sparse representation process to enhance the identification of information hidden in the coding coefficients. Finally, by synthesising the sparse representation results of all visual salient block dictionaries, the global coding residual is obtained and the class label is given. The experimental results on four databases, that is, AR, extended Yale B, LFW and PubFig, indicate that the combination of visual saliency dictionary, block cooperative sparse representation and weighted constraint coding can effectively enhance the accuracy of sparse representation of the samples to be tested and improve the performance of unconstrained face recognition.},

Vibration signal can reflect the cavitation conditions in axial piston pumps and it has been combined with machine learning to detect the pump cavitation. However, the vibration signal usually contains noise in real working conditions, which raises concerns about accurate recognition of cavitation in noisy environment. This paper presents an intelligent method to recognise the cavitation in axial piston pumps in noisy environment. First, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using the spectrogram images transformed from raw vibration data under different cavitation conditions. Second, we employ the technique of gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to visualise class-discriminative regions in the spectrogram image. Finally, we propose a novel image processing method based on Grad-CAM heatmap to automatically remove entrained noise and enhance class features in the spectrogram image. The experimental results show that the proposed method greatly improves the diagnostic performance of the CNN model in noisy environments. The classification accuracy of cavitation conditions increases from 0.50 to 0.89 and from 0.80 to 0.92 at signal-to-noise ratios of 4 and 6 dB, respectively.},

Relevance Vector Machine classification suffers from theoretical limitations and computational inefficiency mainly because there is no closed-form solution for the posterior of the weight parameters. We propose two advanced Bayesian approaches for RVM classification, namely the Enhanced RVM and the Reinforced RVM, to perfect the theoretic framework of RVM and extend the algorithm to the imbalanced data problem, which has an arresting skew in data size between classes. First, the Enhanced RVM conducts a strict Bayesian sampling process instead of the approximation method in the original one to remedy its theoretic limitations, especially the non-convergence of the iterations. Secondly, we conjecture that the hierarchical prior makes the Reinforced RVM achieve consistent estimations of the quantities of interest compared with the non-consistent estimations of the original RVM. Consistency is necessary for RVM classification since it makes the model more stable and localises the relevant vectors more accurately in the imbalanced data problem. The two-level prior also renders the Reinforced one competitive in the imbalanced data problem by building the inner connection of parameter dimensions and alloting a more vital relevance to the small class data weight parameter. The theoretic proofs and several numeric studies demonstrate the merits of our two proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The goal of street-to-aerial cross-view image geo-localization is to determine the location of the query street-view image by retrieving the aerial-view image from the same place. The drastic viewpoint and appearance gap between the aerial-view and the street-view images brings a huge challenge against this task. In this paper, we propose a novel multiscale attention encoder to capture the multiscale contextual information of the aerial/street-view images. To bridge the domain gap between these two view images, we first use an inverse polar transform to make the street-view images approximately aligned with the aerial-view images. Then, the explored multiscale attention encoder is applied to convert the image into feature representation with the guidance of the learnt multiscale information. Finally, we propose a novel global mining strategy to enable the network to pay more attention to hard negative exemplars. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that our approach obtains 81.39% top-1 recall rate on the CVUSA dataset and 71.52% on the CVACT dataset, achieving the state-of-the-art performance and outperforming most of the existing methods significantly.},

  abstract     = {The exponential increase in IoT device usage has spawned numerous cyberspace innovations. IoT devices, sensors, and actuators bridge the gap between physical processes and the cyber network in a cyber-physical system (CPS). Cyber-physical system is a complex system from a security perspective due to the heterogeneous nature of its components and the fact that IoT devices can serve as an entry point for cyberattacks. Most adversaries design their attack strategies on systems to gain an advantage at a relatively lower cost, whereas abusive adversaries initiate an attack to inflict maximum damage without regard to cost or reward. In this paper, a sensor spoofing attack is modelled as a malicious adversary attempting to cause system failure by interfering with the feedback control mechanism. It is accomplished by feeding spoofed sensor values to the controller and issuing erroneous commands to the actuator. Experiments on a Simulink-simulated linear CPS support the proof of concept for the proposed abusive ideology, demonstrating three attack strategies. The impact of the evaluations stresses the importance of testing the CPS security against adversaries with abusive settings for preventing cyber-vandalism. Finally, the research concludes by highlighting the limitations of the proposed work, followed by recommendations for the future.},

Radar sensing is desirable to build a more robust navigation system. In this paper, a cross-modality radar localisation on prior lidar maps is presented. Specifically, the proposed workflow consists of two parts: first, bird&#39;s-eye-view radar images are transferred to fake lidar images by training a generative adversarial network offline. Then with online radar scans, a Monte Carlo localisation framework is built to track the robot pose on lidar maps. The whole online localisation system only needs a rotating radar sensor and a pre-built global lidar map. In the experimental section, the authors conduct an ablation study on image settings and test the proposed system on Oxford Radar Robot Car Dataset. The promising results show that the proposed localisation system could track the robot pose successfully, thus demonstrating the feasibility of radar style transfer for metric robot localisation on lidar maps.},

Different classification schemas have been investigated, including character-based and visemes-based schemas. The visual front-end model of the system consists of a Spatial-Temporal (3D) convolution followed by a 2D ResNet. Transformers utilise multi-headed attention for phoneme recognition models. For the language model, a Recurrent Neural Network is used. The performance of the proposed system has been testified with the BBC Lip Reading Sentences 2 (LRS2) benchmark dataset.

  abstract     = {Emotion cause extraction (ECE) task that aims at extracting potential trigger events of certain emotions has attracted extensive attention recently. However, current work neglects the implicit emotion expressed without any explicit emotional keywords, which appears more frequently in application scenarios. The lack of explicit emotion information makes it extremely hard to extract emotion causes only with the local context. Moreover, an entire event is usually across multiple clauses, while existing work merely extracts cause events at clause level and cannot effectively capture complete cause event information. To address these issues, the events are first redefined at the tuple level and a span-based tuple-level algorithm is proposed to extract events from different clauses. Based on it, a corpus for implicit emotion cause extraction that tries to extract causes of implicit emotions is constructed. The authors propose a knowledge-enriched joint-learning model of implicit emotion recognition and implicit emotion cause extraction tasks (KJ-IECE), which leverages commonsense knowledge from ConceptNet and NRC_VAD to better capture connections between emotion and corresponding cause events. Experiments on both implicit and explicit emotion cause extraction datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

Predicting the Stock Market is quite challenging, and it requires intensive study of the pattern of data. Specific statistical models and artificially intelligent algorithms are needed to meet this challenge and arrive at an appropriate solution. Various machine learning and deep learning algorithms can make a firm prediction with minimised error possibilities. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) or Deep Feed-forward Neural Network and the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are the two network models that have been used extensively to predict the stock market prices. The models have been used to predict upcoming days&#39; data values from the last few days&#39; data values. This process keeps on repeating recursively as long as the dataset is valid. An endeavour has been taken to optimise this prediction using deep learning, and it has given substantial results. The ANN model achieved an accuracy of 97.66%, whereas the CNN model achieved an accuracy of 98.92%. The CNN model used 2-D histograms generated out of the quantised dataset within a particular time frame, and prediction is made on that data. This approach has not been implemented earlier for the analysis of such datasets. As a case study, the model has been tested on the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a sudden downfall of the stock market. The results obtained from this study was decent enough as it produced an accuracy of 91%.},

First, the economic dispatch goal of wind power is be considered. It is projected to save money and reduce the cost of power generation for the system. The model includes risk operating costs to account for the impact of wind power output variability on the system, as well as wind farm negative efficiency operating costs to account for the loss caused by wind abandonment. The model also employs carbon trading market metrics to achieve the goal of lowering system carbon emissions, and analyze the impact of different carbon trading prices on the system. A low-carbon economic dispatch model for the wind power market is implemented based on the following two goals.

  abstract     = {Graphs help to define the relationships between entities in the data. These relationships, represented by edges, often provide additional context information which can be utilised to discover patterns in the data. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) employ the inductive bias of the graph structure to learn and predict on various tasks. The primary operation of graph neural networks is the feature aggregation step performed over neighbours of the node based on the structure of the graph. In addition to its own features, for each hop, the node gets additional combined features from its neighbours. These aggregated features help define the similarity or dissimilarity of the nodes with respect to the labels and are useful for tasks like node classification. However, in real-world data, features of neighbours at different hops may not correlate with the node&#39;s features. Thus, any indiscriminate feature aggregation by GNN might cause the addition of noisy features leading to degradation in model&#39;s performance. In this work, we show that selective aggregation of node features from various hops leads to better performance than default aggregation on the node classification task. Furthermore, we propose a Dual-Net GNN architecture with a classifier model and a selector model. The classifier model trains over a subset of input node features to predict node labels while the selector model learns to provide optimal input subset to the classifier for the best performance. These two models are trained jointly to learn the best subset of features that give higher accuracy in node label predictions. With extensive experiments, we show that our proposed model outperforms both feature selection methods and state-of-the-art GNN models with remarkable improvements up to 27.8%.},

  abstract     = {Probabilistic time series forecasting aims at estimating future probabilistic distributions based on given time series observations. It is a widespread challenge in various tasks, such as risk management and decision making. To investigate temporal patterns in time series data and predict subsequent probabilities, the state space model (SSM) provides a general framework. Variants of SSM achieve considerable success in many fields, such as engineering and statistics. However, since underlying processes in real-world scenarios are usually unknown and complicated, actual time series observations are always irregular and noisy. Therefore, it is very difficult to determinate an SSM for classical statistical approaches. In this paper, a general time series forecasting framework, called Deep Non-linear State Space Model (DNLSSM), is proposed to predict the probabilistic distribution based on estimated underlying unknown processes from historical time series data. We fuse deep neural networks and statistical methods to iteratively estimate states and network parameters and thus exploit intricate temporal patterns of time series data. In particular, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is adopted to calculate marginal likelihoods and update distributions recursively for non-linear functions. After that, a non-linear Joseph form covariance update is developed to ensure that calculated covariance matrices in UKF updates are symmetric and positive definitive. Therefore, the authors enhance the tolerance of UKF to round-off errors and manage to combine UKF and deep neural networks. In this manner, the DNLSSM effectively models non-linear correlations between observed time series data and underlying dynamic processes. Experiments in both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the DNLSSM consistently improves the accuracy of probability forecasts compared to the baseline methods.},
