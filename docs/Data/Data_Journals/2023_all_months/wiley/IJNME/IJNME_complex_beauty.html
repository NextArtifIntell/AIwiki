  abstract     = {The rational approximation is an important tool for establishing a dynamic analysis model in time domain for semi-infinite water and soil. It accurately represents the interaction between the semi-infinite medium and an engineering structure. Current research on rational approximation method focuses mainly on the establishment of time-domain analysis models. However, the stability, accuracy, and calculation efficiency of the rational approximation model cannot be guaranteed simultaneously. Based on linear system control theory, this work decomposes the continuous-time rational approximation (CRA) and the discrete-time rational approximation (DRA) into a combination of first- and second-order subsystems, and the stability boundaries for the identified parameters are established according to the stability conditions of each subsystem. A genetic algorithm and a sequential quadratic programming algorithm are used to construct a parameter identification method that can ensure stability in the time domain. Through parameter identification of complex frequency response functions, it is demonstrated that the method proposed in this work can guarantee the stability and accuracy simultaneously, and the calculation efficiency is also substantially improved over that of the existing methods.},

The weak form of the motion equation for the hybrid model is derived by applying Hamilton&#39;s principle. An element-based spatial discretization scheme is set up using the peridynamics-based finite element method (PeriFEM) (Han and Li). The -convergence and m -convergence of the hybrid model are analyzed to verify the numerical convergence and the mesh dependency. The influence of the area of the peridynamic model subdomain and the hybrid model subdomain on the calculation efficiency and accuracy is discussed. And the relationship between the crack propagation speed and the crack branching phenomenon is also investigated. Good agreements are obtained by comparing the crack path and the crack speed profile predicted by the hybrid model with those in the literature. Numerical results verify the ability and efficiency of the hybrid model for dynamic fracture problem.},

The approach proposed has the interest of fulfilling numerically the LBB condition for P1-type discretizations over a wide range of element sizes. Thus, the existence of an error estimate is ensured and there is no need for a stabilization technique. For more convenience, the new P1/RNP0 formulation is first detailed for the Stokes problem. It is based on a RNP0 (Random Nodal P0) approximation of the pressure with constant values on nodal subcells whose size is defined by means of a pseudo-random number generator. For nearly incompressible material flows, the numerical approach is extended to problems involving von Mises elasto-plasticity. Examples are presented to show the relevance of the new approach for Eulerian and Lagrangian formalisms.},

Recently, strain or gradient smoothing techniques have been incorporated into NMM to improve its performance. The resulting smoothed NMMs (SNMMs) normally possess enhanced numerical properties, for example, higher accuracy, convergence, and efficiency. A challenging issue rooted in NMM and other enhanced finite element methods using unfitted meshes is the ill-conditioning induced by extremely small cut element. In this study, we investigate the behaviors of SNMMs in the case of small cut element. It is demonstrated that the cut-induced ill-conditionings also exist for two types of SNMMs, namely, edge-based SNMM and physical-patch-based SNMM. Furthermore, a preconditioner based on the normalization of basis functions is proposed to resolve the ill-conditioning. Several benchmark problems demonstrate the performances of SNMMs regarding accuracy, convergence, and stability.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new velocity-based space-time finite element method for computing the large deformation of solids over arbitrary Lagrange/Eulerian moving meshes. The proposed method is oriented toward quasi-static deformation problems with hypoelastic and neo-Hookean hyperelastic constitutive models. The Cauchy stress in the weak form of the linear momentum equation is explicitly described in terms of deformation velocity through consistent time integration of objective stress rates transferred in the arbitrary moving mesh. Consequently, the resultant system equation only contains the space-time nodal velocity as the primary unknown. An iterative algorithm for solving the discretized system equation is implemented, whereby the nonlinearities induced by geometrical change in the computational domain as well as nonlinear constitutive equations are computed in an iterative manner updating the stress and the strain over the moving mesh of the deforming domain. Three benchmark problems, such as uniform beam compression, thick-cylinder compression with superimposed rigid body rotation and extrusion of a column involving material loss, have been solved in order to examine the accuracy of the proposed numerical scheme. The numerical results have revealed the proper computation of the stress and the displacement of the solids undergoing the large deformation and rotation over the arbitrary Lagrange/Eulerian moving meshes, and have shown the validity and applicability of the proposed method with linear convergence of the iterative algorithm.},

Elastic or inelastic material behavior can be considered for the deformable body. Furthermore, the proposed approach is capable of finite deformations. Moreover, a node-to-segment (NTS) formulation is utilized for contact element discretization. Various numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the numerical method&#39;s applicability for different contact mechanics tasks. First, the presented examples verify the displacement-driven approach by investigating its convergence behavior and consistency. Then, comparisons of solutions by the proposed formulation to the analytical solution and the penalty method are provided to validate its accuracy.

  abstract     = {In the present article, we introduce a new approach that uses a standard lumping technique, also known as the row-sum technique, in the extended finite element method (XFEM) in order to stabilize a fully-coupled hydromechanical model in the presence of a strong discontinuity. Typically, numerical oscillations can be observed where high gradients appear (pressure shocks) due to the violation of the maximum principle. In order to remediate this abnormal behavior, it is of common use to lump the mass matrix associated with the discretized form of the diffusion equation, a parabolic partial differential equation. Several techniques are available to diagonalize the mass matrix in XFEM in the context of dynamic crack growth. However, these techniques were designed for a wave-like partial differential equation, a hyperbolic partial differential equation. The direct use of such techniques with a fully-coupled hydromechanical model does not conserve the mass and leads to the violation of the maximum principle. The approach proposed in this work fulfills the features of a parabolic partial differential equation. It is also adapted to the nonlinear case for which the mass density is given by a constitutive law with a distribution that depends on the position inside the domain but which can be different on each side of the discontinuity. In order to test the robustness of our XFEM formulation, only discontinuous enrichments are considered in this article and the discontinuity is supposed impermeable in order to recover two distinct materials on each side of the boundary-controlled interface for which we can exhibit independent analytical solutions.},

The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element method provides an innovative framework for modeling brittle crack propagation with zero-thickness interface elements, which can accommodate extrinsic cohesive laws to avoid the artificial compliance required in intrinsic cohesive models. However, robust formulations and implementations of DG methods are critical in alleviating the well-known convergence issues for both crack nucleation and propagation with reduced instability. This paper presents a robust interface element formulation by modifying the incomplete interior penalty Galerkin (IIPG) method, which successfully avoids the initial element interface penetration across elements that occurs prior to crack nucleation, and thereby greatly reduces the instability issue as cracks open. We further verified and validated our implementation by using a bar tension test and a beam fracturing benchmark. The robustness of our proposed interface element method was demonstrated by a micromechanics fiber/matrix debonding problem with 64 fibers embedded in a bulk matrix.},

  abstract     = {The material point method (MPM) is frequently used to simulate large deformations of nearly incompressible materials such as water, rubber, and undrained porous media. However, MPM solutions to nearly incompressible materials are susceptible to volumetric locking, that is, overly stiff behavior with erroneous strain and stress fields. While several approaches have been devised to mitigate volumetric locking in the MPM, they require significant modifications of the existing MPM machinery, often tailored to certain basis functions or material types. In this work, we propose a locking-mitigation approach featuring an unprecedented combination of simplicity, efficacy, and generality for a family of explicit MPM formulations. The approach combines the assumed deformation gradient ( ) method with a volume-averaging operation built on the standard particle–grid transfer scheme in the MPM. Upon explicit time integration, this combination yields a new and simple algorithm for updating the deformation gradient, preserving all other MPM procedures. The proposed approach is thus easy to implement, low-cost, and compatible with the existing machinery in the MPM. Through various types of nearly incompressible problems in solid and fluid mechanics, we verify that the proposed approach efficiently circumvents volumetric locking in the explicit MPM, regardless of the basis functions and material types.},

Once the reduced-order model is obtained, the online stage of querying the reduced-order model for simulation is very fast and often real-time capable. This work concerns a strategy to speed up the offline stage of model order reduction for large and complex systems. In particular, it is successful in accelerating the greedy algorithm that is often used in the offline stage for reduced-order model construction. We propose to replace the high-fidelity error estimator in the greedy algorithm with multi-fidelity error estimation. Consequently, the computational complexity of the greedy algorithm is reduced and the algorithm converges more than two times faster without incurring noticeable accuracy loss.},

  abstract     = {Multi-fidelity models are of great importance due to their capability of fusing information coming from different numerical simulations, surrogates, and sensors. We focus on the approximation of high-dimensional scalar functions with low intrinsic dimensionality. By introducing a low dimensional bias we can fight the curse of dimensionality affecting these quantities of interest, especially for many-query applications. We seek a gradient-based reduction of the parameter space through linear active subspaces or a nonlinear transformation of the input space. Then we build a low-fidelity response surface based on such reduction, thus enabling nonlinear autoregressive multi-fidelity Gaussian process regression without the need of running new simulations with simplified physical models. This has a great potential in the data scarcity regime affecting many engineering applications. In this work we present a new multi-fidelity approach that involves active subspaces and the nonlinear level-set learning method, starting from the preliminary analysis previously conducted (Romor F, Tezzele M, Rozza G.

  abstract     = {The present article proposes a time-domain boundary element method (TDBEM) for the three-dimensional (3D) dissipative wave equation (DWE). Although the fundamental ingredients such as the Green&#39;s function for the 3D DWE have been known for a long time, the details of formulation and implementation for such a 3D TDBEM have been unreported yet to the author&#39;s best knowledge. The present formulation is performed truly in time domain on the basis of the time-dependent Green&#39;s function and results in a marching-on-in-time fashion. The main concern is in the evaluation of the boundary integrals. For this regard, weakly- and removable-singularities are carefully treated. The proposed TDBEM is checked through the numerical examples whose solutions can be obtained semi-analytically by means of the inverse Laplace transform. The results of the present TDBEM are satisfactory to validate its formulation and implementation for Neumann problems. On the other hand, the present formulation based on the ordinary boundary integral equation (BIE) is unstable for Dirichlet problems. The numerical analyses for the non-dissipative case imply that the instability issue can be partially resolved by using the Burton–Miller BIE even in the dissipative case.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the construction of a mean-field homogenization (MFH) surrogate for nonlinear stochastic multiscale analyses of two-phase composites that allows the material response to be studied up to its failure. The homogenized stochastic behavior of the studied unidirectional composite material is first characterized through full-field simulations on stochastic volume elements (SVEs) of the material microstructure, permitting to capture the effect of the microstructural geometric uncertainties on the material response. Then, in order to conduct the stochastic nonlinear multiscale simulations, the microscale problem is substituted by a pressure-dependent MFH reduced order micromechanical model, that is, a MF-ROM, whose properties are identified by an inverse process from the full-field SVE realizations. Homogenized stress-strain curves can be used for the identification process of the nonlinear range, however, a loss of size objectivity is encountered once the strain softening onset is reached. This work addresses this problematic introducing a calibration of the energy release rate obtained with a nonlocal MFH micromechanical model, allowing to scale the variability found on each SVE failure characteristics to the macroscale. The obtained random effective properties are then used as input of a data-driven stochastic model to generate the complete random fields used to feed the stochastic MF-ROM. To show the consistency of the methodology, two MF-ROM constructed from SVEs of two different sizes are successively considered. The performance of the MF-ROM is then verified against an experimental transverse-compression test and against full-field simulations through nonlocal Stochastic Finite Element Method (SFEM) simulations. The implementation of the energy release rate calibration allows to conduct stochastic studies on the failure characteristics of material samples without the need for costly experimental campaigns, paving the way for more complete and affordable virtual testing.},

Increasing crack growth rates are observed for increasing amounts of environmental oxygen in a certain oxygen concentration range, while below and above that range crack growth rates remain approximately constant. A fully coupled chemo-mechanical modeling framework accounting for the degradation of grain boundaries by oxygen has been presented by the authors. In this work, we expand the framework by a moving boundary condition to capture a realistic oxygen flux in grain boundary cracks for both edge cracks connected to the environment and interior cracks. In numerical simulation results, the behavior of the moving boundary condition is shown for intergranular crack propagation through a polycrystal subjected to cyclic loading. Finally, the capabilities of the modeling framework to qualitatively predict the dependence of the average crack growth rate on the environmental oxygen content, load level, and dwell time are evaluated and it is shown that predictions qualitatively agree with experimental observations for intergranular fracture.},

Helmholtz equation for the acoustic problems is solved using the boundary element method, while sensitivities of the objective function with respect to a large number of design variables are calculated via a sensitivity analysis method originated from the adjoint variable method (AVM), and the optimal solution is obtained by the method of moving asymptotes (MMA). Since the traditional single-frequency topology optimization is frequency dependent, that is, the optimal solution at a certain frequency may not be optimal at other frequencies, broadband topology optimization of sound-absorbing materials is conducted in this work. To address the problem of tremendous computational cost due to repetitive calculations at each discrete frequency point during broadband optimization, Taylor expansion of the Hankel function is performed to decouple the frequency dependent and independent terms in the BEM equations. For large-scale problems, a reduced-order model that retains the essential structures and key properties of the original model is built using the second-order Arnoldi (SOAR) method. The accuracy and feasibility of the proposed algorithms are finally validated via some two-dimensional numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {In the context of simulation-based methods, multiple challenges arise, two of which are considered in this work. As a first challenge, problems including time-dependent phenomena with complex domain deformations, potentially even with changes in the domain topology, need to be tackled appropriately. The second challenge arises when computational resources and the time for evaluating the model become critical in so-called many query scenarios for parametric problems. For example, these problems occur in optimization, uncertainty quantification (UQ), or automatic control, and using highly resolved full-order models (FOMs) may become impractical. To address both types of complexity, we present a novel projection-based model order reduction (MOR) approach for deforming domain problems that takes advantage of the time-continuous space-time formulation. We apply it to two examples that are relevant to engineering or biomedical applications and conduct an error and performance analysis. In both cases, we are able to drastically reduce the computational expense for a model evaluation and, at the same time, maintain an adequate accuracy level, each compared to the original time-continuous space-time full-order model (FOM). All in all, this work indicates the effectiveness of the presented MOR approach for deforming domain problems by taking advantage of a time-continuous space-time setting.},

The algorithm also introduces several new features to the existing methods, including: (i) a novel method for determining a reasonable updating step length; (ii) the avoidance of solving an additional “phase one problem” for finding an initial feasible point; and (iii) the proposition of an empirical criterion for detecting infeasibility problems. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been demonstrated through several classic examples derived from geotechnical engineering. The initial two examples show the superior convergence speed of the novel approach compared to existing methods.

The frequency-domain fundamental solutions to the transformed elastodynamic problems are subsequently derived for the two-dimensional (2D) plane-strain state. Based on the fundamental solutions and the elastodynamic reciprocal theorem, the frequency-domain boundary integral equations (BIEs) are established. Then, the BIEs are numerically solved by a collocation method in conjunction with analytical and numerical treatments of the arising singular integrals. To obtain the time-domain dynamic responses, an exponential window method (EWM) is adopted to transform the frequency-domain results to the time-domain solutions. By using the developed boundary element method (BEM), several typical couple-stress elastodynamic problems are numerically investigated and the size-effects are studied by using different values of the length-scale parameter in the CCST. Good agreements between the results obtained by the developed BEM for a tiny length-scale parameter and the corresponding classical BEM results or analytical solutions are achieved, which validates the high accuracy of the present BEM.},

This equilibrium element, using edge tractions as basic variables, is found straightforward to deal with the friction and contact constraints on the contact surface. On the other hand, the Coulomb frictional contact problem is recast into a linear complementarity problem (LCP), with which the algebraic complementarity formulation can be obtained with the help of the constructed equilibrated stress field. A remarkable property of the proposed EFEM is that the equilibrated solution, in conjunction with the compatible solution of the traditional FEM, can provide reliable error estimation for frictional contact within the framework of dual analysis. Numerical examples are finally conducted to see the performance and the ability to reliable error estimation of the proposed EFEM.},

  abstract     = {We propose a parametric sampling strategy for reduction of large scale PDE systems with multidimensional input parametric spaces by leveraging models of different fidelity. The design of this methodology allows a user to adaptively sample points ad hoc from a discrete training set with no prior requirement of error estimators. It is achieved by exploiting low-fidelity models throughout the parametric space to sample points using an efficient sampling strategy, and at the sampled parametric points, high-fidelity models are evaluated to recover the reduced basis functions. The low-fidelity models are then adapted with the reduced order models built by projection onto the subspace spanned by the recovered basis functions. The process continues until the low-fidelity model can represent the high-fidelity model adequately for all the parameters in the parametric space. Since the proposed methodology leverages the use of low-fidelity models to assimilate the solution database, it significantly reduces the computational cost in the offline stage. The highlight of this article is to present the construction of the initial low-fidelity model, and a sampling strategy based on the discrete empirical interpolation method. We test this approach on a 2D steady-state heat conduction problem for two different input parameters and make a qualitative comparison with the classical greedy reduced basis method and with random selection of points. Further, we test the efficacy of the proposed method on a 9-dimensional parametric non-coercive elliptic problem and analyze the computational performance based on different tuning of greedy selection of points.},

  abstract     = {Hilber and Hughes gave several competitive demands on the implicit methods in 1978. However, there are no such integration methods in the traditional algorithm design. Via imposing subsidiary variables, this article proposes two novel implicit methods to splendidly achieve these competitive demands without increasing computational costs. The two novel methods are self-starting, unconditionally stable, single-solve, identically second-order accurate, controllably dissipative, and non-overshooting. The novel methods achieve the maximal dissipation of auxiliary variables in the high-frequency limit, although such the design is not a must. The first novel method uses auxiliary velocity and acceleration variables, whereas the second one employs two auxiliary acceleration variables. After embedding desired numerical characteristics, the novel methods employ four eigenvalues of amplification matrices in the high-frequency limit as user-specified parameters to flexibly control numerical high-frequency dissipation. To reduce the number of use-specified parameters, this article gives some recommended sub-families of algorithms, such as optimal low-frequency dissipation schemes. The article further refines the error analysis to analytically calculate amplitude and phase errors for some implicit methods. The error analysis technique can be applied to almost all direct time integration methods. Comparisons of amplitude and phase errors highlight the superiority of the novel methods over the published algorithms. In addition, some classical measures, such as numerical damping ratios and relative period errors, are analyzed and compared. Numerical examples are solved to show the novel methods&#39; superiority.},

The vast majority of articles concerning this issue are focused on the instabilities that manifest when a material point crosses between background grid cells. However, there are other issues related to the stability of MPMs. This article focuses on the issue of the conditioning of the global system of equations caused by the arbitrary nature of the position of the physical domain relative to the background computational grid. The issue is remedied here via the use of a ghost stabilisation technique that penalises variations in the gradient of the solution field near the boundaries of the physical domain. This technique transforms the stability of the MPM, providing a robust computational framework for large deformation explicit dynamic and implicit quasi -static analysis.},

  abstract     = {The mathematical formulation of constitutive models to describe the path-dependent, that is, inelastic, behavior of materials is a challenging task and has been a focus in mechanics research for several decades. There have been increased efforts to facilitate or automate this task through data-driven techniques, impelled in particular by the recent revival of neural networks (NNs) in computational mechanics. However, it seems questionable to simply not consider fundamental findings of constitutive modeling originating from the last decades research within NN-based approaches. Herein, we propose a comparative study on different feedforward and recurrent neural network architectures to model 1D small strain inelasticity. Within this study, we divide the models into three basic classes: black box NNs, NNs enforcing physics in a weak form, and NNs enforcing physics in a strong form. Thereby, the first class of networks can learn constitutive relations from data while the underlying physics are completely ignored, whereas the latter two are constructed such that they can account for fundamental physics, where special attention is paid to the second law of thermodynamics in this work. Conventional linear and nonlinear viscoelastic as well as elastoplastic models are used for training data generation and, later on, as reference. After training with random walk time sequences containing information on stress, strain, and—for some models—internal variables, the NN-based models are compared to the reference solution, whereby interpolation and extrapolation are considered. Besides the quality of the stress prediction, the related free energy and dissipation rate are analyzed to evaluate the models. Overall, the presented study enables a clear recording of the advantages and disadvantages of different NN architectures to model inelasticity and gives guidance on how to train and apply these models.},

In this paper, we propose a new computational framework called stochastic spectral cell method (SSCM) as a stochastic development of the spectral cell method for uncertainty quantification applied to structural dynamics and wave propagations. The stochastic form of spectral cell method has not been developed yet. Hence, the SSCM is a novel stochastic method comprising the advantages of spectral cell method for computational mechanics considering the geometrical complexity resulting from computer-aided design. The SSCM is established by incorporating the polynomial chaos and Karhunen-Loève expansions for the uncertainty quantification, and the interpolation functions of spectral elements for the spatial discretization. In the SSCM, the numerical solution of the Fredholm integral equation of the second kind required in Karhunen-Loève expansion is obtained using the spectral cell method. The use of Cartesian mesh, diagonal mass matrix, and higher order interpolation functions of spectral elements for stochastic dynamic analysis lead to desirable computational efficiency and accuracy of the SSCM. The capability, effectiveness, and accuracy of the proposed SSCM are demonstrated with several numerical examples of wave propagation as well as dynamic analysis of structures.},

  abstract     = {One of the fundamental but unsolved problems in fracture mechanics of solid materials is how to describe the continuous and discontinuous deformation of continuum in a unified manner. This paper aims to develop a novel nonlocal geometric fracture theory attempting to address this essential issue. Using the concepts of nonlocal calculus, a new nonlocal equation for the deformation of continuum is obtained by minimizing a nonlocal Lagrangian. This is done to ensure that the proposed nonlocal model can be used to describe the continuous and discontinuous deformation of a continuum in a unified geometric manner, as well as to be asymptotically compatible with the classical continuum theory. Inspired by the phase field fracture theory, a nonlocal geometric crack surface functional is proposed to approximate the Griffith fracture energy in continuum. Note, however, that a distinguished feature of the proposed functional is that it enables strong discontinuities appear in the crack phase fields, which is difficult for the phase field fracture theory. After obtaining the nonlocal fracture energy, a nonlocal elastic energy is phenomenologically decomposed into volumetric and deviatoric parts, and then a system of nonlocal geometric fracture equations is derived to describe the damage nucleation, cracks initiation and propagation, which covers the whole physical process of fracture in solid materials. A staggered discontinuous Galerkin method is developed to reach an accurate and stable numerical solution. Numerical examples demonstrate the proposed theory can well capture the transition from the continuous to discontinuous deformation of the continuum and accurately describe the topological evolution of cracks in a unified framework.},

  abstract     = {In this work an efficient algorithm for a fully implicit single crystal plasticity routine including twinning and secondary plasticity is presented and implemented for the example of magnesium. The material model uses the volume fraction transfer scheme for the evolution of twinning, that is, plastic slip in newly formed twins (“secondary plasticity”) is resolved. This is considered particularly important, if the volume fractions of some twins reach the order of magnitude of the parent phase. However the resolution of secondary plasticity also implies a large number of unknowns, which is significantly reduced by a newly proposed algorithm. For magnesium a hardening model based on basal, prismatic, pyramidal a and pyramidal c+a slip modes as well as a tension and a compression twinning mode and yields a total of 18 slip systems and 12 twinning systems. As a special feature of the proposed algorithm, the total amount of 246 unknowns, due to simultaneous slip in the parent phase and the twinned phases, is reduced to only 31 unknowns. Additionally, thermodynamic consistency is ensured by including the second law with the Clausius–Duhem equation, which considers the change of free energy upon twinning as an additional driving force for twinning. Further, the setup of the time discrete nonlinear equation system using midpoint rule, as well as the analytical solution of the algorithmic tangent are given in detail. Finally, the implemented model is tested in finite element simulations and compared to single- and polycrystal compression and tension experiments.},

To achieve this, the algorithm is proposed by (1) imposing consistent normalization conditions for both left and right eigenvectors throughout the computational system, and (2) solving sensitivity problems using the chain rule. These contributions add significant value to the proposed method. Additionally, the numerical difficulty is overcome by suggesting justifying Nelson (1976)&#39;s technique based on the normalization conditions. Even though the proposed algorithm is simple and easy to implement, the employment of chain rule with new normalization in this note has never been reported in the literature, especially for the problem of eigensensitivity. Because this new algorithm does not require the second-order derivatives of the eigenequations, the analytical and numerical solutions for eigensensitivity offered by this method are less complicated than existing available solutions. The validity and applicability of the method are demonstrated through five numerical examples, showcasing its implementation in displacement- and state-space equations (rotordynamic system). Also, verifications are found to be in reasonable agreement with the approximated method.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new approach which uses the tools within artificial intelligence (AI) software libraries as an alternative way of solving partial differential equations (PDEs) that have been discretised using standard numerical methods. In particular, we describe how to represent numerical discretisations arising from the finite volume and finite element methods by pre-determining the weights of convolutional layers within a neural network. As the weights are defined by the discretisation scheme, no training of the network is required and the solutions obtained are identical (accounting for solver tolerances) to those obtained with standard codes often written in Fortran or C++. We also explain how to implement the Jacobi method and a multigrid solver using the functions available in AI libraries. For the latter, we use a U-Net architecture which is able to represent a sawtooth multigrid method. A benefit of using AI libraries in this way is that one can exploit their built-in technologies to enable the same code to run on different computer architectures (such as central processing units, graphics processing units or new-generation AI processors) without any modification. In this article, we apply the proposed approach to eigenvalue problems in reactor physics where neutron transport is described by diffusion theory. For a fuel assembly benchmark, we demonstrate that the solution obtained from our new approach is the same (accounting for solver tolerances) as that obtained from the same discretisation coded in a standard way using Fortran. We then proceed to solve a reactor core benchmark using the new approach. For both benchmarks we give timings for the neural network implementation run on a CPU and a GPU, and a serial Fortran code run on a CPU.},

In addition, the space-time regulating factor is defined and added to the conventional schemes to improve the stability of numerical methods. The modified approaches are resulted in a simple and effective time-marching process which can achieve long-time simulation, resting on the property that the coefficient matrices generated by these two methods are only related to the space-time distance between the collocation points and source points.

Domain integral terms arising from the use of frequency-independent fundamental solutions are handled with the radial integration method (RIM) and dual reciprocity method (DRM), respectively. The results show the lower precision in high frequency domain of using RIM to handle domain integral terms than that of using DRM, which can be solved by increasing Gauss point. The B-spline wavelet on the interval and wavelet coefficients are applied to approximate the physical boundary conditions. It is proved that coupling conditions between matrix and scatterers and Bloch theorem are also applicable to wavelet coefficients. Some small matrix entries generated by wavelet vanishing moment characteristics are truncated by the provided matrix compression technique, and the influence of compressed matrices on the results is studied.

Local reduced spaces are constructed by solving an oversampling problem with random boundary conditions. Herein, we inform the boundary conditions by a global reduced problem and compare our approach using physically meaningful correlated samples with existing approaches using uncorrelated samples. The local spaces are designed such that the local contribution of each subdomain can be coupled in a conforming way, which also preserves the sparsity pattern of standard finite element assembly procedures. Several numerical experiments show the accuracy and efficiency of the method, as well as its potential to reduce the size of the local spaces and the number of training samples compared to the uncorrelated sampling.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a Minkowski difference-based advancing front approach is proposed to generate convex and non-circular particles in a predefined computational domain. Two specific algorithms are developed to handle the contact conformity of generated particles with the boundaries of the computational domain. The first, called the open form, is used to handle the smooth contact of generated particles with (external) boundaries, while the other, called the closed form, is proposed to handle the internal boundaries of a computational domain with a complex cavity. The Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) method is used to efficiently solve the contact detection between the newly generated particle at the front and existing particles. Furthermore, the problem of one-sided particle lifting, which can cause some defects in the packing structure in existing advancing front methods during packing generation, is highlighted and an effective solution is developed. Several examples of increasing complexity are used to demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed packing generation approach. The numerical results show that the generated packing is not only more uniform, but also achieves a higher packing density than existing advancing front methods.},

  abstract     = {Physics-informed neural network (PINN) has been widely concerned for its higher computational accuracy compared with conventional neural network. The merit of PINN mainly comes from its ability to embed known physical laws or equations into data-based neural networks. However, when dealing with the rate-dependent nonlinear problems, such as elasto-plasticity with loading and unloading and hypoelastic large deformation, the conventional PINN cannot obtain satisfactory results. In this article, a stepwise physics-informed neural network (sPINN) is proposed to solve large deformation problems of hypoelastic materials. The whole process of sPINN can be divided into a series of time steps. In each time step, the rate constitutive equation expressed by Hughes-Winget algorithm and momentum governing equation are incorporated into the loss function as physical constraints. The displacement and stress fields can be resolved by completing the training process of each time step. Three numerical examples are designed to validate the proposed method by comparing with the solutions of FEM. The results show that sPINN can accurately resolve the displacement and stress fields in path-dependent large deformation problems. Furthermore, the performance of the sPINN on small data sets are also discussed, which illustrates that sPINN is more capable of predicting the global solution on small data sets as compared with conventional artificial neural network.},

Coupled via the HDG technique, our method enables local refinement by uniform simplicial subdivision of each macro-element. By enforcing one spatial discretization for all macro-elements, we arrive at local problems per macro-element that are embarrassingly parallel, yet well balanced. Therefore, our macro-element variant scales efficiently to n-node clusters and can be tailored to available hardware by adjusting the local problem size to the capacity of a single node, while still using moderate polynomial orders such as quadratics or cubics. Increasing the local problem size means simultaneously decreasing, in relative terms, the global problem size, hence effectively limiting the proliferation of degrees of freedom. The global problem is solved via a matrix-free iterative technique that also heavily relies on macro-element local operations. We investigate and discuss the advantages and limitations of the macro-element HDG method via an advection-diffusion model problem.},

In the algorithm&#39;s equation, an appropriate truncated series of the solution functions was replaced. To tackle the issue, this study uses a series expansion of an unidentified function, where this function is approximated using a neural architecture.

VMS modeling requires the approximation of the impact of the fine-scales in terms of the coarse-scales. In linear problems, our formulation reduces the problem of learning the subscales to learning the projected element Green&#39;s function basis coefficients. For this approximation, a special neural-network structure—the variational super-resolution N-N (VSRNN)—is proposed. The VSRNN constructs a super-resolution model of the unresolved scales as a sum-of-the-products of individual functions of coarse-scales and physics-informed parameters. Combined with a set of locally nondimensional features obtained by normalizing the input coarse-scale and output subscale basis coefficients, the VSRNN provides a general framework for the discovery of closures for different Galerkin discretizations. By training it on a sequence of projected data and using the subscale to compute the continuous Galerkin subgrid terms, and the super-resolved state to compute the discontinuous Galerkin fluxes, we improve the optimality and the accuracy of these methods for the convection-diffusion and linear advection problems. Finally, we demonstrate that the VSRNN allows generalization to out-of-sample initial conditions and nondimensional numbers.},

  abstract     = {Fractured media have been extensively studied due to their significant impact on hydraulic properties of subsurface systems. However, accurately modeling and simulating flow and transport in complex 3D fractured media still remains a challenge. For this purpose, this work aims to develop a new 3D modeling approach and investigate flow and mass transport in fractured media. First, a modeling approach is presented for generating 3D complex structures and high quality finite element grids. This approach allows for the presence of a range of complex geometries, including curved fracture, multiple fractures and the coexistence of fracture-inclusions. The resulting models and grids are of high quality, enabling accurate simulation and analysis of complex systems. Furthermore, stress-dependent aperture and roughness are integrated in the computational scheme using Barton–Bandis law. The Galerkin finite element method is used for numerical discretization, then pressure and concentration are calculated in a unified formulation. Later, numerical tests are performed to analyze the role of 3D fractures in flow and mass transport. Simulation results show that fractures have a larger impact on pressure distribution and flow rate compared to inclusions. Fracture roughness increases the aperture then the effective conductivity is improved as well. Curved fractures may reduce flow rate more than planar fractures due to the tortuosity effect. The variation of equivalent permeability tensor is analyzed with varying orientation, roughness, and number of fractures. The impact of stress and fracture roughness causes a variation of fracture permeability and a high pressure gradient on the fracture-matrix interface, resulting in different patterns of concentration evolution. Overall, this investigation provides insights into the role of 3D fractures in subsurface flow and transport, with implications for various applications.},

The conventional assumption of constant material properties (CMPs) is broken through with the full consideration of temperature-dependent material properties (TDMPs) including thermal conductivity, elastic tensor, and coefficient of thermal expansion. Nonlinear heat conduction is thus implemented to give varying temperature fields in thermoelasticity. The maximum displacement of the specified region is taken as the objective function in the formulation of the optimization problem. The Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser (KS) function is employed to approximate the regional maximum displacement/temperature. Corresponding sensitivity analyses, which are carried out using the adjoint method, theoretically reveal how TDMPs affect the thermo-elastic optimization problem. Typical numerical examples are investigated to validate the proposed approach. The results show that the use of TDMPs produces optimized structures of high fidelity with displacements precisely predicted and temperature constraints rigorously satisfied under large temperature gradient, while thermo-elastic analysis and optimization with CMPs lead to undesirable designs with significant inaccuracy.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an uncertainty analysis method for systems with hybrid stochastic and fuzzy uncertainty parameters based on polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). Parameters in the system are described by probability boxes, interval numbers, and fuzzy sets, respectively, based on the differences in their limited stochastic knowledge. First, this method transforms the uncertain parameters into standard normal distribution and interval variables through equal probability transformation or α $$ \alpha $$ -cut operations. Second, the Legendre and Hermite polynomials are used as the PCE model&#39;s primary functions, and the expansion coefficients are calculated by the Galerkin projection method based on sparse grid numerical integration. Then, the system response bounds under the pre-defined confidence level can be obtained using a genetic algorithm to solve the optimization problem constructed based on PCE models. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the method are illustrated by taking the tank bi-directional stabilized system and the double-pendulum-controlled system as examples. The numerical results show that the system response bounds obtained by the PCE model optimization algorithm are consistent with the Monte Carlo simulation. Still, the computational efficiency is much higher. The proposed method effectively combines fuzzy sets and probability boxes and dramatically simplifies the analysis process of uncertain systems. The method exhibits fine precision even in high-dimensional uncertainty analysis problems.},

Both contact boundaries are treated as Neumann conditions, where the prescribed contact force is calculated using a penalty law, which is linearised and updated within the iterative solution procedure. Compared to the currently available explicit treatment, the implicit treatment offers better efficiency for the same accuracy. This is achieved with the proposed implicit linearisation, which replaces the explicit under-relaxation of the contact force. The proposed procedure, intended for frictionless contact of Hookean solids, can handle non-conformal contact interface discretisations and faces in partial contact. The accuracy and efficiency of the implicit approach are compared with the explicit procedure on four benchmark problems, where it is shown that the proposed method can significantly improve efficiency and robustness.},

  abstract     = {The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is successfully employed in a variety of projection-based methods for parametric model order reduction (pMOR) of large dynamical systems. It extracts the most energetic modes describing the dynamics of a system from time snapshots of the solution. In practice, these snapshots are computed at user-defined parameters of the system with a high fidelity model. Then either all the snapshots are concatenated to extract a global POD basis, or a different POD basis is extracted for each parameter value. In the latter case, for unseen target parameters, the POD bases need to be adapted with a dedicated technique. An established method addressing this task is the interpolation on the tangent space to the Grassmann manifold (ITSGM). It interpolates the linear subspaces spanned by the known POD bases, discarding by construction the knowledge on the modes ordering by energy levels. In this paper, we formalize an ordered reduced basis interpolation (ORBI) technique which preserves such ordering. This approach improves the adaptation accuracy of the resulting POD basis as more information is taken into account in the construction of the interpolation operator. Numerical investigations are conducted on the parametric reduced order model of a dynamical system representing a small-scale gas-bearings supported rotor. Results show that the proposed method is more accurate than the ITSGM method at a similar computation cost. Trained at only three points of the parameters space, the developed hyper reduced order model (h-ROM) performs to faster simulations with satisfactory accuracy, even far from the training points.},

Spurious buckling modes may appear in low density regions, a well-known and largely discussed phenomenon. However, localized modes may also appear in solid areas, where stress concentrations occur. This second phenomenon, which is due to the inherent limitations of the linearized buckling analysis when used for complex stress states, is hardly addressed in the topology optimization literature. The remedy we propose makes use of elementary operations in the topology optimization framework: filtering and erosion, but now applied to the stress field. We show how this simple strategy helps mitigating the occurrence of spurious modes, in turn regularizing the optimization process towards high performance designs, which are then verified by nonlinear analysis.},

In this paper, we propose a mixed three-field total Lagrangian material point method (TLMPM) to deal with the fracture of nearly incompressible rubber-like solids. In this method, the phase-field method combining with perturbed Lagrangian approach is developed to describe the fracture of nearly incompressible materials. Based on the Lagrangian equation, the governing equations of the displacement, pressure and phase fields are derived for the system considering dynamic effect. Then, a mixed three-field TLMPM discrete formulation with a remapping strategy is then built to solve the problem involving large deformation. Besides, a staggered solving scheme with explicit time integration is developed for the three-field problem. The accuracy and capabilities of the proposed method for dealing with the fracture of incompressible materials are demonstrated by modeling several quasi-static and dynamic numerical problems and comparing the results with other numerical methods and experiments. Moreover, the applicability of the method is further proved by an out-of-plane tearing case.},

The sensitivity filtering technique is widely adopted to avoid numerical instabilities. Because the filtered sensitivity values are recalculated from the normalized density values and the sensitivity values from within a fixed range of neighborhoods, the values are sometimes completely different from the original ones. Thus, the idea of the CSFM is to control the change of filtered sensitivity values based on the previous iterations. By controlling the changes of filtered sensitivity values within certain limitation, optimal layouts can be obtained with lower compliance and the computational expenses can also be reduced in comparison to that by conventional topology optimization. The computational expense with CSFM topology optimization could be reduced by up to 85%. The numerical examples established that CSFM topology optimization has improved the numerical efficiency and effectiveness.},

In practice, a predictor/corrector algorithm is developed. The predictor step consists of a linearized mechanical resolution, which is obtained by considering the scalar generalized viscoplastic strain rate as an inherent strain rate, deduced from resolutions performed during previous time steps. The corrector step consists of a local (e.g., in each finite element) reconstruction of the effective stress field by solving a local nonlinear scalar equation. This predictor/corrector strategy is employed to deal with the dynamic evolution of strain rates and stress, during the distinct stages of the process: deposition, inter-layer dwell time, and final cooling. With the proposed method, a time gain of around 5 is obtained for both a single wall and a curved turbine blade mock-up, while the results (distortion and stress) of the full nonlinear thermomechanical resolution are replicated with an excellent accuracy. This makes the new inherent strain rate method a very promising tool for additive manufacturing simulation.},

Thus, controlling the maximum temperature of used material within a safe range is of great significance to the safe operation of thermal structures. In this article, a density-based multi-material topology optimization method for transient thermal structures is proposed, in which the maximal temperature for each material is controlled not greater than its permissible temperature. In this method, a projection algorithm based on the PDE (partial differential equation) filter and Heaviside projection is set up and used to identify the domains occupied by each material. The maximal temperature of each specific material occupying domain is approximately expressed by the condensed integrals in the time and space domains. The permissible temperature constraint is satisfied by controlling the condensed integrals not great than a specific threshold value (depending on the corresponding material&#39;s permissible temperature). Several examples illustrate that the permissible temperature plays an important role in the selection and the distribution scheme of the candidate materials for the design of multi-material thermal structures. The proposed method can effectively control the maximal temperature of each material within its constraint range, and achieve the rational design for multi-material thermal structures. In addition, different thermal loading time may also lead to different material selection of structure. This work has potential applications in the lightweight design of thermal insulation structures.},

In this work, we generalize CAS elements to remove shear and membrane locking from quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of linear plane curved Timoshenko rods. CAS elements are an assumed strain treatment that interpolates the shear and membrane strains at the knots using linear Lagrange polynomials. Consequently, the inter-element continuity of the shear and membrane strains is maintained. The numerical experiments considered in this work show that CAS elements excise the spurious oscillations in shear and membrane forces caused by shear and membrane locking. Furthermore, when using CAS elements with either full or reduced integration, the convergence of displacements, rotations, and stress resultants is independent of the slenderness ratio up to while the convergence is highly dependent on the slenderness ratio when using NURBS elements. We apply the locking treatment of CAS elements to quadratic -continuous NURBS and the resulting element type is named discontinuous-assumed-strain (DAS) elements. Comparisons among CAS and DAS elements show that once locking is properly removed, continuity across element boundaries results in higher accuracy than continuity across element boundaries. Lastly, CAS elements result in a simple numerical scheme that does not add any significant computational burden in comparison with the locking-prone NURBS-based discretization of the Galerkin method.},

Meanwhile, the energy representation of physical system can be treated as the loss function for machine learning methods. Therefore, a nonlocal energy-informed neural network is constructed to approximate the solution of the system. A distinct advantage of the proposed neural network is that the strain energy is expressed in terms of spatial integration instead of spatial derivatives, which avoids the invalidation of automatic differentiation at the crack surfaces in original physics-informed neural networks. To demonstrate the convergence and accuracy of the proposed neural network, a series of problems in solid and fracture mechanics are conducted, and compared with results from analytical solutions or classical numerical methods. Additionally, for elastic material containing initial cracks, displacement extrapolation method is encoded into the proposed neural network to evaluate the static stress intensity factor.},

  abstract     = {A novel artificial boundary method called the scaled boundary perfectly matched layer (SBPML) is proposed for the transient analysis of elastic wave propagation in unbounded domains. This method constructs a generalized perfectly matched layer (PML) around the finite interior subdomain based on a coordinate transformation inspired by the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM). It can model the infinite exterior subdomains of heterogeneous materials, featuring both parallel and radial straight-line physical surfaces and interfaces. In addition, generally-shaped (even nonconvex-shape) artificial boundaries can be used to provide high flexibility in choosing the geometry of the finite interior subdomain. Two coordinate mapping technologies, namely the modified scaled boundary coordinate transformation from the SBFEM and the complex coordinate stretching from the PML, are successively utilized to construct the proposed method. By introducing the integral of stress as an auxiliary variable, the resulting SBPML subdomain is represented in the time domain using a mixed displacement-stress unsplit-field formulation. This has the added benefit of allowing for easy incorporation into standard dynamic finite element methods. The performance of the SBPML is demonstrated through several numerical examples, including P-SV and SH wave propagation problems occurring in unbounded domains with complex geometries and heterogeneous material properties. The numerical results are evaluated in comparison to both reference solution and existing artificial boundary methods, ultimately demonstrating the flexibility, robustness, accuracy, and stability of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The fracture problem of elastoplastic materials is an insistent challenge. It is difficult to implement the fracture simulations of elastoplastic materials in peridynamics (PD), especially in the bond-based peridynamic (BB–PD) framework. The core issue is how to introduce non-linear constitutive relationships into BB–PD model. To address this issue, an incremental form of BB–PD model was originally proposed. In the proposed model, a rapid strain identification technique was established. Based on this technique, the constitutive relationship is related to the deformation and the incremental bond force equation is formulated in a unified form. In addition, a fracture criterion controlled by energy was derived to implement plastic fracture simulations. Several numerical examples, including five elastoplastic deformation analyses and three quasi-static and dynamic fractures, were implemented to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed model. The results show that the proposed model can accurately analyze the deformation of elastoplastic problems, especially plastic deformation. The numerical examples also demonstrate the fracture prediction capability of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {This work proposes a moving morphable component (MMC)-based topology optimization approach for designing graded lattice flexoelectric nanostructures, which are generally considered to have better flexoelectric properties. To this end, the infill structure is described with the use of a set of components. A coordinate perturbation is made to the topology description functions of the components to achieve a graded distribution of the flexoelectric materials. Resorting to the explicit parameters of the components, the singular disconnected structure can be naturally controlled with the use of lower/upper bound constraints. To ensure the continuity in the approximation of the PDEs of flexoelectricity, an ersatz material model is developed by combining isogeometric analysis (IGA) with MMC. Since MMC provides definite feature sizes in the optimization result, the complicated infill lattice can be manufactured by additive manufacturing directly. The flexoelectric performances of the design results from the proposed approach are demonstrated through both numerical examples and experimental measurements. It is shown that the obtained novel infill lattice structures have better flexoelectric performance when compared with traditional structural configurations.},

Uncertainty propagation concerns material and geometrical design parameters of particulate composites and is performed thanks to an application of polynomial responses; probabilistic moments of the effective tensor are computed via the iterative generalized stochastic perturbation technique and the semi-analytical probabilistic method. Probabilistic entropy is determined according to Shannon theory, while relative entropies equations employed here follow mathematical models created by Kullback &amp; Leibler, Jeffreys, Hellinger, and Bhattacharyya.

The proposed method greatly simplifies the conventional computation procedure for thermal flows past porous bodies by unifying the governing equations for the flow and temperature fields in both the porous and fluid domains. This is achieved by introducing a diffuse layer, across which the variation of the flow properties including its thermal features are expected to be smooth. Also, the developed method can be applied on either uniform or nonuniform grid since the numerical fluxes are locally reconstructed by LBFS at cell interfaces. In addition, the boundary conditions for both the flow and temperature fields at the porous-fluid interface with complex shape can be implemented through IBM in a simple way. The proposed method is validated by several numerical examples over wide ranges of thermal parameters from forced convection to mixed convection. Excellent agreements are obtained for all simulations, including the one with severe temperature gradient in the thin temperature boundary layer at , which demonstrates the capabilities of the proposed method.},

Three optimal families of three-sub-step implicit algorithms are developed to achieve second, third, and fourth-order accuracy. The present second- and third-order methods achieve identical effective stiffness matrices, thus embedding optimal spectral characteristics. Besides, both of them impose two dissipative parameters ( ρ 2 ∞ $$ {\rho}_2^{\infty } $$ and ρ 3 ∞ $$ {\rho}_3^{\infty } $$ ) to control numerical dissipation imposed in the second and third sub-steps. The parameter ρ 3 ∞ $$ {\rho}_3^{\infty } $$ adjusts overall numerical dissipation in the whole integration schemes, while the firstly used parameter ρ 2 ∞ $$ {\rho}_2^{\infty } $$ can change numerical dissipation in the second sub-step. The numerical example has shown the superiority of controlling middle sub-step dissipation via . The present fourth-order method is moderately dissipative due to achieving higher-order accuracy, but it presents a more reasonable sub-step division than the published fourth-order three-sub-step trapezoidal rule. Linear and nonlinear examples are simulated to show the numerical performance and superiority of the three novel methods.

Two formulations, based on two strong forms of the Stokes problem, and using different mixed variables, are presented. Particular attention is paid to the symmetry of the resulting system of global equations, and a simple rewriting of the interface boundary condition is proposed to ensure that one of the formulations preserves the symmetry of the linear system that is usually lost when considering material interfaces. Four numerical examples are considered to test the implementation numerically by performing mesh convergence studies, in two and three dimensions. The examples account for discontinuous viscosity as well as the effect of surface tension. The results show that one of the formulations is less sensitive to the numerical stabilisation used in FCFV methods but does not preserve the symmetry of the global system, whereas the other formulation is more sensitive to the stabilisation, but preserves the symmetry of the resulting system of equations. The FCFV method appears as a promising alternative for the simulation of viscous flow involving internal boundaries on conformal meshes. The potential application of the FCFV method for the purpose of geodynamic modelling is discussed.},

On the other hand, Carrera Unified Formulation (CUF) allows one to use one-dimensional high-order finite elements, resulting in excellent accuracy while improving computational efficiency. To address the high computational cost of solving fracture problems, a coupling technique between these two theories is necessary. Various approaches have been proposed to couple peridynamic grids with finite element meshes in the literature. However, most of these approaches are affected by arbitrary choices of blending functions and tuning parameters or exhibit spurious effects at the interfaces. To overcome these issues, we propose a simple coupling technique based on overlapping PD/CUF regions and continuity of the displacement field at the interfaces. This approach is verified through static analysis of classical beams and thin-walled structures with applications in the aerospace industry.},

The discrete approximation combines ED-FEM for concrete crack representation in each element and X-FEM representation of bond-slip along a particular reinforcement bar. The uncertain model parameters are modeled as random variables and identified via Bayesian inference with the help of observations from tensile tests on concrete tie beams with a single embedded reinforcement bar.

We propose a new variant, the embedded Trefftz discontinuous Galerkin method, which is the Galerkin projection of an underlying discontinuous Galerkin method onto a subspace of Trefftz-type. The subspace can be described in a very general way and to obtain it no Trefftz functions have to be calculated explicitly, instead the corresponding embedding operator is constructed. In the simplest cases the method recovers established Trefftz discontinuous Galerkin methods. But the approach allows to conveniently extend to general cases, including inhomogeneous sources and non-constant coefficient differential operators. We introduce the method, discuss implementational aspects and explore its potential on a set of standard PDE problems. Compared to standard discontinuous Galerkin methods we observe a severe reduction of the globally coupled unknowns in all considered cases, reducing the corresponding computing time significantly. Moreover, for the Helmholtz problem we even observe an improved accuracy similar to Trefftz discontinuous Galerkin methods based on plane waves.},

The resulting formulation is similar to the finite element method where each field variable is interpolated by the same set of shape functions in parametric space and differs only in the integration of the stiffness and mass matrices. Well-established finite element procedures can be applied with the developed shape functions, to solve a variety of engineering problems including, for example, coupled field problems, phase field fracture, and addressing volumetric locking in the near-incompressibility limit by adopting a mixed formulation.

The classical Cahn–Hilliard equation does not satisfy the maximum principle; hence the order parameter can be shifted out of the minimum values of the double-well potential. We adopt a high-order polynomial potential to diminish this effect and employ the efficient linear convex splitting scheme. Since the stabilizing factor gradually increases as the degree of potential becomes greater, we modify a non-physical part of potential as a fourth-order polynomial to reduce the stabilizing factor. Numerical results as well as theoretical results demonstrate the accuracy and energy stability of our method. Furthermore, we verify that some limitations arising from applications of the classical Cahn–Hilliard model can be resolved by adopting a high-order free energy.},

In this paper, we propose a simple method to construct accurate ABCs for peridynamic scalar wave-type problems in viscous media.

Consequently, their implementation is relatively simple, since no derivatives of the wave field are required. The proposed ABCs are derived at the continuum level, from a semi-analytical solution of the exterior domain using harmonic exponential basis functions in space and time (plane-wave modes). The numerical implementation is done using a meshfree collocation approach employed within a boundary layer adjacent to the interior domain boundary. The modes satisfy the peridynamic numerical dispersion relation, resulting in a compatible solution of the interior region (near-field) with that of the exterior region (far-field). The accuracy and stability of the proposed ABCs are demonstrated with several numerical examples in two-dimensional unbounded domains.},

  abstract     = {A partitioned/combined computational method based on Newmark scheme is proposed to analyze dynamic systems with different temporal scales and element scales. To effectively filter spurious high-frequency vibration content and retain the second-order accuracy simultaneously, Generalized- α schemes are investigated and incorporated into the proposed method. The proposed method can decompose a complete domain into several independent computational subdomains (≥3), and several independent substructures can be combined into a complete computational structure. The accuracy and stability of responses in different subdomains can be ensured and adjusted by using their own integration parameters and time-step sizes. The energy conservation property is preserved in the proposed method. Only one calculation is performed at each time step for all subdomains, and computational information exchange between subdomains is only conducted at the system time step, therefore, the computational efficiency is improved significantly compared with the existing multi-time-step methods. The derivation process and theoretical demonstration of the proposed method are given in detail. Two representative examples, namely, a single degree of freedom system split into four subdomains and a sandwich beam subjected to high-frequency impact loads, are studied to systematically demonstrate the proposed method&#39;s accuracy, energy properties, and efficiency compared with the existing multi-time-step methods.},

  abstract     = {A new computational framework for large strain elasticity in principal stretches is presented. Distinct from existing literature, the proposed formulation makes direct use of principal stretches rather than their squares that is, eigenvalues of Cauchy-Green strain tensor. The proposed framework has three key features. First, the eigen-decomposition of the tangent elasticity and initial (geometric) stiffness operators is obtained in closed-form from principal information alone. Crucially, these newly found eigenvalues describe the general convexity conditions of isotropic hyperelastic energies. In other words, convexity is postulated concisely through tangent eigenvalues supplementing the original work of Ball ( Arch Ration Mech Anal . 1976; 63(4): 337–403). Consequently, this novel finding opens the door for designing efficient automated Newton-style algorithms with stabilised tangents via closed-form semipositive definite projection or spectral shifting that converge irrespective of mesh resolution, quality, loading scenario and without relying on path-following techniques. A critical study of closed-form tangent stabilisation in the context of isotropic hyperelasticity is therefore undertaken in this work. Second, in addition to high order displacement-based formulation, mixed Hu-Washizu variational principles are formulated in terms of principal stretches by introducing stretch work conjugate Lagrange multipliers that enforce principal stretch-stress compatibility. This is similar to enhanced strain methods. However, the resulting mixed finite element scheme is cost-efficient, specially compared to approximating the entire strain tensors since the formulation is in the scalar space of singular values. Third, the proposed framework facilitates simulating rigid and stiff systems and those that are nearly-inextensible in principal directions, a constituent of elasticity that cannot be easily studied using standard formulations.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an efficient nonlinear stochastic finite element method to solve stochastic elastoplastic problems. Similar to deterministic elastoplastic problems, we describe history-dependent stochastic elastoplastic behavior utilizing a series of (pseudo) time steps and go further to solve the corresponding stochastic solutions. For each time step, the original stochastic elastoplastic problem is considered as a time-independent nonlinear stochastic problem with initial values given by stochastic displacements, stochastic strains, and internal variables of the previous time step. To solve the stochastic solution at each time step, the corresponding nonlinear stochastic problem is transformed into a set of linearized stochastic finite element equations by means of finite element discretization and a stochastic Newton linearization, while the stochastic solution at each time step is approximated by a sum of the products of random variables and deterministic vectors. Each couple of the random variable and the deterministic vector is also used to approximate the stochastic solution of the corresponding linearized stochastic finite element equation that can be solved via a weakly intrusive method. In this method, the deterministic vector is computed by solving deterministic linear finite element equations, and corresponding random variables are solved by a non-intrusive method. Further, the proposed method avoids the curse of dimensionality successfully since its computational effort does not increase dramatically as the stochastic dimensionality increases. Four numerical cases are used to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method.},

The principle renders the discretized boundary-value problem into an equivalent second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem that can be resolved in mathematical programming using the advanced optimization algorithm—the interior point method. In such a way, the developed method not only inherits admirable features of the SOCP-based finite element method in solving elastoplastic problems but also enables the enforcement of absorbing layers (i.e., Caughey absorbing layer), which is essential in modeling stress wave propagation problems, to absorb wave energy. The proposed scheme is validated via the comparison between analytical and numerical results for seismic wave propagation in dissipative media. Its application to elastoplastic dynamic problems with stress wave propagation is also illustrated to demonstrate its efficiency.},

Geometric verification shows that the distance regularization scheme keeps the level set function near the structural boundary as an approximate signed distance function. Based on benchmark example of the cantilever beam, it is verified that the DRPLSM can avoid the re-initialization of level set function in the optimization process and obtain smooth structural boundary. The DRPLSM is applied to multicomponent concurrent topology optimization with partially shared design domain for the first time. It makes the optimization results have smooth structural boundaries. The optimization objective of this algorithm is to minimize the structural compliance of all components. The sharing domain is divided into different design domains according to the strain energy of elements. The optimality of the proposed algorithm for partitioning the sharing domain is verified using the literature example with known optimal solutions. A symmetric structure example, a main and auxiliary optimization structure example and an example with design-dependent boundary loads show that the proposed concurrent optimization algorithm has wide applicability.},

Furthermore, a high performance-to-weight ratio can be attained by utilizing porous composites. However, hygral and thermally induced loads are limiting the robustness of polymeric and natural composite materials, therefore; in this research, concurrent multiscale multiphysics topology optimization is used to design lightweight porous composite structures that have resilience toward mechanical as well as hygral and thermal loads. By establishing two independent representations of the design problem, that is, macro and microscale domains, a concurrent topology optimization framework is implemented, and the effective properties of the microscale (i.e., elastic, thermal conductivity, moisture diffusivity tensors, and hygral as well as thermal expansion coefficients) are calculated and used as the hygro-thermo-elastic properties of the macroscale using in-house MATLAB codes. For hygral physics, moisture transport, as well as evaporation, are simultaneously considered in this study. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on the multiphysics concurrent optimization scheme in order to account for the coupling of macro and microstructure, as well as hygro-thermo-elastic physics. Multiple numerical cases were examined, which included different loading and boundary conditions, as well as various spatial configurations. The results showed attaining a high stiffness-to-weight ratio for the multiscale optimized porous structure compared to the single-scale solid structure. Furthermore, a study was conducted on multiple microstructure subsystems to examine the impact of microstructure systems on macrostructure dependence. By combining several microstructures into a single macro design domain, design flexibility was enhanced and the performance-to-weight ratio was improved. The study was expanded to include the evaluation of hygro-thermo-elastic multiscale multiphysics with an evaporation problem, which was demonstrated through several numerical examples. The introduced formulations showed a successful application of the concurrent multiscale optimization formulations and good coupling on the macro and microscale. Also, the formulations demonstrated a strong influence between the macro and the microscale of the design problem for the topology optimization methods. The successful application of the concurrent multiscale optimization method in this research highlights its potential for designing more efficient and effective structures in the future.},

The underlying discretization scheme was subsequently identified as an approach based on trigonometric polynomials, coupled to the trapezoidal rule to substitute full integration. For problems with smooth solutions, the power of spectral methods is well-known. However, for heterogeneous microstructures, there are jumps in the coefficients, and the solution fields are not smooth enough due to discontinuities across material interfaces. Previous convergence results only provided convergence of the discretization per se, that is, without explicit rates, and could not explain the effectiveness of the discretization observed in practice. In this work, we provide such explicit convergence rates for the local strain as well as the stress field and the effective stresses based on more refined techniques. More precisely, we consider a class of industrially relevant, discontinuous elastic moduli separated by sufficiently smooth interfaces and show rates which are known to be sharp from numerical experiments. The applied techniques are of independent interest, that is, we employ a local smoothing strategy, utilize Féjer means as well as Bernstein estimates and rely upon recently established superconvergence results for the effective elastic energy in the Galerkin setting. The presented results shed theoretical light on the effectiveness of the Moulinec–Suquet discretization in practice. Indeed, the obtained convergence rates coincide with those obtained for voxel finite element methods, which typically require higher computational effort.},

The resulting discretizations are continuous in space, and continuous or discontinuous in time. In a first test run, all four methods are applied to a linear scalar advection-diffusion model problem. Then, the convergence properties of the time-discontinuous space-time finite element discretizations are studied in numerical experiments. Advection velocity and diffusion coefficient are varied, such that the parabolic case of pure diffusion (heat equation), as well as, the hyperbolic case of pure advection (transport equation) are included in the study. For each model parameter set, the L 2 $$ {L}_2 $$ error at the final time is computed for spatial and temporal element lengths ranging over several orders of magnitude to allow for an individual evaluation of the methods&#39; spatial, temporal, and space-time accuracy. In the parabolic case, particular attention is paid to the influence of time-dependent boundary conditions. Key findings include a spatial accuracy of second order and a temporal accuracy between second and third order. The temporal accuracy tends toward third order depending on how advection-dominated the test case is, on the choice of the specific discretization method, and on the time-(in)dependence and treatment of the boundary conditions. Additionally, the potential of time-continuous simplex space-time finite elements for heat flux computations is demonstrated with a piston ring pack test case and a subtractive manufacturing test case.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new nonlinear non-intrusive reduced-order model (NL-NIROM) that outperforms traditional proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-based reduced order model (ROM). This improvement is achieved through the use of auto-encoder (AE) and self-attention based deep learning methods. The novelty of this work is that it uses stacked auto-encoder (SAE) network to project the original high-dimensional dynamical systems onto a low dimensional nonlinear subspace and predict fluid dynamics using an self-attention based deep learning method. This paper introduces a new model reduction neural network architecture for fluid flow problem, as well as, a linear non-intrusive reduced order model (L-NIROM) based on POD and self-attention mechanism. In the NL-NIROM, the SAE network compresses high-dimensional physical information into several much smaller sized representations in a reduced latent space. These representations are expressed by a number of codes in the middle layer of SAE neural network. Then, those codes at different time levels are trained to construct a set of hyper-surfaces using self-attention based deep learning methods. The inputs of the self-attention based network are previous time levels&#39; codes and the outputs of the network are current time levels&#39; codes. The codes at current time level are then projected back to the original full space by the decoder layers in the SAE network. The capability of the new model, NL-NIROM, is demonstrated through two test cases: flow past a cylinder, and a lock exchange. The results show that the NL-NIROM is more accurate than the popular model reduction method namely POD based L-NIROM.},

  abstract     = {The FE 2 $$ {}^2 $$ computational homogenization method is a predictive multi-scale method without the need for constitutive assumptions and/or potential function postulates at the macro engineering scale. Instead, the effective micro-structural responses are extracted directly from a representative volume element (RVE) underlying each macro point. However, the FE method is still computationally too expensive for most practical uses, since the micro-macro FE coupling is done at each loading step/iteration for the entire domain. To this end, the machine learning method has been utilized in the literature for the offline training of a surrogate model to predict the RVE homogenized response for general loading conditions. In this contribution, the neural network (NN) is incorporated into the macro finite element framework in a non-intrusive manner. This is termed as the FE-NN framework, in analogy to the FE method. In general, online simulations in the FE-NN method is very efficient, with predictions matching closely to those obtained from reference direct numerical simulations (DNS). A bottleneck with the FE-NN framework, however, is the high computational cost associated with the data generation for offline NN model setup. In this paper, focusing on the FE-NN multi-scale framework for non-linear elastic deformation of heterogeneous materials, a sequential training strategy with knowledge transfer is proposed, to enable an efficient offline microscopic NN model setup. For a given target RVE, we first consider a simplified source RVE, where data can be generated rapidly, for the NN pre-training of surrogate model. The pre-trained network parameters are next downloaded to initialize the target NN surrogate model, followed by a fine-tuning training process, using only a small dataset generated by the computationally expensive high-fidelity RVE. The efficiency of the proposed sequential learning method over the conventional NN training, as well as, its excellent predictive capability for multi-scale analyses, are demonstrated for a multi-phase composite material. The proposed FE-NN-KT approach can be implemented easily without complicated pre-processing procedures, since the data generation only involves the standard extraction of effective responses from RVEs, together with a standard NN architecture.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a computationally efficient and straightforward to implement a posteriori error estimator for second-order G/XFEM and FEM approximations. The formulation is based on the recently proposed block-diagonal Zienkiewicz–Zhu (ZZ-BD) a posteriori error estimator. The focus is on linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) problems but the proposed error estimator formulation is general and can be adapted to other types of problems such as those involving material interfaces. The proposed ZZ-BD error estimator is based on a new strategy to recover stress fields from second-order G/XFEM and FEM approximations. This recovery procedure involves locally weighted projections of raw stresses on an approximation space for discontinuous and singular stress fields. The basis functions for these stress approximations are defined using a low-order partition of unity together with polynomial, discontinuous, and singular recovery enrichment functions. These singular enrichments are provided by the gradient of G/XFEM enrichments for LEFM problems and are, thus, available in most G/XFEM implementations. They also lead to a more computationally efficient stress recovery procedure than the one in the original ZZ-BD error estimator. The adopted G/XFEM are optimally convergent with the error in the energy norm of . Numerical experiments show that the error of the recovered stress field converges at the same rate as the discretization error. They also show that the effectivity index of the error estimator is close to the unity and that it provides good local error indicators for mesh adaptivity algorithms. Second-order FEM for elasticity problems is a special case of the G/XFEM adopted here. This is exploited to define a block-diagonal ZZ error estimator for the FEM as a special case of the proposed estimator for the G/XFEM. This brings the computational efficiency, simplicity, and accuracy of the ZZ-BD error estimator, originally developed for the G/XFEM, to second-order standard FEM.},

Anisotropic metamaterial typically has a periodic structure constituted of unit cells, and exhibits highly anisotropic wave propagation based on local resonance induced by its periodic medium. In previous works, design methods for anisotropic metamaterials which shows unusual wave propagation properties have been proposed, though since metamaterials comprised of only a single type of unit cell were in interest, the macroscopic wave propagation properties that could be obtained were limited. Therefore, in the present work, we propose a design method for acoustic structures which are composed of several unit cells, in order to realize waveguides that navigate acoustic waves and achieve complex wave propagation overall. First, we introduce the high-frequency homogenization method, which is capable of evaluating the macroscopic property of periodic structures based on local resonance. We construct a multiscale optimal design method by formulating the macro-scale optimization problem for obtaining the properties required for different unit cells in order to realize the waveguide, along with the micro-scale optimization problem for designing each unit cell based on topology optimization. Numerical examples are introduced to demonstrate the validity of our proposed method.},

Applying a Petrov–Galerkin projection method, we propose a rod finite element formulation where the virtual displacements and rotations as well as the translational and angular velocities are interpolated instead of using the consistent variations and time-derivatives of the introduced interpolation formula. Properties such as the intrinsic absence of locking, preservation of objectivity after discretization and parameterization in terms of a minimal number of nodal unknowns are demonstrated by representative numerical examples in both statics and dynamics.},

More specifically, the linear elasticity model is considered under the small deformations hypothesis, and the elastic body is assumed to be in contact (sliding or with Tresca friction) with a rigid foundation. The mathematical formulations studied are two regularized versions of the original variational inequality: the penalty formulation and the augmented Lagrangian formulation. In order to get the shape derivatives associated to those two non-differentiable formulations, we follow an approach based on directional derivatives introduced in previous works. This allows us to develop a gradient-based topology optimization algorithm, built on these derivatives and a level-set representation of shapes. The algorithm also benefits from a mesh-cutting technique, which gives an explicit representation of the shape at each iteration, and enables us to apply the boundary conditions strongly on the contact zone. The different steps of the method are detailed. Then, to validate the approach, some numerical results on two-dimensional and three-dimensional benchmarks are presented.},

When exposed to hygrothermal conditions, the encapsulant ethylene- co -vinyl acetate (EVA) layers undergo chemical degradation that significantly influences the overall PV performance. Aiming at efficient thermo-mechanical modeling, the coupled displacement-temperature governing equations for the EVA layers are formulated, and its 3D finite element (FE) implementation is derived in detail. Subsequently, the chemical reaction-diffusion processes occurring in the EVA layers are described, and the corresponding numerical implementation is formulated with the consideration of spatial and temporal variation of diffusivity and chemical kinetic rates. Specifically, the thermo-mechanical solution accounting for the heat generation from chemical reactions is projected to the FE model of the reaction-diffusion system in order to determine the kinetic rates and diffusion coefficients for its subsequent analysis. The proposed modeling method is applied to simulate the evolution of reaction-diffusion species at different damp heat tests, and predictions show a very satisfactory agreement with the analytical solution and experimental electroluminescence images taken from the literature. Its capabilities to predict the spatio-temporal variation are demonstrated through the simulation of the humidity freeze test, where the cyclic temperature boundary condition is imposed. With this modeling framework, it is possible to evaluate the degradation of PV modules under varying environmental boundary conditions, thus providing a guideline to design new products tailored for specific climatic zones.},

This approach has minimal impact on the overall accuracy of numerical computations but leads to considerable gains in performance. These outcomes can be justified because the proposed simplified SFM accurately accounts for the area of the fracture surface and prevents the severe mesh dependencies observed in classical cohesive zone models or node-release/element-deletion techniques.

As such, the stress is constrained at each load step. The augmented Lagrangian method is used to formulate the optimization problem with its many constraints. In numerical examples, we investigate different load trajectories for the same terminal load and compare the optimized designs and their performances. The results show the importance of considering the entire load trajectory as the load history significantly influences the optimized designs.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel capsule -based deep encoder–decoder model for surrogate modeling and uncertainty quantification of systems in mechanics from sparse data. The proposed framework is developed by adapting Capsule Network (CapsNet) architecture into an image-to-image regression encoder–decoder network. Specifically, the aim is to exploit the benefits of CapsNet over convolution neural network (CNN) – retaining pose and position information related to an entity to name a few. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated by solving two different variants of elliptic partial differential equations (PDE): a stochastic version without a source term having an input dimensionality of 1024 and a deterministic pressure Poisson equation for flow past a cylinder. The first PDE, that is, the stochastic PDE (SPDE), also governs systems in mechanics such as steady heat conduction, groundwater flow, or other diffusion processes. In this article, the problem definition for this SPDE is such that it does not restrict the random diffusion field to a particular covariance structure, and the more strenuous task of response prediction for an arbitrary diffusion field is solved. Finally, we also evaluate the performance of our model on the uncertainty propagation problem based on this equation. The obtained results from the performance evaluation of the developed model on the mentioned problems indicate that the proposed approach is accurate, data efficient, and robust.},

Complicated by the nonlinear interaction between solid deformation and fluid flow, the underlying correlation between discretization and physical parameters of fluid-driven fracture is still unclear. This work studies this correlation through the dimensionless process of the governing equations that associate the cohesive element and time step sizes in a discrete regime. Three characteristic parameters (i.e., related to crack opening, fluid pressure, and fracture length) are introduced in the derivation, and two dimensionless parameters are proposed to construct the unified criterion. The criterion is validated by numerical tests of toughness-dominated fracture with various conditions including the modulus of solid, injection rate of fluid, fracture energy, and in-situ stress. The proposed criterion determines the spatial and temporal constraints of the cohesive zone model for modeling fluid-driven fracture, which is often treated empirically in previous practices.},

In this paper, two 8-node quadrilateral elements are developed by introducing two different incompatible modes into the unsymmetric formulation. The unsymmetric framework with two different sets of interpolation functions for displacement fields provides the basis for the immunity property. The incompatible displacement mode and the enhanced assumed strain guarantee the completeness of the displacement field interpolation polynomials, and the satisfaction of -orthogonality condition ensures the accuracy of the simulations. The resulting elements, respectively, denoted as UQ10 and UQ10/E4, can provide exact solutions for both pure and linear bending problems and exhibit excellent insensitivity in shear-dominated tests. Furthermore, they are invariant, rapidly converging, and free of various locking problems.},

First, a univariate dimension-reduction algorithm is derived using the generalized Taylor expansion. The global stiffness matrix is expressed as the sum of the median and the univariate disturbance radius. Compared with Taylor expansion approximation, the univariate dimension-reduction approximation has higher accuracy and does not increase the amount of calculation. Then the inverse of the interval global stiffness matrix is approximated as an improved Neumann series. Higher- order terms are included by summing up the geometric terms in the Neumann series. Finally, the improved interval algorithm is used to solve the upper and lower bounds of the structural displacement response and the element stress response. The dependence between the interval parameters is accounted in comparison with the classic interval algorithm. The accuracy and effectiveness of the new method are validated by numerical cases on 2D truss, 3D frame and truck frame with multiple interval parameters.},

A novel explicit critical time step formula is obtained based on the system eigenvalues in one dimension and then extended to two and three dimensions. The critical time step formula takes the effect of particle position and neighboring cell interaction into consideration, and can also be used in an explicit phase field finite element method. Several numerical examples, including a dynamic crack branching, a plate with pre-existing crack under velocity boundary conditions and a three point bending problem are studied to verify the proposed ex-PFMPM. The use of the history field in the explicit method is studied, which shows that it will lead to fake phase field update and overestimation of the fracture energy in the unloading case.

Based on these findings, a simple strategy to avoid hourglassing for compression problems is proposed. It is based on a modification of the discrete Green-Lagrange strain, simple to implement and generally applicable. The stabilization concept is tested for various popular element formulations (namely EAS elements and the assumed stress element by Pian and Sumihara). A further aspect of the present contribution is a discussion on proper benchmarking of finite elements in the context of hourglassing. We propose a simple bifurcation problem for which analytical solutions are readily available in the literature.

This paper presents a topology optimization approach for designing bi-material distributions on vibrating shell structures in the shallow sea waveguide. The combined method of the finite element method, the virtual mass method, and the image method-based boundary element method is adopted for the system response analysis, where the coupling of the direct sound waves and the reflected sound waves from the free sea surface and the rigid seabed, as well as the strong interaction between the structural and fluid domains, are considered. In this context, a new sensitivity analysis of waveguide sound pressure is proposed. In the optimization problem, the design variables are the volumetric densities of design material elements in a bi-material model constructed by the solid isotropic material with penalization method, and the minimization of sound pressure level at a reference field point in the waveguide domain is taken as the design objective. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the correctness of the sensitivity analysis approach and the validity of the proposed optimization procedure, and several factors on the optimized designs are also discussed.},

Using the second law of thermodynamics, we rigorously derive a thermodynamically consistent mathematical model, which characterizes the two-phase capillarity and rock compressibility through free energies, thereby following an energy dissipation law. We also derive a general and thermodynamically consistent formulation for the effective pore fluid pressure acting on rocks, which is a fundamental problem for two-phase flow with rock compressibility. To solve the model effectively, we propose an energy stable numerical method, which can preserve multiple physical properties, including the energy dissipation law, full conservation law for both fluids and pore volumes, and positivity of porosity and saturations. Benefiting from the newly-developed energy factorization approach and careful treatments for the effective pressure and porosity, the proposed scheme can inherit the energy dissipation law at the discrete level. The fully discrete scheme is constructed using a locally conservative cell-centered finite difference method. The implicit strategy is applied to treat the upwind phase mobilities and porosity in the phase mass conservation equations and the porosity equation so as to conserve the mass of each phase as well as pore volumes. The positivity of porosity and saturations is proved without any restrictions on time step and mesh sizes. An efficient sequential iterative method is also developed to solve the nonlinear system resulting from the scheme. Finally, numerical results are given to verify the features of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a new traction-separation based constitutive model for use in finite element simulation of masonry joints under complex loading conditions is developed for cohesive elements. The proposed model is formulated using damage parameters and plastic deformation with mutual couplings, and can accurately simulate the complex nonlinear behaviors of masonry joints considering hardening or softening of strength and stiffness degradation. To enhance the numerical stability of the model, plasticity and damage are separated algorithmically and implemented in two phases. In the first phase, the plastic deformations are treated using a multi-surface plasticity model composed of a smooth hyperbolic yield surface for tension-shear mixed-mode failure and an elliptical cap primarily for the compressive failure. This is implemented in effective stress space and helps restrict the evolution of yield surfaces with no softening, significantly enhancing the efficiency of stress return mapping by the closed point projection method. In addition, an adaptive sub-stepping scheme is adopted to further improve the robustness of the numerical implementation. In the second phase, nominal stresses are computed from the effective stresses using damage parameters. The evolution of these damage parameters is defined in terms of plastic work which is defined by a polynomial form, and is recommended in this study for a better calibration capability. Improvements are made in the formulation of compressive cap including incorporation of hardening of strength and stiffness degradations as these are ignored in existing interface models. This approach helped improve simulation of masonry under cyclic loads with tension-compression transitions. For the structural level applications, the interface model is implemented within a finite element program, which is utilized to simulate failure of a number of masonry specimens under in-plane/out-of-plane monotonic/cyclic loading. The simulated results are rigorously validated with existing experimental data that shows a good potential in modeling masonry structures.},

  abstract     = {The material point method (MPM) is a robust numerical simulation approach for continuum mechanics problems involving large material deformations coupled to changing surface topographies. These types of problems are present in many different engineering contexts, from understanding the failure processes of earthen slopes to predicting the strengths and failure mechanisms of body armor to modeling the impact forces of waves in fluid tanks. By using a set of persistent material point tracers to follow the motion and deformation of the continuum material while solving the equations of motion on a static simulation grid, the MPM avoids several shortcomings of more traditional numerical approaches including blurring of material surfaces — as in Eulerian finite element or finite volume methods (FEMs or FVMs) — and mesh tangling — as in Lagrangian FEMs. Despite its robustness, MPM is known to develop significant numerical errors: namely, (i) the particle ringing instability and (ii) solution dependent discretization and integration errors. In this work, we present an analysis of local-in-time, spatial integration errors in the MPM and several techniques designed to mitigate these errors. Error mitigation approaches previously described in the literature are compared to a new method we propose for problems involving very large material deformations. The proposed method is shown to offer substantial improvement over standard MPM for simulations of fluid-like materials without requiring significant augmentation of existing MPM frameworks.},

  abstract     = {An enhancement of the extended B-spline-based implicit material point method (EBS-MPM) is developed to avoid pressure oscillation and volumetric locking. The EBS-MPM is a stable implicit MPM that enables the imposition of arbitrary boundary conditions thanks to the higher-order EBS basis functions and the help of Nitsche&#39;s method. In particular, by means of the higher-order EBS basis functions, the EBS-MPM can suppress the cell-crossing errors caused by material points crossing the background grid boundaries and can avoid both the stress oscillations arising from inaccurate numerical integration and the ill-conditioning of the resulting tangent matrices. Although the higher-order EBS basis functions are known to avoid volumetric locking, the problem of pressure oscillation has not yet been resolved. Therefore, to suppress pressure oscillation due to quasi-incompressibility, we propose the incorporation of the F-bar projection method into the EBS-MPM, which is compatible with the higher-order EBS basis functions. Three representative numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in suppressing both the pressure oscillation and volumetric locking. The results of the proposed method are compared to those of the finite element method with F-bar elements and those of isogeometric analysis with quadratic NURBS elements.},

We discretize the problem by means of the finite element method. Since the dual formulation solves directly for the stress variable and is not affected by locking, it is very attractive for many engineering applications. However, it is hard to solve it efficiently, since many challenges arise. First, the stress belongs to the non-Sobolev space H div $$ {\mathbf{H}}_{\mathrm{div}} $$ . Second, the matrix block related to the stress is only semi-positive definite in the incompressible limit. Third, global equality constraints and box-constraints are enforced. In this paper, we propose a novel and optimal nonlinear multigrid method for the dual formulation of the Signorini problem, that works even in the incompressible limit. We opt for the combination of a truncation of the basis functions strategy and a nonlinear monolithic patch smoother with Robin conditions of parameter . Numerical experiments show that multigrid performance is recovered if is chosen properly.

  abstract     = {In this work a new methodology for finite strain solid dynamics problems for stress accurate analysis including the incompressible limit is presented. In previous works, the authors have presented the stabilized mixed displacement/pressure formulation to deal with the incompressibility constraint in finite strain solid dynamics. To this end, the momentum equation is complemented with a constitutive law for the pressure which emerges from the deviatoric/volumetric decomposition of the strain energy function for any hyperelastic material model. The incompressible limit is attained automatically depending on the material bulk modulus. This work exploits the concept of mixed methods to formulate stable displacement/pressure/deviatoric stress finite elements. The final goal is to design a finite element technology able to tackle simultaneously problems which may involve incompressible behavior together with a high degree of accuracy of the stress field. The variational multi-scale stabilization technique and, in particular, the orthogonal subgrid scale method allows the use of equal-order interpolations. These stabilization procedures lead to discrete problems which are fully stable, free of volumetric locking, stress oscillations and pressure fluctuations. Numerical benchmarks show that the results obtained compare very favorably with those obtained with the corresponding stabilized mixed displacement/pressure formulation.},

Analytical target cascading (ATC) is a method for the design optimization of hierarchical, multilevel systems and has been successfully employed in the design of complex engineering systems. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven set-based ATC (SBATC) method for hierarchical design optimization problems using machine learning techniques. The proposed SBATC offers two advantages in engineering processes. First, it decomposes hierarchical design optimization problems into sets of suboptimization problems. The feasible regions of the suboptimization problems are explored and cascaded to lower-level optimization problems. Using the set-based approach, couplings between two adjacent levels in the optimization process are not required. Second, an efficient strategy is employed to determine feasible regions based on Bayesian active learning (BAL). In BAL, the Gaussian process (GP) of all cost functions is trained. An acquisition function that combines the probability of feasibility and entropy search is evaluated using posterior distributions of the trained GP. The acquisition function is maximized to generate new sampling points around the feasible regions by balancing the exploitation and exploration of the design space. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, numerical examples of hierarchical optimization problems are evaluated.},

  abstract     = {A novel mixed framework and energy-momentum consistent integration scheme in the field of coupled nonlinear thermo-electro-elastodynamics is proposed. The mixed environment is primarily based on a framework for elastodynamics in the case of polyconvex strain energy functions. For this elastodynamic framework, the properties of the so-called tensor cross product are exploited to derive a mixed formulation via a Hu-Washizu type extension of the strain energy function. Afterwards, a general path to incorporate nonpotential problems for mixed formulations is demonstrated. To this end, the strong form of the mixed framework is derived and supplemented with the energy balance as well as Maxwell&#39;s equations neglecting magnetic and time dependent effects. By additionally choosing an appropriate energy function, this procedure leads to a fully coupled thermo-electro-elastodynamic formulation which benefits from the properties of the underlying mixed framework. In addition, the proposed mixed framework facilitates the design of a new energy-momentum consistent time integration scheme by employing discrete derivatives in the sense of Gonzalez. A one-step integration scheme of second-order accuracy is obtained which is shown to be stable even for large time steps. Eventually, the performance of the novel formulation is demonstrated in several numerical examples.},

These types of combinations, however, might entail difficulties even when individual models are well-understood, particularly in relation to the well-posedness of the ensemble. In this article, we focus on combining two classes of dissimilar diffusive models: the first one defined over a continuum and the second one based on discrete equations that connect average values of the solution over disjoint subdomains. For stationary problems, we show unconditional stability of the linked problems and then the stability and convergence of its discretized counterpart when mixed finite elements are used to approximate the model on the continuum. The theoretical results are highlighted with numerical examples illustrating the effects of linking diffusive models. As a side result, we show that the methods introduced in this article can be used to infer the solution of diffusive problems with incomplete data.},

This results in a relatively simple model with good agreement to experimental data. By expressing the strain energy function in terms of its invariants or other parameters, it is possible to interpret the resulting algebraic formulation in a physical context. In addition, a direct implementation of the obtained algebraic equation for example into a finite element procedure is possible. For the validation of the proposed approach, benchmark tests on the basis of the generalized Mooney–Rivlin model are presented. In all these tests, the chosen ansatz can find the predefined models. Additionally, this method is applied to the multi-axial loading data set of vulcanized rubber. Finally, a data set for a temperature-dependent thermoplastic polyester elastomer is evaluated. In latter cases, good agreement with the experimental data is obtained.},

  abstract     = {The contribution is concerned with a finite element formulation for the nonlinear analysis of heterogeneous solids in boundary representation. It results in an element with an arbitrary number of curved boundary edges. The curved edges can be parametrized by, for example, non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). The presented element formulation is based on the scaling concept, which is adopted from the so-called scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM). In contrast to SBFEM, the proposed method uses a numerical approximation for the displacement response in scaling direction. This enables the analysis of geometrically and physically nonlinear problems in solid mechanics. The interpolation at the boundary in circumferential direction is independent of interpolation in scaling direction. Thus, different basis functions can be used for each direction, for example, NURBS basis functions in circumferential and Lagrange basis functions in radial direction. It allows the construction of polygonal elements with an arbitrary number of curved sides, which are described by either whole NURBS curves or NURBS curves&#39; segments. The advantage of the presented element formulation is the flexibility in mesh generation. For example, using Quadtree algorithms, a fast and reliable mesh generation can be achieved. Furthermore, in connection with trimming algorithms, the element formulation allows a precise representation of the geometry even with coarse meshes. Some benchmark tests are presented to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed numerical method against analytical solutions, and a comparison to standard element formulations is given as well.},

The virtual region approach allows having an activated and deactivated part of the mesh, where elements can freely enter or leave the activated domain. Furthermore, the surface reconstruction ensures boundary conformity of the activated domain. The robustness of the proposed method is shown in two numerical examples: a variation of the benchmark Poiseuille flow, and the flow simulation during a closing diaphragm valve. In particular, the diaphragm valve simulation includes large boundary movement, complex geometry, and closing motion. For this case, both steady and transient simulation results at different closing conditions are presented.},

The first approach (point-to-point interpolation) uses inconsistent integration with quadrature points prescribed by a primary element. The second approach uses consistent integration by choosing quadratures depending on the intersection between non-conforming elements. In literature, some excellent properties regarding performance and ease of implementation are reported for point-to-point interpolation. However, we show that this approach can not safely be used for DG discretizations of the acoustic conservation equations since, in our setting, it yields spurious oscillations that lead to instabilities. This work presents a test case in that we can observe the instabilities and shows that consistent integration is required to maintain a stable method. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of the method with consistent integration. We show optimal spatial convergence rates globally and in each mesh region separately. The method is constructed such that it can natively treat overlaps between elements. Finally, we highlight the benefits of non-conforming discretizations in acoustic computations by a numerical test case with different fluids.},

  abstract     = {By blending the primal-dual interior point method (PDIPM) and the return mapping algorithm, we propose a hybrid strategy of implicit stress update for a class of hypoelastic-plastic models with the hardening rule whose evolution is restricted by the memory surface. The inequality constraint relevant to the memory surface is replaced by the equality constraint by the introduction of a slack variable, and the duality gap is gradually reduced by using path-following method. First, we formulate an optimization problem corresponding to the principle of maximum plastic dissipation for the standard von-Mises plasticity with isotropic and kinematic hardening rules and its variant for the model with the memory surface. Next, after function forms employed for the elastic-plastic model are specified, the PDIPM to realize an implicit stress update is briefly reviewed and then applied to the model involving the memory surface to replace the relevant inequality constraint by the equality constraint by the introduction of a slack variable. Then, we present a hybrid scheme that combines the standard return mapping algorithm with the PDIPM. The numerical accuracy of the proposed stress update algorithm for the conventional elastic-plastic model is verified in comparison with the standard return mapping algorithm using iso-error map. Also, targeting a notched round steel bar under cyclic loading with three different amplitudes, we demonstrate the performance for the stress update using the elastic-plastic model with the memory surface. Finally, the capability of the proposed algorithm is proven through a typical real-life example such that a steel bridge is subjected to earthquake for which the residual load carrying capacity must be estimated.},

The common and indiscriminate treatment of spatial and temporal directions allows us to remove one of the major bottlenecks in parallel computations: The design of time-stepping schemes, which can neither been parallelized efficiently in time nor allow for local refinements as no information transfer backwards in time is possible. Moreover, stability of time-stepping schemes depend on the accumulation of local approximation errors in each time-step, in contrast to space-time formulation, characterized by enhanced stability and robustness.

  abstract     = {Viscoelastic fluids are highly challenging from the rheological standpoint, and their discretization demands robust, efficient numerical solvers. Simulating viscoelastic flows requires combining the Navier–Stokes system with a dynamic tensorial equation, increasing mathematical and computational demands. Hence, fractional-step methods decoupling the calculation of the flow quantities are an attractive option. In consistent fractional-step schemes, the splitting of the equations is derived from the continuous level, so that neither mass nor momentum balance is sacrificed. Thus, no corrections or velocity projections are needed, resulting in fewer algorithmic steps than other classical approaches. Moreover, consistency guarantees the absence of both numerical boundary layers and splitting errors, enabling high-order accuracy in space and time. This article introduces the first consistent splitting methods for incompressible flows of viscoelastic fluids, for which arbitrary constitutive laws are allowed. We present the formulation and the algorithm, along with various numerical examples testing their accuracy. First-, second- and third-order backward-differentiation schemes are numerically tested, and optimal convergence is confirmed for several spatial and temporal discretizations. Furthermore, good numerical stability is verified in challenging benchmark problems, including steady and time-dependent solutions.},

Auxiliary variables for the horizontal derivatives and integrals of displacements are introduced to modify the governing equations and the nodal forces.

The transmitting boundary for a scalar wave satisfies the criteria for an accurate and well-posed boundary condition and shows convergent, accurate, and stable behaviors for a variety of scalar-wave propagation problems in waveguides.

  abstract     = {This work presents a new numerical approach to efficiently model the cathode&#39;s moving surface in the moving boundary value problem of electrochemical machining. Until recently, the process simulation with finite elements had the drawback of remeshing required by the changing surface geometries. This disadvantage was overcome by an innovative model formulation for the anodic dissolution that utilizes effective material parameters as well as the dissolution level as an internal variable and, thereby, does not require remeshing. Now, we suggest a new numerical method to model arbitrarily shaped and moving cathodes. Two methodologies are investigated to describe the time varying position of the cathode and compared in terms of implementational effort and numerical efficiency. In the first approach, we change the electric conductivity of elements within the cathode and, in a second approach, we apply Dirichlet boundary conditions on the nodes of corresponding elements. For both methods, elements on the cathode&#39;s surface are treated with effective material parameters. This procedure allows for the efficient simulation of industrially relevant, complex geometries without mesh adaptation. The model&#39;s performance is validated by means of analytical, numerical and experimental results from the literature. The short computation times make the approach interesting for industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {We propose a combined nodal integration and virtual element method for compressible and nearly incompressible elasticity, wherein the strain is averaged at the nodes from the strain of surrounding virtual elements. For the strain averaging procedure, a nodal averaging operator is constructed using a generalization to virtual elements of the node-based uniform strain approach for finite elements. We refer to the proposed technique as the node-based uniform strain virtual element method (NVEM). No additional degrees of freedom are introduced in this approach, thus resulting in a displacement-based formulation. A salient feature of the NVEM is that the stresses and strains become nodal variables just like displacements, which can be exploited in nonlinear simulations. Through several benchmark problems in compressible and nearly incompressible elasticity as well as in elastodynamics, we demonstrate that the NVEM is accurate, optimally convergent and devoid of volumetric locking.},

  abstract     = {Hard-magnetic soft materials (HMSMs) are particulate composites that particles with high coercivity are dispersed in a soft matrix. Since applying the magnetic loading induces a body couple in HMSMs, the resulting Cauchy stress is predicted to be asymmetric. Therefore, the micropolar continuum theory can be employed to capture the deformation of these materials. On the other hand, the geometries and structures made of HMSMs often possess small thickness compared to the overall dimensions of the body. Accordingly, in the present contribution, a 10-parameter micropolar shell formulation to model the finite elastic deformation of thin hard-magnetic soft structures under magnetic stimuli is developed. The proposed shell formulation allows for using three-dimensional constitutive laws without any need for modification to apply the plane stress assumption in thin structures. A nonlinear finite element formulation is also presented for the numerical solution of the governing equations. To alleviate the locking phenomenon, the enhanced assumed strain method is employed. Several examples are presented that demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed formulation.},

The principal novelty of the proposed approach is that the vertical displacements of the beam elements, as well as the transversal relative displacements of the interface elements, are interpolated using a quadratic linked interpolation that also takes into account the nodal cross-sectional rotations of the beam elements. At the same time, the axial displacements and cross-sectional rotations are interpolated using linear Lagrange polynomials. A bilinear cohesive zone model is embedded in the interface finite elements for delamination modes I and II. Numerical analyses based on the examples from the literature with metal joints show that the formulation with quadratic linked interpolation improves the convergence and robustness of the solution with respect to the approach with linear interpolation. On the other hand, in case of composites with stiff adhesives this formulation exhibits a peculiar behavior with spurious oscillations of the normal interface tractions that leads to a poor performance in mode-I and mixed-mode tests. This problem can be easily solved by canceling the quadratic term in the interpolation function and using the standard Lagrange interpolation in such cases.},

Two maximum stress minimization problems are addressed: minimization of maximum microstructural stress and minimization of maximum macrostructural stress. The homogenization method is used to bridge the macrostructure and the microstructure and to calculate local microstructural stress. By replacing the maximum stress value with a Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser function, the difficulty of nondifferentiability of maximum stress is avoided. Each strength design problem is formulated as a distributed parameter optimization problem subject to an area constraint including the whole microstructure. The shape gradient functions for both problems are derived using Lagrange&#39;s undetermined multiplier method, the material derivative method, and the adjoint variable method. The H 1 gradient method is used to determine the unit cell shapes of the microstructure, while reducing the objective function and maintaining smooth design boundaries. In the numerical examples, the optimal shapes obtained for minimization of the maximum local stress of the microstructure and the macrostructure are compared and discussed. The results confirm the effectiveness of the microstructure shape optimization method for the two strength design problems of multiscale structures.},

For models that show a strongly non-linear dependence on their input parameters, standard surrogate techniques, such as polynomial chaos expansion, are not sufficient to obtain an accurate representation of the original model response. It has been shown that for models with discontinuities or rational dependencies, for example, frequency response functions of dynamic systems, the use of a rational (Padé) approximation can significantly improve the approximation accuracy. In order to avoid overfitting issues in previously proposed standard least squares approaches, we introduce a sparse Bayesian learning approach to estimate the coefficients of the rational approximation. Therein the linearity in the numerator polynomial coefficients is exploited and the denominator polynomial coefficients as well as the problem hyperparameters are determined through type-II-maximum likelihood estimation. We apply a quasi-Newton gradient-descent algorithm to find the optimal denominator coefficients and derive the required gradients through application of -calculus. The method is applied to the frequency response functions of an algebraic frame structure model as well as that of an orthotropic plate finite element model.},

A novel periodic boundary including an efficient searching algorithm for particle contact is proposed to reduce the computational cost and boundary effect. Then this model is validated by two numerical examples: a circular particle with concentration convection-diffusion moving in a horizontal channel and mass transport from a cylinder particle in a simple shear flow. The numerical results obtained from the proposed model agree well with previous studies. To further demonstrate the capacity of the proposed model, simulations of methane hydrate exploitation including two formations in marine sediments are carried out. The numerical results indicate that the coupled DEM-IMB-LBM is not only capable of simulating the dissolution of hydrate particles at the grain level, but also recover the sand erosion and migration process in a fundamental perspective during the methane hydrate exploitation process.},

  abstract     = {For any floating body, statical stability curves play a critical role in its stability analysis. In this article, a force-oriented approach, in conjunction with finite element procedure, is proposed in order to compute those curves of floating bodies with complicated hull forms. The hull surface is meshed by triangular elements. The buoyant force and restoring moments are directly computed through the load redistribution of the hydrostatic pressure over the facet of each triangular element. Computations of a statical stability curve require a series of floating conditions that lead to the change of waterline with respect to the hull surface. In order to do all computations by using a unique finite element mesh, techniques regarding nodal coordinate update and non-matching element treatment are developed. The procedure has been established and the algorithm has been developed. Results from three examples with simple but representative geometries are compared to those by hand calculations to verify the accuracy of the approach. Then, two standard reference hull forms, a very large crude carrier (KRISO KVLCC2) and a trimaran (NPL Round Bilge 4a), have been investigated to demonstrate the validation of the approach. Results of all examples show that the proposed approach is insensitive to the mesh pattern.},

  abstract     = {Projection-based model order reduction (PMOR) methods based on linear or affine approximation subspaces accelerate numerical predictions by reducing the dimensionality of the underlying computational models. The state of the art of PMOR includes approximation methods based on state-local subspaces—that is, subspaces associated with different regions of the solution manifold—and methods based on adaptive reduced-order bases. For challenging applications such as those associated with highly nonlinear problems, such methods accelerate traditional PMOR by controlling the dimension of the reduced-order basis (ROB) and associated projection-based reduced-order model (PROM). This article proposes an alternative as well as complementary approach for accelerating PMOR based on introducing sparsity into the ROB, in order to enhance the computational efficiency of the associated PROM. Specifically, the proposed approach introduces sparsity in PMOR by partitioning the computational domain rather than, or in addition to, the solution manifold, and therefore leads to the concept of a space-local ROB. This concept is compatible with both concepts of a state-local ROB and hyperreduction. It is demonstrated for two computational fluid dynamics problems in turbulent flow applications. Acceleration factors of the order of 1.5 relative to traditional PMOR and CPU time speedup factors of several orders of magnitude relative to high-dimensional models are reported.},

Such characteristics are especially attractive in the design of micro-scale robots but also other applications such as high-speed data transfer or the conversion of photonic energy into a mechanical response holds great promise. Despite these almost futuristic possibilities, photo-sensitive polymers have not yet experienced a sufficient attention in industrial applications. One important factor to increase the acceptance of this group of soft smart materials is the formulation of a rigorous constitutive modeling approach in combination with numerical simulation methods. Thus, in this contribution we present a photo-mechanical modeling approach, departing from the fundamentals published previously. We briefly introduce the necessary constitutive equations which are subsequently utilized in combination with the respective balance laws into a finite element implementation. Finally, the capabilities of the numerical solution approach are illustrated by a simple two-dimensional bench-mark example and subsequently extended to a more complex three-dimensional problem.},

We discuss a few of these challenges and the techniques, such as the use of Fourier transform, that can be used to resolve these issues. This paper proposes and develops a physics-informed neural network model that combines the residuals of the strong form and the potential energy, yielding many loss terms contributing to the definition of the loss function to be minimized. Hence, we propose using the coefficient of variation weighting scheme to dynamically and adaptively assign the weight for each loss term in the loss function. The developed PINN model is standalone and meshfree. In other words, it can accurately capture the mechanical response without requiring any labeled data. Although the framework can be used for many solid mechanics problems, we focus on three-dimensional (3D) hyperelasticity, where we consider two hyperelastic models. Once the model is trained, the response can be obtained almost instantly at any point in the physical domain, given its spatial coordinates. We demonstrate the framework&#39;s performance by solving different problems with various boundary conditions.},

A curvilinear coordinate system is fixed on this reference configuration to measure the local deformation of the element. Based on Hamilton&#39;s principle, the global elastic force vector, the global internal damping force vector, the global inertia force vector, and the global external damping force vector are derived using the same shape functions to ensure the consistency and independence of the element.

However, the most typical method, the Monte-Carlo Simulation is highly time consuming. And most of the existing methods with high computational efficiency compared to the Monte-Carlo Simulation are approximate methods and may not be applicable for high-precision requirements. Within the proposed method, the solution equations are deduced in terms of the properties of matrix operations step by step based on the Kronecker product and straightening operation, and thus the mean values and variances of the eigenvalues can be obtained directly with high precision. Three numerical examples are employed to illustrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed method in specific engineering structures. The results indicate that the proposed method yields consistent mean values and variances of the eigenvalues with those obtained by the Monte-Carlo Simulation respectively with significantly less computation time showing its superiority in accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a novel heterogeneous multi-scale method for the frequency response analysis of waves propagating in porous domains with a complex micro-structure. In this, the domain is decomposed onto polygonal coarse elements each clustering its local micro-structure. The micro-structure is resolved using the virtual element method hence providing ample flexibility into capturing fine scale heterogeneities of arbitrary polygonal shapes. The upscaling is performed through a set of numerically evaluated multi-scale basis functions. Rather than evaluating the basis for a broad band set of frequencies, a reduced order modeling approach is opted for. In this, the basis is evaluated for a select subset of frequencies, that is used as a basis for the evaluation of the remaining set through a proper orthogonal decomposition procedure. The solution of the coupled governing equations is then performed at the coarse-scale at a reduced computational cost. The performance of the method in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency is evaluated through a set of numerical examples for poro-elastic materials with heterogeneities of various shapes.},

The method merges the rigid-plastic analysis and the density-based topology optimization. To obtain a clean black-and-white design, the density in the objective function is penalized using an exponential function. The solution of the final plasticity-based topology optimization problem exhibits as a sequence of second-order cone programming (SOCP) problems that can be resolved efficiently using the advanced primal-dual interior point method. Compared to the conventional stress-constrained topology optimization techniques, the developed method accounts for plasticity and the finite element analysis of structures does not need to be carried out separately.

  abstract     = {We discuss the multiscale modeling of a granular material trapped between continuum elastic domains. The amorphous granular region, usually termed “gouge,” is under high confinement pressure, to represent the loading of faults at depth. We model the granularity of gouge using the discrete element method (DEM), while the elastic regions surrounding it are represented with two continuum domains modeled with the finite element method (FEM). We resort to a concurrent coupling of the discrete and continuum domains for a proper transmission of waves between the discrete and continuum domains. The confinement pressure results in the appearance of a new kind of ghost forces, which we address via two different overlapping coupling strategies. The first one is a generalization to granular materials of the bridging method , which was originally introduced to couple continuum domains to regular atomic lattices. This method imposes a strong formulation for the Lagrange constraints at the coupling interface. The second strategy considers a weak formulation. Different DEM samples sizes are tested in order to determine at which scale a convergence of the elastic properties is reached. This scale sets the minimal mesh element size in the DEM/FEM interface necessary to avoid undesirable effects due to an elastic properties mismatch. Then, the two DEM/FEM strategies are compared for a system initially at equilibrium. While the performance of both strategies is adequate, we show that the strong coupling is the most stable one as it generates the least spurious numerical noise. Finally, as a practical example for the strong coupling approach, we analyze the propagation of pressure and shear waves through the FEM/DEM interface and discuss dispersion as function of the incoming wave frequency.},

The ductility demand-capacity method was used to determine the geometrical parameters of cross-section plasticization zones, their ability to move and rotate, as well as their ductility. Due to the varied geometry and stiffness of the supports and their nonlinear behavior under dynamic load, this method was concluded to be imperfect. Therefore, an improved algorithm was proposed by determining the main parameters of plastic hinges depending on the degree of concrete degradation according to Lubliner&#39;s assumptions. The new algorithm has been implemented in the form of mathematical equations.

The crack initiation and propagation processes are determined from an energy minimization problem with respect to the displacement field and crack phase-field, and the predicted path represented by a diffuse crack topology is replaced by a discrete path by applying the finite cover method. By developing a technique for determining explicit crack tips, the crack topology is updated from diffusive to discrete intermittently during the course of the staggered iterative procedure. Therefore, even a curved crack path that evolves significantly within a single time increment can be explicitly captured. Additionally, to stably update an explicit crack tip within the finite strain framework, we introduce a stabilization technique. Specifically, pseudo-stiffness is applied to severely damaged elements around the discrete crack path to prevent excessively large deformations, and the corrector of the displacement increment in the global Newton–Raphson iterative procedure is intentionally diminished so that the discrete crack opens in a gradual and stable manner. After describing the individual techniques devised in the proposed scheme for achieving these features based on their algorithmic aspects, we present several representative numerical examples to demonstrate the performance and capability of the developed approach.},

  abstract     = {Recent developments in the field of computational modeling of fracture have opened up possibilities for designing structures against failure. A special case, called interfacial fracture or delamination, can occur in loaded composite structures where two or more materials are bonded together at comparatively weak interfaces. Due to the potential crack growth along these interfaces, the structural problem suffers from snap-back/snap-through instabilities and bifurcations with respect to the model parameters, leading to noisy and discontinuous responses. For such a case, the design optimization problem for a selected quantity of interest is ill-posed, since small variations in the design parameters can lead to large jumps in the structural response. To this end, this article presents a stochastic optimization approach to maximize delamination resistance that is less sensitive to small perturbations of the design and thereby leads to a robust solution. To overcome the intractability of Monte Carlo methods for estimating the expected value of the expensive-to-evaluate response function, a global, piecewise-constant surrogate is constructed based on nearest-neighbor interpolation that is iteratively refined during the optimization run. We found that by taking a large stochastic region at the beginning of the optimization and gradually reducing it to the desired one can help overcome poor local optima. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using an example of shape optimization of hard inclusions embedded in a double-cantilever beam, which significantly enhances delamination resistance.},

Then, we formulate the boundary heat flux estimation problem in a deterministic inverse problem setting using a sequential approach according to the sequentiality of the temperature measurements. We consider different formulations of the inverse problem. For each one, we develop novel direct methodologies exploiting a space parameterization of the heat flux and the linearity of the mold model.

Furthermore, the driving energy used to check crack propagation is evaluated using the representative crack elements (RCE), by which the crack is modeled as a discrete phenomenon. The RCE approach shows more realistic results compared to other split models.

However, due to the heterogeneous nature and anisotropic response of masonry, such prediction is still difficult to achieve, where most current masonry representations are based upon homogeneous isotropic material models or even more simplified masonry macro-elements. In this article, a novel anisotropic constitutive model to be used in detailed 3D continuum FE representations is described. This is based upon the application of the transformed-tensor method to an isotropic uncoupled plastic-damage model, which is further enhanced by additional novel features enabling the proper definition of the shear behavior both in terms of yielding surface and damage evolution while increasing local computational robustness. Illustrative examples at different scales are presented, highlighting the characteristics and potential of the developed masonry material model. Focus is placed on the mechanical behavior under uniaxial and biaxial stress states considering pure compression on wallets with varying inclination of the material principal axes and the out-of-plane response of wall components. The numerical results confirm the ability of the proposed constitutive model to predict typical masonry anisotropic response characteristics, which cannot be accurately represented by standard isotropic representations commonly used in professional practice and research.},

As an illustration, the approach is applied in liquid composite molding processes, and to the processing of large thick panels toughened with perforated interlayers.

The combination of 3D and 1D elements to manage components with different dimensions has been used before, however no proper analysis of the loss of accuracy introduced has been conducted to our knowledge. A systematic parametric study is conducted to quantify the impact of the length of the domain, the number of interlayers, the diameter of the holes and the viscosity of the fluid on the loss of accuracy.

Various permutations and combinations of n design variables are utilized to represent 2 n discrete candidate angles. Since the weighting functions of the way automatically satisfy the sum constraint, it is unnecessary to address the sum constraints during the optimization process. Compared with the traditional discrete material optimization strategy and solid isotropic material with penalization scheme, the BIO method reduces the dimension of the mathematical model for optimizing fiber angles. Compared to the shape functions with penalization scheme, the BIO method can be extended to the optimization problem of 2 n candidates. Numerical examples of different types demonstrate that the proposed method has higher solution efficiency in the optimization problem of fiber orientation selection and is suitable for three-dimensional shell optimization problems.

  abstract     = {The present work presents a novel approach for semi-analytic adjoint sensitivity-based design optimization for nonproportional fatigue damage. In order to apply fatigue damage in sensitivity-based design optimizations, an essential part is to calculate correct sensitivities. However, this is not straight forward since fatigue damage calculation typically include rainflow counting and critical plane search algorithms. Therefore, no derivatives are directly available for the fatigue damage calculation, only functional values given by numerical computation. In existing literature the considered fatigue damage calculation is simplified until a closed-form differentiability is satisfied. However, these simplifications are not applicable for industrial examples where accurate fatigue life estimates are required. In the present work numerical differentiation of the fatigue damage values with respect to the stress tensor is applied to calculate semi-analytical adjoint sensitivities at material points for multiple load cases. The proposed method is verified and demonstrated using different damage parameter types including critical plane analysis. Additionally, different academic and industrial numerical examples are compared to stress and stiffness optimized designs. The fatigue damage optimized designs show improved fatigue damage results for both the specific damage parameter types and when comparing to stress and stiffness optimized designs. Furthermore, it is successfully applied for different design variables (sizing, non-parametric shape and bead) as well as different optimization formulations using fatigue damage either as objective or constraint.},

The general stiffness matrices of scaled boundary finite element (SBFE) is proved to be block-circulant, and can be constructed via the basic region, instead of the whole computing domain. Thus, the expense on eigenvalue analysis required in generating stiffness matrix can be significantly reduced, and the solution scale can be reduced by partitioning the system equation into a series of small independent subproblems. Furthermore, the presented algorithm is combined with the Woodbury formula to reduce the computational cost on the analysis of incomplete cyclically symmetric structures, the original system equation is transformed into the equations with block-circulant coefficient matrices, which is efficiently solved by partitioning algorithm. Four numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach.},

The non-negative discriminant of the cubic characteristic polynomial vanishes as these two eigenvalues merge. Turning points of the cubic curve reveal two non-negative invariant factors of the discriminant. These factors are defined in the favorable form of sums of squares by the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, to be used as numerically stable invariants instead of the determinant. Full numerical stability of the procedure is attained by expressing the angular coordinate in terms of the tangent function rather than the cosine, enhanced by range reduction obtained by considering the half angle.

Specifically, a modified generalized- time integration scheme is used and combined with a nonlinear isogeometric Kirchhoff–Love shell element to provide second-order accuracy while introducing controllable high-frequency dissipation. In addition, a weak enforcement of essential boundary conditions based on a penalty approach is considered with a particular focus on the inhomogeneous case of imposed prescribed displacements. Moreover, we propose a least-squares B-spline surface fitting approach and corresponding error measures to model both eigenmode based and measured geometric imperfections. The imperfect geometries thus obtained can be naturally integrated into the framework of isogeometric nonlinear dynamic shell analysis. Based on this idea, the different modeling methods and the influence of the appropriately considered geometric imperfections on the dynamic buckling behavior can be investigated systematically. Both perfect and geometrically imperfect shell models are considered to assess the performance of the proposed method. We compare our method with established developments in this field and demonstrate superior achievements with regard to solution quality and robustness.},

  abstract     = {The shifted fracture method (SFM) is an embedded method that enables sharp crack representations while using mesh-fitted data structures. In the SFM, the true crack is embedded in the computational grid, but the crack interface conditions are approximated by, or shifted to , a surrogate crack composed of element boundaries (i.e., edges/faces in two/three dimensions). This avoids enriched degrees-of-freedom and cut elements, so that data structures and geometrical treatment are much simpler, while still maintaining mesh-independent and accurate crack approximations. This article presents a continuous-discontinuous model of fracture based on blending a phase-field (PF) model with the SFM. The PF tracks the evolution of cracks inside a numerical fracture processing zone: diffuse cracks initiate, propagate, branch, and merge according to the field equations of energy minimization; no ad-hoc criteria are needed. The PF damage variable is then used to define the geometry of the true crack. With computational efficiency in mind, the PF model is only solved in subdomains where additional crack growth is expected and the SFM representation is used elsewhere. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach in capturing complex crack patterns are illustrated by a representative set of two-dimensional numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {The Dirichlet–Neumann scheme is the most common partitioned algorithm for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) and offers high flexibility concerning the solvers employed for the two subproblems. Nevertheless, it is not without shortcomings: to begin with, the inherent added-mass effect often destabilizes the numerical solution severely. Moreover, the Dirichlet–Neumann scheme cannot be applied to FSI problems in which an incompressible fluid is fully enclosed by Dirichlet boundaries, as it is incapable of satisfying the volume constraint. In the last decade, interface quasi-Newton methods have proven to control the added-mass effect and substantially speed up convergence by adding a Newton-like update step to the Dirichlet–Neumann coupling. They are, however, without effect on the incompressibility dilemma. As an alternative, the Robin-Neumann scheme generalizes the fluid&#39;s boundary condition to a Robin condition by including the Cauchy stresses. While this modification in fact successfully tackles both drawbacks of the Dirichlet–Neumann approach, the price to be paid is a strong dependency on the Robin weighting parameter, with very limited a priori knowledge about good choices. This work proposes a strategy to merge these two ideas and benefit from their combined strengths. The resulting quasi-Newton-accelerated Robin-Neumann scheme is compared to both Robin- and Dirichlet–Neumann variants. The numerical tests demonstrate that it does not only provide faster convergence, but also massively reduces the influence of the Robin parameter, mitigating the main drawback of the Robin-Neumann algorithm.},

  abstract     = {We provide theoretical investigations and empirical evidence that the effective stresses in computational homogenization of inelastic materials converge with a higher rate than the local solution fields. Due to the complexity of industrial-scale microstructures, computational homogenization methods often utilize a rather crude approximation of the microstructure, favoring regular grids over accurate boundary representations. As the accuracy of such an approach has been under continuous verification for decades, it appears astonishing that this strategy is successful in homogenization, but is seldom used on component scale. A part of the puzzle has been solved recently, as it was shown that the effective elastic properties converge with twice the rate of the local strain and stress fields. Thus, although the local mechanical fields may be inaccurate, the averaging process leads to a cancellation of errors and improves the accuracy of the effective properties significantly. Unfortunately, the original argument is based on energetic considerations. The straightforward extension to the inelastic setting provides superconvergence of (pseudoelastic) potentials, but does not cover the primary quantity of interest: the effective stress tensor. The purpose of the work at hand is twofold. On the one hand, we provide extensive numerical experiments on the convergence rate of local and effective quantities for computational homogenization methods based on the fast Fourier transform. These indicate the superconvergence effect to be valid for effective stresses, as well. Moreover, we provide theoretical justification for such a superconvergence based on an argument that avoids energetic reasoning.},

First, the basic governing equation is formulated using the ALE-SPH framework. The universal formulation is similar to the standard WCSPH, but the degree of Eulerian and Lagrangian schemes can be controlled by inserting a pre-defined arbitrary parameter α α ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] $$ \upalpha \in \left[0,1\right] $$ . To alleviate potential numerical errors and inconsistency, particle mass correction is proposed along with particle disorder correction. Then, an algorithm is introduced, in which only a slight modification is necessary compared to the standard WCSPH. Finally, extensive benchmark simulations are conducted to validate the proposed method. As a result, the proposed method is found to perform well in hydrodynamics problems with various flow conditions (pipe flow, lid-driven problem, Taylor–Green vortex, vortex shedding problem, and water sloshing) and thermal-hydraulics problems (natural convection in a square cavity).},

  abstract     = {The classical theory of elasticity relies on the perfect structure of matter. No matter how small a medium is, it always stays homogeneous—but the reality is different. Even though the classical continuum mechanics suffices well for describing phenomena that evolve at super-microscopic scales, it ceases to reproduce reasonable responses when the size effects are pronounced. It is due to the local constitutive equations of classical continuum mechanics, which are devoid of any length scales associated with the underlying microstructure. The gradient-dependent theory of elasticity redresses this shortcoming by incorporating the kinematic quantities of the corresponding representative volume element by enriching the differential equations with higher-order spatial and temporal derivatives. In this study, the scaled boundary finite element method is formulated for the equations of motion with higher-order inertia terms. To this end, the semi-discretized scaled boundary finite element equations of the medium are derived by introducing the scaled boundary transformation of geometry to the gradient-enriched equations of motion and applying the Galerkin method of weighted residuals. It is shown that the well-established available solution methods are incapable of handling the frequency-domain representation of the derived formulation. Accordingly, a numerical solution method based on the shooting technique is proposed. The solution procedure is formulated for general numerical integration schemes via the infinite Taylor series. The evolution of the impedance-diffusion matrix and contribution of inter-subdomain forces and tractions are extracted. Four different numerical integration methods are employed to describe the solution procedure. In addition, a comparison regarding their computational efficiency is presented. For the sake of verification, the scaled boundary finite element solutions of three numerical examples are compared with reference solutions that are obtained using finite element models with extremely fine meshes. The convergence trends are also presented for both - and -refinement methods. The results demonstrate the capability of the proposed formulation in reproducing accurate responses.},

  abstract     = {A graph convolutional network (GCN) is employed in the deep energy method (DEM) model to solve the momentum balance equation in three-dimensional space for the deformation of linear elastic and hyperelastic materials due to its ability to handle irregular domains over the traditional DEM method based on a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network. The method&#39;s accuracy and solution time are compared to the DEM model based on a MLP network. We demonstrate that the GCN-based model delivers similar accuracy while having a shorter run time through numerical examples. Two different spatial gradient computation techniques, one based on automatic differentiation (AD) and the other based on shape function (SF) gradients, are also accessed. We provide a simple example to demonstrate the strain localization instability associated with the AD-based gradient computation and show that the instability exists in more general cases by four numerical examples. The SF-based gradient computation is shown to be more robust and delivers an accurate solution even at severe deformations. Therefore, the combination of the GCN-based DEM model and SF-based gradient computation is potentially a promising candidate for solving problems involving severe material and geometric nonlinearities.},

  abstract     = {A stopping criterion for fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based iterative schemes in computational homogenization is proposed and investigated numerically. This criterion is based on the separate evaluation and comparison of the discretization and iteration errors on the computed fields. Some estimators for these errors are proposed and their performances are assessed on a set of 2D problems in the frameworks of both the classical FFT-based methods and these that use a modified version of the featured Green&#39;s operator. In particular, two novel strategies for estimating the discretization error are investigated: either using an image processing approach or transposing to the FFT-based setting the constitutive relation error that is well-established in the context of the finite element method. It is then shown that the resulting stopping criterion leads to a better control of the global error on the computed effective property compared to the classical criterion based on the residual of the iterative scheme alone.},

The temporal homogenization formula is classified into two types: non-updated temporal homogenization formula and updated temporal homogenization formula. Initial boundary value problem was classified into the global initial boundary value problem and the local initial boundary value problem. To verify this method, two examples were used: (i) when a uniaxial cyclic load is applied to a one-dimensional bar and (ii) when a multiaxial cyclic load is applied to a three-dimensional bar. On comparing the accuracy of the non-updated and the updated temporal homogenization formula, it can be clearly seen that the updated temporal homogenization formula yielded more accurate results.},

  abstract     = {A common choice for multiscale modeling of the mechanical response of composites is to use periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) on square and cubical representative volume elements (RVEs). However, when strain localization occurs in the micromodel, these PBCs are unable to reproduce the transverse isotropy of composite materials with a random microstructure. Existing remedies to alleviate this issue have been proposed in literature by either rotating or shifting the periodicity constraints. However, this results in a mismatch of the microstructure on opposing edges which may prevent cracks to cross the boundary and consequently limit the supported localization angles. Furthermore, in absence of a strategy that ensures a single localization band to arise in a fracturing RVE, it is difficult to formulate a generic expression for the length scale parameter that is used to regulate the energy dissipation, which plays an important role in obtaining RVE-size objective results. As an alternative to square (or cubical) RVEs, circular (or spherical) RVEs have been proposed in literature since they provide a response which is independent of the orientation due to shape of the RVE. However, it is shown in this work that the existing formulation with straightforward application of PBCs on a circular RVE fails to predict the correct softening behavior, due to over-constraining when cracks reach the boundary. Therefore, a new formulation of PBCs on a circular RVE is proposed, which allows for a single fully developed localization band under arbitrary angle. The performance of the new formulation is tested with a series of simulations where macroscopic strains are imposed under varying orientations. It is demonstrated that the circular RVE with the new formulation of PBCs successfully predicts a transversely isotropic response with full softening without the issue of mismatching microstructure as with previously developed remedies for the square RVE. In addition, it is shown that the length scale parameter is well-defined and independent of the orientation of the circular RVE.},

The neighbor search problem is first numerically converted into a general ray tracing problem so that it can be possible to utilize the hardware acceleration of RT cores. A new, general-purpose RT-based neighbor search algorithm is then proposed and benchmarked with a prevailing cell-based one. As a showcase, both algorithms are implemented into a GPU-based DEM code for simulating large-scale granular problems including packing, column collapse and debris flow. The overall simulation performance is examined with varying problem sizes and GPU specs. It demonstrates that the RT-based simulations are 10%–60% faster than the cell-based ones, depending on the simulated problems and GPU specs.

Inspired by the high-order FEM, this study presents a novel high-order collocation indirect BEM for solving three-dimensional high-frequency exterior acoustic problems. Due to the difficulty of evaluating hypersingular integrals on curved surface elements with complex density functions, the high-order BEM scheme for acoustic problems has long been a challenging task, especially for relatively large-scale problems. In the developed scheme, the Leis formulation is used to overcome the well-known nonuniqueness problem in the indirect BEM, and an auxiliary integral equation method is presented and employed to regularize the hypersingular integrals in this formulation. The derived regularized boundary integral formulation is mathematically simple and amenable to the elements of arbitrary shape and arbitrary variable interpolation order, and leads to a simple, efficient, and robust algorithm for the calculation of all integrals. Several benchmark examples are investigated to verify the performance of the proposed method. Results demonstrate that the present method is very effective in stimulating the far-field solution with large wavenumber.},

Then these identified interrelationships are represented by neural networks in an offline stage, where the training data are also generated based on the formulation devised through asymptotic analysis. Then for the upcoming online simulation, those desired local behaviors can be quickly captured without resolving the microstructural configurations.

This formulation is based on equilibrium equations in their integrated form, combined with the kinematic relations and sectional equations that link the internal forces to sectional deformation variables. The resulting first-order differential equations are approximated by the finite difference scheme and the boundary value problem is converted to an initial value problem using the shooting method. The article develops the theoretical framework based on the Navier–Bernoulli hypothesis, with a possible extension to shear-flexible beams. Numerical procedures for the evaluation of equivalent nodal forces and of the element tangent stiffness are presented in detail. Unlike standard finite element formulations, the present approach can increase accuracy by refining the integration scheme on the element level while the number of global degrees of freedom is kept constant. The efficiency and accuracy of the developed scheme are documented by seven examples that cover circular and parabolic arches, a spiral-shaped beam, and a spring-like beam with a zig-zag centerline. The proposed formulation does not exhibit any locking. No excessive stiffness is observed for coarse computational grids and the distribution of internal forces is not polluted by any oscillations. It is also shown that a cross effect in the relations between internal forces and deformation variables arises, that is, the bending moment affects axial stretching and the normal force affects the curvature. This coupling is theoretically explained in the Appendix.},

  abstract     = {Numerical modeling of two-phase flow in porous media has extensive applications in subsurface flow and petroleum industry. A comprehensive Maxwell–Stefan–Darcy (MSD) two-phase flow model has been developed recently, which takes into consideration the friction between two phases by a thermodynamically consistent way. In this article, we for the first time propose an efficient energy stable numerical method for the MSD model, which can preserve multiple important physical properties of the model. First, the proposed scheme can preserve the original energy dissipation law. This is achieved through a newly-developed energy factorization approach that leads to linear semi-implicit discrete chemical potentials. Second, the scheme preserves the famous Onsager&#39;s reciprocal principle and the local mass conservation law for both phases by introducing different upwind strategies for two phase saturations and applying the cell-centered finite volume method to the original formulation of the model. Third, by introducing two auxiliary phase velocities, the scheme has ability to guarantee the positivity of both saturations under proper conditions. Another distinct feature of the scheme is that the resulting discrete system is totally linear, well-posed and unbiased for each phase. Numerical results are also provided to show the excellent performance of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {The main idea of this work is an application of relative entropy in the numerical analysis of probabilistic divergence between original material tensors of the composite constituents and its effective tensor in the presence of material uncertainties. The homogenization method is based upon the deformation energy of the representative volume elements for the fiber-reinforced and particulate composites and uncertainty propagation begins with elastic moduli of the fibers, particles, and composite matrices. Relative entropy follows a mathematical model originating from Bhattacharyya probabilistic divergence and has been applied here for Gaussian distributions. The semi-analytical probabilistic method based on analytical integration of polynomial bases obtained via the least squares method fittings enables for determination of the basic probabilistic characteristics of the effective tensor and the relative entropies. The methodology invented in this work may be extended toward other probability distributions and relative entropies, for homogenization of nonlinear composites and also accounting for some structural interface defects.},

The first one is that the explicit expression of the transformation matrix can be directly obtained using a recurrence formula. The second one is that the calculation efficiency of the proposed method is very high because there is no need for iterative calculation. Three types of structure are used as examples to verify the proposed method. It is found that the lower-frequency eigenpairs calculated by the reduced model are very close to the exact ones obtained by the full model. Moreover, the calculation time of the proposed method is much less than that of the existing methods. It has been shown that the proposed method is reliable and effective.},

Resorting to the adjoint variable method, we derive the shape derivative (SD) with respect to a deformation (perturbation) of an arbitrary point on the target surface of acoustic scatterers. Successively, we represent the target surface with non-uniform rational B-spline patches and then discretize the SD in term of the associated control points (CPs), which are useful for manipulating a surface. To solve both the primary and adjoint problems, we apply the time-domain boundary element method (TDBEM) because it is the most appropriate when the analysis domain is the ambient air and thus infinitely large. The issues of the severe computational cost and instability of the TDBEM are resolved by exploiting the fast and stable TDBEM proposed by the present authors. Instead, since the TDBEM is mesh-based and employs the piecewise-constant element for space, we introduce some approximations in evaluating the discretized SD from the two solutions of TDBEM. By regarding the evaluation scheme as the computation of the gradient of the objective functional, given as the summation of the absolute value of the sound pressure over the predefined observation points, we can solve SO problems with a gradient-based non-linear optimization solver. To assess the developed SO system, we performed several numerical experiments from the perspective of verification and application with satisfactory results.},

The harmonic balance (HB) method and its variants have been the most widely-used approaches for such systems, but are either confined to low-order approximations or impaired by aliasing and improper-sampling problems. Here we propose a collocation-based harmonic balance framework to successfully unify and reconstruct the HB-like methods. Under this framework a new conditional identity, which exactly bridges the gap between frequency-domain and time-domain harmonic analyses, is discovered by introducing a novel aliasing matrix. Upon enforcing the aliasing matrix to vanish, we propose a powerful reconstruction harmonic balance (RHB) method that obtains extremely high-order (&gt;100) nonaliasing solutions, previously deemed out-of-reach, for a range of complex nonlinear systems including the cavitation bubble dynamics, the three-body problem and the two dimensional airfoil dynamics. We show that the present method is 2–3 orders of magnitude more accurate and simultaneously much faster than the state-of-the-art method. Hence, it has immediate applications in multidisciplinary problems where highly accurate periodic solutions are sought.},

While the displacement field is explicitly updated, the phase field is implicitly solved, with upper and lower bounds strictly and conveniently enforced. In particular, two important variants of the phase field approach, the AT1 and AT2 models, are equally easily implemented.

In this article, we present an element-based formulation of ES-FEM and FS-FEM methods allowing to implement the two methods in a standard finite element code with no modifications to its architecture. Moreover, the element-based formulation permits to easily manage any type of element, especially in 3D models where, to the best of the authors&#39; knowledge, only tetrahedral elements are used in FS-FEM applications found in the literature.

However, its wide application in engineering is limited due to low efficiency and convergence problems. The RIA-based modified reliability index approach (MRIA) appears to be very robust and accurate than RIA but yields inefficient for the most probable point (MPP) search with highly nonlinear probabilistic constraints. In this study, an enhanced modified reliability index approach (EMRIA) is developed to improve the efficiency and robustness of searching for MPP and is utilized for RBDO. In the EMRIA, an innovative active set using rigorous inequality is applied to construct the region of exploring for MPP, where the unnecessary probabilistic constraint could be eliminated adaptively during the iterative process. Moreover, the double loop strategy (DLS) is integrated into the EMRIA to strengthen the efficiency and robustness of large-scale RBDO problems. Two numerical examples demonstrated that the EMRIA is an efficient and robust method for MPP search in comparison with current first-order reliability methods. Six RBDO problems quoted also indicate that DLS-based EMRIA has good performance to solve complex RBDO problems.},

Unlike finite element limit analysis, DLO is formulated entirely in terms of discontinuities and can produce accurate solutions for problems involving singularities naturally, without the need for mesh refinement. In the homogenized model presented, masonry joints are reduced to interfaces, with sliding governed by an associative friction flow rule and blocks are assumed to be infinitely resistant. The model takes account of the interlock ratio of the masonry blocks, their aspect ratio and the cohesion and coefficient of friction of interfaces in both the vertical and horizontal directions. Results from the proposed model are compared with those from the literature, showing that complex failure mechanisms can be identified and that safe estimates of load carrying capacity can be obtained. Finally, to demonstrate the utility of the proposed modeling approach, it is applied to more complex problems involving interactions with other elements, such as voussoir arches and weak underlying soil layers.},

To improve the computational efficiency of the proposed LS under RIMU, the Kriging model is employed to reduce the model evaluation numbers in the two stages. For efficiently searching the design point, the Kriging model is constructed and adaptively updated in the first stage to accurately recognize the Markov chain candidate state, and then it is sequentially updated by the improved U learning function in the second stage to accurately estimate the failure probability bounds.

One key challenge for designing and optimizing these geometrically complicated structures lies in devising an effective geometric representation to characterize the system&#39;s spatially varying cellular evolution driven by objective sensitivities. A conventional discrete cellular structure, for example, a Voronoi diagram, whose representation relies on discrete Voronoi cells and faces, lacks its differentiability to facilitate large-scale, gradient-based topology optimizations. We propose a topology optimization algorithm based on a differentiable and generalized Voronoi representation that can evolve the cellular structure as a continuous field. The central piece of our method is a hybrid particle-grid representation to encode the previously discrete Voronoi diagram into a continuous density field defined in a Euclidean space. Based on this differentiable representation, we further extend it to tackle anisotropic cells, free boundaries, and functionally-graded cellular structures. Our differentiable Voronoi diagram enables the integration of an effective cellular representation into the state-of-the-art topology optimization pipelines, which defines a novel design space for cellular structures to explore design options effectively that were impractical for previous approaches. We showcase the efficacy of our approach by optimizing cellular structures with up to thousands of anisotropic cells, including femur bone and Odonata wing.},

On one hand, the method captures stresses and fluid fluxes more accurately than when using standard Lagrange elements, enabling a direct assessment of the fracture criterion at the crack tip and ensuring local mass conservation. On the other hand, the method avoids limitations for discrete crack analysis which adhere to isogeometric analysis. A crack is introduced directly in the physical domain. Due to the use of triangles, remeshing and crack path tracking are straightforward. During remeshing transfer of state vectors (displacement, fluid pressure) is required from the old to the new mesh. The transfer is done using a new approach which exploits a least-squares fit with the energy balance and conservation of mass as constraints. The versatility and accuracy to simulate free crack propagation are assessed for mode-I and mixed-mode fracture problems.},

  abstract     = {Typical strategies for reducing the computational cost of contact mechanics models use low-rank approximations. The underlying hypothesis is the existence of a low-dimensional subspace for the displacement field and a non-negative low-dimensional subcone for the contact pressure. However, given the local nature of contact, it seems natural to wonder whether low-rank approximations are a good fit for contact mechanics or not. In this article, we investigate some of their limitations and provide numerical evidence showing that contact pressure is linearly inseparable in many practical cases. To this end, we consider various mechanical problems involving nonadhesive frictionless contacts and analyze the performance of the low-rank models in terms of three different criteria, namely, compactness, generalization, and specificity.},

  abstract     = {The large fluctuation of uncertain parameters introduces a great challenge in the stability analysis of structures. To address this problem, a novel stochastic residual error based homotopy method is proposed in this article. This new method used the concept of homotopy to reconstruct a new governing equation for stochastic elastic buckling analysis, and the closed-form solutions of the isolated buckling eigenvalues and eigenvectors are obtained by the stochastic homotopy analysis method. On this basis, a p th order origin moment of the stochastic residual error with respect to the elastic buckling equation is defined. Then, the optimal form of the homotopy series can be determined automatically by minimizing the p th order origin moment, which overcomes the disadvantage of highly relying on sample values of the existing homotopy stochastic finite element method. Moreover, the proposed method is developed to deal with the stochastic closely spaced buckling eigenvalue problem. Three mathematical examples and three buckling eigenvalue examples, including a variable cross-section column, a 7-story frame, and a Kiewitt single-layer latticed spherical shell, are performed to illustrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing with the existing methods when dealing with large fluctuation of random parameters.},

Nematohydrodynamics equations are discretized using the SPH algorithm. Flow behavior, nematic ordering, topological defects, and vorticity correlation are calculated and discussed in detail. The spectrum of the kinetic energy with respect to the wavenumber is calculated at high particle resolution, and its slope at the different length scales is discussed. To exploit the SPH capabilities, pathlines of nematic particles are evaluated during the simulation. Finally, the mixing behavior of the active nematics is calculated as well and described qualitatively. The effects of two important parameters, namely, activity and elastic constant are investigated. It is shown that the activity intensifies the chaotic mixing nature of the active nematics, while the elastic constant behaves oppositely.},

  abstract     = {In the quest for a numerical method for surface waves and wave-induced effects applicable when linear or weakly nonlinear methods are insufficient, a three-dimensional numerical wave tank assuming fully-nonlinear potential-flow theory is proposed. When viscous-flow effects, breaking waves or other violent flow-phenomena are not of primary importance, potential-flow methods may have similar capability in capturing the involved physics as Navier–Stokes solvers while being potentially more accurate in handling wave-propagation mechanism and more computationally efficient. If made sufficiently accurate, efficient and numerically robust, fully-nonlinear potential flow models can therefore represent a powerful tool in the study of ocean waves and their interaction with marine structures, which is the main motivation behind the present work. The governing Laplace equation for the velocity potential is solved using the harmonic polynomial cell method, which is a field method giving high-order accuracy provided that the cells used to describe the water domain have no stretching or distortion. This can only be achieved in a grid with cubic cells, which leads to poor numerical efficiency unless measures are introduced to refine the grid locally. Here, to improve the efficiency using strictly cubic cells, an adaptive grid refinement technique is introduced. It is shown that this has the ability to improve the computational speed with a factor of up to 20 without sacrificing accuracy. Numerical results are shown to be in good agreement with highly accurate nonlinear reference solutions for regular and irregular waves of various steepness up to the limit of theoretical wave breaking. For long-crested irregular waves, significant discrepancies with a second-order theory for the crest-height distribution are identified, while the second-order theory appears to provide a better description of the crest height for the single short-crested irregular sea state simulated. Having demonstrated that the proposed numerical method accurately models nonlinear wave phenomena up to the limit of wave breaking, future work should seek to implement wave-body interaction capabilities. The adaptive grid refinement technique, which refines the grid dynamically depending on the position of boundaries of interest, is developed with this application in mind. Except from providing a robust way of dealing with wave-body intersection points, extending the method to account for wave-body interactions should therefore involve limited difficulty.},

  abstract     = {The large-deformation mechanics and multiphysics of continuous or fracturing partially saturated porous media under static and dynamic loads are significant in engineering and science. This article is devoted to a computational coupled large-deformation periporomechanics paradigm assuming passive air pressure for modeling dynamic failure and fracturing in variably saturated porous media. The coupled governing equations for bulk and fracture material points are formulated in the current/deformed configuration through the updated Lagrangian–Eulerian framework. It is assumed that the horizon of a mixed material point remains spherical and its neighbor points are determined in the current configuration. As a significant contribution, the mixed interface/phreatic material points near the phreatic line are explicitly considered for modeling the transition from partial to full saturation (vice versa) through the mixed peridynamic state concept. We have formulated the coupled constitutive correspondence principle and stabilization scheme in the updated Lagrangian–Eulerian framework for bulk and interface points. We numerically implement the coupled large deformation periporomechanics through a fully implicit fractional-step algorithm in time and a hybrid updated Lagrangian–Eulerian meshfree method in space. Numerical examples are presented to validate the implemented stabilized computational coupled large-deformation periporomechanics and demonstrate its efficacy and robustness in modeling dynamic failure and fracturing in variably saturated porous media.},

  abstract     = {Despite the increasing use of the particle finite element method (PFEM) in fluid flow simulation and the outstanding success of the Generalized- α $$ \alpha $$ (GA) time integration method, very little discussion has been devoted to their combined performance. This work aims to contribute in this regard by addressing three main aspects. First, it includes a detailed implementation analysis of the GA method in PFEM. The work recognizes and compares different implementation approaches from the literature, which differ mainly in the terms that are -interpolated (state variables or forces of momentum equation) and the type of treatment for the pressure in the time integration scheme. Second, the work compares the performance of the GA method against the Backward Euler and Newmark schemes for the solution of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. Third, the study is enriched by considering not only the classical velocity-pressure formulation but also the displacement-pressure formulation that is gaining interest in the fluid-structure interaction field. The work is carried out using various 2D and 3D benchmark problems such as the fluid sloshing, the solitary wave propagation, the flow around a cylinder, and the collapse of a cylindrical water column.},

  abstract     = {Solving linear equations and finding eigenvalues are essential tasks in many simulations for engineering applications, but these tasks often cause performance bottlenecks. In this work, the hierarchical subspace evolution method (HiSEM), a hierarchical iteration framework for solving scientific computing problems with solution locality, is proposed. In HiSEM, the original problem is converted to a corresponding minimization function. The problem is decomposed into a series of subsystems. Subspaces and their weights are established for the subsystems and evolve in each iteration. The subspaces are calculated based on local equations and knowledge of physical problems. A small-scale minimization problem determines the weights of the subspaces. The solution system can be hierarchically established based on the subspaces. As the iterations continue, the degrees of freedom gradually converge to an accurate solution. Two parallel algorithms are derived from HiSEM. One algorithm is designed for symmetric positive definite linear equations, and the other is designed for generalized eigenvalue problems. The linear solver and eigensolver performance is evaluated using a series of benchmarks and a tower model with a complex topology. Algorithms derived from HiSEM can solve a super large-scale problem with high performance and good scalability.},
