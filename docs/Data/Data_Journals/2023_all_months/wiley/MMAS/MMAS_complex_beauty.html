The frictional damping is only distributed in the part of the string&#39;s or riser&#39;s domain, and its dissipative effect is transmitted to the other equation through the coupling. Firstly, we prove the existence and uniqueness result for solution of coupled system. Next, using a semigroup approach combined with the multipliers technique, we obtain that the two coupled systems are not exponentially stable, provide precise polynomial decay rates for their energy functionals, respectively, regardless of whether the friction damping only acts on the string equation or the riser equation, and give the optimality of polynomial decay rates. Finally, we compare the case of friction damping acting on string and riser equations simultaneously with the previous two cases. The results show that the case of friction damping acting on string and riser equations simultaneously is exponential stable, while the case of friction damping only acting on string or riser equations is polynomial stable and the decay result of friction damping only acts on the string equation is better than that only acts on the riser equation.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we substantiate the appositeness of the mode-matching technique to study the scattering response of bridging elastic plates connecting two flexible duct regions of different heights. We present two different solution schemes to analyze the structure-borne and fluid-borne radiations in the elastic plate-bounded waveguide. The first scheme supplements the mode-matching technique with the so-called tailored-Galerkin approach that uses a solution ansatz with homogeneous and integral parts corresponding to the vibrations of the bridging elastic plate and the cavity, respectively. In the second scheme, we supplement the mode-matching technique with the modal approach wherein the displacement of the bridging elastic plate is projected onto the eigenmodes of the cavity. To handle the non-orthogonality of the eigenfunctions, we invoke generalized orthogonality relations. An advantage of the proposed mode-matching schemes is that they provide a convenient way of incorporating a variety of edge conditions on the joints of the plates, including clamped, pin-joint, or restraint connections. The numerical analysis of the waveguide scattering problems substantiates that edge connections on the joints have a significant impact on the scattering energies and transmission loss. Furthermore, it appears that the transmission loss and structural vibration attenuation in the expansion chamber may be improved by adjusting chamber dimensions and excitation modes.},

Aforementioned motions, determined by Lorentz force in nonrelativistic case, thereby are explored in polar coordinates to present them in a quasi-periodic motions in a general case (in equatorial plane of Earth). Thus, the system of momentum equations has been successfully solved numerically or semianalytically in each case and the resulting semianalytical solving algorithm can clarify the quasi-periodic structure of such family of solutions (with reduction of their geometric symmetry around the Earth in an equatorial plane).},

After evaluating the particular solution, 3D-LMFS method can be employed to evaluate the homogeneous solution. The proposed 3D-LMFS algorithms construct 3D artificial surfaces where source points and then the collocation procedure propose by using the fundamental solutions in each 3D surface.

  abstract     = {To describe the spread of COVID-19, we develop a simple susceptible-vaccinated-infectious-recovery (SVIR) model. The transmission rate in this model incorporates the impact of caution and sense of safety on the transmission rate, making it biologically valid. The biological validity of the model is demonstrated by proving that a positive bound solution exists for this model. We find a formula for the basic reproduction function and use it to discuss the local asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium (DFE). The existence of the endemic equilibrium (EE) is shown to be dependent not only on the basic reproduction number value but also on the level of caution. By fitting the model to COVID-19 data from several countries, we estimate parameter values with 95 % confidence intervals. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the time-series solution is affected by both the level of caution and the sense of safety, indicating the importance of population behavior in disease spread. We introduce an optimal control problem for vaccination and show that the optimal strategy exists and is unique. Our simulations demonstrate that optimal vaccination is most effective for low sense of safety, leading to fewer infections and lower costs. For high levels of sense of safety, vaccines may have a negative impact, highlighting the importance of combining vaccination efforts with educational initiatives.},

This paper studies asymptotic collective behaviors of a delayed multi-particle system with multiple processes while particles interact directionally and locally. Up to now, the studies on dynamic behaviors of multi-particle systems do not involve limited processing capacity, that is, the information queuing phenomenon is ignored. To this aim, we introduce multiple processes to formulate the evolution of a delayed multi-particle system. To optimize the delay parameters, we choose the greedy principle to set the processing order. The main idea is to decompose the velocity into each process and use functional differential equation theory and matrix theory to constrain the velocity variation rate while the processing order is fixed. As the new results, in the non-critical and general situation, when the time delay is less than or equal to the threshold value and the eigenvalue 1 of the average matrix is semi-simple, we achieve the criterion of flocking and multi-cluster with exponential convergence rate involving multiple processes. Furthermore, we get the lower bound estimate of the processing capacity.},

The present article studies how far this possibility of reinfection impacts the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Considering a six compartment mathematical model, we have studied the transmission dynamics of the disease and presented the situations that will lead to endemic-free (also endemic) state. Considering the COVID-19 waves in India during the spread of SARS-CoV-2, delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, and Omicron variant, the parameters of the model are estimated corresponding to these three situations. As expected, the obtained parameters lie in the stable region of endemic state. The changes in dynamics of the system with the reinfection is studied, and it shows that its effects are not neglible. Even finite value of reinfection can significantly vary the number of infected individuals, and it could explain secondary (smaller) rise in the COVID-19 cases after the COVID-19 wave. We also study the dynamics of the system through fractional order differential equations.},

A penalty method is proposed to handle the inextensibility constraint by relaxation, allowing a simple computer implementation and an affordable computational load compared to the full mixed formulation. To handle the high-order derivatives in the stress jump across the membrane, which arise due to the high geometric order of the Helfrich functional, we employ higher degree finite elements for spatial discretization. The time integration scheme relies on the double composition of the Crank–Nicolson scheme to achieve faster fourth-order convergence behavior. Additionally, an adaptive time-stepping strategy based on a third-order temporal integration error estimation is implemented. We address the main features of the proposed method, which is benchmarked against existing numerical and experimental results.

By doing this, we investigate the Hall–Killing–Fermi effect on the charged particle, then we define new types of Fermi–Walker magnetic curves corresponding to the Killing magnetic field. We carefully construct the Fermi–Walker character of the magnetic field to prove the parallelism of the magnetic trajectories and uniformly accelerated motion of the charged particle. It leads to defining a very special family of magnetic fields, that is, Fermi–Walker uniform magnetic fields. Moreover, we use the Killing feature of the magnetic field to show that the Frenet–Serret scalars and quasislopes of the magnetic curves must meet particular differential equations that lead to obtaining some geometric interpretations of the magnetic trajectories. Last but not the least, both of these two characters allow us to define Killing and Fermi–Walker electric vector fields influencing the motion of the charged particle experiencing the Lorentz force in the three-dimensional setting.},

  abstract     = {A second-order accurate, linear numerical method is analyzed for the Landau–Lifshitz equation with large damping parameters. This equation describes the dynamics of magnetization, with a non-convexity constraint of unit length of the magnetization. The numerical method is based on the second-order backward differentiation formula in time, combined with an implicit treatment for the linear diffusion term from the harmonic mapping part and explicit extrapolation for the nonlinear terms. Afterward, a projection step is applied to normalize the numerical solution at a point-wise level. This numerical scheme has shown extensive advantages in the practical computations for the physical model with large damping parameters, which comes from the fact that only a linear system with constant coefficients (independent of both time and the updated magnetization) needs to be solved at each time step, and has greatly improved the numerical efficiency. Meanwhile, a theoretical analysis for this linear numerical scheme has not been available. In this paper, we provide a rigorous error estimate of the numerical scheme, in the discrete norm, under suitable regularity assumptions and reasonable ratio between the time step size and the spatial mesh size. In particular, the projection operation is nonlinear, and a stability estimate for the projection step turns out to be highly challenging. Such a stability estimate is derived in details, which will play an essential role in the convergence analysis for the numerical scheme, if the damping parameter is greater than 3.},

This research highlighted on generalized nonlinear LFLWR model, and LFVIM is employed to derive non-differentiable solutions of the suggested model. The existence and uniqueness of the solution of LFLWR model have also been established. Furthermore, several exemplary instances are discussed to demonstrate the success of implementing LFVIM to the proposed model. The numerical simulations for each of the cases have also been shown. Additionally, the obtained solutions of the suggested model have been compared with the solutions of the classical LWR model with non-differentiable conditions in few examples.

In this work, we propose a novel fractional-order delayed Myc/E2F/miR-17-92 network model that revels the relation between miR-17-92, E2F, and Myc. Taking advantage of Laplace transform, we obtain the characteristic equation of the established fractional-order delayed Myc/E2F/miR-17-92 network model. By virtue of stability theorem and bifurcation criterion of fractional-order dynamical equation, a novel delay-independent condition guaranteeing the stability and the generation of bifurcation phenomenon of the involved model is acquired. By exploiting a proper extended mixed controller (including P ⁢ D ϵ $$ P{D}&amp;#x0005E;{\epsilon } $$ controller and delayed feedback controller), we efficiently control the stability domain and the emergence of bifurcation for the the involved model. By utilizing another suitable extended mixed controller (including controller and hybrid controller), we can successfully adjust the stability domain and the emergence of bifurcation for the the involved model. The research indicates that delay plays a vital role in stabilizing system and controlling bifurcation of the fractional-order delayed Myc/E2F/miR-17-92 network model. Computer experiment results illustrate the scientificity of the gained key analytical outcomes.

The main difficulty lies in the fact that the semiflow generated here does not admit the order-preserving property. Meanwhile, this new model brings some new challenges due to the unboundedness of the nonlinear term. We overcome these difficulties to obtain the boundedness of traveling waves with the speed c &gt; c min $$ c&amp;gt;{c}_{\mathrm{min}} $$ by some analysis techniques firstly and then prove the existence of traveling waves by employing Lyapunov–LaSalle theorem and Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem.

Meanwhile, due to the application of SAV approach, the unconditional energy stability of the numerical scheme is also derived, without any restriction on the time step size.

Prey harvesting will lead to enriched dynamics to help us realize ecological phenomena such as the extinction of some species with a positive initial density when the harvesting rate is larger than a critical level. All these may be very useful for biological management. Based on these reasons, firstly, we analyze the existence conditions and stability of different equilibrium points to predict the eventual state of the given system. In particular, the existence of cusps of Codimensions 2 and 3 is proved. Secondly, we successfully demonstrate the presence of Hopf bifurcation and saddle-node bifurcation for specified parameter values. To prove the limit cycle stability of Hopf bifurcation, we use the first Lyapunov coefficient for illustration. As well as calculating the universal expansion near the cusp, the Bogdanov–Takens bifurcations of Codimensions 2 and 3 are investigated. If the parameters are chosen fittingly, there will be a stable or an unstable limit cycle, a homoclinic loop, two limit cycles, or both a limit cycle and a homoclinic loop simultaneously in the system. Finally, numerical simulations are performed using MATLAB to illustrate the theoretical results.},

In fact, in order to facilitate modeling and dynamical analysis, these models assume that the probability of infected cells staying in different infection stages obeys an exponential distribution. However, this does not accurately describe the process of HIV infection from target cells to budding of virus, that is, fusion-reverse transcription-reproductivity formation-budding process. Therefore, to expand the idea of HIV modeling, in this paper, we first establish the HIV integral-differential equation model that obeys the general distribution, and then degenerate the model into a subclass ODEs model under the assumption of gamma distribution. Finally, an equivalent age structure model is given, and numerical simulations are conducted to describe the integral-differential equations model. It is worth mentioning that ODEs models with subclasses can provide good numerical implementations for age structure as well as other PDEs HIV models. This is another important purpose of our work.},

  abstract     = {In real-world problems, data suffer from measurement errors, data staleness, and repeated measurements, which make data uncertain. To consider the uncertainty of data, the concept of giving each data feature as a multidimensional Gaussian distribution has been utilized. In 2021, support vector machines with an ϵ $$ \epsilon $$ insensitive zone pinball loss (UPinSVMs) for uncertain data classification was proposed, where ϵ $$ \epsilon $$ is a positive number. The UPinSVMs bring noise insensitivity, stability for resampling, and increased model sparsity. However, the value of ϵ $$ \epsilon $$ is known to be specified. In order to improve the performance, we combine the generalized pinball loss (( ϵ 1 , ϵ 2 ) $$ {\epsilon}_1,{\epsilon}_2\Big) $$ -Mod-Pin-SVM) into the uncertain classification, term as UGPinSVMs, where ϵ 1 , ϵ 2 $$ {\epsilon}_1,{\epsilon}_2 $$ are two positive numbers. The generalized pinball loss is an optimal insensitive zone pinball loss and is an extension of existing loss functions that also addresses the issues of noise insensitivity and resampling instability. We solve the primal quadratic programming problems by transforming individuals into unconstrained optimization using an efficient stochastic gradient descent algorithm. More specially, we have introduced verified theorems that are related to our approaches and investigated scatter minimization. The results from several benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms the existing classifier in terms of accuracy and statistical analysis. Furthermore, the application of our framework to the crop recommendation dataset is also examined.},

We present a variational and operator formulation for the problem and derive sufficient conditions for the existence of trapped waves. We give examples of floating obstacles supporting trapped waves in a discretely stratified fluid in different obstacle configurations with a variable number of layers. Some conclusions regarding the dependence of the sufficient condition on the number of fluid layers are drawn, considering whether the sufficient condition is of the potential or algebraic type.},

First, the dynamical behavior of the model is investigated, including the positivity and boundedness of solutions, the calculation regarding basic reproduction number, the existence and stability of equilibrium, and the uniform persistence of the model. The theoretical results show that the basic reproduction number completely decided the dynamical properties of the model. Second, the parameters and current basic reproduction number specific to the model are fitted and estimated considering the actual data of HPV infection and secondary cervical cancer cases in Xinjiang from January 2003 to December 2019. Furthermore, the sensitivity of main parameters to the basic reproduction number is discussed by the numerical simulations. Finally, some practical control strategies are proposed to control the further spread of HPV infection and cervical cancer in the region.},

Furthermore, a distributed fixed-time consensus protocol is proposed to remove the dependence on system&#39;s initial state. Under the fixed-time consensus protocol, it is proved that an upper bound of the system&#39;s convergence time can be estimated. Sufficient conditions are given to ensure that all agents can achieve consensus in finite time and fixed time, respectively.

In the case of the constrained minimization problem, solutions are shown to be positive with undetermined wave propagation constants, but in the min–max approach, the wave propagation constants can be prescribed. The quadratic nonlinearity introduces some interesting properties not commonly observed in other coupled systems in the context of nonlinear optics, such as the system not accepting any semi-trivial solutions, meaning that optical solitons cannot be observed when, say, one of the beams is off. Additionally, the second harmonic always remains positive.},

This approach enables us to identify a ring in the energy space for nontrivial solutions to exist, energy (norm) thresholds for their existence, and upper bounds on their velocity. In the case of soft on-site potentials, the proof of existence of periodic traveling wave solutions is facilitated by a variational approach based on the mountain pass theorem.

The fixed points of the system and their local stability are investigated. The criteria for Neimark–Sacker bifurcation and period-doubling bifurcation are presented. The sufficient conditions for global asymptotic stability of the interior fixed point are derived. The chaotic behavior of the system is stabilized by applying a hybrid control strategy. We conclude with a numerical simulation that strengthens our theoretical discussion and provides a way to observe the complex behavior of the system.},

The existence of real solutions to the dispersion relation demands a further stability condition on the layer velocities. From the variational formulation, after certain choices of background steady flow, results a nonlinear spectral problem, which upon a sensible linearization gives a geometric condition ensuring the existence of trapped modes (within the limits set by the stability condition). Symmetries reduce the global problem to the first quadrant of the velocity space. Examples are shown of configurations of obstacles that are both independent of the layer velocities and dependent only on their difference. Future developments are suggested.},

Considering the QVNTMNNs as a switching system and utilizing Lyapunov theorem as well as inequality techniques, several sufficient criteria depending on the state-dependent switching parameters to guarantee global dissipativity and exponential dissipativity of QVNTMNNs with time-varying delays are obtained in the form of quaternion-valued linear matrix inequalities (QVLMIs) and corresponding complex-valued liner matrix inequalities (CVLMIs). Moreover, the positive invariant set, global attractive set, and exponential attractive set of QVNTMNNs with time-varying delays can also be derived.

Measuring population immunity to assess the epidemiology of health and disease is a challenging task and is currently an active area of research. However, to meet these challenges, mathematical modeling is an effective technique in shaping the population dynamics that can help disease control. In this paper, we introduce a susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) model and a susceptible–exposed–infected–recovered–deceased (SEIRD) model based on conformable space-time partial differential equations (PDEs) for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As efficient analytical tools, we present new modifications based on the fractional exponential rational function method (ERFM) and an analytical technique based on the Adomian decomposition method for obtaining the solutions for the proposed models. These analytical approaches are more efficacious for obtaining analytical solutions for nonlinear systems of PDEs with conformable derivatives. The interesting result of this paper is that it yields new exact and approximate solutions to the proposed COVID-19 pandemic models with conformable space-time partial derivatives.},

  abstract     = {Numerous classical models of thermostats have been analyzed in the literature, and while existence and uniqueness results have been established, the investigation of other properties, such as stability, can present significant challenges. Therefore, there is a need for fractional mathematical models that are nonlocal problems and allow for the straightforward study of the asymptotic behavior of their solutions. However, solving these problems is often exceedingly complex or even impossible, necessitating the use of numerical methods to obtain approximate solutions. The focus of this research is a generalized boundary value problem that is based on a classical thermostat model. Our initial step involves determining the associated integral equation for the problem at hand. The properties of existence and uniqueness are proved by exploiting the classical contraction principle of Banach together with another kind called - -contraction. Afterwards, thanks to the Bernstein polynomials and fractional matrix of derivative, the approximate solutions of our nonlinear fractional thermostat model problem are obtained. This approach utilizes the Legendre operational matrix of fractional derivatives in combination with a truncated Legendre series for the numerical integration of fractional differential equations. By doing so, the problem can be reduced to solving a system of algebraic equations, resulting in significant simplification. This method has been successfully used to solve both linear and nonlinear fractional differential equations. Finally, an example on this type of problem have been studied and the approximate solution are plotted.},

The breather solutions of the higher-order dNLS are obtained for the first time. We show that the rational solutions and breather solutions of the higher-order dNLS equation yield the counterparts of the integrable fourth-order NLS equation under proper continuous limits. Most importantly, we also explore the gauge equivalent equation of the higher-order dNLS equation from the point of view of the continuous limit theory. We make integrable discretization for the linear spectrum problem of the integrable generalized Heisenberg ferromagnetic equation that is just the gauge equivalent structure of the LPD equation. Compatibility condition of the discrete linear spectrum problem leads to a discrete integrable generalized Heisenberg Ferromagnetic equation. It is revealed that the discrete linear spectrum problem of the discrete integrable generalized ferromagnetic equation converges to the corresponding spectrum problem of the integrable generalized Feisenberg spin model in the continuum limit.In addition, with the help of the method of linear combinations for the conserved fluxes and densities, the conservation laws of the integrable higher-order dNLS equation converge to the homologous results of the LPD equation.},

  abstract     = {We consider an epidemiological model with the four classical compartments of susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered population. We add a new compartment that is supposed to describe, for a limited time, individuals that are protected from the epidemic through vaccination or medication, for instance. We model the protection phase by an age-structured partial differential equation. The age is the time since an individual entered the protection phase. The model is then reduced by integration on the characteristics to a differential-difference system with delay. The discrete delay represents the limited duration of the protection phase. After establishing the basic properties of the model, we show that the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number is less than one and is unstable when this number is greater than one. Furthermore, we show that even if there is no mortality during the protection phase and the basic reproduction number is greater than one, the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. The proofs of the global asymptotic stability of both equilibria are based on carefully constructed Lyapunov functions. To complete this study on the global dynamics, we discuss some results on weak and strong uniform persistence of the disease. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to illustrate and complete our main results.},

  abstract     = {In human societies, memory has a significant impact on the procedure of progression and control of epidemics. Therefore, fractional differential equations govern an epidemic model, including the memory effect. Since infectious diseases can spread from one place to another, human movement impacts the prevalence of such diseases. In this study, we present a two-patch model for tuberculosis with fractional order and exogenous re-infection, in which susceptible individuals can move without any obstacle between the patches. The present work establishes the effect of population movement and the backward bifurcation phenomenon on the prevalence of the tuberculosis epidemic with fractional-order derivatives. Furthermore, to show that the proposed model has backward bifurcation, we provide some conditions between the model&#39;s parameters, so in this case, the model of tuberculosis has numerous boundary points. We show the tuberculosis model can exhibit backward bifurcation neither in case of exogenous re-infection, with some conditions, nor in the situation that the model is vacant from any re-infection. In contrast, the disease-free equilibrium of the model is globally asymptotically stable when . Furthermore, we investigate the fractional-order derivative on the spread of infection. The results show that can perform the function of adventure or expertise of people about the disease background.},

  abstract     = {The dynamics of food consumption by higher trophic level is complicated as its availability, choice, and consequently their development. The top predator interference has a strong influence on the dynamic structure of the tritrophic food chain system. The proposed article deals with the characteristic features of a three-tire modified Leslie–Gower model with a one-prey two-predator system with the assumption of multiple gestation delays. The intermediate predator of the food chain is taken as a specialist type, whereas the growth of top predator is assumed by sexual reproduction. Two different response functions named Monod–Haldane (M-H) and Beddington–DeAngelis (B-D) are considered for the modeling of system dynamics. The population densities of intermediate and top predators are assumed to be affected by two different gestation delays. The boundedness and positive equilibria and their stability conditions are examined theoretically for the delay-free system. The local and global stability conditions of the delayed system are also determined. With the help of normal form theory and central manifold arguments, the properties of bifurcating periodic solutions are carried out. The numerical computation is performed to validate our analytical findings that show the different dynamical outcomes such as periodic and chaotic dynamics. The Hopf-bifurcation scenario for different parameters of the model system is well studied. Further, the stability behavior of multiple delays for the different cases is investigated. The system shows chaotic behavior when the gestation delay of intermediate predators is large enough. It is also observed that the top predator density is highly fluctuating through the creation of chaos by the inclusion of time delay. Finally, the time delay destabilizing effect is noticed for three-way interactions among prey, intermediate predator, and top predator, highlighting its significance in chaotic dynamics.},

One of the delays denotes the time taken for digestion of the prey, and the other reflects the negative feedback of the predator&#39;s density. Taking into account of the economic profit, linear predator harvesting and prey harvesting have been incorporated into the proposed predator–prey system. From the biological viewpoint, we discuss the sufficient conditions for the existence of nontrivial positive equilibrium point. By jointly using the stability theory of fractional differential-algebraic equations and the bifurcation theory, we study the delay-induced instability and Hopf bifurcations. Finally, the correctness of the theoretical analysis is verified by numerical simulations, and the effects of delays, economic profit, and fractional exponents on the stability of the system are explored.},

The phaseless data are the modulus of the tangential component of the far-field pattern measured on the unit sphere and generated by the scatterer as well as the electric dipoles. Based on the superpositions of two electric dipoles with different positions and polarization vectors as the incident fields, the translation invariance property of the phaseless far-field pattern corresponding to a single incident wave can be broken. A rigorous argument is given to illustrate that the location, shape, and boundary conditions of the obstacle or the refractive index of the medium can be uniquely determined by the phaseless far-field data. Different from the existing method, we do not need to introduce an additional reference sphere. Thus our method makes the argument of uniqueness much simpler and clearer.},

In the proposed technique, we approximate the unknown functions via Bws, and then with the help of Bw operator of fractional integration and LS-SVR, we reduce the problem to an algebraic system.

  abstract     = {Present geophysical model analyzes the propagation characteristics of torsional wave in an inhomogeneous viscoelastic fiber-reinforced layer sandwiched between superior porous layer and transversely isotropic piezoelectric subspace with imperfect interfaces. Porous layer and intermediate reinforced layer are endowed with initial stress and corrugated interfaces, whereas the lower piezoelectric half space possesses rectangular cavity at the welded contact. Earth&#39;s adjacent layers near mountainous region often endowed with initial stresses resemble the present geological setup. The material properties of intermediate layer are considered to be varying exponentially. Particular cases have been deduced for electrically open and short condition for validation with the standard Love wave expressions. Effects of the relevant parameters on resultant torsional velocity have been explored through numerical simulation and depicted for electrically short and open conditions. Findings of present model may be utilized in the field of signal testing, sensors design, seismic acoustic wave (SAW) devices, and geophysical application concerned with torsional wave based on non-destructive evaluation.},

  abstract     = {The varied applications of the aggregation and breakage equations in several fields of science have attracted many researchers to explore accurate novel methods to calculate their solutions. Due to the complexity of these models, the exact solutions are computable only for a few cases of aggregation and breakage kernel parameters. So, to obtain solutions for physically relevant kernels, various numerical and semi-analytical approaches have been explored. It is observed in the literature that the numerical methods are accurate, but they require some unrealistic assumptions. This has led to the development of semi-analytical methods that need fewer parameters and are bereft of discretization of the variables. The researchers explore accurate and less time-consuming methods to solve such equations. So, the objective of this article is the introduction of novel and accurate semi-analytical techniques to solve the pure aggregation and breakage equations. We have used the Laplace optimized decomposition method (LODM) to calculate the series solution for the aggregation equation and the Laplace Adomian decomposition method (LADM) to solve pure breakage equation. The novelty of this work is that it deals with the theoretical convergence of the LADM and LODM solutions toward the exact solutions. In addition to this, several numerical test cases are presented to validate our theoretical findings. For the aggregation equation, LODM results are compared with the solutions obtained via well-developed finite volume technique. The methods are found to be highly accurate to solve these partial integro-differential equations.},

The suggested controller can stabilize the chaotic system excellently with a continuous and smooth control law even without knowing the boundaries and in the presence of unknown disturbances due to the model uncertainties.

In this research, fractional diffusion equation for different functions has been solved using fractional derivative form with variable-order (VO) to predict the diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Comparison of the obtained results with the available experimental data and mathematical calculations shows that the use of VO form can predict the viral behavior more accurately. The main advantage of considering a VO fractional derivatives instead of a constant-order fractional derivative or classical derivative is accurately predicting the behavior of propagation of microorganisms over large time and dimensional scales. In addition, to the specified SARS-CoV-2 virus, the method presented in this study will be able to investigate the diffusion pattern of all environmental pollutants at the nanoscale/microscale, including carcinogenic compounds, such as biogenic amines in aqueous and porous media. The obtained results manifest a high accuracy of mathematical approach which provides helpful information to urban and health planners/managers worldwide to manage other possible outbreaks.},

Assuming some suitable conditions on the time-dependent delay term and the coefficients of feedback (delayed or not), we study the exponential stability of the concerned hyperbolic-parabolic system. Due to the presence of the time-varying delay term, the corresponding spatial operator is also time dependent. Using classical semigroup theory with Kato&#39;s variable norm approach, we first show the existence and uniqueness of the Navier-Stokes system with time delay, acting in the boundary or interior.

  abstract     = {In recent research, fear, refuge, and harvesting have been highlighted, but their combined impact must also be explored. We investigate the combined effects of these three ecologically important factors in the context of a prey–predator system using Holling type II as an interaction term. By using the parametric conditions, we can determine the existence of biologically feasible equilibria with their local and global stability. We investigate transcritical, Saddle-node, Hopf, backward, Bogdanov–Takens bifurcations about different equilibria theoretically and numerically. We observe that the system is stable for lower and higher values of catchability effect and harvesting parameters. And the system shows stable behavior for a high value of fear and refuge parameters. Our model is extended by considering fear, refuge, and harvesting as time-dependent parameters. Nonautonomous systems exhibit periodic solutions when the corresponding autonomous system is stable. Further, the nonautonomous system shows complex dynamics such as higher periods, chaos and bursting patterns whenever the associated autonomous system goes through limit cycle oscillations.},

The temporal discretization of the first scheme is carried out by a second-order fully implicit scheme, which requires an iterative method. Thanks to the circulant matrix of spatial discretization, we significantly reduce the computational costs of matrix-array multiplications and memory requirements via the discrete Fourier transform. The considered scheme is shown to preserve the total mass and energy in a discrete sense, and the rate of convergence is proved, without any restriction on the grid ratio, to be of the order of in the discrete -norm with time step and mesh size . To overcome the challenge of nonlinearity, we also constructed two other schemes based on improved scalar auxiliary variable approaches by transforming the CSBEs into an equivalent new system that involves solving linear systems with constant coefficients at each time step. Furthermore, their algorithms are supplied, and the time-consuming challenge resulting from the coupled problem is addressed. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the excellent long-time conservation behaviors of the presented schemes and to verify their effectiveness and correctness.},

Firstly, according to the Lyapunov functional method, inequality technique and the designed adaptive control strategy, the algebraic criteria of stability, and projective lag synchronization are derived by adjusting the control gain parameters in the controller. The obtained sufficient conditions are simple and easy to verify. Different from the traditional feedback controller, the adaptive controller can adjust its characteristics according to the system model, and external disturbance makes the system have better control performance. Besides, unlike the existing ones, this stability and synchronization problem is directly analyzed by constructing some new Lyapunov functionals with state variables and state variable derivatives. Finally, the effectiveness and practicability of the results are verified by numerical examples.},

The fibers cannot penetrate each other but can slide with respect to each other in the in-plane directions. The sliding is bounded by a contact function, which is chosen loose. The partial clamp and the loose contact lead to a domain partitioning, with different expected behaviors on each of the four subdomains. The homogenization is made via the periodic unfolding method, with an additional dimension reduction.

Unfortunately, the identification of the said ranking—called the Kemeny ranking—is known to be a computationally expensive task. In this paper, we study different ways of computing the Kemeny ranking with quantum optimization algorithms, and in particular, we provide some alternative formulations for the search for the Kemeny ranking as an optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this problem is addressed with quantum techniques. We propose four different ways of formulating the problem, one novel to this work. Two different quantum optimization algorithms—Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and Quantum Adiabatic Computing—are used to evaluate each of the different formulations. The experimental results show that the choice of the formulation plays a big role on the performance of the quantum optimization algorithms.},

Chasing the accuracy and comprehensiveness, our model has to be improved with the following elements: neutrality of the nonlinear part and being effected under time delays in the both of straight and neutral parts of the nonlinearity. Since the proposed neural network is novel, so we need to make use of a novel Lyapunov functional correspondingly to globally asymptotic stabilization of the neural network under investigation. Prior to this process, it is necessary to present a uniqueness criterion for solutions of the proposed neural network. To this aim, the well-known M-matrix technique of the linear algebra is applied that guarantees existence of a unique equilibrium point of the considered Cohen–Grossberg neural network. Numerical perspective of this investigation leads us to some numerical prototypes that justify our stability criterion is applicable.

First, we obtain the expression of magnetization orientation into the two faraway domains, then characterize the static magnetization profile under the action of magnetoelastic and transverse magnetic fields. Next, we introduce a trial function (Schryer and Walker type). After that, by adopting the small angle approximation formalism, we derive the explicit expression of key quantities such as propagating transverse domain wall profile, excitation angle, transverse domain wall velocity, mobility, and displacement. Finally, we present the numerical illustrations of derived analytical results and find that they are in qualitatively good agreement with the recent numerical simulations and experimental observations.},

Those systems are called switched systems with state reset. We show that it is possible to analyze the state trajectories of a switched system with state reset by considering suitable switched systems without state resets, that is, with continuous state trajectories. We establish sufficient conditions for the stability of switched systems with state reset using the associated systems without reset. Moreover, introducing some restrictions, we also derive simple algebraic stability conditions. The obtained results are used in numerical examples to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {In this manuscript, we append the hospitalization, diagnosed and isolation compartments to the classic SEIR model to design a new COVID-19 epidemic model. We further subdivide the isolation compartment into asymptomatic infected and symptomatic infected compartments. For validity of the purposed model, we prove the existence of a unique solution and prove the positivity and boundedness of the solution. To study disease dynamics, we compute equilibrium points and the reproduction number R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ . We also investigate the local and global stabilities at both of the equilibrium points. Sensitivity analysis will be performed to observe the effect of transmission parameters on . For optimal control analysis, we design two different optimal control problems by taking different optimal control approaches. Firstly, we add an isolation compartment in the newly designed model, and secondly, three parameters describing non-pharmaceutical behaviors such as educating people to take precautionary measures, providing intensive medical care with medication, and utilizing resources by government are added in the model. We set up optimality conditions by using Pontryagin&#39;s maximum principle and develop computing algorithms to solve the conditions numerically. At the end, numerical solutions will be displayed graphically with discussion.},

The time-fractional derivative in the model problem is described in terms of Liouville–Caputo. In order to handle the weak singularity at the initial time, we use a graded mesh technique for discretization of multiterm temporal fractional derivatives. The space derivatives are approximated by means of a compact finite difference (CFD) method. The proposed method is analyzed for its stability and convergence. Two numerical examples are considered to demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of the method. It is shown that the proposed graded mesh technique provides an optimal rate of convergence in time direction for the problem with nonsmooth exact solution, while the method on the uniform mesh yields a nonoptimal rate of convergence.},

We provide different approximately dual frames of VVNSG frames and give the corresponding reconstruction error bounds. In particular, for a special class of VVNSG frames that are related to painless VVNSG frames, we show that the approximately dual frames carry the VVNSG structure, which is very important since there exist fast analysis and reconstruction algorithms for VVNSG frames. We also provide a method to construct the special class of VVNSG Bessel sequences. Finally, a constructive example is given to illustrate the theoretical results.},

Specifically, we implement the nonhomogeneous Riemann solver (NHRS) scheme in order to investigate the unsteady planar flow of an isentropic, inviscid compressible fluid in the presence of dust particles. The principle of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy governs the dynamical behavior of a fluid. The Rusanov scheme is also implemented to examine the dusty gas flow model for comparison and validation. One of the important characteristics of the NHRS technique is its capability to compute the numerical flux corresponding to the real states of solution in the absence of a Riemann solution. The numerical results exhibit that the NHRS system outperforms the Rusanov scheme and validates the ability to simulate the dusty gas flow model with strong shocks and rarefaction waves accurately. Finally, more sophisticated models in applied science can be solved using the NHRS scheme.},

Here, we suggest an intermediate error estimation of low order, at the beginning of the integration, that can be used for the reconsideration of the step length before this is completed. This requires the evaluation of a variable coefficient RK. These coefficients depend on the value ϵ $$ \epsilon $$ , where ϵ ⁢ h $$ \epsilon h $$ is the new prediction of the step-size. In addition, a new control for the step length at the end of each integration is designed taking advantage from the extra estimator. The basic concept of this idea is to produce general purpose RK methods that have the capability to reduce the number of step rejections for difficult problems (such as orbits with high eccentricities and Van der Pole equation).},

We prove that our proposed scheme conserves non-negativity, and we show convergence towards the time-continuous unique solution.

Due to the noncompactness of the semiflow, we used the Kuratowski measure of noncompactness to demonstrate the existence of a global compact attractor. This noncompactness issue generates difficulties in calculating the basic reproduction number R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ , which is the principal eigenvalue of the next-generation operator. The threshold role of this number is determined, where we derived two different cases: (i) the global stability of the virus-free steady state, which is globally stable for R 0 &lt; 1 $$ {R}_0&amp;amp;lt;1 $$ by the Lyapunov direct method, and (ii) the global stability of the virus steady state for R 0 &gt; 1 $$ {R}_0&amp;amp;gt;1 $$ . Indeed, the second case is demonstrated through several steps that include uniform persistence, the existence of a virus steady state, and the global stability of the virus steady state. The results are supported by different graphical representations with proper biological justifications.},

We focus on a purely mechanical setting and derive the cell and homogenized problems corresponding to the balance of linear momentum equation in the absence of body forces and inertial terms. In doing this, we reformulate the original framework in the Laplace–Carson domain and discuss how to obtain the effective coefficients in the time domain. We particularize the general setting of our work by considering memory functions that describe special types of fractional linear viscoelastic behaviors, and after presenting the limit cases of our selections, we framed the homogenization results to account for benchmark problems with different combinations of constitutive models. Specifically, these latter involve elastic, fractional Kelvin–Voigt, fractional Zener and fractional Maxwell constituents. Our results permit us to reinforce the interpretation of the theoretical findings and to elucidate the role of the fractional constitutive models on the effective properties of the composites under investigation.},

Then, to tackle with the impact of input constraints, an auxiliary system is constructed, and an event-triggered approach is developed to cut down communication burden between the controller and the actuator. Moreover, a dynamic surface control strategy is developed to cope with the tedious analytic computation of time derivatives of virtual controllers. The stability analysis demonstrates that the involved signals remain bounded, and tracking and observering errors can converge to a diminutive neighborhood around the origin.

  abstract     = {Nickel-based superalloys are unique materials with complex doping that demonstrate excellent resistance to mechanical and chemical degradation. Over a long period of use in industry, a variety of information has been accumulated about their possible chemical compounds and features corresponding to a certain composition. One of the main service properties of the alloy is the tensile strength ( σ ). For a more convenient comparison of the characteristics of the alloys with different chemical compositions, the temperature and holding time of the metal during testing are often combined into a complex Larson–Miller parameter ( P LM ). The availability of experimental or simulated data on the alloys&#39; properties in the entire range of temperatures and exposures would significantly expand the possibilities of the alloy applications and would allow a more accurate evaluation and comparison of the alloys. In this work, we use a machine learning method for modeling the properties of the alloys according to their composition. A Bayesian regularized artificial neural network was engaged to simulate missing tensile strength values for 278 superalloys. Special data preprocessing and the use of an ensemble of networks during training reduced the model error. Comparison of the predicted and experimental data showed excellent convergence. The method made it possible to obtain enough data to approximate the relation σ P LM with a sigmoid function. The slope coefficient is considered as a quantitative expression of the thermal stability of the superalloys.},

We apply our proposed scheme to train a wavelet neural network to solve chemotaxis problems with blow-up. These problems are highly nonlinear time-dependent systems of partial differential equations, and it is a challenge to get the pattern of the solution accurately. The proposed structure is partial retraining of the network, which increases its capacity to catch the spiky pattern of the solution. Our neural network-based algorithm allows us to solve the nonlinear chemotaxis problems without the use of linearization techniques and regularization techniques, most of which reduce the accuracy of the model. This mesh-free-based method can manage a variety of blow-up models with curved boundaries without imposing an extra cost. By proving the consistency and stability of the method, we show the convergence of GWNN solutions to analytical solutions of the chemotaxis problem. Several illustrative examples and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the correctness of the results and the robust performance of the presented algorithm. Moreover, to illustrate the effectiveness of the GWNN method, we make a comparison with two other network-based methods.},

However, sometimes, cancer may be controlled if the cancer cells can be infected and split by particular virus with weak pathogenicity. To give a better understanding on tumor dynamics, in this paper, we deal with a reaction–diffusion tumor model, which comes from the process of tumor therapy with oncolytic virus. Our main objective is to analyze the biological compatibility of uninfected and infected tumor cells. In addition, we are concerned with the long-time behavior, stability, and a priori estimates for the model. The compatibility conditions show that under certain range of parameters control, the infected tumor cells can coexist with normal tumor cells or be eliminated by oncolytic virus as time goes on; in the elimination case, it implies that the organism&#39;s complete recovery is highly possible as a result of the attack of oncolytic virus. An indirect idea in calculating fixed point index is proposed; correspondingly, a new condition on coexistence is presented.},

Making use of the quasi-linearization technique, the underlying equations are then changed to a set of linear equations. Numerical simulations are conducted to show the reliability and use of the suggested approach when contrasted with methods from the existing literature.

  abstract     = {In the present work, the fractional-order Sawada–Kotera–Ito problem is solved by considering nonlocal Caputo and nonsingular Atangana–Baleanu (ABC) derivatives. The methodology used is an application of the Shehu transform and the Adomian decomposition method. The obtained solution is more accurate when using the ABC type derivative as compared to the Caputo sense, when using the proposed ADShTM method (Adomian decomposition Shehu transform method). The results so obtained by the ADShTM using Caputo and ABC operators are compared, establishing the superiority of the proposed method. The numerical results demonstrate that the application of the ABC derivative is not only relatively more effective and reliable but also straightforward to achieve high precision solution.},

Studying effective numerical methods for this equation has considerable scientific importance and application value. In that direction, this paper presents designing and analyzing a high-order numerical scheme for the generalized time-fractional Fisher&#39;s equation. The time-fractional derivative is taken in the Caputo sense and approximated using Euler backward discretization. The quasilinearization technique is used to linearize the problem, and then a compact finite difference scheme is considered for discretizing the equation in space direction. Our numerical method is convergent of O ⁢ ( k 2 − α + h 4 ) $$ O\left({k}&amp;#x0005E;{2-\alpha }&amp;#x0002B;{h}&amp;#x0005E;4\right) $$ , where h $$ h $$ and k $$ k $$ are step sizes in spatial and temporal directions, respectively.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose self-adaptive artificial boundary conditions (ABCs) for the two-dimensional (2D) time-dependent nonlinear Schrödinger equation and studied their efficiency. This equation describes the laser pulse interaction with a semiconductor layer under laser-induced plasma generation. Because of its nonlinearity, the interaction process is very sensitive to the appearance of the optical beam spurious reflection; therefore, highly transparent ABCs are urgently required to avoid disturbing the interaction process by an unphysical reflected wave. This can be achieved by using time- and spatial-dependent local wavenumbers computed near the artificial boundaries. We claim that it is necessary to account for both wavenumbers in each of the adaptive ABCs stated on both spatial coordinates. Based on computer simulation, we demonstrate an increase in the efficiency of the adaptive ABC stated on the coordinate along which the optical pulse propagates by involving both local wavenumbers. The accuracy of the developed approach is verified using a well-known analytical solution of the linear Schrödinger equation as well as the reference problem solution, obtained by solving the problem with zero-value boundary conditions on the extended spatial domain. For computer modeling, the finite-difference scheme, possessing asymptotic stability, is applied together with a two-stage iterative process for its realization. The algorithm and peculiarities of the local wavenumber computation are discussed in detail. The applicability of the developed approach is also demonstrated via the solution of both linear and nonlinear problems. The proposed method has widespread application for solving various laser physics problems governed by the Schrödinger equation.},

This paper starts with a short survey of different ways to define the notion of inconsistency in fuzzy logic systems. As a result, we provide a first notion of inconsistency by means of the absence of models. Subsequently, we define two measures of consistency that belong purely to the fuzzy paradigm; in the sense that both measures coincide with the crisp notion of consistency when the set of truth values is {0, 1}. Accordingly, we can state that the two provided measures of consistence are notions of consistence based on degrees, bringing back the spirit of fuzzy logic into the notion of consistency.},

By way of example, we have used these point symmetries to reduce straightaway the given system of second-order partial differential equations to a system of second-order ordinary differential equations. Moreover, we are allowed to substitute one of the dependent variables from one of the equations into the other, leading to an equivalent fourth-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation.

Although the opponent can eavesdrop the message sent between the sender and the receiver, the opponent is unable to decrypt to read the message. Therefore, the secret key is very important. The sender and the receiver agree with the secret key in an insecure channel by using key distribution protocol such as the Diffie–Hellman protocol. Since quantum computer is coming soon, Diffie–Hellman protocol is not secure. We will develop a quantum key distribution protocol. The benefit of the quantum system is the quantum state that cannot copy by no-cloning theorem. Thus, the opponent does not copy and keeps the message that is quantum. In this paper, a novel quantum key distribution protocol between two people (Alice and Bob) based on quantum operators is developed. The opponent (Eve) wants to know the secret key. Although Eve knows this quantum key distribution protocol, Eve does not behave similarly to Alice and Bob. For example, Eve eavesdrops Alice&#39;s quantum state that was sent to Bob, and Eve sends another quantum state. Therefore, we cannot control Eve&#39;s behavior. So we give the upper bound of mutual information between the user and opponent by using Holevo&#39;s bound. We verify the usual security definition for quantum key distribution that is equality-and-uniformity and privacy in the mutual information sense.},

  abstract     = {A study of the rheological and heat transport characteristics in cone–disk systems finds relevance in many applications such as viscometry, conical diffusers, and medical devices. Therefore, a three-dimensional axisymmetric flow with heat transport of a magnetized nanofluid in a cone–disk system subjected to Hall current and thermal radiation effects is investigated. The simplified Navier–Stokes (NS) equations for the cone–disk system given by Sdougos et al. [18] Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 138, 379–404 are solved by using the asymptotic expansion method for the four different models, such as rotating cone with static disk (Model I), rotating disk with static cone (Model II), co-rotating cone and disk (Model III), and counter-rotating cone and disk (Model IV). The Khanafer–Vafai–Lightstone (KVL) model along with experimental data-based properties of 37 nm Al 2 O 3 –H 2 O nanofluid is considered. To obtain the transformations leading to self-similar equations from the Navier–Stokes (NS) and energy conservation equations, the Lie group technique is used. The self-similar nonlinear problem is solved numerically to examine the effects of physical parameters. There are critical values of the power exponent at which no heat transport from the disk surface occurs. Nanoparticles significantly enhance heat transport when both the cone and disk rotate in the same or opposite directions. The centrifugal force and thermal radiation improve the heat transport in cone–disk systems.},

  abstract     = {In the present work, we investigate the stability problem for a third-order switched linear system in which the eigenvalues of each subsystem are all positive real parts. Firstly, we introduce a degenerated linear mechanical model with two state variables, in which one of the mechanical equations degenerates to a nonholonomic constraint, thereby such a mode being treated as a mechanical system with 1.5-degrees of freedom (DOFs). Secondly, we establish the corresponding relationship between the mechanical system with 1.5-DOFs and a standard third-order linear system so as to define an energy function with actual physical meaning. Thirdly, an invertible transformation is introduced to convert a general third-order linear system to a standard one so as to calculate energy function easily. On this basis, we reasonably introduce an intermediate subsystem for a general third-order switched linear system with two unstable subsystems, such that each subsystem and the intermediate subsystem can be converted to standard third-order linear systems simultaneously via an identical invertible transformation. Accordingly, we construct an energy ratio function with the help of the energy functions of the intermediate subsystem and two subsystems. Fourthly, based on the obtained energy ratio function, a proper state-dependent switching law is designed to guarantee asymptotic stability of switched systems. That is, the energy loss from switching is large enough to offset the energy increased from unstable subsystems operation in a switching loop. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state-dependent switching approach.},

These models have chaotic attractors and circles of stationary points. Our suggested models are derived from the Lorenz model, which appears in physics, engineering, and medicine (e.g., secure communications). Based on the tracking control method, we investigate a scheme for studying dual compound combination synchronization (DCCS) among 10 fractional-order chaotic models. This kind of synchronization is a generalization of many other types in the literature. In order to achieve this type of synchronization, a theorem is established and proven to give us the analytical formula for the control functions. These analytical results are supported by numerical calculations. The encryption and decryption of medical image are presented based on DCCS of 10 fractional-order chaotic models. Information entropy, correlation analysis between adjacent pixels, and histograms are computed together with the experimental results of medical image encryption.},

  abstract     = {Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health concern throughout the world. It can be treated effectively through proper medication and vaccination, although it is very difficult to cure, especially in people who have had the chronic infection. So, it is necessary to pay proper attention for its eradication. In this study, two nonlinear fractional-order HBV infection models with recycling effects of capsids are presented via the Caputo derivative. Each model contains four compartments, namely, susceptible hepatocytes, infected hepatocytes, HBV capsids, and viruses. In the first model, the order of fractional derivatives is equal for each compartment, whereas, in the second model, the order is incommensurate. The existence and uniqueness of solutions for both models are discussed separately. The parameters are estimated in order to validate the proposed model with experimental data obtained from a chimpanzee. Stability analyses are carried out for both models theoretically. The models are solved numerically using the predictor–corrector Adams–Bashforthm–Moulton method (for commensurate order) and implicit product integration of trapezoidal type method (for incommensurate order) with various choices of fractional orders and initial conditions. All the results are presented graphically. Interestingly, the results reveal the importance of fractional-order derivatives in capturing the dynamics of HBV transmission in the host. It is also noticed that with the decrease in the order of fractional derivative, the peak level of infection decreases, but the disease takes a long time to be cured.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the stabilization problem of an axially moving string with a tip mass attached at the free end and subject to an external disturbance. The disturbance here is not uniformly bounded, and it is assumed to be exponentially increasing. First, the tip mass equation is designed under a boundary controller. By using this equation, the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) technique is applied to design a disturbance observer, and it is shown that the observer can be estimated exponentially. Then, the closed-loop system is formulated and the well-posedness of the model is proved in the framework of the semigroup theory. The stability of the closed-loop system is then proved by means of the multiplier technique, where the energy system converges to equilibrium with an exponential manner. The efficiency of the obtained results is verified through numerical simulations.},

Based on the existence and uniqueness of the strong solution established by Galerkin method, the finite dimensional global attractor for the system without time-varying delay has been shown by using the quasi-stability theory. The difficulties for our desired well-posedness are the limiting of fourth-order derivative terms and the von Karman bracket term, which need some delicate estimates to achieve. The key point for the dynamics is to obtain the quasi-stability for gradient system, which needs the higher regularity of trajectory especially the von Karman bracket.},

  abstract     = {Synergy theories for multi-component agent combinations use 1-agent dose-effect relations (DERs), known from analyzing previous 1-agent experiments, to calculate neither-synergy-nor-antagonism combination DERs. Synergy theories are widely used in pharmacology, toxicology, and radiation biology. This article analyzes mathematical properties of one important synergy theory, proposed by John Hand in a little-known article published in 2000 and here called Hand Incremental Effect Additivity (HIEA). In 2018, Hand&#39;s approach was reinvented in a radiobiology study that inadvertently overlooked his paper. We carefully state the assumptions required for mathematically rigorous development of HIEA and other synergy theories. Under these assumptions, studying synergy/antagonism between any number of agents can be done on a single 2d plot. We show that HIEA combination DER is in general not well-defined in that it can “blow up” at finite total dose. We also formulate necessary and sufficient conditions on 1-agent DERs preventing such pathology. Using weighted harmonic means, we study the betweenness property of HIEA synergy theory and demonstrate that Hand&#39;s combination DER has a systematic tendency for betweenness violation. On the positive side, we introduce the concept of a strongly dominant agent and show that the presence of such an agent ensures the betweenness property. We show also that the betweenness property holds for another major synergy theory, Loewe–Berenbaum Additivity. Our emphasis in this article on synergy theories that can handle any number of agents was motivated by applications to the study of toxic effects of galactic cosmic rays on astronauts during interplanetary travel.},

Very different from the exponential decay of solutions to classical ordinary differential equations, solutions of FODEs decay only polynomially, leading to the so-called Mittag–Leffler stability, which was already extended to linear fractional delay differential equations (FDDEs) with order 0 &lt; α &lt; 1 $$ 0&amp;amp;amp;lt;\alpha &amp;amp;amp;lt;1 $$ . However, the study on the long-time decay rates of the solutions for FDDEs with order 1 &lt; α &lt; 2 $$ 1&amp;amp;amp;lt;\alpha &amp;amp;amp;lt;2 $$ is scarce. Hence, this paper is devoted to the asymptotical stability and long-time decay rates for a class of FDDEs with 1 &lt; α &lt; 2 $$ 1&amp;amp;amp;lt;\alpha &amp;amp;amp;lt;2 $$ , that is, fractional delay diffusion-wave equations. We reformulate the fractional delay diffusion-wave equations to infinite-dimensional FDDEs by the eigenvalue decomposition method. Through a detailed analysis for the characteristic equations, a novel necessary and sufficient stability condition is established in a coefficient criterion. Moreover, we are able to deal with the awful singularities caused by delay and fractional exponent by introducing a novel integral path, and hence to give an accurate estimation for the fractional resolvent operators. We show that the long-time decay rates of the solutions for both linear FDDEs and fractional delay diffusion-wave equations are . Finally, an example of an application model with feedback control is provided to show the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

The derived method transforms the given equation into a system of linear algebraic equations. For the numerical solution, we derive the optimal error bound and prove the theoretical unconditional stability with respect to the -norm. Furthermore, we numerically verify the stability of the proposed method. We observe the accuracy of the second order of the given schemes. The accuracy and effectiveness of the method are checked to solve some problems of telegraph equations.

This condition is satisfied when the domain of the Kawahara equation is posed in the real line, left half-line, and right half-line. Moreover, we are also able to prove that there exists a minimal time in which the integral overdetermination condition is satisfied.

The significant contribution is the role of complex plant models in system stability and robustness and associated physical phenomena. A general transfer function is studied in the paper. Other plant models may be built with this structure since the FCOP is a general mathematical form covering integer order plant (IOP) and fractional order plant (FOP). Using the equations produced with the proposed technique and the recommended integer order proportional derivative (IOPD controller, physical changes in integer, fractional and complex coefficients, and orders are observed within this paper. Analysis of the plant controlled with an IOPD controller is done by applying an integrator to reveal the differences. The effects of the parameters are discussed together with the visuals, supported by simulations. The aim is to tune the controller parameters to achieve the phase and specifications as the researcher desired. It is observed that the integrator greatly takes part in reducing the steady-state error. The IOP with the integrator showed the lowest steady-state error, and also, the settling and overshoot time were enhanced. Increase in the phase margin also caused an increase in the phase crossover frequency. It is also observed that the fractional order affected the phase crossover frequency comparing with the IOP, and the complex order modification also had an effect comparing to the fractional order version. The complex order of the system is considered with its conjugate components in the imaginary part thus, the results are found separately for each case.},

The model&#39;s geometry is considered orthotropic, highly non-homogeneous, and initially stressed media in the context of non-local continuum mechanics. The non-homogeneity functions are regarded as binomial functions with a positive real exponent. Two different non-local parameters have been defined by considering different internal characteristic lengths for the layer and half-space. Modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds are used to determine displacement functions. Asymptotic representations of derivatives of modified Bessel&#39;s functions have been derived to get the compact form of the dispersion equation. A comparison of phase velocity equations with classical Love wave equations has demonstrated the validity of our model. It is found that different modes of Love-like waves are dispersive and highly affected by the attenuation coefficient. Additionally, non-local parameters significantly influence the limitation of phase velocity modes of Love-like waves. The phase and damped velocity versus non-local parameters have been depicted with the effect of different parameters in the model. It has been found that the non-local parameters decrease the particle displacement amplitude in elastic half-space and rapidly eliminate waves with depth.},

Firstly, we give the well-posedness of the model and prove that the solutions are bounded and positive. The difficult mathematical issue in this research is that the model is partially degenerate, and the solution map is not compact. In addition, we construct a global attractor of a bounded set to establish the existence of total trajectory. Moreover, we define the principal eigenvalue associated with a principal eigenvalue problem to give a relation with the basic reproduction number and this value. By assuming that , then the infection-free steady-states is globally asymptotically stable. Furthermore, for and by using the persistence results, we prove the existence of endemic steady-states , and by constructing an appropriate Lyapunov function, we show that is globally asymptotically stable.

Here, we propose and study a two-species fishery model where the ecological and economic concepts are integrated. The objectives are to demonstrate the effect of fishing tax and tourist entrance fees to stabilize fishery dynamics and maximize revenue generation. For this, we consider a predator–prey fishery model coupled with dynamic harvesting and time-dependent fish price variation. The prey fish is commercially harvested, and the predatory fish is used for recreation purposes of the visitors with an entry fee. A fishing tax is levied on the fishers to restrict the overfishing of this renewable resource. We provide the local and global stability conditions of different equilibrium points of the system and unveil the broader dynamics through bifurcation analysis. Pontryagin&#39;s maximum principle shows the existence of an optimal fishing tax that maximizes overall revenue generation.},

  abstract     = {The function approximation technique (FAT) is a powerful mathematical tool recently utilized to design model-free controllers for robots. However, some FAT-based controllers depend on joint velocities, which may not be available in many real-world applications. This problem is solved in this paper by proposing an output feedback tracking control for cooperative robotic arms using the Bernstein–Chlodowsky polynomial as an uncertainty approximator. In other words, the Bernstein–Chlodowsky approach is adopted to approximate the lumped uncertainties consisting of disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. An adaptive rule is then suggested to update the approximator&#39;s coefficients matrix. Moreover, it is assured that controlled system error signals are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) utilizing the Lyapunov lemma. Finally, the designed Bernstein–Chlodowsky controller is applied to a cooperative system with two arms handling a load. Besides, the results of applying the designed technique are compared with the outcomes of the Chebyshev neural network (CNN) as a state-of-the-art approximation method. The simulation outcomes indicate the capability of the designed method.},

We use nonlinear analysis techniques and the spectral radius method to study the stability and instability of systems. Since the reproduction number plays a critical role in stability analysis, we use the spectral radius method to evaluate it. We have also added a control function to the model to enhance it by including interactions between healthy and cancer cells. Optimization techniques are used to identify the limitations and needs of the problem and derive the best solutions to control the tumor.

  abstract     = {Due to the spatial heterogeneity present in many aspects of disease transmission, the rate of transmission of infectious diseases, human birth/mortality rate, and the mobility ability of infected humans should be different in different geographical locations. On the other hand, infected humans may exhibit distinct differences in symptoms during the different stages of the disease transmission. This paper aims to study threshold dynamics of a reaction–diffusion host–pathogen model governed by two-stage mechanism and no flux boundary condition. In the model, we use bilinear and saturated incidence mechanism to model the interactions between host populations and pathogens and assume that (i) the parameters are spatially dependent and (ii) infected individuals in the first stage can random walk, while in the second stage, the diffusion rates are neglected. By carrying out strict analysis, the paper establishes the threshold-type results with the basic reproduction number. Specifically, in a homogeneous case that all parameters are constants, we establish the global attractivity of the endemic equilibrium. To investigate the effects of small or large diffusion rates of susceptible individuals on the disease transmission in a heterogeneous environment, we explore the asymptotic profile of positive steady state whenever it exists. Our numerical results validate the theoretical results and indicate the importance of the infected humans in the second stage and pathogens in the environment in disease transmission, which greatly contribute to disease spread in a bounded domain and should not be ignored.},

In this work, we extend the two-period model in risk decision-making to a n $$ n $$ -period model with n ≥ 3 $$ n\ge 3 $$ . Prevention and saving are two main factors discussed in this model. Then we apply the coordinate descent algorithm to find the “optimal” solution of the model equation. To the best knowledge we know, it is the first time to give the approximation of the optimality from a theoretical view. Some substitution results based on the first derivative are also presented.

We prove the strong convergence theorems of the sequence generated by the iterative scheme under some mild assumptions. Furthermore, we derive iterative methods for solving split generalized variational inequality, convex feasibility, and minimization problems. In addition, some numerical illustrations are provided to support the main result.},

First, a linear stability analysis is performed by deriving the principle of exchange of stability condition, which shows the system loses stability when the thermal Rayleigh number exceeds a threshold. Second, we consider the transition induced by real eigenvalues and complex eigenvalues, respectively, and two nonlinear transition theorems along with several transition numbers determining the transition types are obtained via the method of center manifold reduction. Finally, rigorous numerical computations are performed to offer examples of possible transition types. Our results show that both continuous and jump transitions can occur for certain parameters when the diffusivities from big to small are thermal, solute concentration and magnetic diffusion, but only continuous transition induced by real eigenvalues is observed when the diffusivities from big to small is the opposite of the previous case.},

However, he did not attempt any spiral drawings in hyperbolic space. In this paper, we consider a modified hyperbolic geometry by removing the condition that a geodesic is orthogonal to the unit circle in the Poincaré model. We show that spiral symmetry and the similarity property exist in this modified geometry so that the creation of uncommon hyperbolic spiral drawings is possible. To this end, we first establish the theoretical foundation for the proposed method by deriving a contraction mapping and a rotation for constructing modified hyperbolic spiral tilings (MHSTs) and introduce symmetry groups to analyze the structure of MHSTs. Then, to embed a pre-designed wallpaper template into the tiles, we derive a one-to-one mapping between a tile of MHST and a rectangle. Finally, we specify some technical implementation details and give a gallery of the resulting MHST drawings. Using existing wallpaper templates, the proposed method is able to generate a great variety of exotic Escher-like drawings.},

The main difficulties are the degeneracy of the system yielded by vanishing of the density close to the free boundary, the singular terms due to the large coefficients inversely proportional to the Mach number and the Froude number, and the strong coupling of the magnetic field and the velocity. The uniform estimates of solutions with respect to the Mach number and the Froude number are established, which is the first result on the MHD equations with vacuum free boundary.

In contrast to the parabolic reaction–diffusion (PRD) models, the spatial disturbances in an HRD system travel through space with finite velocity. This paper considers the simplest two-species HRD model with different inertia based on the telegraph equation. The underlying reaction terms are considered as a predator–prey interaction with type III response function and prey refuge. We prescribe the analytical conditions for the existence of diffusion-driven instabilities of the considered system. Simulation results further verify the theoretical results. A connection between the refuge parameter and inertial time is discussed in generating different spatiotemporal patterns. Extension of the two-species PRD system to HRD system with diagonal diffusion matrix causes a diffusion-driven wave instability, which is never possible for its parabolic counterpart. Furthermore, the patterns under pure wave instability are dependent on the initial population density.},

  abstract     = {Due to its importance in science, finding both exact and approximate solutions to fractional partial differential equations with boundary conditions is important for the research community. The natural decomposition method (NDM), which is based on the natural transformation method (NTM) and the Adomian decomposition method, is modified in this study to produce exact and approximate solutions for boundary value problems (BVPs) of partial differential equations (PDEs) with fractional coefficients. In addition, we present an exact solution to the temperature distribution in a slab constructed of materials with variable thermal conductivity&#39;s combined convection–radiation lumped system. We present these findings as numerical tables and graphs that show the convergence and stability rates. The study demonstrates that this approach is effective since it is simple to apply and produces reliable findings. We are the first to use this approach for such applications, as far as we are aware. Additionally, this method is applicable to a sizable class of BVPs for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and PDEs.},

Moreover, different species exhibit different living habits, so it is of certain interest to investigate species-related imprecise biological parameters. Besides, from the perspective of scientific and reasonable exploitation and utilization of fishery resources, two types of harvesting strategies are introduced into the system. Firstly, the dynamic properties of the system guided by continuous harvesting strategy are analyzed, which demonstrates the impact of refuge rate, imprecision indexes and harvesting efforts on the system dynamics. Meanwhile, the bio-economic equilibrium is discussed, and the optimal harvesting strategy is obtained. Secondly, the complex dynamics of the system induced by weighted harvesting activity are analyzed. The predator-extinction periodic solution and coexistent order-1 periodic solution is discussed according to different weights and thresholds. Finally, the correctness of the obtained results and the feasibility of the harvesting strategy are verified through numerical simulation in MATLAB. The results of this study provide a reference for the scientific and reasonable exploitation and utilization of prey–predator fishery resources in the imprecise parameter environment.},

We consider general operators of Hausdorff–Berezin type constructed with an arbitrary positive Radon measure on the unit disc within the framework of weighted spaces with the so-called Möbius weights. This is a fairly wide class of weights in the unit disc which includes classical radial weights with singularities or zeroes at the boundary. Sufficient conditions for the boundedness of the Hausdorff–Berezin operators in these spaces are obtained. In the case of nonnegative kernels, a boundedness criterion is obtained in L p ⁡ ( 𝔻 ) . Approximation properties of operators of Hausdorff–Berezin type are also studied. We also discuss some applications.},

The variational approach is adapted to show the well-posedness of the direct scattering problem. For the inverse problem, we intend to reconstruct the shape and location of the coated dielectric from measured far-field data by developing a modified factorization method. In fact, we shall first prove that the classical factorization method is effective for the case when a Neumann boundary condition is imposed on the buried object. However, for the case when a Dirichlet boundary condition is imposed on the buried object, the classical factorization method is no longer valid due to the loss of the coercivity of the middle operator of the associated factorization of the far-field operator. In this case, we are expected to develop a modified factorization method to overcome this difficulty. Finally, some numerical examples are carried out to confirm the validity of the developed algorithms.},

Its strong convergence is proved without additional conditions on the cutters such as the approximately shrinking property of each cutter and bounded regular assumption on their fixed point sets, assumed recently in the literature. Some particular cases of the last method, applications and computational experiments to a convex optimization over the intersection of level sets are given for illustration and comparison.},

  abstract     = {The study of the spread of epidemics has gained significant attention in recent years, due to ongoing and recurring outbreaks of diseases such as COVID-19, dengue, Ebola, and West Nile virus. In particular, modeling the spatial spread of these epidemics is crucial. This article explores the use of fractional diffusion as a means of describing non-local infection spread. The Grünwald–Letnikov formulation of fractional diffusion is presented, along with several mass-conserving boundary conditions, that is, we aim to design the boundary conditions in a mass-conserving way, by not allowing gain or loss of the total population. The stationary points of the model for both sticky and reflecting boundary conditions are discussed, with numerical examples provided to illustrate the results. It is shown that reflecting boundary conditions are more reasonable, as the stationary point for sticky boundary conditions is infinite at the boundaries, while reflecting boundary conditions only have the trivial stationary point, given sufficiently fine discretization. The numerical results were applied to an SI model with fractional diffusion, highlighting the dependence of the system on the value of the fractional derivative. Results indicate that as the order of the derivative increases, the diffusivity also increases, accompanied by a slight increase in the average number of infected individuals. These models have the potential to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of disease spread and aid in the development of effective control strategies.},

One of the most studied models is the Potts model, which has a rich structure of physical phenomena. However, countable analog of the mentioned model has not been deeply studied yet. In the present paper, we are going to construct generalized p $$ p $$ -adic Gibbs measures (for the countable state p $$ p $$ -adic Potts model on a Cayley tree) by investigating non-linear p $$ p $$ -adic dynamical systems on the sequence spaces. The provided study offers the existence of the strong phase transition for the model.},

We involve two types of algorithms, namely, stochastic AFD (SAFD) and stochastic pre-orthogonal AFD (SPOAFD), for, respectively, the Hardy space format and non-Hardy space ones, as may be regarded. We provide both their theoretical results and practical algorithms and compare them with the well adopted and, in fact, dominating Karhunen–Loève (KL)-type expansions. The AFD methods involve a finite or infinite sequence of optimally chosen parameters; they, in contrast, do not rely on and hence not have to compute the eigenpairs of the second type Fredholm integral equation with the covariance function as the kernel. Apart from such computational conveniences, they with the same convergence rate have flexibility of choosing best suitable dictionaries for doing the specific task in the practice. We include a number of experiments showing that in terms of effectiveness, the AFD methods give better approximations before all the positive eigenvalues running out in the case the integral operator being of a finite rank or before the KL iteration step becomes excessively large: The AFD methods normally give better approximations from the very beginning of the iterations.},

By treating the predator-taxis coefficient as a potential critical parameter for Turing bifurcation, we observe that the Turing pattern is fully captured by three distinct critical thresholds. Meanwhile, utilizing weakly nonlinear analysis and the amplitude equation, we establish the direction of Turing bifurcation. Our mathematical analysis reveals that the inclusion of the predator-taxis coefficient in the predator–prey system may lead to the emergence of either subcritical or supercritical Turing bifurcation. Our numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and exhibit various spatial patterns with different values of predator-taxis coefficients.},

The method that we have proposed in the present study is the combination of gCAS wavelets (based on new operational matrices) and the quasilinearization technique. We have derived and constructed the gCAS wavelets, the gCAS wavelets operational matrix of Hadamard fractional integral of order α $$ \alpha $$ , and the gCAS wavelets operational matrix of Hadamard fractional integral for boundary value problems. We have also derived the orthonormality condition for the gCAS wavelets. The purpose of these operational matrices is to make the calculations faster. Furthermore, we worked out the error analysis of the proposed method. We presented the procedure of implementation for both nonlinear Caputo–Hadamard fractional initial and boundary value problems. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the reliability and accuracy of the method. Since the Hadamard differential equation is a new and emerging field, many engineers can utilize the proposed method for the numerical simulations of their linear/nonlinear Caputo–Hadamard fractional differential models.},

The existing literature on quantitative randomized response models utilize the scrambling variable either as an additive term or as a multiplicative factor. This paper introduces the novel idea of the use of the exponential function of scrambling variable in quantitative randomized response models. Two new quantitative randomized response models are proposed based on exponential scrambling variable. It is found that the new randomized response models are more efficient than the existing quantitative randomized response models. The mathematical properties of the mean estimator of the sensitive variable under the new proposed methods have been discussed. Moreover, the joint and separate measures of privacy protection and efficiency of the proposed and existing models have also been discussed. Further, to illustrate the practical implementation of the suggested models, an example of data collection is also presented.},

Considering the influence of environmental factors such as temperature, drought, and humidity, as well as possible prevention strategies, including trunk injection, cutting infected pines, and insecticide application, in this paper, we develop a stochastic pine wilt disease model with prevention strategies, aiming to obtain the conditions for its near-optimal control. The near-optimality problem is constructed by decreasing the infected pine forests and beetle population while minimizing the costs of prevention strategies. We first verify that, under certain convexity conditions, the near-minimum condition of the Hamiltonian function is sufficient for the near-optimal control. Then, by utilizing the spike variational technique, we derive the necessary conditions of the near-optimal control. Finally, we present an example to illustrate the validity of the main theoretical results, which indicates that reasonable prevention strategies could effectively reduce pine wilt infection, and therefore, to some extent, could protect the pine forests from pine wilt disease and reduce economic losses caused by this disease.},

In particular, the indirect transmission via person–water–person contact is half-saturated and the direct transmission by person–person contact takes the saturated form. Possible equilibrium points of the model are investigated, and their stability criterion is discussed. Basic reproduction number R 0 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0 $$ of the model is obtained through the next-generation matrix method. It has been shown that the disease-free equilibrium is locally stable when R 0 &lt; 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;lt;1 $$ and unstable for R 0 &gt; 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;gt;1 $$ . Furthermore, a stochastic Lyapunov method is adopted to establish sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an ergodic stationary distribution of the proposed stochastic model, which reveals that the infection will persist if . We also obtain an exact expression of the probability density function near the quasi-endemic equilibrium of stochastic system. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to support our analytical findings. Results suggest that saturation constants in both direct and indirect transmissions play a positive role in controlling disease.

Using the regularized beta function, the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral operator (RLFIO) of these wavelets is precisely determined. We then transform the given VO-FOCPs into parameter optimization problems that can be easily solved. The convergence analysis and error estimation of the proposed method are provided. Four examples are solved to illustrate the high accuracy of the approach.

These orders of magnitude motivate the choice of a specific class of transformations that can be chosen to reduce the number of required dynamic iterations in a sequence-based approach to examining such systems.

The modified system is applied externally to an electrical field in the horizontal direction and a magnetic field in the transverse direction. Governing equations of nanofluid flow are formulated, and the assumptions of low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations are tackled. The resulting coupled non-linear partial differential equations like velocity and temperature equations are solved numerically by the NDSolve command using the computational mathematical software Mathematica. The influence of various important parameters on the velocity of the fluid, the temperature profiles, and the trapping phenomenon are discussed in detail by graphs. Under the influence of Joule heating, the study details the thermal transport process in the fluid. It demonstrates how an increase may significantly improve the momentum transmission in the core region of the microchannel in the volume fraction of the nanoparticles in the fluid.},

  abstract     = {The state-space realization of linear systems is of utmost importance in linear systems theory. After the realization problem for the time-invariant case was solved, particular attention was paid to the case of linear periodic systems. Recently, such systems have regained importance, for instance, in the context of coding theory where periodic convolutional encoders play an important role. The majority of the contributions within this area only concern the realization of transfer functions (or impulse responses), thus excluding the case of input/output linear systems without coprime representations. By the end of the eighties of the last century, Jan C. Willems suggested an approach (nowadays known as the behavioral approach) that considers a wider class of systems and allows to overcome this drawback. According to this approach, the central object in a system is its behavior which consists of all the signals that satisfy the system laws (also called system trajectories). Consequently, the behavior of a system with an input/output representation that is not coprime contains more trajectories than the set of input/output signals defined by the system transfer function. Our work takes this fact into account. In previous research conducted by the authors, some results on the realization of periodic behavioral systems were obtained, which, despite their importance, are conservative with respect to the dimension of the obtained realizations. In this paper, we revisit the behavioral periodic realization problem and give further insight into this question. This allows to derive new results and set up an algorithm to compute low-dimensional state-space realizations.},

In this article, a newly developed idea of the fractional-order derivative of the Rabotnov fractional–exponential function and the nonsingular kernel has been applied to study viscous fluid flow in the presence of an applied magnetic field. The flow is considered over an infinite vertical plate moving with arbitrary velocity. The modeled problem is transformed into a nondimensional form via dimensionless analysis, and then the Laplace transform method is applied for the solution of the problem. Due to the complexity in Laplace inversion, a strong numerical inversion procedure, namely, Zakian&#39;s algorithm, has been used, and the results are computed in various plots and tables. The corresponding discussion of results is included in detail. It is concluded that the generalized fractional-order derivative is accurate and efficient for describing general fractional-order dynamics in complex and power law phenomena.},

To model this feature, however, we depart from the Holling type II (HTII) response function, in that we assume that a sufficiently large set of prey could respond to individualistic attacks and therefore induce the predator to renounce. The basic idea is described at first in a simple two-populations predator-prey system. It is then expanded considering the generalist predators to deal with two prey. In the first case, both are gathered in herds, and in the second one, one of the two instead behaves individualistically. The net outcome is an enhanced survival for the prey with respect to both the herding cases without and with predators feeding satiation (i.e., using the HTII response).},

The formulation processed is performed step by step. For this purpose, we started with FEM formulation of the 3-D Laplace equation. Then, the obtained formulation is extended to the convection-diffusion equation with standard Galerkin FEM. In order to solve the stability problems for the convection dominated case, the most popular stabilized formulation known as the streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) type stabilization method is considered. As a further step, obtained stabilized formulation is used in the solutions of the MHD equations by transforming the coupled system of differential equations to the decoupled convection-diffusion type equations defined on different 3-D domains. For the comparison purpose, MHD equations are also formulated with finite volume method (FVM). Obtained numerical results are displayed in terms of a table and figures as the 2-D slices of the 3-D plots in order to visualize the effect and accuracy of the proposed numerical scheme over the different test problems.},

In the first part of this work, we present a model without spatial structure describing the dynamics of insects including its resistance to insecticides. In the second part, we include in the model dispersal between different space patches. Individuals can move from one patch to another at a fast time scale with respect to the demographical time scale. Using this model, we aim to understand the main characteristics leading to persistence or extinction of the insect pest population. We establish global stability results.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a queueing system with a preemptive priority limited processor sharing system with some versions of the discipline is considered. The problem of lost probability is an important aspect for developing methods to improve efficiency and productivity of in modern communications system and computer networks. In the paper, the following conditions are considered. The total service rate depends on the number of jobs serviced simultaneously, and this number is limited. The service rate of simultaneously serviced jobs is the same. There are jobs of different priorities. If the maximum quantity of jobs are serviced simultaneously, and a new job arrives, then depending on the priorities of the arriving and serviced jobs, the arriving job can be lost or preempt a serviced job. Four versions of the service discipline are considered. Depending on the discipline version, an arriving job can preempt or not preempt a job of the same priority, and preempted job is lost or its service is resumed later. This paper develops an approach to compute the loss probability of a prescribed priority job for each version of the discipline.},

We look for nonlinear eigenvalues that correspond to propagation constants of the waveguide. One of the main feature of the problem is that it has nonperturbative solutions and therefore the corresponding linearized problem cannot be used in any perturbation approach to find such eigenvalues (moreover, it turns out that the linearized problem is solvable in exceptional cases only). To solve the main problem, we develop a nonlinear perturbation approach based on usage of a certain simpler nonlinear problem that also has nonlinearizable solutions. Using this approach, we prove existence of nonlinearizable solutions to the main problem. Numerical results are also presented. Briefly, we present electromagnetic background for the main problem.},

First, the original second-order system is converted into first-order differential equations using the variable transformation method. Next, some sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are obtained using Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF), state-dependent switching (SDS) method, and Jensen&#39;s integral inequality for estimating integral inequalities so that the augmented system is robust, global, and asymptotically stable in the mean square for the uncertain SSINNs with time-varying delay. It is shown that the stability of the above considered system composed of all unstable subsystems can be achieved by using the SDS law. Finally, two numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SDS law.},

Biquaternion is a more generalized algebra of quaternion, which has attracted scholars&#39; research interest in recent years. In this paper, a new transform is proposed called the biquaternion linear canonical transforms (BiQLCTs). Due to the noncommutativity of biquaternion algebra multiplication, there are three different types of the BiQLCTs: Left-sided BiQLCT, right-sided BiQLCT, and two-side BiQLCT. The transforms are the extension of the complex linear canonical transforms. Then, the relationships between the three kinds of transforms are obtained. Next, based on the right-side biquaternion linear canonical transform (RBiQLCT), some general properties of this transform are proved. Moreover, the convolution and correlation theorems of the RBiQLCT are studied. As an application, according to the convolution operator and convolution theorem, the biquaternion linear time-invariant system is analyzed. Finally, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for the RBiQLCT is established.},

This model describes the relation between infectious, noninfectious prion proteins, and chaperone. The well-posedness of the system is proved for bounded kernels by using evolution operator theory in the state space ℝ × ℝ × L 1 ⁡ ( Z , z ⁢ d ⁢ z ) $$ \mathrm{\mathbb{R}}\times \mathrm{\mathbb{R}}\times {L}_1\left(Z, zdz\right) $$ . The existence of a global weak solution for unbounded kernels is also discussed by a weak compactness argument. In addition, we investigated the stability analysis results theoretically and effect of chaperone on prion proliferation numerically.},

In these flow regimes, variable horizontal or vertical density is taken into account. The shallow water equations for the hydraulic variables are coupled with a suspended sediment transport equation for the concentration variable to construct the model. To approximate the numerical solution of the models under consideration, a generalized Rusanov method is proposed; this method avoids solving Riemann problems during the time integration process, and it is simple and accurate. The proposed method is divided into two stages: predictor and corrector; the presented finite volume approach is well balanced, conservative, and simple. Non-oscillatory and suitable for shallow water equations when Riemann problems are challenging to solve. Several test problems for single-layer and two-layer shallow water flows are applied to the proposed method. The numerical results show that the proposed finite volume approach has high resolution and that it is capable of simulating shallow water equations with variable density in flow regimes with strong shocks accurately.},

The unharvested system exhibits either a steady-state or an oscillatory dynamics for the coexistence of the species. We explore how the delayed harvesting affects the dynamics of these two modes by analyzing the system stability in effort-delay bi-parameter plane. Some novel dynamical scenarios and intricate dynamics are obtained. Analytical conditions for different stability scenarios are derived by examining the associated quasi-polynomial eigenvalue equation. For invariant harvesting effort, the time delay induces four stability scenarios: stability invariance, instability invariance, stability change, and stability switching. On the other hand, the effort instigates five stability scenarios: stability invariance, instability invariance, stability change, instability change, and instability switching, when the delay strength is fixed. Majority of literatures on harvesting reported that harvesting stabilizes predator–prey interactions. However, we will show that the delayed harvesting can destabilize the system. One of the novelties of the study is to unveil the occurrence of effort-induced chaos via period-doubling mechanism. Interestingly, the effort-induced switching phenomena and chaos do not occur for non-delayed harvesting.},

Specifically, in these equations, the diffusion coefficient can depend on both the dependent variable and its gradient, and it vanishes when either one of the latter does. It is known that solutions of such degenerate equations can exhibit finite speed of propagation (so-called localization property of solutions). We give a proof of this property using a De Giorgi–Ladyzhenskaya iteration procedure for nondivergence form equations. A mapping theorem is then established to a divergence-form version of the governing equation for the case of one spatial dimension. Numerical results via a finite-difference scheme are used to illustrate the main mathematical results for this special case. For completeness, we also provide an explicit construction of the one-dimensional self-similar solution with finite speed of propagation function, in the sense of Kompaneets–Zel&#39;dovich–Barenblatt. We thus show how the finite speed of propagation quantitatively depends on the model&#39;s parameters.},

The proposed scheme is proved to perfectly inherit the mass and energy conservation possessed by ZS, while the invariants satisfied by most existing schemes are expressed by two-level&#39;s solution at each time step. In the subsonic limit regime, that is, when 0 &lt; ε ≪ 1 $$ 0&amp;lt;\varepsilon \ll 1 $$ , the solution of ZS propagates rapidly oscillatory initial layers in time, and this brings significant difficulties in designing numerical methods and establishing the error estimates, especially in the subsonic limit regime. After proving the solvability of the proposed scheme, we use the cut-off function technique and energy method to rigorously analyze two independent error estimates for the well-prepared, less-ill-prepared, ill-prepared initial data, respectively, which are uniform in both time and space for and optimal at second order in space. Numerical examples are carried out to verify the theoretical results and show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

The system consists of two equations for ( u , σ ) $$ \left(u,\sigma \right) $$ , where u $$ u $$ is the velocity and σ $$ \sigma $$ is the stress and is strictly hyperbolic and nonconservative. The study of interaction of waves is one of the most important steps in the construction of a global solution with initial data in the space of functions of bounded variation using an approximation procedure like Glimm&#39;s scheme. This amounts to constructing a solution with initial data consisting of three states ( u L , σ L ) $$ \left({u}_L,{\sigma}_L\right) $$ , ( u m , σ m ) $$ \left({u}_m,{\sigma}_m\right) $$ , and ( u R , σ R ) $$ \left({u}_R,{\sigma}_R\right) $$ . Usually, this analysis is done for the states which are in a small neighborhood of a fixed state.

  abstract     = {This research investigates the explicit series solutions of the fractional Chaffee–Infante reaction–diffusion coupled hierarchy system utilizing Lie symmetry analysis in two-dimensional space. This fractional system is a prominent model in fluid dynamics to characterize the surface-stripe wave evolution of liquids in light of the theory of conservation laws. The governing fractional system is analytically solved by the well-defined technique, called the power series method, so that the total derivative used is based on the Riemann–Liouville derivative. Simulations are also provided in this direction. The acquired results are systematically validated through a series of test cases. The results show that the proposed method is robust, accurate, and flexible in gaining more solutions, and it is effective in treating various fractional physical phenomena within the framework of conservation laws as well.},

A relation between the Euler–Frobenius polynomial and B-spline associated with exponential Euler spline is reported. Moreover, with the aid of derivative operator and functional equations for generating functions, many new computational formulas involving the special finite sums of higher powers of (inverse) binomial coefficients, the Bernoulli polynomials and numbers, the Euler polynomials and numbers, the Stirling numbers, the harmonic numbers, and special finite sums are derived. Moreover, a few recurrence relations containing these particular finite sums are given. Using these recurrence relations, we give a solution of the problem which was given by Charalambides.

To incorporate all the aforementioned characteristics, we extend the standard Susceptible-Vaccinated-Infected-Recovered (SVIR) epidemic model to a new mathematical model, which is governed by a system of coupled stochastic delay differential equations, in which the disease transmission rates are driven by Gaussian noise and Lévy-type jump stochastic process. First, under suitable conditions on the jump intensities, we address the mathematical well-posedness and biological feasibility of the model, by virtue of the Lyapunov method and the stopping-time technique. Then, by choosing an adequate positively invariant set for the considered model, we establish sufficient conditions guaranteeing the disease extinction and persistence. Lastly, to support the theoretical results, we provide the outcome of several numerical simulations which, together with our conducted analysis, indicate that the spread of the disease can be majorly altered by all the new considered characteristics.},

Several modifications on Chebyshev–Halley-type methods without memory have been considered in order to extend it to the scheme with memory. We have used self accelerating parameter in order to attain acceleration of convergence speed which is estimated from the current and previous iterations using divided differences. Therefore, the order of convergence increases from 3 to 3.30 without any further functional evaluation. We study the complex and real dynamics of the proposed family. The parameter spaces and dynamical planes are presented. From the parameter spaces, we can detect different members of the proposed family that have good and bad convergence properties. From the dynamical planes, we can analyze the stability of the proposed family in terms of different values of the parameter involved. This study aids in determining the family members with stable behavior which in turn are suitable for practical problems. Numerical examples and comparisons with some of the existing methods are included to confirm the theoretical results. Furthermore, basins of attraction are included to describe a clear picture of the convergence of the proposed as well as some of the existing methods.},

This model is written in terms of four nonlinear partial differential equations with nonlinear diffusions, depending on the total amount of the SEIR populations. The model aims at describing the spatio-temporal spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and is a variation of the one recently introduced, discussed, and tested in a paper by Viguerie et al (2020). Here, we deal with the mathematical analysis of the resulting Cauchy–Neumann problem: The existence of solutions is proved in a rather general setting, and a suitable time discretization procedure is employed. It is worth mentioning that the uniform boundedness of the discrete solution is shown by carefully exploiting the structure of the system. Uniform estimates and passage to the limit with respect to the time step allow to complete the existence proof. Then, two uniqueness theorems are offered, one in the case of a constant diffusion coefficient and the other for more regular data, in combination with a regularity result for the solutions.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops a Müntz–Legendre wavelet method for solving a fractional optimal control problem with dynamic constraint as a fractional Sturm–Liouville problem. We first derive the necessary optimality conditions as a two-point boundary value problem by using the calculus of variation and integration by part formula. The operational matrices for Müntz–Legendre scaling functions have been obtained, and by utilizing it, the two-point boundary value problem has been converted into a system of algebraic equations. The L 2 $$ {L}_2 $$ -error estimates in the approximation of operations matrices and in the approximation of unknown variable by the Müntz–Legendre wavelet has been derived. In the last, illustrative examples have been taken to show the applicability of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose the construction of discrete-time systems with two time scales in which infectious diseases dynamics are involved. We deal with two general situations. In the first, we consider that individuals affected by the disease move between generalized sites on a faster time scale than the dynamics of the disease itself. The second situation includes the dynamics of the disease acting faster together with another slower general process. Once the models have been built, conditions are established so that the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of their solutions can be carried out through reduced models. This is done using known reduction results for discrete-time systems with two time scales. These results are applied in the analysis of two new models. The first of them illustrates the first proposed situation, being the local dynamics of the SIS-type disease. Conditions are found for the eradication or global endemicity of the disease. In the second model, a case of co-infection with a primary disease and an opportunistic disease is treated, the latter acting faster than the former. Conditions for eradication and endemicity of co-infection are proposed.},

Infections from the infected surfaces have also been identified as drivers of COVID-19 transmission, but most of the epidemic models do not include the effect of environmental contamination to account for the indirect transmission of the disease. The present study is devoted to the investigation of the effect of environmental contamination on the spread of the coronavirus pandemic by means of a mathematical model. We also consider the impact of vaccination coverage as an effective control measure against COVID-19. The proposed model is analyzed to discuss the feasibility as well as stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibria; an epidemic threshold in the form of basic reproduction number is obtained. Further, we incorporate the effect of seasonal periodic changes by letting the rate of direct transmission of disease as time dependent, and find sufficient conditions for the global attractivity of the positive periodic solution. We employ sophisticated techniques of sensitivity analysis to identify model parameters which significantly alter the epidemic threshold and the disease prevalence. We find that by enhancing the vaccination of the susceptible population and hospitalization of the symptomatic/asymptomatic individuals, the basic reproduction number can be lowered to a value less than unity. The findings show that the prevalence of disease can be potentially suppressed by increasing the vaccination of susceptible population, hospitalization of infected people and depletion of environmental contamination. Moreover, we observe that seasonal pattern in the disease transmission causes persistence of the pandemic in the population for a longer period.},

Here, we use the fractional Adams–Bashforth method to solve the childhood disease model with nonlocal operator. The proposed numerical technique is developed by combining the fundamental theorem of integral calculus with Lagrange&#39;s interpolation. This numerical approach is more efficient than the other existing numerical techniques and is easily computed using Matlab as a programming language. The existence and uniqueness of this fractional model are studied with the fixed-point theorem. These fractional derivatives show different asymptotic behaviors for the distinct values of the fractional order.

Furthermore, we show that the error rate is reduced under erasures if the K $$ K $$ -frame is of uniform excess. Toward the protection of encoding frame (K-dual) against erasures, we introduce a new concept so called -matrix to recover lost data and solve the perfect recovery problem via matrix equations. Moreover, we discuss the existence of such matrices by using minimal redundancy condition on decoding frames for operators. We exhibit several examples that illustrate the advantage of using the new matrix method with respect to the previous approaches in existence construction.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a new generalized model of partial integro-differential equation of fractional order (PIDEFO). The new model of the PIDEFO is defined in terms of the B operator presented recently. The B operator takes form of the Riemann-Liouville and Caputo derivatives in special case. The generalized model of the PIDEFO reduces to (1) linear space-time fractional reaction-diffusion equation (FRDE), (2) space-time fractional diffusion equations (STFDE), and (3) time fractional telegraph equations (TFTE) in particular cases. The considered model is solved with collocation method using Jacobi polynomials. For theoretical accuracy, we prove that the Jacobi approximation converges to the exact solution uniformly. Two test examples are considered to verify the accuracy of the proposed method. Further, we present two applications of the proposed model and solve it using the presented method. The obtained numerical results are compared with the existing results. Finally, the numerical stability of the presented method is analyzed under the effect of the random noise in the force term.},

The two-operator approach and appropriate parametrix (Levi function) are used to reduce this BVP to four systems of two-operator boundary-domain integral equations (BDIEs). Although the theory of two-operator BDIEs in 3D is well developed, the BDIEs in 2D need a special consideration due to their different equivalence properties. As a result, we need to set conditions on the domain or on the associated Sobolev spaces to ensure the invertibility of corresponding parametrix-based integral layer potentials and hence the unique solvability of BDIEs. The equivalence of the two-operator BDIE systems to the original BVP is shown. The invertibility of the associated operators is proved in the appropriate Sobolev spaces.},

The Bolzano intermediate value theorem, which implies Darboux&#39;s theorem when the derivative is continuous, states that a continuous real-valued function f $$ f $$ defined on [ − 1,1 ] $$ \left[-1,1\right] $$ satisfying f ( − 1 ) &lt; 0 $$ f\left(-1\right)&amp;amp;lt;0 $$ and f ( 1 ) &gt; 0 $$ f(1)&amp;amp;gt;0 $$ , has a zero, that is, f ( x ) = 0 $$ f(x)&amp;amp;amp;#x0003D;0 $$ for at least one number − 1 &lt; x &lt; 1 $$ -1&amp;amp;lt;x&amp;amp;lt;1 $$ . It has numerous counterparts in multivariate calculus as well as in the infinite-dimensional setting. The present paper is devoted to the discussion of some infinite-dimensional variants of the Darboux theorem, which does not seem to be sufficiently deeply discussed. The study relies on different notions of nonsmooth differentiability of real functions and some appropriate compactness conditions. Problems involving functionals bounded below, monotone operators, and some general questions concerning the existence of the so-called generalized equilibria are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Map-based neuron models are an important tool in modeling neural dynamics and sometimes can be considered as an alternative to usually computationally costlier models based on continuous or hybrid dynamical systems. However, due to their discrete nature, rigorous mathematical analysis might be challenging. We study a discrete model of neuronal dynamics introduced by Chialvo in 1995. In particular, we show that its reduced one-dimensional version can be treated as an independent simple model of neural activity where the input and the fixed value of the recovery variable are parameters. This one-dimensional model still displays very rich and varied dynamics. Using the fact that the map whose iterates define voltage dynamics is S-unimodal, we describe in detail both the periodic behavior and the occurrence of different notions of chaos, indicating corresponding regions in parameter space. Our study is also complemented by a bifurcation analysis of the mentioned dynamical model.},

The model can be viewed as a singularly perturbed differential system; therefore, our analysis is mainly based on the geometric singular perturbation theory. The existence and the uniqueness result for small ion sizes are established, and treating the sizes as small parameters, we also derive an approximation of the individual flux, the I $$ I $$ – V $$ V $$ (current–voltage) relation and the individual flux difference. Critical potentials are identified, and their roles in characterizing ionic flow properties are studied.},

The new method provides a systematic tool for finding classes of reciprocal transformations (group of reciprocal transformations). Similar to the classical group analysis, this approach can be also applied for finding all reciprocal transformations (not only composing a group) of the equations under study. The present paper provides this algorithm. As an illustration, the method is applied to the two-dimensional stationary gas dynamics equations. Equivalence group, group of reciprocal transformations, and completeness of all discrete reciprocal transformations are presented in the paper. The results are stated in form of a theorem.},

Nanofluid model consists of important features Brownian motion and thermophoresis. First-order chemical reaction is present in mass transportation. The resulting system of differential equations is numerically tackled after adopting large wavelength and low Reynolds number assumptions. Influences of pertinent variables of interest on concentration, temperature, coefficient of heat transfer, streamlines, skin friction coefficient, and Nusselt and Sherwood numbers are examined graphically. The findings of this study reveal that temperature enhances against Brownian motion and thermophoresis parameters, whereas it decays for radiation variable. Concentration of the fluid declines for a couple stress fluid variable. Further, the heat transfer coefficient shows increasing behavior for Eckert number.},

Supercritical carbon dioxide (s-CO₂) is a suitable candidate being proposed as an alternative coolant to enhance the cooling of the microchannel heat sink (MCHS), with high heat flux, due to its favorable thermophysical properties near its critical point. In this study, numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the thermal and hydraulic performance of a channel for a designed heat sink with s-CO₂ (at constant P = 8 MPa ) and compare it with conventional liquid coolant (water). The effect of coolants mass flow rate ( ), channel aspect ratio (AR), and inlet temperatures on the thermal and hydraulic performance of one channel is studied by varying from 0.004 to 0.03 kg/s and AR from 0.33 to 10. The results show that, for the same aspect ratio, same geometry, and constant heat flux, s-CO₂ offers a higher overall heat transfer coefficient (32%) with a lower friction factor (pumping power) compared with the water at the same inlet temperature (T = 32°C). The results of pumping power comparison between two coolants reveal that for CO₂ in supercritical conditions ( , T = 32°C), the consumed power varies by change of the aspect ratio, which is 1.85 times lower than water for AR = 0.33 and is 3.6 times higher for AR = 10. However, in the subcooled state, the reverse effect of the aspect ratio is seen.},

The Lorentz force, which is generated by the interactions of a vertical magnetic field and an externally imposed horizontal electrical field, is presumed to be unilateral and one-dimensional. Using the Darcy-Brinkman-Forchheimer model, the medium of the micro-parallel plates is assumed to be porous. The energy equation evaluates the effect of viscous dissipation and joule heating as well. To solve the nonlinear coupled differential equations, analytical solutions are derived using the multi-step differential transform method. For the velocity and temperature profiles, the impact of all evolving variables is explored and illustrated in graphs and tables. It can be seen from the graphical results that the Darcy parameter, and also the magnetic field, are oppositional to both fluid motion and temperature profile. Additionally, the thermal Grashof number improves the velocity and temperature profiles of the system. On the velocity and temperature profiles, the outcomes for both fluid parameters are nearly identical.},

  abstract     = {When designing microscale heat exchangers, the reduction of energy dissipation and improved system performance in terms of heat transfer and fluid flow should be considered. Some methods, such as the use of nanofluids and convergent walls in the microchannel heat sinks, can be helpful. In this study, the hydrothermal performance and entropy generation of alumina-silica/water hybrid nanofluid in the double-layer tapered microchannel are investigated using the three-dimensional simulation. The flow Re number and the volumetric fraction of the nanoparticles vary in the ranges of 50 to 400 and 0% to 5%, respectively. Numerical results show that by using the convergent microchannel, in addition to decreasing the maximum base surface temperature, the temperature gradient also becomes more uniform. Boosting the volumetric fraction of nanoparticles and decreasing the tapered factor (TF) reduce the thermal resistance of the system but cause higher pumping powers. At Re = 400 and φ = 5%, when the convergence factor of the channel reduces from 1 to 0.4, pumping power will increase 149% but the thermal resistance reduction about 12%. At lower Re numbers, the effects of channel convergence on enhancing the mean Nu number are greater than the cases with higher Re numbers. In general, boosting the convergence of the channel increases the frictional entropy generation and diminishes the thermal entropy generation. At Re = 200 and φ = 5%, by decreasing the tapered ratio from TF = 1 to TF = 0.4, the frictional entropy generation will double and the thermal entropy generation will reduce by 7.9%.},

Silver–gold hybrid nanofluid particles with different shapes are inserted in the base fluid engine oil. Flow and heat transfer mechanism is detected in the presence of magnetohydrodynamics between the two parallel infinite plates. The thermal conductivity models, that is, Yamada–Ota and Hamilton–Crosser models are used to investigate various shapes (Blade, platelet, cylinder, and brick) of hybrid nanoparticles. The model is made up of paired high nonlinear partial differential equations that are then transformed into ordinary differential equations which are coupled and strong nonlinear using the boundary layer approximation. The MATLAB solver bvp4c package is used to solve the numerical solution of this coupled system. The influence of different parameters on the physical quantities is addressed via graphs. A comparison with already reported results is given in order to confirm the current findings. The analysis shows that surprisingly the Yamada–Ota model of the Hybrid nanofluid gains high temperature and velocity profile than the Hamilton–Crosser model of the hybrid nanofluid. Also, both the models show increasing trends toward increasing the volume fraction rate of silver-gold hybrid nanoparticles. It is also inferred that the hybrid-nanoparticles performance is far better than the common nanofluids.},

A low Reynolds number is used as the inertial forces are weaker than viscous forces, and also, creeping flow limitations are fulfilled. For the cilia movement, a very large wavelength of a metachronal wave is taken into account. Entropy generation is used to examine the heat transfer through the flow. Numerical solutions are calculated by using MATHEMATICA. Exact mathematical solutions are calculated and analyzed with the help of graphs. Streamlines are also plotted. An axially symmetric flow as well as temperature profile is revealed through the graphical solutions.

  abstract     = {Optimization of cooling systems for electronic devices is one of the crucial challenges in the modern engineering world. Inclusion of nanosized particles to working heat transfer liquids can enhance the heat removal from the heated elements in electronics. Taking into account these data, the present research is devoted to numerical analysis of natural convection in a cavity filled with a non-Newtonian nanosuspension under an influence of a heat-generating wall section. The paper contains the simulation outcomes for two different cases, namely, a heat-generating wall section with constant heat flux and a heat-generating wall section with constant temperature. The considered phenomenon has been described using the single-phase nanofluid model where the base liquid is a pseudoplastic fluid. The rheological parameters of the host liquid including the coefficient of flow density and an indicator of fluid behavior are the empirical data of MWCNT nanofluids. The non-Newtonian nature of the nanoliquid has been described by the Ostwald-de-Waele power law. Detailed analysis has been carried out for different governing parameters including the Rayleigh number, the volume fraction of nanoparticles, and the size of the heater using the non-primitive dimensionless variables and the finite difference method. Obtained results illustrate different temperature patterns for various boundary conditions. Moreover, in the case of heat-generating element, the average Nusselt number is greater than for the isothermal heater. It should be noted that the considered nanofluid model reflects the energy transference degradation with a growth of the nanoparticles concentration.},

  abstract     = {A theoretical investigation is done to talk about the impact of hybrid twofold diffusivity convection and inclined magnetic field on peristaltic flow of a Powell–Eyring nanofluids in a slanted asymmetric channel. Firstly, the mathematical modeling of magneto Powell–Eyring nanofluids along with double-diffusive convection is discussed. The whole investigation is accomplished in a moving frame of reference. Under lubrication assumptions, the governing equations of the proposed problem are simplified, and numerical solutions of the non-linear partial differential equations are obtained. In the end, mathematical outcomes is graphical investigated to check the conduct of different flow quantities. The investigation reports that miniature blending interaction of strong nano-sized particles in a nanofluid induces heat transfer rates, increasing the temperature of the liquid and reducing its mass concentration because of scattering of these particles. It is observed that large values of Brownian motion, Soret number, thermophoresis parameter, and Dufour parameter cause substantial increases in fluid temperature. Moreover, the nanoparticle fraction increases by increasing the values of Soret, Dufour, and thermophoresis parameter.},

The general boundary condition is considered for achieving the solution, and particularly convective cooling plays the dominant role in this problem. The obtained solution is first verified against the numerical data, and then, the credibility of the solution for studying practical problems is tested employing two illustrative test cases with various boundary conditions. Parametric studies are done to evaluate some significant parameters, including material constant, boundary conditions, and convection on temperature distribution. It is seen that boundary condition plays a dominant role in the cooling rate. Material constant does not have a significant effect on the temperature distribution. The current study can be hired to better the design and production process of cylindrical shells made of functionally graded material.},

To show this, we first establish the Elzaki transform in the context of the Atangana–Baleanu fractional derivative in the Caputo sense (ABC) and then extend it to heat-like equations. Our suggested approach has been reinforced by convergence and error analysis. The validity of the novel technique is tested with the aid of some illustrative examples. Comparative analysis has been established for both fractional and integer-order solutions. EHPTM is considered to be an appropriate and convenient approach for solving FO time-dependent linear and nonlinear partial differential problems. Plots and tables are being used to reveal the findings. The relatively high validity and reliability of the present approach are also reflected by the comparative solution analysis by means of statistical analysis.},

By using the properties of the Sinc collocation method, the nonlinear problem is discritized into a nonlinear system of equations. The results support the accuracy and speed of the solution. The effects of effective physical parameters such as fins porosity, thermal conductivity of fin, Raley&#39;s number, and Darcy parameter have been considered in solving the problem. Also, the variations in temperature distribution, efficiency, and performance of fins are investigated.

Radiative heat flux and two temperature boundary conditions, namely, prescribed surface temperature (PST) and prescribed heat flux (PHF), are considered. The flow is influenced by a magnetic field and porosity effects of a medium. The motivation pertains to attain an enhancement in thermal transportation via nanoparticle inclusion. The possible settling of the nanoparticles may be avoided by bioconvection of microorganisms. The basic theoretical conservation of mass, concentration, momentum, and energy provides a nonlinear set of partial differential equations which are then transmuted into ordinary differential form. The implementation of Runge–Kutta method with shooting technique in Matlab coding resulted the numerical solution. A deep insight into the problem is inspected by varying the inputs of influential parameters of the dependent functions. It is perceived that the flow speed is hindered by the growing inputs of parameters of buoyancy ratio, magnetic field, Raleigh number, and porosity. The temperature of the fluid attains higher outputs directly with thermophoresis and Brownian movement of nanoparticles. Motile microorganisms χ ( η ) profile goes down when bioconvection Schmidt number intensified. The current numeric results are validated when compared within existing studies.},

With heat generation, the contribution of concentration gradient is taken into account for heat flux (Dufour effect), and chemical reaction of order first for species balance is also considered. Initially, governing equations of flow model are reduced to nondimensional equations and then solved analytically. The transformed solutions for concentration, temperature, and velocity are written in summation form to invert by Laplace transform easily. The closed form solution of field variables has been plotted graphically due to different parametric variations to analyze the behavior of concentration, temperature, and flow fields against the physical parameters. Furthermore, comparisons among fractionalized and ordinary concentration, temperature, and velocity fields are made to see the effect of parameter α . It is concluded that concentration, temperature, and velocity obtained with fractional derivative are smaller than that obtained by ordinary derivative. Therefore, fractional derivative is the best choice to obtain controlled concentration, temperature, and velocity.},

To solve the problem, the idea of parametrization method, namely, the interval at which the problem is being considered, is divided into subintervals whose lengths do not exceed the values of the constant delay; constant parameters are introduced at the left ends of these intervals; a new unknown function is introduced at each subinterval. Thus, the problem under consideration is reduced to an equivalent multipoint boundary value problem for differential equations with delay containing parameters. Auxiliary Cauchy problems without delay with zero initial conditions at the left ends of the subintervals are consistently considered on each of the subintervals. Using an analog of the Cauchy formula to represent the solution of a system of linear differential equations on each of the subintervals and given nonlinear boundary conditions, an algebraic system with respect to unknown parameters is obtained. The article proposes an algorithm for finding a solution to a multipoint boundary value problem for differential equations with a delay containing parameters. At each step of the algorithm, a system of nonlinear algebraic equations is solved to determine the values of the parameters, and an analog of the Cauchy formula is used to obtain solutions to auxiliary Cauchy problems.

The case of harmonically additive mobilities has been addressed recently using a suitable metric to define the gradient flow of the phase field approximate energy. We generalize this approach to arbitrary nonnegative mobilities using a decomposition as sums of harmonically additive mobilities. We establish the consistency of the resulting method by analyzing the sharp interface limit of the flow: A formal expansion of the phase field shows that the method is of second order. We propose a simple numerical scheme to approximate the solutions to our new model. Finally, we present some numerical experiments in dimensions 2 and 3 that illustrate the interest and effectiveness of our approach, in particular for approximating flows in which the mobility of some phases is zero.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the relatively exact controllability of fractional stochastic delay system (FSDS) driven by Lévy noise. First, we derive the solution of linear FSDS via delayed matrix functions of Mittag–Leffler (M-L). Subsequently, by virtue of the controllability Grammian matrix, we explore the relatively exact controllability of linear FSDS. In addition, with the aid of Jensen&#39;s inequality, Hölder&#39;s inequality, and Itô&#39;s isometry, the existence and uniqueness of the considered nonlinear FSDS are investigated by employing Banach contraction principle. Thereafter, the relatively exact controllability of nonlinear FSDS is discussed. Finally, the theoretical results are supported through examples.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the qualitative behavior of a class of fractional SEIR epidemic models with a more general incidence rate function and time delay to incorporate latent infected individuals. We first prove positivity and boundedness of solutions of the system. The basic reproduction number R 0 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0 $$ of the model is computed using the method of next generation matrix, and we prove that if R 0 &lt; 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;lt;1 $$ , the healthy equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable, and when R 0 &gt; 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;gt;1 $$ , the system admits a unique endemic equilibrium which is locally asymptotically stable. Moreover, using a suitable Lyapunov function and some results about the theory of stability of differential equations of delayed fractional-order type, we give a complete study of global stability for both healthy and endemic steady states. The model is used to describe the COVID-19 outbreak in Algeria at its beginning in February 2020. A numerical scheme, based on Adams–Bashforth–Moulton method, is used to run the numerical simulations and shows that the number of new infected individuals will peak around late July 2020. Further, numerical simulations show that around 90 % of the population in Algeria will be infected. Compared with the WHO data, our results are much more close to real data. Our model with fractional derivative and delay can then better fit the data of Algeria at the beginning of infection and before the lock and isolation measures. The model we propose is a generalization of several SEIR other models with fractional derivative and delay in literature.},

This work proposes a TB SVELIT (S-Susceptible, V-Vaccinated, E-Early latent, L-Late latent, I-Infected, T-Treated) transmission model with relapse. In particular, a complete threshold dynamical analysis for the model is performed and the existence of optimal control is obtained. Meanwhile, the validity of the model is shown by comparing the real data with the fitted curve and the future trend in the incidence of TB in China is predicted. More importantly, the effects of four strategies, including vaccination, media propaganda, screening latent individuals, and receiving treatment, are evaluated numerically. The results suggest that the above four strategies can effectively control TB and shorten the duration of the epidemic. Interestingly, treatment is more effective than vaccination in controlling TB, but media propaganda and latent screening are cheaper and easier to implement.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we propose an approximate solution based on two-dimensional shifted Legendre polynomials to solve nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations with variable coefficients. For this purpose, we have considered a Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (Fisher–KPP) equation with space uniform white noise for the same. New stochastic operational matrix of integration based on shifted Legendre polynomials is generated. This operational matrix reduces the problem under study into solving a system of algebraic equations. The convergence analysis is discussed, and the error bound in L 2 $$ {L}&amp;#x0005E;2 $$ norm is derived and obtained as ‖ e N ⁡ ( t , x ) ‖ 2 ≤ 6 ⁢ K ( 16 ⁢ N 4 ) 2 ⁢ ( 1 − 6 ⁢ S ) $$ {\left\Vert {e}_N\left(t,x\right)\right\Vert}&amp;#x0005E;2\le \frac{6K}{{\left(16{N}&amp;#x0005E;4\right)}&amp;#x0005E;2\left(1-6S\right)} $$ . The theoretical analysis confirms that as the degree of the approximation polynomial is increased, the solution is on par with the exact solution. The numerical examples confirm the accuracy and the applicability of the proposed method. A comparative study is carried out with explicit 1.5 order Runge–Kutta method. The time complexity of the proposed technique is also studied.},

The basic idea of this method is that it changes the system of PDEs representing the one-dimensional flow through the similarity variable to the system of ODEs. The flow profiles are drawn behind the shock followed by a brief discussion on the behavior of the solutions via graphs. The effects of variation in non-ideal parameter, adiabatic index of the gas, Alfven–Mach number and ambient azimuthal velocity exponent on the flow variables are described.

  abstract     = {We propose and study a mathematical model governing interactions between cancer and immune system with an oncolytic viral therapy (OVT), wherein cancer cells can activate and inhibit immune cells simultaneously with saturations. When the therapy is not applied, it is shown that the interaction can support at most three hyperbolic positive equilibria where two of them are always asymptotically stable and the other is a saddle point. The reachable stable tumor burden can be either small or large depending on initial tumor size. We analyze the full model by proving global asymptotic stability of the virus-free equilibrium that corresponds to OVT failure. Sufficient conditions based on model parameters are derived under which the model is uniformly persistent. The proposed system is validated using a mouse model of human pancreatic cancer carried out by Koujima et al. Global sensitivity analysis indicates that the rates of tumor-mediated killing and immune cell exhaustion are critical for tumor progression and therapy success. Numerical bifurcation analysis reveals that the saddle point can be utilized to estimate the maximum tumor load for eradication by OVT. Moreover, an immunosuppressive microenvironment may enhance viral therapy efficacy.},

The difficulty lies in the challenges of handling the boundary conditions with high accuracy. The unique solvability, convergence and stability of the proposed compact difference scheme are proved by the energy method. Some novel techniques are introduced for the analysis.

It is interesting to find out that weak or mild oscillations will not cause any energy growth, while regular and strong oscillations will lead to polynomial or exponential growth of the energy. This is meaningful to help us explore the energy conversion mechanism in the electromagnetic field. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the optimality of the -estimates, typical counterexamples with periodic coefficients will be constructed to show the lower bound of growth rate by the application of harmonic analysis and instability arguments.

As it is well known, one can show existence under this condition but not necessarily uniqueness. Uniqueness fails for certain incident directions (if the wavenumber is kept fixed), and it is not clear which additional condition has to be assumed in this case. In this paper, we will analyze three concepts.

This paper investigates the time-fractional order rotavirus epidemic model in an uncertain environment defined in the Caputo–Fabrizio (CF) derivative sense. In the titled model, the initial conditions are considered as fuzzy numbers. A double parametric form (DPF) of fuzzy numbers has been used in the fuzzy fractional rotavirus model. A semi-analytical approach called the homotopy perturbation Elzaki transform method (HPETM) has been employed to solve the present model with the fuzzy initial condition. In order to derive the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the model, the concept of fixed-point theory is utilized. Various fuzzy and interval solutions have been computed by considering different values of fractional orders, fuzzy parameters, and parameters involved in the given model.},

To this end, we first study the properties of eigenvalues for a two-parameter nonlocal Sturm–Liouville eigenvalue problem. We obtain the two-parameter nonlocal Sturm–Liouville eigenvalue problem that has countable number of simple real eigenvalues. Meanwhile, the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues is studied by aid of the analytic perturbation theory.},

  abstract     = {Wood plays a very important role for daily household needs. In this paper, we have taken three parameters, forest biomass density F B , wood-based industries density W I , and synthetic-based industries density S I in the proposed mathematical modeling. The forest biomass is assumed to grow logistically, which requires a fixed time to achieve full growth. The excessive cutting of wood for the growth of wood-based industries not only depletes these forest resources, but there comes a delay in the growth of forest biomass as well. On the contrary, the growth of synthetic-based industry is independent of forest biomass, yet there is a competition between wood-based products and synthetic-based products as per market demands. With the help of differential equation, we studied the stability of the system. Delay plays a significant role in the system to understand the complex behavior of the system about non-zero equilibrium point. Hopf-bifurcation observed and directional analysis is studied using normal form theory and manifold reduction. MATLAB software is used to graphical representation of the system.},

This can be considered as a time-average inventory problem to time-discretely control a continuous-time system driven by a non-smooth jump process under habit formation disturbing project implementation. The system is modeled such that the sediment storage dynamics are physically consistent with certain experimental results. Further, the habit formation is modeled as simple linear dynamics and serves as a constraint related to the replenishment amount of the sediment. We show that the time-average control problem is not necessarily ergodic. Consequently, the effective Hamiltonian may become a non-constant. Thereafter, ratcheting cases as extreme cases of the irreversible habit formation are considered, owing to them being unique exactly solvable non-ergodic control problems. The optimality equation associated with a regularized and hence well-defined control problem is verified. Furthermore, a finite difference scheme is examined against the exactly solvable case and then applied to more complicated cases.},

  abstract     = {Habitat loss is one of the biggest threats facing plant species nowadays. We formulate a simple mathematical model of seed dispersal on reduced habitats to discuss survival of the species in relation to the habitat size and seeds production rate. Seeds get dispersed around the mother plant via several agents in a random way. In our model, seeds landing sites are distributed according to a homogeneous Poisson point process with a constant rate on ℝ $$ \mathbb{R} $$ . We will assume that each seed will successfully germinate and grow into a new plant with the same characteristics as the mother plant. The time is discrete, scaled according to generations of plants, or can represent years, since annual plants go through an entire growing cycle during 1 year. Then we will assume there are two symmetric barriers with respect to the origin and consider that the growth cannot evolve past the barriers. Imposing barriers correspond to the physical limitation of the habitat. We appeal to tools of probability theory to formalize and study such a model, which can be seen as a discrete-time one-dimensional branching random walk with barriers. By means of coupling techniques and the comparison with suitably constructed multitype branching processes, we localize the critical parameter of the process around which there is survival with positive probability or extinction almost surely. In addition, we consider a discrete-space version of the model for which exact results are also obtained.},

  abstract     = {Many important special numbers appear in the expansions of some polynomials in terms of central factorials and vice versa, for example, central factorial numbers, degenerate central factorial numbers, and central Lah numbers which are recently introduced. Here we generalize this to any sequence of polynomials P = { p n ⁡ ( x ) } n = 0 ∞ $$ \boldsymbol{P}&amp;#x0003D;{\left\{{p}_n(x)\right\}}_{n&amp;#x0003D;0}&amp;#x0005E;{\infty } $$ such that deg p n ⁡ ( x ) = n , p 0 ⁡ ( x ) = 1 $$ {p}_n(x)&amp;#x0003D;n,{p}_0(x)&amp;#x0003D;1 $$ . The aim of this paper is to study the central factorial numbers of the second kind associated with any sequence of polynomials and of the first kind associated with any sequence of polynomials, in a unified and systematic way with the help of umbral calculus technique. The central factorial numbers associated with any sequence of polynomials enjoy orthogonality and inverse relations. We illustrate our results with many examples and obtain interesting orthogonality and inverse relations by applying such relations for the central factorial numbers associated with any sequence of polynomials to each of our examples.},

The governing system is discretized through time and space via novel techniques of differential quadrature method and the fractional operator of Caputo kind. Two problems are offered to explain the accuracy of the numerical algorithms. To verify the reliability, accuracy, efficiency, and speed of these methods, computed results are compared numerically and graphically with the exact and semi-exact solutions. Then mainly, we deal with absolute errors and L ∞ errors to study the convergence of the presented methods. For each technique, MATLAB Code is designed to solve these problems with the error reaching ≤1 × 10 −5 . In addition, a parametric analysis is presented to discuss influence of fractional order derivative on results. The achieved solutions prove the viability of the presented methods and demonstrate that these methods are easy to implement, effective, high accurate, and appropriate for studying fractional partial differential equations emerging in fields related to science and engineering.},

An infinite-dimensional disturbance estimator is constructed in order to estimate the total disturbance. By compensating the total disturbance, we design a state observer to trace the state and then an estimated state and estimated total disturbance-based output feedback control law.

The existence and stability conditions of the equilibrium points are analyzed. Numerical results showed that neither microglia nor CTLs has the ability to eradicate the tumor. As a result, we extend the model by including the chemotherapeutic agent. The model has six equilibrium points, and one of these points represents a cured state. Through local stability, we found a range of values for the infusion rate that guarantees the elimination of glioma, as well as preventing the glioma from reoccurring.},

In our work, we built a mathematical model to describe the anaerobic co-digestion of two substrates, with preference and mortality of bacteria in closed mode. The existence and boundedness of positive solutions are investigated. We show that trajectories converge toward a global attractor which is composed of an infinite number of non-hyperbolic equilibria. The choice of growth functions, for both bacteria, can completely change the performance of the process. Numerical tests are presented to illustrate the theoretical analysis. They allow the prediction of the quantities of the initial mixture for a better biogas production.},

It is known that the usual scheme obtained with a space discretization is not uniformly exponential decaying.

In this approach, the fully discrete system was decomposed into two subsystems, namely conservative and nonconservative. According to the literature, it has been noted that under a numerical hypothesis on ξ $$ \xi $$ , a uniform observability inequality holds for a conservative system. The uniform exponential decay of the energy for the damped system was proved via the application of the observability inequality.},

In considered problem, the temperature term is included in the elastic constitutive equations (generalized Hooke&#39;s law) as well as in describing the evolution of visco-elastic strain. The main idea of presented proof is to analyze reformulated model, in which visco-elastic strain (internal variable) is eliminated. For such system of equations, we propose a two-level Galerkin approximation, which allows us to show a non-negativity of temperature during the entire deformation process. In order to characterize the weak limits in the nonlinearities occurring in the system at different levels of approximation, the following tools are used: Truncation methods for heat equation proposed in the paper of D. Blanchard [Nonlinear Analysis, 21(10):725-743, 1993], modified Boccardo-Gallouët&#39;s approach, and Minty-Browder trick.},

We first construct a local classical solution to the continuum Lohe group model, and then we find an invariant set and derive a global well-posedness in some sufficient frameworks formulated in terms of initial data, system functions, and system parameters. We also show that phase-locked states can emerge from the admissible class of initial data in a large coupling regime.

For this study, a new deterministic SEIHR fractional model is developed for the first time. The purpose is to perform a complete mathematical analysis and the design of an optimal control strategy for the proposed Caputo–Fabrizio fractional model. We have proved the existence and uniqueness of solutions by employing principle of mathematical induction. The positivity and the boundedness of solutions is proved using comprehensive mathematical techniques. Two main equilibrium points of the pandemic model are stated. The basic reproduction number for the model is computed using next generation technique to handle the future dynamics of the pandemic. We develop an optimal control problem to find the best controls for the quarantine and hospitalization strategies employed on exposed and infected humans, respectively. For numerical solution of the fractional model, we implemented the Adams–Bashforth method to prove the importance of order. A general fractional-order optimal control problem and associated optimality conditions of Pontryagin type are discussed, with the goal to minimize the number of exposed and infected humans. The extremals are obtained numerically.},

Then, we derive a priori estimates and use the continuity argument to obtain the global-in-time solution, where the initial perturbation is small in H 2 $$ {H}&amp;#x0005E;2 $$ -norm. Finally, based on Fourier theory and the idea of cancelation of a low-medium frequent part as in [Sci.

Then the linear stability analysis for the considered model shows that chemotaxis can induce the losing of stability of the unique positive spatially homogeneous steady state via Turing bifurcation and Turing-spatiotemporal Hopf bifurcation. These bifurcations results in the formation of two kinds of important spatiotemporal patterns: stationary Turing pattern and oscillatory pattern. Simultaneously, the threshold values for Turing bifurcation and Turing-spatiotemporal Hopf bifurcation are given explicitly. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to illustrate and support our theoretical findings, and some interesting non-Turing patterns are found in temporal Hopf parameter space by numerical simulation.},

In this case, one is usually interested on the asymptotic behavior of the solutions near the geometric singularities. However, for both mathematical and engineering purposes, it is important to have extraction formulas for the coefficients in the asymptotic expansion. In this paper, we consider initial boundary value problems for the wave equation in two-dimensional domains with corners and derive, by means of Fourier analysis, explicit computable expressions for the coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of the solution near the corners. The explicit structure of the singular solutions presented herein makes it fairly easy to compute numerically. Thus, the formulas can be used to construct postprocessing procedures for improving the accuracy of standard numerical techniques of approximating the solution and for improving the rates of convergence in the error estimates. The analysis presented herein would also apply to more general hyperbolic or parabolic equations with constant coefficients.},

Formally, the full NSK system converges, as the viscosity, heat-conductivity, and capillary coefficient vanish, to the corresponding full Euler equation, and we do justify this for the case that the full Euler equation has a rarefaction wave. To prove this result, we first decompose the solution ( v , u , θ ) $$ \left(v,u,\theta \right) $$ as a small perturbation of the smooth rarefaction wave, then make use of the rescaling technique and an elementary energy method on two time scales. Moreover, the uniform convergence rates are also obtained.},

For an arbitrary spline Gabor frame with special lattices, we present its one dual Gabor frame window, which has the same smoothness as the initial window function. For a class of special spline Gabor Bessel sequences, we prove that they can be extended to a tight Gabor frame by adding a new window function, which has compact support and same smoothness as the initial windows. And we also demonstrate that two spline Gabor Bessel sequences can always be extended to a pair of dual Gabor frames with the adding window functions being compactly supported and having the same smoothness as the initial windows.},

The heat and mass transport phenomenon of Maxwell power-law-fluid has been expressed using Cattaneo–Christov double diffusion (CCDD) model. Governing equations are modeled by using Navier–Stokes equations under suitable consideration. The developed mathematical model of the problem is in the form of nonlinear and coupled partial differential equations. Using similarity transforms, governing equations are converted into non-linear coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) whose numerical solutions have been obtained using Bvp4c routine in MATLAB. Through numerous graphs, a thorough analysis of entropy generation and Bejan number is conducted. It has been observed that the fluid velocity gets accelerated for higher values of thermal and solutal Marangoni parameters in the boundary layer.},

Nevertheless, we experience our visual percept as a single 3D entity—our visual world that we tend to identify with the physical world. However, experiments point to different geometries in these two worlds. Using the binocular system with asymmetric eyes (AEs), this article studies the global geometric aspects of visual space in the Riemannian geometry framework. The constant-depth curves in the horizontal field of binocular fixations consist of families of arcs of ellipses or hyperbolas depending on the AE parameters and the eyes&#39; fixation point. For a single set of AE parameters, there is a unique symmetric fixation at the abathic distance such that the constant-depth conics are straight frontal lines. Critically, the distribution of these constant-depth lines is independent of such fixations. In these cases, a two-parameter family of the Riemann metrics is proposed to account for the retinotopy of the brain&#39;s visual pathways and simulated constant-depth lines. The obtained geodesics for a subset of metric parameters include incomplete geodesics that give finite distances to the horizon. The Gaussian curvature of the phenomenal horizontal field is analyzed for all the metric parameters. The sign of the curvature can be inferred from the global behavior of the constant-depth ellipses and hyperbolas only when for the metric parameters for which the constant-depth frontal lines at the abathic distance fixations are geodesics.},

For the incompressible case, this class implies almost known corresponding results on periodic domain via either the velocity or its gradient including the famous Lions&#39; energy conservation criterion obtained in [1, Rend. Semin. Mat. Univ. Padova, 30 (1960)]. For the compressible case, this helps us to extend the previously known criteria for the energy conservation of weak solutions from the incompressible fluid to compressible flow and improve the recent results due to Nguyen-Nguyen-Tang in [26, Nonlinearity, 32 (2019)] and Liang in [27, Proc.

  abstract     = {A method for practical realization of the inverse scattering transform method for the Korteweg–de Vries equation is proposed. It is based on analytical representations for Jost solutions and for integral kernels of transformation operators obtained recently. The representations have the form of functional series in which the first coefficient plays a crucial role both in solving the direct scattering and the inverse scattering problems. The direct scattering problem reduces to computation of a number of the coefficients following a simple recurrent integration procedure with a posterior calculation of scattering data  by well known formulas. The inverse scattering problem reduces to a system of linear algebraic equations from which the first component of the solution vector leads to the recovery of the potential. We prove the applicability of the finite section method to the system of linear algebraic equations and discuss numerical aspects of the proposed method. Numerical examples are given, which reveal the accuracy and speed of the method.},

The new approach is free from gradient evaluations at each iteration. Also, the search direction generated by the proposed method satisfies the sufficient descent property, which is independent of the line search. Compared with traditional methods for solving CCNE that assumes Lipschitz continuity and monotonicity to establish the global convergence result, an advantage of our proposed method is that the global convergence result does not require the assumption of Lipschitz continuity. Moreover, the underlying operator is assumed to be pseudomonotone, which is a milder condition than monotonicity. As an applications, we solve the LASSO problem in compressed sensing. Numerical experiments illustrate the performances of our proposed algorithm and provide a comparison with related algorithms.},

Consider that the time delay in sensing flux information during the operation of traffic system is inevitable. Meanwhile, a new method is applied to model and analyse traffic system. A novel discrete-time lattice hydrodynamic model considering time delay is introduced in this paper. Based on the proposed model with constant and varying time-delay, the asymptotic stabilities are investigated and corresponding stable conditions are derived. The traffic flow evolution trend with and without time delay is conducted and compared by numerical simulations. Also, under the influence of different control gain conditions, density wave characteristics for traffic flow system with time delay are intuitively shown. The results indicate that time delay effect in sensing density and flux information can aggravate traffic congestion, and traffic congestion will be effectively relieved by considering steady flow control signal.},

Firstly, We determine the existence and uniqueness of positive steady states for the single species model by investigating the properties of the corresponding principal eigenvalues. Secondly, some conditions are provided to assert the globally asymptotical stability of semi-steady states for the two species competitive model. The results suggest that: (a) the species will prevail whenever it exists if the diffusion rate of the other species is small or large enough; (b) the species with much faster diffusion rate will win in the long run if the diffusion rates of the two species fall into some particular ranges. Finally, we show that if the appropriate diffusion rates are selected, then the two species will coexist. Our results indicate that both “competition exclusion principle” and “co-existence” may happen depending on the different dispersal strategies.},

The application of RLFIO-H and Haar wavelet to TFDE on metric star graph returns a system of linear algebraic equations. Solving this system yields wavelet coefficients and subsequently the solution. The convergence analysis of the proposed method is discussed to establish the theoretical authenticity of the method. The proposed method is tested on four benchmark problems to validate the theoretical findings. Moreover, the comparison of the developed method with the existing method shows the superiority and accuracy of the proposed method.

It is shown that the methods obtained by our scheme are optimal as they satisfy Kung–Traub conjecture.

To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to introduce an optimization formulation constrained by partial differential equations to study the kinetics of fluorescently labeled molecules in budding yeast. We derive the optimality conditions and use an optimize-then-discretize approach. A gradient descent algorithm allows accurate estimation of unknown key parameters in different cellular compartments. The numerical results support the empirical barrier index theory suggesting the presence of a physical diffusion barrier that compartmentalizes the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by limiting the exchange of proteins between the mother and its growing bud. We report several numerical experiments on real data and geometry, with the aim of illustrating the accuracy and efficiency of the method. Furthermore, a relationship between the size ratio of mother and bud compartments and the barrier index ratio is provided.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the dynamics of an autonomous mathematical model of COVID-19 depending on a real bifurcation parameter is controlled by the parameter switching (PS) algorithm. With this technique, it is proved that every attractor of the considered system can be numerically approximated and, therefore, the system can be determined to evolve along, for example, a stable periodic motion or a chaotic attractor. In this way, the algorithm can be considered as a chaos control or anticontrol (chaoticization) algorithm. Contrarily to existing chaos control techniques that generate modified attractors, the obtained attractors with the PS algorithm belong to the set of the system attractors. It is analytically shown that using the PS algorithm, every system attractor can be expressed as a convex combination of some existing attractors. Interestingly, the PS algorithm can be viewed as a generalization of Parrondo&#39;s paradox.},

The discrete-time nonlinear plant considered in this paper is modeled as a Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy system with plant rules. The data missing phenomenon is considered in both measurement and performance output signals due to the unreliable nature of communication links. Further, to reduce the network bandwidth utilization, the measurement quantization is also employed for both the outputs before transmitting through the communication channel. Also, additive filter gain fluctuation is taken into account to reflect the imprecision in filter implementation. Stochastic variables obeying the Bernoulli distribution are incorporated in the model description to characterize the random occurrence of parameter uncertainties and data packet dropouts. A set of sufficient conditions assuring the stochastic stability of the filtering error system with mixed H ∞ $$ {H}_{\infty } $$ and passivity performance is derived according to Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, three numerical examples including mass–spring–damper and tunnel diode circuit model are established to establish the validity of the developed filter design algorithm.},

In the research process, firstly, the considered HOQHNNs are decomposed into four equivalent real-valued Hopfield neural networks (RHNNs) to solve the problem that quaternion multiplication is not commutative, and then, a sufficient condition related to time delays is given to ensure that the state trajectories that are contained in or globally exponentially convergent into a cuboid. Thereby, the corresponding reachable set estimation is obtained. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate validity of theoretical results. At present, the research on HOQHNNs with mixed time delays adopts Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) method, which needs to not only choose the appropriate LKF but also take into account both conservatism and computational complexity. Besides, there is no literature to study the state bounding of HOQHNNs with mixed delays. The method suggested in the present text has three merits: (1) According to the definition of state bounding straightway, it has no use any LKF, which avoids massive calculations and solutions of high-dimensional matrix inequalities; (2) it is available not only to HOQHNNs but also to RHNNs and complex-valued Hopfield neural networks (CHNNs); and (3) make up for the blank of state bounding research of HOQHNNs.},

Moreover, we provide an explicit representation of its characteristic function in terms of special functions, that is, generalized hypergeometric function and its special case hypergeometric Gauss function. Thus, using probabilistic arguments, we provide a new identity between those two functions. Our calculations are also confirmed by numerical simulations of this new process.

The proposed model describes the effects of variable heat flux, viscous dissipation, and the slip velocity on the viscous Casson flow and heat transfer due to an unsteady stretching sheet taking into account the influence of heat generation or absorption. A collocation method based on a summation of Mittag–Leffler functions is employed to convert the system of ODEs that describe the problem to a system of algebraic equations. This system is constructed as a constrained optimization problem and optimized to get the unknown coefficients. Error analysis of the approximation solution is studied. The influence of the parameters governing the flow and heat transfer such as unsteadiness parameter, slip velocity parameter, Casson parameter, local Eckert number, heat generation parameter, and the Prandtl number are discussed and presented through tables and graphs. Besides, the local skin-friction coefficient and the local Nusselt number at the stretching sheet are computed and discussed.

  abstract     = {The deadly coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently affected each corner of the world. Many governments of different countries have imposed strict measures in order to reduce the severity of the infection. In this present paper, we will study a mathematical model describing COVID-19 dynamics taking into account the government action and the individuals reaction. To this end, we will suggest a system of seven fractional deferential equations (FDEs) that describe the interaction between the classical susceptible, exposed, infectious, and removed (SEIR) individuals along with the government action and individual reaction involvement. Both human-to-human and zoonotic transmissions are considered in the model. The well-posedness of the FDEs model is established in terms of existence, positivity, and boundedness. The basic reproduction number (BRN) is found via the new generation matrix method. Different numerical simulations were carried out by taking into account real reported data from Wuhan, China. It was shown that the governmental action and the individuals&#39; risk awareness reduce effectively the infection spread. Moreover, it was established that with the fractional derivative, the infection converges more quickly to its steady state.},

  abstract     = {The first case of COVID-19 in India detected on January 30, 2020, after its emergence in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The lockdown was imposed as anemergency measure by the Indian government to prevent the spread of COVID-19 but gradually eased out due to its vast economic consequences. Just 15 days after the relaxation of lockdown restrictions, Delhi became India&#39;s worst city in terms of COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we propose a variable-order fractional SIR (susceptible, infected, removed) model at state-level scale. We introduce a algorithm that uses the differential evolution algorithm in combination with Adam–Bashforth–Moulton method to learn the parameters in a system of variable-order fractional SIR model. The model can predict the confirm COVID-19 cases in India considering the effects of nationwide lockdown and the possible estimate of the number of infliction inactive cases after the removal of lockdown on June 1, 2020. A new parameter p is introduced in the classical SIR model representing the fraction of infected people that get tested and are thereby quarantined. The COVID-19 trajectory in Delhi, as per our model, predicts the slowing down of the spread between January and February 2021, touching a peak of around 5 lakh confirmed cases.},

A number of research outputs have proven beyond doubt that modeling with noninteger-order derivative is much more accurate and reliable when compared with the integer-order counterparts. In the present case, an extension is given to the polio model by replacing the classical time derivative with the newly defined operator known as the Atangana–Baleanu fractional derivative which has its formulation based on the noble Mittag–Leffler kernel. This derivative has been tested and applied in number of ways to model a range of physical phenomena in science and engineering. The Picard–Lindelöf theorem is applied to determine the condition under which the proposed model has a solution, also to show that the solution exists and unique. Local stability analysis of the disease-free equilibrium and endemic state is also discussed. A novel approximation based on the Adams–Bashforth method is formulated to numerically approximate the fractional derivative operator. To justify the theoretical findings, some numerical results obtained for different instances of fractional order are presented.},

The existence and uniqueness of the acquired solutions to the model are also studied in this paper. In order to investigate the effects of the fractional-order along with other existing parameters in the model, several possible scenarios have been examined. As it is seen in the proposed graphical simulations, the employed fractional operator is capable of capturing all anticipated theoretical features of the model. The numerical technique employed in this contribution is precise and efficient and can be easily adopted to investigate many fractional-order models in biology.

Classical nanofluid studies are generally confined to models described by partial differential equations of an integer order where the memory effect and hereditary properties of materials are neglected. In order to overcome these downsides, the present work focuses on studying nanofluids with fractional derivative formed by differential equations with Caputo time derivatives that provides memory effect on nanofluid characteristics. Also, investigation on natural convective flow, heat, and mass transfer of nanofluids formed by different base fluids with different shapes of copper nanoparticles past an infinite vertical plate with radiation effect is carried out. The governing fractional differential equations are solved by employing Laplace transform technique with suitable boundary conditions. The different base fluids—water (H 2 O), SA:sodium alginate (C 6 H 9 Na O 7 ), and EG:ethylene glycol (C 2 H 6 O 2 ) and different shapes of nanoparticles—blade, brick, platelet, and cylinder are considered for the study. The exact solutions are obtained for the temperature, concentration, and velocity distributions and the respective Nusselt number, Sherwood number, and skin-friction coefficient. The influence of non-dimensional parameters provides physical interpretations of temperature, concentration, and velocity fields, Nusselt number, Sherwood number, and skin friction in detail with the help of graphical representations. From the results, it is found that nanofluid with water-based blade-shaped nanoparticle exhibits more velocity and temperature distributions. Also, strengthen of fluid flow, temperature, and concentration of nanofluids are inversely correlate with fractional order derivatives.},

To improve the computational efficiency of the variable-order Caputo–Fabrizio derivative, we approximate the kernel of the fractional derivative by the K -term truncation of its Taylor expansion at a fixed fractional order to develop a fast evaluation scheme which significantly reduces the memory requirement from to and the computational complexity from to where N refers to the number of time steps. We accordingly develop a fast Galerkin finite element method to the proposed model. Numerical experiments are carried out to substantiate the theoretical findings and to show the performance of the fast method.},

  abstract     = {Block pulse functions (BPFs) are constant functions on each subinterval and not so smooth. This property makes BPFs incapable of approximating function accurately. Therefore, the existing BPFs method is insufficiently accurate to numerically solve variable coefficients fractional differential equations (VCFDEs). To obtain highly accurate solutions with fewer computational burden, we propose an efficient numerical method to find the approximate solutions of VCFDEs. The proposed method uses a hybrid of Bernoulli polynomials and BPFs (HBPBPFs) to overcome the disadvantage that BPFs are piecewise constant and smooth enough. For this aim, a fractional integral operational matrix of HBPBPFs is derived and used to convert VCFDEs into a system of algebraic equations. The solutions of VCFDEs are obtained by solving the algebraic equations. Some simulation examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. Numerical results from our proposed method are compared with those from the existing BPFs numerical method. It is demonstrated that our method can obtain more accurate approximate solutions than the BPFs method.},

With the aid of an auxiliary identity correlated with Raina&#39;s function, by generalized Hölder inequality, two Hermite–Hadamard-type local fractional integral inequalities for generalized harmonically ψ -convex functions are apprehended.

The master system is the fractional-order chaotic system, and then, we designed a fractional-order high gain observer, which is the slave system, based on the chaotic system model to achieve the synchronization. We used three different oscillator systems, a novel Chen-Burke-Shaw chaotic attractor, a novel fractional-order chaotic system, and the fractional-order model of a simple autonomous Jerk circuit. Our research followed to test the performance of the fractional synchronization. We use two performance indices, the integral of the square error (ISE) and the integral of the square error multiplied by time (ITSE). We showed that by using the fractional-order approach, we can reduce the values on the ISE and ITSE indices; hence, we guaranteed a full synchronization between the master and slave system. Our analysis shows that when using fractional derivatives with variable order, the ISE and ITSE indices have a lower value than when using the classical derivatives. We used the definition of Atangana-Baleanu-Caputo and Liouville-Caputo derivatives for the three examples mentioned in this work. We numerically solved the equations using the Adams method. Our results show that when using the fractional-order approach, the ISE and ITSE indices are lower than the integer-order case.},

In India, the first reported case of Covid-19 was confirmed on 30 January 2020. Today, coronavirus has been spread out all over the world. In this manuscript, we studied the coronavirus epidemic model with a true data of India by using Predictor-Corrector scheme. For the proposed model of Covid-19, the numerical and graphical simulations are performed in a framework of the new generalised Caputo sense non-integer order derivative. We analysed the existence and uniqueness of solution of the given fractional model by the definition of Chebyshev norm, Banach space, Schauder&#39;s second fixed point theorem, Arzel&#39;s-Ascoli theorem, uniform boundedness, equicontinuity and Weissinger&#39;s fixed point theorem. A new analysis of the given model with the true data is given to analyse the dynamics of the model in fractional sense. Graphical simulations show the structure of the given classes of the non-linear model with respect to the time variable. We investigated that the mentioned method is copiously strong and smooth to implement on the systems of non-linear fractional differential equation systems. The stability results for the projected algorithm is also performed with the applications of some important lemmas. The present study gives the applicability of this new generalised version of Caputo type non-integer operator in mathematical epidemiology. We compared that the fractional order results are more credible to the integer order results.},

On the other hand, a theorem provides the reduction of the fractional derivatives to non-autonomous ordinary derivative is given. Thus, the FFPE is reduced to non-autonomous classical ones. Some explicit solutions of the classical, fractional time-derivative Fokker–Planck equation are obtained. It is shown that the solution of the Fokker–Planck equation is bi-Gaussian&#39;s, which was not found up to date. It is found that high friction coefficient plays a significant role in lowering the standard deviation. Further, it is found that the effect of the presence of the fractional derivative prevails that of the fractal derivative. Here, the most interesting result found is that mixed-Gaussian solution is obtained. It is worthy to mention that the mixture of Gaussian&#39;s is a powerful tool in machine learning and also in the distribution of loads in networks.

This paper considers the time–space fractional Drinfeld–Sokolov–Wilson system, where He&#39;s variational method together with the two-scale transform is applied to find its solitary solutions. The numerical results have been shown through graphs to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of our approach. The main advantage of variational approach is that it can reduce the order of differential equation and make the equation more simple. The obtained results in this work are expected to shed a bright light on the study of fractional nonlinear partial differential equations.},

The derivative of time is understood in the sense of the time derivative of the Caputo fraction of the order α ,  0 &lt; α &lt; 1. The first result is an investigation of the existence and uniformity of the solution; the formula for mild solution and the regularity properties will be given. The proofs are based on a number of sophisticated techniques using the Sobolev embedding and also on the construction of the Mittag–Lefler operator. In the second part, we investigate the convergence of the mild solution for non-local problem to the solution of the local problem when two non-local parameters reach 0. Finally, we present some numerical examples to illustrate the proposed method.},

Also, it is useful in obtaining the semi-group properties. We will prove the action of fractional sums on the A B C type h -fractional differences and then it can be used to solve the system of A B C h -fractional difference. By using the h -discrete Laplace transforms and the Picard successive approximation technique, we will solve the nonhomogeneous linear A B C h -fractional difference equation with constant coefficient, and also we will remark the h -discrete Laplace transform method for the continuous counterpart. Meanwhile, we will obtain a nontrivial solution for the homogeneous linear A B C h -fractional difference initial value problem with constant coefficient for the case δ ≠ 1. We will formulate the relation between the A B C and A B R h -fractional differences by using the h -discrete Laplace transform. By iterating the fractional sums of order −( ϕ , δ , 1), we will generate the h -fractional sum-differences, and in view of this, a semigroup property will be proved. Due to these new powerful techniques, we can calculate the nabla h -discrete transforms for the A B h -fractional sums and the A B iterated h -fractional sum-differences.

In this study, we use the Hermite wavelets basis in order to solve the COVID-19 model with time- arbitrary Caputo derivative. The discussed framework is based upon Hermite wavelets. The operational matrix incorporated with the collocation scheme is used in order to transform arbitrary-order problem into algebraic equations. The corrector scheme is also used for solving the COVID-19 model for distinct value of arbitrary order. Also, authors have investigated the various behaviors of the arbitrary-order COVID-19 system and procured developments are matched with exiting developments by various techniques. The various illustrations of susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered individuals are given for its behaviors at the various value of fractional order.

In this paper, we solved a time delay fractional COVID-19 SEIR epidemic model via Caputo fractional derivatives using a predictor–corrector method. We provided numerical simulations to show the nature of the diseases for different classes. We derived existence of unique global solutions to the given time delay fractional differential equations (DFDEs) under a mild Lipschitz condition using properties of a weighted norm, Mittag–Leffler functions and the Banach fixed point theorem. For the graphical simulations, we used real numerical data based on a case study of Wuhan, China, to show the nature of the projected model with respect to time variable. We performed various plots for different values of time delay and fractional order. We observed that the proposed scheme is highly emphatic and easy to implementation for the system of DFDEs.},

In this paper, we study singular properties of pseudo-spherical evolutes of lightlike loci on mixed type surfaces.

Moreover, the singularities of pseudo-spherical evolutes are studied from the viewpoint of opening map-germ. Finally, we give an example to demonstrate the theoretical results.},

The main features obtained using this novel approach are (a) the requirements for stability are imposed directly on the equations of the system and involve only finite-dimensional variables; (b) the conclusions are asserted on the variables of interest; (c) the method can be extended in several ways, including multi-order systems. Illustrative examples, including an application in adaptive control, are finally presented to convey the usefulness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {We consider the classical Cauchy problem for a system of equations describing 3D arbitrary electrostatic oscillations of the cold plasma and introduce an iteration procedure that allows estimating the blow-up time from below. This procedure is constructive provided one succeeds in obtaining a two-sided estimate of an additional quantity depending on the solution. We show that this is possible in the case of one and two dimensions, as well as for solutions with zero vorticity. For the particular case of two-dimensional initial data with radial symmetry, refined sufficient conditions for destruction and preservation of smoothness in the first period of oscillations are obtained. Moreover, we give the example of estimating the blow-up time for the data for which results of numerics exist and discuss the roughness of our estimate.},

An embedding-like procedure is used to estimate the error of the proposed optimized method. The current approach has been used to compute efficiently approximate solutions to general second-order IVPs.

The first part gives the properties of the set of Cartan numbers, and in the second part, some geometric definitions, theorems, and applications are given. In addition, the definition of the center of a parabola and the concept of the central angle are defined. The connection is made between these concepts and the parabolic rotation transformation. Rotation matrices for parabolic rotations are obtained. The rotating points indicated that it follows in which cases a line path and in which cases a parabolic path. The rotation transformation along any straight line or parabola is studied with examples.},

We perform piecewise linear reconstructions of the conserved variables and energy as well as discretize the source term using the property that the energy remains constant, so that the complex source term and the flux can be precisely balanced so as to maintain the steady state. The scheme also ensures that the cross-sectional wet area is positive by introducing a draining time-step technique. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the scheme is capable of accurately maintaining both the still steady-state solutions and the moving steady-state solutions, simultaneously. Moreover, the scheme has the ability to accurately capture small perturbations of the moving steady-state solution and avoids generating spurious oscillations. It is also capable of showing that the scheme is positive-preserving and robust in solving the dam-break problem.},

However, due to the complexity of biological systems, the mathematical formulation of the corresponding problems faces the challenge that the corresponding stochastic processes should, in most cases, be considered in bounded domains. We propose a model based on a coupled system of reflecting Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equations with jump-like exit from a boundary. The setting describes the population dynamics of active and passive populations. As main working techniques, we use compactness methods and Skorokhod&#39;s representation of solutions to SDEs posed in bounded domains to prove the well-posedness of the system. This functional setting is a new point of view in the field of modeling and simulation of population dynamics. We provide the details of the model, as well as representative numerical examples, and discuss the applications of a Wilson–Cowan-type system, modeling the dynamics of two interacting populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Furthermore, the presence of random input current, reflecting factors together with Poisson jumps, increases firing activity in neuronal systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to investigate the influences of surrounding elastic media and tangential edge constraints on the buckling and postbucking behaviors of nearly cylindrical shell (NCS) made of functionally graded porous material (FGPM) and subjected to uniform temperature rise. Three different types of porosity distributions are considered and assumed to be in forms of cosine functions of thickness variable. The volume fractions of material constituents are assumed to vary through the shell thickness according to power-law functions. Temperature-dependent material properties and elasticity of tangential constraints of boundary edges are included. Governing equations are established within the framework of classical shell theory taking into account von Kármán–Donnell nonlinearity and interactive pressure from surrounding elastic media. Multiterm analytical solutions for simply supported NCSs are assumed and Galerkin procedure is utilized to derive expressions of buckling load and nonlinear load–deflection relation. An iteration process is adopted to determine critical thermal loads and postbuckling temperature–deflection paths. Numerous parametric studies are carried out to assess many different effects on thermal buckling resistance and postbuckling load carrying capabilities. The study reveals that porosity and tangential edge constraint have beneficial and deteriorative influences on the thermal stability of the NCSs, respectively. Furthermore, the obtained results demonstrate that surrounding elastic media have significantly beneficial influences on the thermal nonlinear stability of FGPM NCSs.},

The dynamic step size rule was firstly introduced by Goffin and Kiwiel [Math.

It was observed experimentally that the incremental approach has been very successful in solving large separable optimizations and that the dynamic step sizes generally have better computational performance than others in the literature. In the present paper, we propose two modified dynamic step size rules for the incremental subgradient algorithm and analyse the convergence and complexity properties of them. At last, the assignment problem is considered and the incremental subgradient algorithms employing different kinds of dynamic step sizes are applied to solve the problem. The computational experiments show that the two modified ones converges dramatically faster and more stable than the corresponding one in [SIAM J. Optim., 2001, 12(1): 109-138]. Particularly, for solving large separable convex optimizations, we strongly recommend the second one (see Algorithm 3.3 in the paper) since it has interesting computational performance and is the simplest one.},

As the macro- and micro-physical world could not be unified, it is believed that the laws of macro- and micro-physical world are not the same. This paper proposes a new way of illustrating physical parameters, using the combination of mean ± error instead of a single numeric parameter for illustration, and establishes the corresponding algorithm and equations for means and errors, respectively. The results show that the error part of the Navier–Stokes equations in macro-physical fluid mechanical world is just Schrodinger equation of micro-physical quantum mechanical world. Therefore, a new method of researching complex system is proposed, and this method establishes the relationship between macro-Newtown mechanics and micro-quantum mechanics, so that in the macro world, the mean will follow the Navier–Stokes equations, and the error will follow the Schrodinger equations.},

We prove analytically and numerically the existence of different types of bifurcations in the model. First, one and two parameters bifurcations of this model are investigated by computing their critical normal form coefficients. Second, the flip, Neimark–Sacker, and strong resonance bifurcations are detected for this model. The critical coefficients identify the scenario associated with each bifurcation. The complete complex dynamical behavior of the model is investigated. The model is discretized by a novel technique, namely a nonstandard finite difference discretization scheme (NSFD). Some graphical representations of the model are presented to verify the obtained results.},

This study exploits the recently introduced enhanced fractional derivative based LMS (EFDLMS) for parameter estimation of power signal formed by the combination of different sinusoids. The EFDLMS addresses the issue of fractional extreme points and provides faster convergence speed. The performance of EFDLMS is evaluated in detail by taking different levels of noise in the composite sinusoidal signal as well as considering various fractional orders in the EFDLMS. Simulation results reveal that the EDFLMS is faster in convergence speed than the conventional LMS (i.e., EFDLMS for unity fractional order).},

  abstract     = {This paper considers an inverse coefficient problem of simultaneous determination of solely time-dependent potential and force terms with the unknown longitudinal displacement from a Rayleigh–Love equation from two integral overdetermination measurements. Unique solvability of this theorem is investigated theoretically by using contraction principle. Although, the aforesaid inverse identification problem is ill-posed but has a unique solution. We use the cubic B-spline (CBS) collocation and Tikhonov regularization techniques to discretize the direct problem and to obtain stable as well as accurate solutions, respectively. The stability, for the discretized system of the direct problem, is also carried out by means of the von Neumann method. The acquired results demonstrate that accurate as well as stable solutions for the a ( t ) $$ a(t) $$ and b ( t ) $$ b(t) $$ are accessed for γ 1 = γ 2 ∈ { 1 0 − 8 , 1 0 − 7 , 1 0 − 6 , 1 0 − 5 } $$ {\gamma}_1&amp;#x0003D;{\gamma}_2\in \left\{1{0}&amp;#x0005E;{-8},1{0}&amp;#x0005E;{-7},1{0}&amp;#x0005E;{-6},1{0}&amp;#x0005E;{-5}\right\} $$ , when p ∈ { 0 . 1 % , 1 % } $$ p\in \left\{0.1\%,1\%\right\} $$ for both smooth and discontinuous potential and force terms. The stability analysis shows that the discretized system of the direct problem is unconditionally stable. Since the noisy data are introduced, the investigation and analysis model real circumstances where the practical quantities are naturally infested with noise. The technique establishes that accurate, as well as stable, solutions are obtained.},

  abstract     = {The present paper is devoted to mathematical analysis of the model that describes fluid flow moving in a channel with flexible walls, which are subject to traveling waves. Experimental data show that the energy of the flowing fluid can be consumed by the structure (the walls) inducing “traveling wave flutter.” In the problems involving two-media interactions (fluid/structure), flutter-like perturbations can occur either in the fluid flowing in the channel with harmonically moving walls, or in the solid structure interacting with the flow. In the present research, it is shown that there are no abrupt (or flutter-like) changes in the flow velocity profiles. Using the mass conservation law and incompressibility condition, we obtain the initial boundary value problem for the stream function . The boundary conditions reflect that (i) there is no movement in the vertical direction along the axis of symmetry and (ii) there is no relative movement between the near-boundary flow and the structure (“no-slip” condition). The closed form solution is derived for the stream function, which is represented in the form of an infinite functional series.},

The solution is approached by approximating the appropriate terms in Hadamard fractional differential equations using Hadamard fractional Legendre functions and converting the problem to a system of algebraic equations. Quasilinearization technique is employed to linearize the nonlinear Hadamard fractional differential equations. An upper bound for approximation error is derived. This method provides reasonably accurate results for a relatively smaller order of Hadamard fractional Legendre functions.},

Secondly, three time-varying control schemes are offered to contain the contact infection rate and enhance the implementation rate of positive information for improving people&#39;s awareness and reducing the number of infected and the cost of control. In addition, under the principle of the Pontryagin minimization, the combination strategy is analyzed to form a solution for optimal control.

  abstract     = {This paper numerically investigates the effect of pulsating flow on the settling dynamics of rigid circular particles. This is an interdisciplinary subject and spans several areas ranging from mathematical and numerical modeling to fluid mechanics. For this purpose, pulsatile flow characteristics are embedded in the combination of the direct-forcing immersed boundary method and the split-forcing lattice Boltzmann method. Inter-collision forces between the solid boundaries (particles and boundaries) and the added mass force due to acceleration are considered. Adequate verification tests are done to ensure the credibility of the findings. The critical parameters of pulsating flow, such as amplitude and frequency of pulsation, are investigated in detail. The paper especially puts emphasis on the interaction between particles and studies the well-known drafting, kissing, and tumbling (DKT) phenomena. Two different scenarios are taken into account and also compared with the stationary flow. The first case is when the pulsating flow is in the direction of gravity (co-flow), while in the latter, there is an opposing flow (counterflow). The sedimentation manners of 12 particles in a vertical channel are also presented. The findings shed light on the importance of pulsating flow and the extension of the proposed computational method for such problems. It is also revealed that pulsation and its variables can alter DKT by either postponing or speeding up the process. Also, in some cases, the cycle of DKT can be maintained incompletely, and particles would just stick together. The results can be useful for various engineering problems like filtration and particle sorting.},

Arguments from univariate birth-death processes are combined with existing matrix-analytic formulations to obtain sufficient conditions for these block-structured processes to be regular, positive recurrent, and absorbed with certainty in a finite mean time. Specifically, it is our purpose to show that, as is the case for competition processes, these sufficient conditions are inherently linked to a suitably defined birth-death process. Our results are exemplified with two Markov chain models: a study of target cells and viral dynamics and one of kinetic proof-reading in T cell receptor signal transduction.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with a class of singular prey-taxis models in a smooth bounded domain under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The main challenge of analysis is the possible singularity as the prey density vanishes. Employing the technique of a priori assumption, the comparison principle of differential equations and semigroup estimates, we show that the singularity can be precluded if the intrinsic growth rate of prey is suitably large and hence obtain the existence of global classical bounded solutions. Moreover, the global stability of co-existence and prey-only steady states with convergence rates is established by the method of Lyapunov functionals.},

  abstract     = {Nanocomposites are heterogeneous media with two or more micro-structural levels. For instance, a nano-level is characterized by isolated nano-inclusions, and a micro-level is represented by the clusters resulting from aggregation processes. Based on the reiterated homogenization method, we present a procedure to study the influence of this aggregation process and interfacial thermal resistance on the effective thermal conductivity for 2-D square arrays of circular cylinders. First, an effective intermediate thermal property is obtained by taking into account only the influence of the individual nano-inclusions in the matrix. Second, the final effective thermal coefficient ( k ^ R H $$ {\hat{k}}_{RH} $$ ) is calculated considering the clusters immersed in the intermediate effective medium derived in the first step. The conductivity gain ( k g a i n $$ {k}_{gain} $$ ) is defined as the quotient ( k ^ R H / k ^ C H $$ {\hat{k}}_{RH}/{\hat{k}}_{CH} $$ ) where k ^ C H $$ {\hat{k}}_{CH} $$ is the effective thermal coefficient computed considering only one microstructural level with the same volumetric fraction of inclusions. We apply the theory of complex variable functions deriving in an infinite system of equations solvable by truncation method. The analytical formulas of the effective coefficient used in the calculations generalize other well-known formulas reported in the literature. We also provide formulas for several truncation orders. The main novel contribution is in the reiterative application of the obtained formulas to illustrate the gain effect in nanocomposites, expressed as a function of the Biot number, thermal conductivities, volumetric fibers fraction, and an aggregation parameter. Furthermore, this result can be used to assess numerical computations and for nano-reinforced fibers and nanofluids applications. An appendix is included showing similarities and differences with a three-phase model.},

Moreover, the difficulty of comparing the “size” of quaternions can be avoided. In the case of discrete-time system, a very useful lemma is presented, which makes the analysis of the discrete-time quaternion-valued memristive network easy to operate.

The optimality system for the quadratic cost functional is derived by using the Frechet derivative. Then we relate the operator theoretic approach optimality system to a Hamiltonian system of Pontryagin&#39;s minimum principle. The primary goal of this article is to demonstrate the existence of an optimal pair for the fractional-order delay dynamical system by using a functional minimization theorem in functional analysis. Likewise, the optimality systems for the fractional-order delay dynamical system are derived by using the functional (either Gateaux or Frechet) derivatives.

The conventional convex splitting scheme is one of the most well-known methods for solving gradient flows, and it guarantees both energy stability and first-order accuracy in time. Recently, there are some researches, which are extended to the second-order accuracy; however, most of results provide the proof of energy stability for a modified (pseudo) energy or in a weak sense. In this paper, we prove the energy stability of the proposed method with respect to the Ginzburg–Landau free energy functional. Moreover, the unique solvability, mass conservation, and accuracy of the proposed scheme are also proven based on the convex splitting approach. The numerical experiments are presented to show convergence rate, mass conservation, energy stability, and phase separation are in good agreement with the theory.},

A delay-dependent sufficient condition containing several simple inequalities is first proposed to guarantee that the state trajectories remain inside or converge globally exponentially into a Cartesian product of two polytopes under the minimal dwell-time constraint. Second, the reachable set estimation problem is further studied, and another reachable set estimation condition can be derived. Based on the reachable set estimation result, state-feedback controllers are designed such that the state trajectories of the closed-loop system are limited in a given Cartesian product of two polytopes.

Moreover, we confirm that continuous periodic traveling waves with singular crests or troughs, which correspond to large-amplitude waves, are also symmetric if some cancellation structure appears near the singular points or if the wave profile has only a single singular point per period. Included in the results as particular cases are periodic traveling waves with peak, cusp, or stump type singular structures.

Using two integration norms, namely, the new auxiliary equation method (NAEM) and the extended sinh-Gordon equation expansion method (ShGEEM), we obtain a variety of nonlinear dynamical solitary wave structures in various shapes, including hyperbolic, trigonometric, and exponential function solutions, as well as some unique solitary wave solutions, including bell-shaped, kink, singular, combined, and multiple solitons. Using the logarithmic transformation assistant, we examine a variety of wave structures and recover singular periodic wave solutions with unknown parameters, along with the validity constraints. According to the results, the governing model contains an unusually large number of theoretically exact solitary wave solutions. The physical characterization of some of the presented results can be visualized in 3D and 2D profiles by selecting the appropriate parameter values.},

Radiations from annular and inner regions of inlet rigid shells scatter on interfaces after interaction with the geometric variations and change of material properties. The flexible shell that supports vibrations along the shell is expressed though the Donnell–Mushtari formulation in the differential system. The mode-matching technique is applied to solve the governing boundary value problem. The solution is projected on the orthogonal characteristics which in flexible casing is generalized as compared with the properties of acoustically rigid setting. The implication of generalized orthogonality relations governs additional constants that are found by defining the physical connection of shell with rigid disc. The clamped and pin-jointed conditions are considered in this article. The scattering powers and transmission loss are analyzed against frequency, chamber length, and radii of shells for clamped and pin-jointed edge conditions. It is found that the power propagation in annular shell and inner shell behave conversely. Moreover, configuration can be attenuated through the variation of dimensions of chamber and edge conditions.},

The existence of saddle-node bifurcation is derived by using the Sotomayor theorem. The stability of periodic solution of Hopf bifurcation is determined by calculating the first Lyapunov number. The direct conversion rate and indirect infection rate in the system are selected as bifurcation parameters; the existence of Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation of codimension 2 of the system is proved by calculating the universal unfolding near the cusp.

We give the convergence and error analysis for the approximations, and the theoretical analysis and numerical experiments show that the methods are effective and can be applied to general domains. We also explore the influence of the Hartmann number on the eigenpairs and the consequential variation of the eigenstructure with the magnetic field by numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study a predator–prey system with the simplified Holling IV functional response and antipredator behavior such that the adult prey can attack vulnerable predators. The model has been investigated by Tang and Xiao, and the existence and stability of all possible equilibria are determined. In addition, they performed a bifurcation analysis and showed that the system undergoes a Codimension 2 Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation. In this paper, for the same model, we further show that the cusp-type Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation can be of Codimension 3, which acts as an organizing center for the whole bifurcation set. In addition, we propose the existence of Hopf bifurcation of Codimension 2 and the coexistence of stable limit cycle and unstable limit cycle. In particular, we show that the antipredator behavior has great effect on the dynamics of the model, it may cause the predator population to extinct while the prey population will increase up to the carrying capacity. Numerical simulations including bifurcation diagrams and phase portraits are performed to illustrate and confirm the theoretical results. These results may enrich the dynamics of predator–prey systems.},

The proposed method is implemented by expressing the function and its spatial fractional derivatives as a finite expansion of shifted Legendre polynomials. Then the expansion coefficients are determined by reducing the SFCRDEs with their initial and boundary conditions to a system of ordinary differential equations for these coefficients. Subsequently, we applied the proposed method to discretize the temporal and spatial variables to convert the two-dimensional spacetime fractional coupled reaction–diffusion equations (STFCRDEs) to a system of algebraic equations. Some results regarding the error estimation are obtained. Several examples are discussed to validate the capability and efficiency of the proposed scheme.},

With regard to the well-known Black-Scholes model, the price of an option in each monitoring date could be calculated by computing a recursive integral formula that is based on the heat equation solution. We have approximated these recursive solutions with the aid of Lagrange interpolation on Jacobi polynomial nodes. After that, an operational matrix, which makes our computation significantly fast, has been derived. In some theorems, the convergence of the presented method has been shown and the rate of convergence has been derived. The most important benefit of this method is that its complexity is very low and does not depend on the number of monitoring dates. The numerical results confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the presented numerical algorithm.},

The discontinuity in the convection and source terms portray corner and interior layers in the solution. This type of model problem often appears in modeling various physical phenomena, particularly, in mathematical biology, and thus requires effective numerical techniques for analyzing them computationally. For this purpose, we approximate the considered linear problem by developing an efficient numerical method. The spatial discretization for the numerical method is based on a finite difference scheme. The spatial domain is discretized by appropriate layer-adapted meshes (S-mesh and B-S-mesh) to accomplish this. The theoretical outcomes are finally supported by extensive numerical experiments, which also include a comparison of the proposed numerical method in terms of the order of accuracy and the computational cost.},

This inequality has gained a very dominant position in the several fields of science as a result of its extensive applications. In the present note, we use an interesting approach for the determination of estimates for the Jensen difference. We acquire several estimates for the Jensen difference while utilizing the convex function definition, Jensen&#39;s inequality for concave functions, power mean, and Hölder inequalities. For the real visualizations of the acquired estimates, we provide some particular examples. We get different improvements for the Hölder inequality while taking specified functions in the received estimates. Moreover, we deduce some more results from the main work in the form of improvements for the Hermite-Hadamard inequality. Furthermore, various relations for the famous quasi-arithmetic and power means are acquired with the help of established estimates. At the end, we present various applications of the main work in information theory. The intended applications provide some new bounds for the Csiszár and Rényi divergences, Shannon entropy, and Bhattacharyya co-efficient.},

Then, the method was implemented in other forms of Blasius equation, that is, Sakiadis flow and shrinking sheet problem. The analytical solutions obtained show the success of ASCM and agree closely with the corresponding numerical results.

J. C. Maxwell was the first to introduce the quaternions to study the physical properties of electromagnetic fields. The contemporary scholars utilize the quaternions and octonions to investigate the electromagnetic theory, gravitational theory, quantum mechanics, special relativity, general relativity, curved spaces, and so forth. The paper adopts the octonions to describe the electromagnetic and gravitational theories, including the octonionic field potential, field strength, linear momentum, angular momentum, torque, and force. In case the octonion force is equal to zero, it is able to deduce eight independent equations, including the fluid continuity equation, current continuity equation, and force equilibrium equation. Especially, one of the eight independent equations will uncover the interrelation of the external torque and angular momentums of fluid elements. One of its inferences is that the direction, magnitude, and frequency of the external torque must impact the direction and curl of the angular momentum of fluid elements, altering the frequencies of Karman vortex streets within the fluids. It means that the external torque is interrelated with the velocity circulation, by means of the liquid viscosity. The external torque is able to exert an influence on the direction of downwash flows, improving the lift and drag characteristics generated by the fluids.},

Using the exact transparent boundary condition (TBC), we reformulate the unbounded scattering problem into an equivalent initial-boundary value problem. The well-posedness is proved for the problem by the Laplace transform and variational method in the s-domain. Moreover, we show that the reduced problem has a unique weak solution by the energy method.

The model is considered in logistically growing populations. We derive the basic reproduction number for the model and use it to describe the local-asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium (DFE). The contribution of educated and uneducated in basic reproduction number is estimated too. We estimate the time series solution of the model for uneducated, low educated and high educated scenarios. The higher the education level the more the vaccine uptake, the less the risky behavior, and the shorter the time needed to control HPV. Late education for adults is more effective than early education for children as late education is applied with vaccine and that could increase vaccine uptake for parents and their kids. Moreover, we introduce an optimal problem to search for the best introduction of early and late educations that maximize the vaccines uptake and control HPV with the least possible cost. In the time period 20 years, the time-dependent optimal educations are as follows: Full coverage of early education for the full period regardless of vaccine efficacy used. This needs to be supported with maximum education rate (one unit) for the first 13 years for vaccine with 90% efficacy, which needs to be extended for three more years when vaccine efficacy is reduced to 65%. The optimal educations have almost the same cost and the same effect in reducing HPV cases regardless of vaccine efficacy. This means that increasing health education is a viable low-cost strategy to support vaccines that have low efficacy.},

In particular, we identify the magnetostatic contribution, provide new results on the symmetries of GMPTs, derive explicit formulae for the real and imaginary parts of GMPT coefficients and also describe the spectral behavior of GMPT coefficients. We also introduce the concept of harmonic GMPTs (HGMPTs) that have fewer coefficients than other GMPT descriptions of the same order. We describe the scaling, translation and rotational properties of HGMPTs and describe an approach for obtaining those HGMPT coefficients that are invariant under the action of a symmetry group.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the effect of spatial average and time delay on the dynamics of a diffusive predator–prey model under the Neumann boundary condition. Compared to the model without spatial average, the delay-induced Hopf bifurcation at the first critical value of delay is nonhomogeneous due to the joint effects of spatial average and delay, and spatiotemporal patterns arise. Also, we show that the spatially homogeneous and nonhomogeneous periodic patterns may switch for different bifurcation parameter values. Moreover, a double Hopf bifurcation occurs at the intersection point of the homogeneous and nonhomogeneous Hopf bifurcation curves, and spatially nonhomogeneous quasi-periodic patterns can be observed via numerical simulations near the double Hopf bifurcation point. The normal form algorithm for the spatially nonhomogeneous/homogeneous Hopf bifurcation is derived for a general reaction-diffusion system with spatial average and delay.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a new efficient self-adaptive method and prove that it converges strongly to a minimum-norm solution of a generalized split feasibility problem in real Hilbert spaces. The proposed method is derived from a definite discrete dynamical system in time, which combines both the relaxation and inertial techniques for the purpose of increasing the rate of convergence of the iterative scheme. Furthermore, the method requires the monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity condition of the underlying single-valued cost operator A $$ A $$ , and it employs some simple self-adaptive stepsizes that are generated at each iteration by some easy computations. As a by-product, we obtain methods for solving other classes of generalized split feasibility problems in real Hilbert spaces. Two major merits of our scheme in solving image restoration problems over related schemes are the higher signal-to-noise ratio value and lower CPU time for generating recovered images. Finally, we analyze our methods with different related strong convergent methods in the literature.},

The obtained results can help us better understand the dynamic characteristics of discontinuous delayed systems and have direct applications to the wireless sensor networks for guaranteeing fast response to malicious signals. Finally, the numerical simulations of three examples are given to validate the correctness of the theoretical results.},

Aiming at avoiding the outbreak of pests by optimizing the control strategies, we propose a novel mathematical model based on the idea of pulse in this study, namely, a discrete-time model of pest–natural enemies, which considers the implementation of spraying insecticides within the time interval between two generations of pests. We first investigate the existence and stability of fixed points, and then using the central manifold theory, we proved that the system can exist period-doubling bifurcation. The main theoretical results are verified by numerical simulations. The experiments show that if the insecticidal time is within a certain range, the lower insecticidal rate stimulates the growth of pests and natural enemies, while the larger insecticidal rate can inhibit the growth of pests and natural enemies. In addition, the effects of pest growth rate, timing of pesticide spraying, and pesticide intensity on the system are comprehensively discussed. The main research provides good reference significance to choose an appropriate time to prevent pest outbreaks.},

Two simulation algorithms are proposed using the acceptance-rejection and inverse-transform methods and computational features to generate values of an r-hypergeometric distributed random variable.

Applications of mathematical methods based on the new distribution in sciences and engineering employing simulated and real-world data sets are provided.

  abstract     = {We consider a predator-prey model with dissimilar functional and numerical responses that induce an Allee effect. There is a time lag between consumption and digestion of prey biomass by predator. Hence, a time delay has been incorporated in the numerical response function. The system consists of two interior equilibria. Taking time delay as the bifurcation parameter, four different dynamic behaviors appear, viz., (R1) system undergoes no change in its stability for all time delay, (R2) system undergoes stability change, (R3) system undergoes stability switching, and (R4) system undergoes instability switching. Here, finding four distinct dynamics in a single population model with only one delay is a novelty in this contribution. This variation in dynamics emerges due to asymmetricity in functional and numerical responses. All the relevant theorems in establishing stability are provided, and these are verified numerically. We analytically prove that if an interior equilibrium is a saddle point in absence of time delay, then the equilibrium cannot be stabilized by varying the time delay. It is popularly believed that existence of two distinct pair of purely imaginary roots of the characteristic function leads to stability switching. However, we provide examples where the system remains unstable, stability changes, and instability switching occurs. This is another new and interesting observation in our work. The numerical examples are furnished with phase portraits, time series plots, bifurcation diagrams, and eigenvalues evaluation with delay, for better understanding. Our model with a single delay exhibits variety of dynamics, which were not explored before.},

Since the vector is an insect, the vector time scale is faster than the host time scale. This leads to a singularly perturbed model with two distinctive intrinsic time scales, two-slow for the host and one-fast for the vector. The basic reproduction number ℜ o $$ {\mathfrak{\Re}}_{\mathfrak{o}} $$ is calculated, and the local stability analysis is performed at equilibria of the model when the perturbation parameter ϵ &gt; 0 $$ \epsilon &amp;gt;0 $$ . The model is analyzed when ϵ → 0 $$ \epsilon \to 0 $$ using asymptotic expansions technique. The results show that if over 30% of humans use ITNs, then ℜ o $$ {\mathfrak{\Re}}_{\mathfrak{o}} $$ can be reduced below 1, and hence, malaria disease can be eliminated.

We develop an approach covering also the quadratic dependence on the spectral parameter in the differential equation, which is based on the completeness and basisness of certain functional systems. By this approach, we obtain a uniqueness theorem and an algorithm for solving the inverse problem along with sufficient properties of the mentioned systems. The presented results give a universal tool for studying a number of important specific situations, including various Hochstadt–Lieberman-type inverse problems both on an interval and on geometrical graphs, which is illustrated as well.},

Therefore, this paper focuses on the near-optimal control problems of a stochastic West Nile virus system with spatial diffusion describing the virus transmission among the bird, mosquito, and human populations. First, we introduce two control variables, namely, antimosquito and the treatment of the infected humans, into the system and prove the existence and uniqueness of the global positive solution of the system. Second, the necessary and sufficient conditions for two controls to be near-optimal are acquired in terms of a Hamiltonian function and a small parameter based on the Ekeland principle, the adjoint equation, and some prior estimates. Finally, we use numerical simulations to illustrate the theoretical results and conclude that mosquito control is the most critical factor preventing West Nile virus.},

Due to the presence of fixed transaction costs, the problem is formulated as a more complicated impulse stochastic control problem. By using methodologies from impulse control theory and the techniques of translation transformation, we obtain the explicit solutions of the value function and the corresponding optimal strategy. Firstly, the original problem is transformed into two types of suboptimal impulse control problems, one of which is “the case without capital injections” and the other one of which is “the case with compulsory capital injections.” Then, by verification theorem and the expressions of value functions of these two suboptimal problems, we verify that the optimal solution of the original problem is either “keeping bankruptcy without injections” or “never bankruptcy with injections.” It depends on the parameters of the model.},

  abstract     = {Based on the three-dimensional (3D) consistent couple stress theory (CCST), we develop an asymptotic theory for the free vibration analysis of functionally graded (FG) microplates resting on an elastic medium. The material properties of the FG microplate are assumed to obey a power-law distribution of the volume fractions of the constituents in the thickness direction, for which the effective material properties are estimated using the rule of mixtures. The interactions between the FG microplate and its foundation medium are simulated using a Winkler–Pasternak foundation. Carrying out the asymptotic expansion method, we obtain recursive sets of motion equations for various order problems. The CCST-based classical plate theory is derived as a first-order approximation of the 3D CCST. The asymptotic theory is shown to converge rapidly and to be in excellent agreement with the exact solutions for FG macroplates reported in the literature when the value of the material length scale parameter is assigned to be zero.},

As a consequence, finite-energy solutions are shown to be transported by a global flow. Moreover, we extend the notion of generalized solution for “effective” densities, and we prove the existence of such solutions. Finally, under a higher integrability assumption of the initial condition, we show that solutions have every energy bounded, even in the gravitational case. These results extend to our setting those recently obtained for the Vlasov-Poisson system in a series of papers by Ambrosio, Colombo, and Figalli; here, we analyze relativistic systems and also consider the contribution of the magnetic force into the evolution equation.},

  abstract     = {Acupuncture is an important part of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Although the efficacy of acupuncture has been widely accepted, the scientific basis behind it is still lack of exploration. Some experimental studies have shown that acupuncture can lead to changes in cell membrane potential, thus affecting the transmission of nerve signals to a certain extent. The change of cell membrane potential mainly depends on a large number of voltage dependent ion channels on the cell membrane. Relevant studies have proved that such voltage dependent ion channels have certain mechanical sensitivity, but the principle is not clear. Based on the theoretical model of cell action potential excitability proposed by Hodgkin–Huxley, taking rat skeletal muscle cell fibers as an example, this paper makes a rough stability analysis of the nonlinear system, explores the conditions of repeated discharge of cell membrane, and simulates the law of cell membrane potential frequency variation under different stimulating currents by numerical calculation. Based on the results of numerical simulation, we propose a hypothesis: Mechanical stimulation will produce a certain amount of stimulating current on the cell membrane, making the cell membrane potential in the state of repeated discharge, so as to block or interfere with the transmission of nerve signals and achieve the analgesic effect and so forth.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we proposed Markov-modulated models to value vanilla European-style continuous-installment options with a numerical approach. The flexibility in installment options to paying installments or stopping payments makes these options more attractive to holders. We consider regime-switching models for the dynamic of the underlying asset; in this way, the pricing problem of installment options can be formulated as coupled partial differential equations with free boundary features, which in many ways is similar to the free boundary problem for vanilla American options due to the possibility of early exercise. To value the installment options in this model, we express the problem as a linear complementarity problem (LCP), then we apply a finite element method as the numerical solving procedure to the resulting variational inequality. We illustrate some numerical results to examine the suitability of the proposed model and the accuracy of the applied numerical method for the pricing problem of installment options.},

Whereafter, the efforts taken to detect the asymptotic behaviors around equilibria, the existence of ergodic stationary distribution, and stochastic extinction of the latter model have been supplemented with meticulous theoretical proofs. At last, several numerical examples and discussions are illustrated to sustain and visualize our theoretical results. Compared and analyzed the numerical and theoretical results, we can find that the noise can influence the dynamics of disease and turn the disease from persistence to extinction.

Then, a boundary controller is presented to achieve the FTS. By virtue of Lyapunov functional method and inequality techniques, sufficient conditions are presented to ensure the FTS of FRDSs via the designed boundary controller. The effect of diffusion term of FRDSs on the FTS is also investigated. Both Neumann and mixed boundary conditions are considered. Moreover, the robust finite-time stabilization of uncertain FRDSs is studied when there are uncertainties in the system&#39;s coefficients. Under the designed boundary controller, sufficient conditions are presented to guarantee the robust FTS of uncertain FRDSs.

We have also found the conditions that should be fulfilled in order to obtain a closed slant geodesics, whereas the meridians and the Equator are closed by construction.

However, as everyone knows, the classical TV regularization trend underestimates the large edge values. In this paper, we propose a convex–nonconvex graph total variation (CNC-GTV) regularization for DOT reconstruction. In particular, we construct a nonconvex regularization by subtracting the generalized Huber function from the GTV regularization. We show that the global convexity of the objective function can be guaranteed by adjusting the nonconvex control parameters. Moreover, we present an alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM) to solve the proposed DOT reconstruction model. Numerical experiments show that the proposed model outperforms existing models in visual and numerical results.},

Some nations have controlled or are controlling the spread of this virus strongly, but some countries are in big trouble because of their poor control strategies. Nowadays, mathematical models are very effective tools to simulate outbreaks of this virus. In this research, we analyze a fractional-order model of Covid-19 in terms of the Caputo fractional derivative. First, we generalize an integer-order model to a fractional sense, and then, we check the stability of equilibrium points. To check the dynamics of Covid-19, we plot several graphs on the time scale of daily and monthly cases. The main goal of this content is to show the effectiveness of fractional-order models as compared to integer-order dynamics.},

If the nodes and links change over time, all the nodes and all the links are regarded the dynamic systems, respectively, and thus, a complex dynamical network (CDN) can be regarded to be composed of the two interconnected subsystems: the nodes subsystem (NS) and the links subsystem (LS). The outer synchronization happens in two CDNs, which means that the state error between the two NSs converges to zero. However, the dynamics of LS is ignored in the existing literature about the outer synchronization. In addition, the existing literature rarely consider the unknown interaction between two CDNs into the outer synchronization. In view of this, this paper investigates the outer synchronization of two CDNs with the unknown interaction. By using the dynamics of LSs and synthesizing the adaptive control scheme, the outer synchronization is asymptotically achieved. The results in this paper show that the outer synchronization happens when the two LSs can track, respectively, the synthesized auxiliary dynamic tracking targets. Finally, the numerical simulation is given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results in this paper.},

Namely, the Linear Inhomogeneous system that shares constant coefficients. Runge–Kutta pairs of high orders are chosen in order to achieve stringent accuracies when solving these systems numerically. It is theoretically interesting to equip these methods with large stability intervals for addressing the problems at hand. Thus, at first, we present an explicit algorithm for deriving the coefficients of such pairs of orders eight and seven. Then we adjust this in an optimization precess for extending the stability region and simultaneously keep the principal truncation error as low as possible. The resulting pair outperforms other standard pairs in a series of relevant problems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate a cannibalistic predator-prey system with Beddington-DeAngelis type response function when the infection only exists in the predator species. The predator species are subject to cannibalistic interaction and the infection spreads among the predators via cannibalism. The model is studied in presence of multiple delays for the maturation of prey and predator. Local stability analysis of the predator-prey model around the biologically realistic two essential steady states is investigated. We also investigate the bifurcation analysis of the proposed model around the co-existing steady states. Using the normal form method and center manifold theory, the direction of Hopf bifurcation and the Hopf bifurcating periodic solutions are explored. In presence of time delays, we derive the criteria for the permanence of the model. Our findings demonstrate that maturation delays destabilize the system and can produce high periodic oscillations. Cannibalism can act as a self-regulatory scenario controlling the transmission of disease among the predator species and stabilizing the oscillations in the predator-prey system. Our theoretical analysis is well supported with numerical simulation.},

  abstract     = {An HIV/AIDS transmission model is constructed and analyzed that assimilates spontaneous change in human behavior depending on the disease prevalence incorporating self-shielding mechanism and treatment control. It is assumed that human population become aware of HIV disease from exposed environment and are conscious enough to make their knowledge fruitful by adopting self-protective measures to reduce disease transmission. We introduce Hill type of behavioral change function and an awareness-induced transmission function associated with nonlinear infection rate. We emphasize the effectiveness of human awareness in controlling HIV epidemic by investigating the impact of nonlinear incidence rate. Further, an optimal control model is formulated and solved to find the strategy of applying treatment considering spontaneous response of people towards HIV disease. In the numerical simulation segment, impacts of significant parameters have been assessed using sophisticated techniques. We calibrate the proposed model with the real data of HIV cases in India and estimate some crucial model parameters. Moreover, different amalgamations of preventive and treatment controls are introduced. The optimal treatment control has massive impact in curbing HIV epidemic. Also, combined strategy of prevention and treatment can curtail the disease with economic gain. It reveals that effective response of individuals can suppress the disease in such an unexpected situation when treatment rate is low. Increasing the efficacy of human consciousness is much beneficial in curbing HIV outbreak. Thus, our findings highlight a path to control HIV epidemic with uninstructed modification of human behavior by boosting up the productivity of their existing knowledge.},

The practical present phenomena that parameters alternately switch in fast or slow frequencies are characterized suitably with such strategy. Meanwhile, the deception attacks are assumed to occur in a random way that obeys the Bernoulli distribution. Moreover, some sufficient conditions are established by means of the Lyapunov stability theory, which guarantee the closed-loop system is mean-square exponentially stable with a prescribed performance. Furthermore, based on the matrix processing technology, the desired controller gains are obtained.

For the initial-boundary value problem, we consider two cases: Dirichlet boundary condition and null-Neumann boundary condition on ( u , ρ ) $$ \left(u,\rho \right) $$ . In the case of Dirichlet boundary condition, similar to the Cauchy problem, the asymptotic profile is still the self-similar solution of the corresponding parabolic equation, which is derived by Darcy&#39;s law; thus, we only need to deal with boundary effect. In the case of null-Neumann boundary condition, the global existence and asymptotic behavior of solutions near constant steady states are established. The proof is based on the elementary energy method and some delicate analysis of the corresponding asymptotic profiles.},

It is intuitively convincing that a Dirac distribution of wealth (centered at the initial average wealth) will be the long time equilibrium for this dynamics. In other words, the Gini index should converge to zero. To better understand this dynamics, we investigate its limit as the number of agents goes to infinity by proving the so-called propagation of chaos, which links the stochastic agent-based dynamics to a (limiting) nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE). This deterministic description has a flavor of the classical Boltzmann equation arising from statistical mechanics of dilute gases. We prove its convergence towards its Dirac equilibrium distribution by showing that the associated Gini index of the wealth distribution converges to zero with an explicit rate.},

Moreover, we studied the nature of blood flow velocity as well as the cross-sectional area of the arteries under the influence of arterial stiffness graphically.

  abstract     = {The research article mainly focuses on investigating the dispersive behaviour of Love waves influenced by an impulsive point source in a fibre-reinforced magnetoelastic (FRME) plate placed on functionally graded fibre-reinforced visco-elastic (FGFRVE) semi-infinite stratum. The materials of the considered structure have been assumed under the influence of magnetic field and functionally graded. The functionally graded in the lower semi-infinite space is caused by consideration of quadratic variation in the shear moduli and mass density. Maxwell&#39;s equation and generalised Ohm&#39;s law have been employed to calculate the Laurentz force in the fibre-reinforced magnetoelastic (FRME) plate. For solving the coupled field equations, three-dimensional Green&#39;s function and Fourier transform are applied; consequently, the closed-form of the Love wave&#39;s dispersion relation is obtained. The obtained dispersion curve is plotted and compared in the numerical results and discussions by taking the different magnitude of materials quantities such as reinforcement parameter, magnetoelastic coupling parameter, functionally graded parameter, and visco-elastic parameter. In some particular cases, the deduced dispersion equation is found to be identical to the classical Love wave equation for uniform homogeneous isotropic cases, indicating that the assumed structures are valid. The obtained results from the entire study can be utilised to better understand the dispersive nature of Love wave propagation in the considered systems containing fibre-reinforced, magnetoelastic, viscoelastic, and point sources.},

In this prey–predator system, assume that the predator population is infected by disease and divided into two classes: susceptible predator and infected predator. The existence of global positive solution is derived. Threshold conditions of extinction and persistence in the mean for prey and predator population are given by Itô&#39;s formula and comparison theorem for stochastic model. The long-time behavior of this random system is also discussed by constructing suitable Lyapunov function, which shows the relationship between the solution of stochastic system and the equilibria of corresponding deterministic system. Finally, these results are verified by numerical simulation. Our results illustrate whether Lévy noise and white noise are both unfavorable to the population size of species.},

  abstract     = {The objective of the present paper is to develop a modified strain gradient beam constraint model (MSGBCM) to improve the modeling accuracy of small-scale compliant mechanisms. First, a simple nano/micro flexure beam under the effect of end loads is considered. The virtual work principle is employed to formulate the nonlinear load–displacement behavior of the system, based on the modified strain gradient theory. It is observed that as the size of the structure becomes smaller, the elements of the elastic stiffness and load stiffening matrices severely deviate from their corresponding values in the beam constraint model (BCM). A closed-form nonlinear strain energy expression is also derived for nano/micro flexure beams in terms of their tip displacements. This energy expression is utilized to model the nonlinear load–displacement relationships of small-scale parallelogram (P) flexures. Moreover, analytical formulas are derived for the axial, transverse, and rotational stiffness values of P-flexures. The most important observation is that in the small-scale P-flexures, the axial stiffness loss of small-scale P-flexures resulted from the movement of the stage in the transverse direction, may be seriously overestimated by BCM. The developed MSGBCM can be easily extended for investigating the static and dynamic behavior of more complicated micron and submicron size flexures.},

By applying the Backstepping transform, the diffusion subsystems in the considered neural networks are decoupled, while only the ODEs are still cascaded with the diffusion terms through the Neumann interconnection. By the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) approach, two auxiliary systems are constructed to compensate each disturbance by an estimator without high gain.

Firstly, based on the earlier study, we set up a class of new fractional-order multiple delayed BAM neural networks with four neurons. Secondly, applying an appropriate variable transformation, we get a new equivalent fractional-order single delayed BAM neural networks with four neurons. With the aid of the stability theory and bifurcation knowledge of fractional-order differential dynamical systems, a novel sufficient criterion to guarantee the stability and the appearance of Hopf bifurcation of the addressed fractional-order delayed BAM neural networks is set up. Thirdly, designing a suitable time-delayed feedback controller, the stability region and the time of appearance of Hopf bifurcation for the involved neural networks have been adjusted. Finally, two simulation examples are presented to illustrate the rationality of the mathematical derivation results. The study vindicates that the time delay has great effect on the stability, bifurcation, and its control for involved network models. The obtained fruits of this work can be effectively applied to control and design neural networks. Also, some research ideas will play a key role in studying the related fractional-order dynamical models in actual world.},

In this regard, numerous researchers and analyst have focused on the importance of mixed convective flow to explore its different aspects, and frequent research articles are published in this area. In this work, mixed convective entropy optimized nanomaterial magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) flow of Ree-Eyring fluid is discussed between two rotating disks. The effects of porosity and velocity slip are considered. Both the disks are rotating with different angular frequency and stretching rates. Modeling is performed for the energy equation subject to heat generation/absorption, dissipation, radiative heat flux, and Joule heating. Four types of irreversibilities are discussed, and total entropy rate is calculated. The obtained results are compared with past studies and found good agreement with them. The physical curiosity like skin friction and Sherwood and Nusselt numbers are numerically calculated. Series solutions are computed via homotopy method. Our obtained outcomes show that the velocity and temperature fields show contrast behavior against larger magnetic parameter. It is also noticed that the entropy rate and Bejan number have opposite behaviors against higher values of Weissenberg number. The entropy rate increases for higher Weissenberg number while Bejan number decays.},

Discovering governing equations and quantifying the dynamical properties of complex systems are among the central challenges. In this work, we devised a nonparametric approach to learning the relative entropy rate from observations of stochastic differential equations with different drift functions. The estimator corresponding to the relative entropy rate is then presented via the Gaussian process kernel theory. Meanwhile, this approach enables us to extract the governing equations. We illustrate our approach with several examples. Numerical experiments show the proposed approach performs well for rational drift functions, not only polynomial drift functions.},

Contrary to the previous works on the system, the boundary control is subject to the presence of an infinite memory term. In order to deal with such a nonlocal term, the minimal state approach is invoked. Specifically, a localized interior control is proposed in order to compensate the infinite memory effect. Thereafter, reasonable assumptions on the memory kernel are evoked so that the closed-loop system is shown to be well-posed thanks to semigroups theory of linear operators. Furthermore, the resolvent method is used to establish the exponential stability of the system.},

The kink, antikink, dark, bright, peakons, antipeakons, and periodic wave solutions are all derived. The existence criteria of solitons are described. It has been shown that for the selective values of arbitrary constants in an auxiliary equation, the generalized auxiliary equation method II is reduced to the new -model expansion method as well as the new extended auxiliary equation method. The impact of free parameters on the obtained solutions is investigated and graphically depicted using physical descriptions. The acquired results are important for the validity of numerical and experimental results and further understanding of the wave propagation in the nonlinear discrete electrical lattice. In addition, the stability analysis of the obtained solitary wave solutions is studied. Furthermore, using the maple software, all derived solutions were checked by re-entering them into the considered equation.},

  abstract     = {Hydrologic design is often based on assessments of large return interval measures; it is vital to be able to conclude them as precisely as possible. Henceforth, the selection of a probability distribution is very crucial for such cases. In view of this scenario, we propose and study a pliant probability distribution for precipitation data analysis. Some mathematical and statistical properties are analyzed. In order to make stronger predictions and judge the realistic return period, we have also characterized the model via Laplace transformation. We have estimated its parameters via the maximum likelihood estimation and constructed its information matrix for developing the confidence belt of population parameters. Moreover, a real-life setup is also considered by applying the model over precipitation data of diverse regions, including Jacksonville, Florida (USA), Barkhan (Pakistan), British Columbia (Canada), and Alexandria (Egypt). This investigated study is based on various statistical parametric and nonparametric tests, which indicates that the proposed model is one of the better strategies for precipitation data analysis when compared with the famous three-parameter Kappa model.},

Mathematical theory work mainly gives the existence of boundary and positive equilibria and shows their local as well as global stability in the deterministic model. Additionally, we explore the dynamics of V-geometric ergodicity, stochastic ultimate boundedness, stochastic permanence, persistence in the mean, stochastic extinction, and the existence of a unique ergodic stationary distribution in the corresponding stochastic version. Numerical simulation work mainly reveals that plankton body size can generate great influences on the interactions between phytoplankton and zooplankton, which in turn proves the effectiveness of mathematical theory analysis. It is worth emphasizing that for the small value of phytoplankton cell size, the increase of zooplankton body size can not change the phytoplankton density or zooplankton density; for the middle value of phytoplankton cell size, the increase of zooplankton body size can decrease zooplankton density or phytoplankton density; for the large value of phytoplankton cell size, the increase of zooplankton body size can increase zooplankton density but decrease phytoplankton density. Besides, it should be noted that the increase of zooplankton body size cannot affect the effect of random environmental disturbance, while the increase of phytoplankton cell size can weaken its effect. There results may enrich the dynamics of phytoplankton-zooplankton models.},

In this Haar wavelet collocation method (HWCM), the time part is discretized by using finite difference approximation, and space variables are handled by Haar series approximation. The main contribution of the proposed method is transforming this ill-posed problem into well-conditioned algebraic equation with the help of Haar functions, and hence, there is no need to implement any sort of regularization technique. The results of numerical method are efficient and stable for this ill-posed problems containing different noisy levels.

Analytically, we present an alternative method to obtain the acute threshold between stationarity and predator disappearance. Our analysis enriches and improves the work of Zhou et al. (2021) by unifying the criteria of said asymptotic characteristics. Numerically, we audit the accuracy of our threshold in three particular situations: linear, quadratic and cubic perturbations. We establish that the increasing order of disturbance has a passive influence on the extinction time of predators.

The stability of the positive equilibrium, the Hopf bifurcation, and the Turing instability of networked system are explored. By using the multiple time scale (MTS), the direction of the Hopf bifurcation is determined. It is found that the networked system may admit a supercritical or subcritical Hopf bifurcation. For the Turing instability, the positive equilibrium will change its stability from an unstable state to a stable one with the change of the connecting probability. That is not the case in the model without network structure. Theoretical results also show that the model can create rich dynamical behaviors and numerical simulations well verify the validity of the theoretical analysis.},

Two formulations are studied and implemented numerically using a finite element method (FEM). We present numerical reconstructions of the missing data on the inaccessible part of the boundary from the knowledge of over-prescribed noisy data for both smooth and piecewise smooth two-dimensional geometries. Numerical examples validate the convergence, stability and efficiency of the proposed numerical algorithm, as well as its capability to deblur the noisy data.},

In this paper, we give an asymptotic expansion of the solution of the above equations at high Reynolds number by using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and prove convergence of the asymptotic solution under some assumptions. By analyzing the dimensionless form of one-dimensional steady compressible Navier–Stokes equations, we find that if there are extreme points inside the boundary layer, the number of extreme points of velocity is at most one more than that of total enthalpy and the extreme points of each flow variables are different from each other. Based on the second-order asymptotic expansion solution, we show that there are extreme points inside the thin boundary layer under some special conditions. Examples are given to verify theoretical analysis. The present asymptotic expansion solution is valuable for verifying the efficiency of high-order numerical methods in flow simulation of high Reynolds number.},

We show that the set of constant equilibrium solutions is unstable when , Lyapunov stable when , and globally exponentially stable when . Second, we show that the controlled GKdVBKS equation has a unique strong solution. Then, we synthesize a single bounded input-feedback controller for the GKdVBKS equation through its linearized system avoiding any spillover. The approach used is valid due to the Fréchet differentiability of the nonlinear -semigroup generated by the nonlinear GKdVBKS equation with its derivative being the linear -semigroup generated by the linearized system. Finally, numerical results for different values of the parameters of the equation are presented to illustrate the developed theory.},

Then, by using the fixed point theorem on cones, we construct an operator and prove the existence of positive non-decreasing solutions on cones in semi-order Banach spaces. In addition, we also use Picard–Lindelöf theorem to prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the equation. Second, we investigate the existence of a solution to the boundary value problem (BVP) on cones with integral boundary conditions of a mix-order differential equation with respect to non-additive measures.

It is proven that the developed numerical method is uniformly convergent of first order in time and third order in space. The purpose of the additive scheme is to decouple the components of the vector approximate solution at each time step and thus make the computation more efficient.

  abstract     = {Triangular operators are an essential tool in the study of nonselfadjoint operators that appear in different fields with a wide range of applications. Although the development of a quaternionic counterpart for this theory started at the beginning of this century, the lack of a proper spectral theory combined with problems caused by the underlying noncommutative structure prevented its real development for a long time. In this paper, we give criteria for a quaternionic linear operator to have a triangular representation, namely, under which conditions such operators can be represented as a sum of a diagonal operator with a Volterra operator. To this effect, we investigate quaternionic Volterra operators based on the quaternionic spectral theory arising from the S-spectrum. This allow us to obtain conditions when a non-selfadjoint operator admits a triangular representation.},

  abstract     = {Tuberculosis was ranked No. 3 among 29 types of infectious diseases in January 2022 of Jiangsu Province, in the southeast of China, and it has strong seasonality whose incidence rate has been high in springs and low in winters. This comprehensive study extends the spreading dynamics to the control strategies of TB in Jiangsu Province with time-varying transmission rate, which is the first one in this type. The periodic transmission rate is incorporated to the classic SEIR model with susceptible, latent, infectious, and recovered compartments. The analysis shows that when the basic reproduction number R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ is less than one, the epidemic will eventually disappear but, if R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ is larger than one, the disease may persist with a periodic solution. The value of Jiangsu TB is calculated as 1.297. In addition, the model predicts that the epidemic will not disappear over time and there will be a major outbreak after certain years. To eradicate TB, this work introduces three control strategies on susceptible, latent, and infectious populations. It turns out that the optimal control solutions can reduce the incidence rate in 2035 by 90 % from 2015, the goal of World Health Organization. Simultaneously, we find that the optimal controls have the same seasonality as the transmission rate. This indicates that Jiangsu Province needs to invest more control efforts in springs than in winters. In addition, the cost of control strategies is analyzed in terms of the unit cost, total cost, and incremental cost-effectiveness. Summarizing all results, we recommend targeting the latent patients, or both latent and infectious individuals, with the transmission rate-synchronized control strength as the most effective control strategy, to mitigate or even eradicate TB disease in Jiangsu Province.},

To depict the nature of propagation of the nonlinear waves in nature, a range of nonlinear evolution equations has been proposed and investigated in the existing literature. In this article, solitary and traveling periodic wave solutions for the (2 + 1)-dimensional modified KdV-KP equation are derived by employing an ansatz method, named the enhanced (G′/G)-expansion method. For this continued equation, abundant solitary wave solutions and nonlinear periodic wave solutions, along with some free parameters, are obtained. We have derived the exact expressions for the solitary waves that arise in the continuum-modified KdV-KP model. We study the significance of parameters numerically that arise in the obtained solutions. These parameters play an important role in the physical structure and propagation directions of the wave that characterizes the wave pattern. We discuss the relation between velocity and parameters and illustrate them graphically. Our numerical analysis suggests that the taller solitons are narrower than shorter waves and can travel faster. In addition, graphical representations of some obtained solutions along with their contour plot and wave train profiles are presented. The speed, as well as the profile of these solitary waves, is highly sensitive to the free parameters. Our results establish that the continuum-modified KdV-KP system supports solitary waves having different shapes and speeds for different values of the parameters.},

We focus on extending the results of this problem for polytropic gas to that for a more realistic gas, that is, van der Waals gas. In this case, rarefaction waves, shock wave, fan–jump composite waves, or fan–jump–fan composite waves may be appeared. The flow expands to vacuum state when the inclination angle θ $$ \theta $$ is small enough, that is, a zone of cavitation will come into being. Otherwise, the flow will arrive at a zone of constant state. The corresponding problem can be transformed into interaction of a planar rarefaction wave with a planar centered wave and interaction of a simple wave with rigid wall, which are actually characteristic boundary value problems for 2-D self-similar Euler system. The estimates of solution are obtained by making use of characteristic analysis, corresponding characteristic decompositions and invariant region of solution. Furthermore, by extending the local solution, and combining with those estimates and hyperbolicity, the existence of global classical solution up to the interface of non-ideal gas with vacuum is obtained.},

In order to avoid peripheral velocities of arbitrary magnitude, as it may happen for a rigid rotating body, they are organized to form successive encapsulated shells, with substructures recalling ball-bearing assemblies. A recipe for the construction of these solutions is provided by playing with the eigenfunctions of the vector Laplace operator. Some applications relative to astronomy are finally discussed.},

Secondly, the stochastic Legendre–Galerkin Chebyshev collocation scheme is developed for solving the stochastic Burgers equation; that is, the stochastic Legendre–Galerkin method is used to discrete the random variable meanwhile the nonlinear term is interpolated through the Chebyshev–Gauss points. Then a set of deterministic linear equations can be obtained, which is in contrast to the other existing methods for the stochastic Burgers equation. The mean square convergence of the former method is analyzed. Numerical experiments are performed to show the effectiveness of our two methods. Both methods provide alternative approaches to deal with the stochastic differential equations with nonlinear terms.},

Various shell models are studied for their mathematical relevance and the numerical simulations that exhibit at most resemblance with turbulent flows. One of the mathematically well-studied shell model of turbulence is called sabra shell model. This work concerns with two important issues related to shell model, namely, feedback stabilization and robust stabilization. We first address stabilization problem related to sabra shell model of turbulence and prove that the system can be stabilized via finite dimensional controller. Thus, only finitely many modes of the shell model would suffice to stabilize the system. Later, we study robust stabilization in the presence of the unknown disturbance and corresponding control problem by solving an infinite time horizon max-min control problem.

Then, we utilize the orthonormal Bernstein basis functions to approximate the solution of the reformulated problem and use a direct technique based on the operational matrices of integration and differentiation of these basis functions together with the collocation technique to reduce the problem to a system of nonlinear algebraic equations. Regarding the perturbed measurements, the method takes advantage of the mollification method in order to derive stable numerical derivatives. Numerical simulations for solving several test examples are presented to show the applicability of the proposed method for obtaining accurate and stable results.},

It is shown that progression of viral infection can be characterized by the viral replication number, time-dependent viral load, and the speed of infection spreading. These three characteristics are determined through the original model parameters including the rates of cell infection and of virus production in the infected cells. The clinical manifestations of viral infection, depending on tissue damage, correlate with the speed of infection spreading, while the infectivity of a respiratory infection depends on the viral load in the upper respiratory tract. Parameter determination from the experiments on Delta and Omicron variants allows the estimation of the infection spreading speed and viral load. Different variants of the SARS-CoV-2 infection are compared confirming that Omicron is more infectious and has less severe symptoms than Delta variant. Within the same variant, spreading speed (symptoms) correlates with viral load allowing prognosis of disease progression.},

  abstract     = {To understand dynamics of the COVID-19 disease realistically, a new SEIAPHR model has been proposed in this article where the infectious individuals have been categorized as symptomatic, asymptomatic, and super-spreaders. The model has been investigated for existence of a unique solution. To measure the contagiousness of COVID-19, reproduction number R 0 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0 $$ is also computed using next generation matrix method. It is shown that the model is locally stable at disease-free equilibrium point when R 0 &lt; 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;amp;lt;1 $$ and unstable for R 0 &gt; 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;amp;gt;1 $$ . The model has been analyzed for global stability at both of the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. Sensitivity analysis is also included to examine the effect of parameters of the model on reproduction number R 0 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0 $$ . A couple of optimal control problems have been designed to study the effect of control strategies for disease control and eradication from the society.

Using the technique of quasilinearization, the nonlinear model is reduced into a sequence of linearized problems. Then, a spectral collocation procedure based on novel shifted Vieta-Fibonacci (SVF) is applied to transform each subproblem into a linear algebraic system of equations. An upper bound for the error is provided, and convergence analysis of the SVF series solution in the weighted L 2 $$ {L}_2 $$ norm is discussed. The technique of error correction is used to improve the SVF polynomial solutions by means of the residual error function. Various numerical tests are provided to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the presented collocation algorithm. The validation of the proposed approach is shown by comparison with available existing numerical solutions.},

The location of the viscous damping are divided into two groups, characterized by whether both of the top and bottom layers are directly damped or otherwise. Each group consists of three cases.

The solutions on the Cantor sets are presented via the 3-D contours.

After introduction of isothermal (conformal) metrics on surfaces of revolution, the axially symmetric solution of the Euler–Lagrange equation for the quasi-one-dimensional magnetic Hamiltonian has been obtained for all four discussed cases in the form of an incomplete elliptic integral of the third kind. It has been shown that the limiting case of XY model can be achieved from an easy-plane regime when the parameter of anisotropy of interaction amongst spins λ $$ \lambda $$ is approaching −1, while the isotropic case can be achieved from both easy-plane and easy-axis regimes when is approaching 0. After the application of the corresponding boundary conditions, the soliton-like solutions have been obtained that either cover the whole surface (in a one-twist or multi-twist manner) or can be arranged in the form of a periodic lattice structure on the curved surface. The general unifying scheme has been illustrated using the exemplary surfaces of revolution with zero (cylinder), negative (catenoid), and positive (sphere) Gaussian curvatures.},

In this first part of the paper, we take an approach to the study of the semifocal anomaly in the hyperbolic motion and in the limit case corresponding to the parabolic movement. From here, we find a relation between the semifocal anomaly and the true anomaly that holds independently of the movement type. We focus on the study of the two-body problem when this new anomaly is used as the temporal variable. In the second part, we show the use of this anomaly—combined with numerical integration methods—to improve integration errors in one revolution. Finally, we analyze the errors committed in the integration process—depending on several values of the eccentricity—for the elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic cases in the apsidal region.},

  abstract     = {We consider the upscaled linear elasticity problem in the context of periodic homogenization. Based on measurements of the deformation of the (macroscopic) boundary of a body for a given forcing, it is the aim to deduce information on the geometry of the microstructure. For a parametrized microstructure, we are able to prove that there exists at least one solution of the associated minimization problem based on the L 2 $$ {L}&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x0005E;2 $$ -difference of the measured deformation and the resulting deformation for a given parameter. To facilitate the use of gradient-based algorithms, we derive the Gâteaux derivatives using the Lagrangian method of Céa, and we present numerical experiments showcasing the functioning of the method.},

Since the study of dynamic equations on time scales can unify the study of differential equations and difference equations. Therefore, in this paper, we first propose a concept of  Weyl almost automorphic functions on time scales and then take the Clifford-valued shunt inhibitory cellular neural networks with time-varying delays on time scales as an example of dynamic equations on time scales to study the existence and global exponential stability of their Weyl almost automorphic solutions.

  abstract     = {This work is to investigate terminal value problem for a stochastic time fractional wave equation, driven by a cylindrical Wiener process on a Hilbert space. A representation of the solution is obtained by basing on the terminal value data u ⁡ ( T , x ) = φ ⁡ ( x ) $$ u\left(T,x\right)&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#x0003D;\varphi (x) $$ and the spectrum of the fractional Laplacian operator ( − Δ ) s / 2 $$ {\left(-\Delta \right)}&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#x0005E;{s/2} $$ (in a bounded domain 𝕏 ⊂ ℝ d , 0 &lt; s &lt; 2 $$ 0&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;s&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;2 $$ ).

We give an explanation why the time continuity of the solution at t = 0 $$ t&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#x0003D;0 $$ could not derived. The main reason comes from unboundedness of a solution operator, so the problem (IP) is then ill-posed, that is, recovery cannot be obtained in general. Hence, we propose a truncation regularization method with a suitable choice of the regularization parameter. Finally, we present a numerical example to demonstrate our proposed method.},

A couple of counterexamples are presented to show that the method is inconclusive and no certificate of quality can be given, when using it as a means to detect anomalies. Hence, an alternative version of the method is proposed whose mathematical foundation is fully justified. Furthermore, a criterion for choosing the number of sampled trees needed to guarantee confidence intervals of the numerical results is presented. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to compare the performance of the classic method with the proposed one.},

From a physical point of view, the initial boundary value problem considered here is a mathematical model of quasistationary processes in semiconductors and magnets, which takes into account a wide variety of physical factors. Many approximate methods are suitable for finding eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in problems where the boundary conditions are linear with respect to the desired function and its derivatives. Among these methods, the Galerkin method leads to the simplest calculations. On the basis of a priori estimates, we prove a local existence theorem and uniqueness for a weak generalized solution of the initial boundary value problem for the quasilinear pseudoparabolic equation. A special place in the theory of nonlinear equations is occupied by the study of unbounded solutions, or, as they are called in another way, blow-up regimes. Nonlinear evolutionary problems admitting unbounded solutions are globally unsolvable. In the article, sufficient conditions for the blow-up of a solution in a finite time in a limited area with a nonlinear Neumann–Dirichlet boundary condition are obtained.},

We have chosen specific values of the parameters of the systems so that the openings of the potential well in both systems are approximately of the same size. We have found that, in the galactic system, the distribution of the times of escape follows a sequential pattern that has never been detected before. Moreover, we have proved that this pattern is directly related to the geometry of the stable manifolds to the Lyapunov orbits located at the openings of the potential. Finally, we have shown that the different nature of the two systems affects the way the escape occurs, due to the difference in the geometry of the manifolds to the Lyapunov orbits in both systems.},

  abstract     = {For material modeling of microstructured media, an accurate characterization of the underlying microstructure is indispensable. Mathematically speaking, the overall goal of microstructure characterization is to find simple functionals which describe the geometric shape as well as the composition of the microstructures under consideration and enable distinguishing microstructures with distinct effective material behavior. For this purpose, we propose using Minkowski tensors, in general, and the quadratic normal tensor, in particular, and introduce a computational algorithm applicable to voxel-based microstructure representations. Rooted in the mathematical field of integral geometry, Minkowski tensors associate a tensor to rather general geometric shapes, which make them suitable for a wide range of microstructured material classes. Furthermore, they satisfy additivity and continuity properties, which makes them suitable and robust for large-scale applications. We present a modular algorithm for computing the quadratic normal tensor of digital microstructures. We demonstrate multigrid convergence for selected numerical examples and apply our approach to a variety of microstructures. Strikingly, the presented algorithm remains unaffected by inaccurate computation of the interface area. The quadratic normal tensor may be used for engineering purposes, such as mean field homogenization or as target value for generating synthetic microstructures.},

Triangular perfect quasi type-2 fuzzy numbers are taken to propose the new method. The main significance of the proposed method is that it uses the arithmetic of interval theory, which makes this method easier to handle. Five numerical examples are solved to show the validation of the proposed technique. Further, two application problems related to 6-bar truss and rectangular sheet are encountered in type-2 fuzzy environment. Comparison among the results obtained by the present method and previously achieved results is also made in this work, which shows that the results are close enough and, in some cases, better bounds for the solution are obtained.},

For the study of integral operators, the notions of weak and strong homogeneity of the kernel are introduced. The weak case is proved to generate a homogeneous operator in the sense of our definition, while the stronger condition corresponds to the most relevant specific examples—classes of homogeneous integral operators on various metric spaces—and allows us to obtain an explicit general form for the kernels of such operators.

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with performance output tracking for an Euler–Bernoulli beam equation with moment boundary control and shear boundary disturbance. An infinite-dimensional disturbance estimator is designed to estimate the total disturbance. By compensating the total disturbance, a servomechanism corresponding to the reference signal and servomechanism-based output feedback control law are designed. It is proved that under such control law, the performance output tracks exponentially the reference signal and the involved states of closed-loop system are bounded. The most important contribution is to deal with the shear boundary term stemmed from the error system between the disturbance estimator and the original system. The admissibility does not hold for such shear boundary term, while the corresponding boundary terms in the existing literature was proved to be admissible. Two key steps are presented to cope with such problem: First, the semigroup generation and exponential stability for a coupled beam system are verified by Riesz basis approach; second, the admissibility of a control operator for semigroup governed by such coupled beam system is proved. Moreover, Sobolev embedding theorem is introduced to simplify the proof of the boundedness of the closed-loop systems with respect to the available literature. Some numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness.},

In this paper, we investigate the collective migration model, which consists of two parts: Cucker–Smale type interaction and target velocity. Each agent has a strategy to allocate limited energy to group interaction and velocity tracking. In this case, if the system achieves monocluster flocking then the final velocity is equal to target velocity. When the strategy is invariant, we show that 1/2 is a critical threshold which is consistent with the classical Cucker–Smale model. When the strategy is time varying, we provide a time-varying strategy named threshold strategy to ensure that for any initial state the system achieves monocluster flocking and the final velocity reaches target velocity. In addition, the case of multiple target velocities is considered. According to the theory of bicluster flocking, we obtain a sufficient framework to guarantee that the system achieves bicluster flocking and two groups would reach their target velocities, respectively.},

The proposed work discusses a model for interacting nutrient phytoplankton systems with the effect of toxic chemicals released by phytoplankton and time delay in toxin liberation. Our main aim is to provide a great insight into the impact of toxins and time delay on the dynamics of nutrient-phytoplankton. We investigate the stability of system dynamics, and the condition for the existence of Turing instability is obtained. The role of time delay is also investigated for the proposed system. The numerical simulation shows that toxin release rate, the diffusion coefficient of nutrients, and time delay significantly impact system dynamics. We observe that increasing values of toxin release results in the system dynamics show stable and oscillatory behavior without diffusion. The spatial and spatio-temporal patterns show that the higher value of the rate of toxin release lead to periodic and standing waves. Finally, we observe that the time delay in toxin distribution term stabilizes and destabilizes the system dynamics.},

The model contemplates a time-delay τ $$ \tau $$ due to the dead-time (non-trivial) that the microbe needed to metabolize the substrate. A Hopf bifurcation analysis is performed to characterize the inherent self oscillatory experimental bioprocess response. As consequence, stability conditions for the equilibrium point together with conditions for limit cycles using the delay τ $$ \tau $$ as bifurcation parameter are obtained. Under the assumptions that the use of observers, estimators, or extra laboratory measurements are avoided to prevent the rise of computational or monetary costs, for the purpose of control, we will only consider the measurement of the biomass. A simple controller that can be employed is the proportional action controller , which is shown to fail to stabilize the obtained model under the proposed analysis. Another suitable choice is the use of a delayed controller which successfully stabilizes the model even when it is unstable. The delay in the feedback control is due to the dead-time necessary to obtain the measurement of the biomass in the bioreactor by dry weight. Finally, the proposed theoretical results are corroborated through numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Vector–host diseases outbreak is a major public health concern, and it has greatly affected human health and economy in various regions around the globe. Different approaches have been adopted to investigate the dynamical behavior and possible control of these diseases. In this study, we present a compartmental transmission model in order to explore the dynamics of vector–host infectious diseases. The saturated incidence rate instead of bilinear (or standard) and saturated treatment function is considered in model formulation which enhance the biological suitability of the proposed model. We first formulate the model based on nonlinear classical integer-order differential equations. Then, the proposed integer-order model is reformulated using the fractional-order operator in Caputo–Fabrizio sense with nonsingular kernel. We investigate the model equilibria and evaluate the expression for the most important threshold parameter known as the basic reproduction number. Furthermore, the existence and uniqueness are presented via the fixed point approach. Additionally, using an efficient numerical scheme, the iterative solution of the model is obtained. Finally, we present the model simulations to illustrate the impact of arbitrary fractional order and some of other important parameters involved in the model on the disease dynamics and minimization.},

In order to reach the goals of synchronization and more accurately gauge of settling time and error level, several fresh quantized controllers are structured to make the utmost of confined communication resources. Then, based on the finite-time theorem, quantized control strategy, Lyapunov function theory and properties of Mittag–Leffler function as well as inequality analysis techniques, some plentiful criteria are formed to set up a relation between control gains and quantization parameters. In addition, the corresponding error bound of QPS and guages of the settling time on FTS are also given. Finally, a few numerical examples are introduced to validate the effectiveness of the presented control protocols.},

We prove the uniqueness of the considered inverse problem and the Lipschitz continuity of the forward operator. Then the inverse problem is formulated into a variational problem by the Tikhonov-type regularization. Based on the continuity of the forward operator, we prove that the minimizer of the Tikhonov-type functional exists and converges to the exact solution under an a priori choice of regularization parameter. The steepest descent method combined with Nesterov acceleration is adopted to solve the variational problem. Three numerical examples are presented to support the efficiency and rationality of our proposed method.},

For the case of zero boundary conditions, in terms of the Laurent&#39;s series and generalization of the residue theorem, the bound-state soliton is derived. For nonzero boundary conditions, using the robust inverse scattering transform, we present a matrix Riemann–Hilbert problem of the sixth-order nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Then, based on the obtained Riemann–Hilbert problem, the rogue wave solutions are derived through a modified Darboux transformation. Besides, according to some appropriate parameters choices, several graphical analysis are provided to discuss the dynamical behaviors of the rogue wave solutions and analyze how the higher-order terms affect the rogue wave.},

Using some nonlinear analysis techniques, we analyze stability of the algorithms and derive optimal order error estimates of the approximate solutions. Theoretical and numerical results show that, when the algorithmic parameters are chosen appropriately, the accuracy of the approximate solutions computed by our two-grid stabilized algorithms is comparable to that of solving a fully stabilized nonlinear problem on the same fine grid; however, our two-grid algorithms save a large amount of CPU time than the one-grid stabilized algorithm.},
