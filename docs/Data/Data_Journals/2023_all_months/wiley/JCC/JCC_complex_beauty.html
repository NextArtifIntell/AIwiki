  abstract     = {The recent discovery that anaerobic methanogens can reductively dissolve pyrite and utilize dissolution products as a source of iron and sulfur to meet their biosynthetic demands for these elements prompted the development of atomic-scale nanoparticle models, as maquettes of reactive surface sites, for describing the fundamental redox steps that take place at the mineral surface during reduction. The given report describes our computational approach for modeling n (FeS 2 ) nanoparticles originated from mineral bulk structure. These maquettes contain a comprehensive set of coordinatively unsaturated Fe (II) sites that are connected via a range of persulfide (S 2 2− ) ligation. In addition to the specific maquettes with n = 8, 18, and 32 FeS 2 units, we established guidelines for obtaining low-energy structures by considering the pattern of ionic, covalent, and magnetic interactions among the metal and ligand sites. The developed models serve as computational nano-reactors that can be used to describe the reductive dissolution mechanism of pyrite to better understand the reactive sites on the mineral, where microbial extracellular electron-transfer reactions can occur.},

Both basis sets are made free of variational prolapse, being developed by means of a polynomial version of the generator coordinate Dirac–Fock method. In addition, these sets were designed to be promptly used with two popular finite nuclear models, uniform sphere and Gaussian nuclei. The largest basis set errors found with the uniform sphere nucleus are 27.3 and 10.6 mHartree, respectively, for the small- and medium-size sets. The largest basis set errors obtained with the Gaussian nuclear model are smaller, reaching 23.2 and 7.1 mHartree for the small- and medium-size sets, respectively.

We report new LHs that focus on an improvement of the LMF in the core region while retaining or partly improving upon the high accuracy in the valence region exhibited by the LH20t functional. The suggested new pt-LMFs are based on a Padé form and modify the previously used ratio between von Weizsäcker and Kohn–Sham local kinetic energies by different powers of the density to enable flexibly improved approximations to the correct high-density and iso-orbital limits relevant for the innermost core region. Using TDDFT calculations for a set of K-shell core excitations of second- and third-period systems including accurate state-of-the-art relativistic orbital corrections, the core part of the LMF is optimized, while the valence part is optimized as previously reported for test sets of atomization energies and reaction barriers (Haasler et al., J Chem Theory Comput 2020 , 16 , 5645). The LHs are completed by a calibration function that minimizes spurious nondynamical correlation effects caused by the gauge ambiguities of exchange-energy densities, as well as by B95c meta-GGA correlation. The resulting LH23pt functional relates to the previous LH20t functional but specifically improves upon the core region.},

We have shown that the recently synthesized pyrocarbonate structure SrC 2 O 5 - P 2 1 / c is thermodynamically stable for both SrC 2 O 5 and BaC 2 O 5 . Thus, SrC 2 O 5 - P 2 1 / c is stable relative to decomposition reaction above 10 GPa, while the lower-pressure stability limit for BaC 2 O 5 - P 2 1 / c is 5 GPa, which is the lowest value for the formation of pyrocarbonates. For SrC 2 O 5 , the following polymorphic transitions were found with increasing pressure: P 2 1 / c → F d d 2 at 40 GPa and 1000 K, F d d 2 → C 2 at 90 GPa and 1000 K. SrC 2 O 5 - F d d 2 and SrC 2 O 5 - C 2 are characterized by the framework and layered structures of [CO 4 ] 4 − tetrahedra, respectively. For BaC 2 O 5 , with increasing pressure, decomposition of BaC 2 O 5 - P 2 1 / c into BaCO 3 and CO 2 is observed at 34 GPa without any polymorphic transitions.},

  abstract     = {The alternant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pyrene has photophysical properties that can be tuned with different donor and acceptor substituents. Recently, a D (donor)-Pyrene (bridge)-A (acceptor) system, DPA, with the electron donor N,N-dimethylaniline (DMA), and the electron acceptor trifluoromethylphenyl (TFM), was investigated by means of time-resolved spectroscopic measurements ( J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 2226–2231). DPA shows great promise for potential applications in organic electronic devices. In this work, we used the ab initio second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction method ADC(2) to investigate the excited-state properties of a series of analogous DPA systems, including the originally synthesized DPAs. The additionally investigated substituents were amino, fluorine, and methoxy as donors and nitrile and nitro groups as acceptors. The focus of this work was on characterizing the lowest excited singlet states regarding charge transfer (CT) and local excitation (LE) characters. For the DMA-pyrene-TFM system, the ADC(2) calculations show two initial electronic states relevant for interpreting the photodynamics. The bright S 1 state is locally excited within the pyrene moiety, and an S 2 state is localized ~0.5 eV above S 1 and characterized as a donor to pyrene CT state. HOMO and LUMO energies were employed to assess the efficiency of the DPA compounds for organic photovoltaics (OPVs). HOMO-LUMO and optical gaps were used to estimate power conversion and light-harvesting efficiencies for practical applications in organic solar cells. Considering the systems using smaller D/A substituents, compounds with the strong acceptor NO 2 substituent group show enhanced CT and promising properties for use in OPVs. Some of the other compounds with small substituents are also found to be competitive in this regard.},

  abstract     = {Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) was applied to gain insights into the electronic and vibrational spectroscopic properties of an important electron transport mediator, methyl viologen (MV 2+ ). An organic dication, MV 2+ has numerous applications in electrochemistry that include energy conversion and storage, environmental remediation, and chemical sensing and electrosynthesis. MV 2+ is easily reduced by a single electron transfer to form a radical cation species (MV •+ ), which has an intense UV–visible absorption near 600 nm. The redox properties of the MV 2+ /MV •+ couple and light-sensitivity of MV •+ have made the system appealing for photo-electrochemical energy conversion (e.g., solar hydrogen generation from water) and the study of photo-induced charge transfer processes through electronic absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopic measurements. The reported work applies leading TDDFT approaches to investigate the electronic and vibrational spectroscopic properties of MV 2+ and MV •+ . Using a conventional hybrid exchange functional (B3-LYP) and a long-range corrected hybrid exchange functional (ωB97X-D3), including with a conductor-like polarizable continuum model to account for solvation, the electronic absorption and resonance Raman spectra predicted are in good agreement with experiment. Also analyzed are the charge transfer character and natural transition orbitals derived from the TDDFT vertical excitations calculated. The findings and models developed further the understanding of the electronic properties of viologens and related organic redox mediators important in renewable energy applications and serve as a reference for guiding the interpretation of electronic absorption and Raman spectra of the ions.},

Calculating the LC effect on the total electron densities shows that the LC stabilizes the electrons around the long-range interaction regions of kinetic energy density, which are assumed to be electrons other than free electrons and self-interacting electrons, while the CCSD method stabilizes the electrons in the long-range interaction regions in the vertical molecular planes. As a more precise test, the LC effect on orbital densities are compared to the CCSD effect on Dyson orbital densities. Surprisingly, these effects are similar for the unoccupied orbitals, indicating that the LC covers the effects required to reproduce the CCSD Dyson unoccupied orbitals. For exploring the discrepancies between these effects on the occupied orbitals, the photoionization cross sections are calculated as a direct test for the shapes of the HOMOs to investigate the differences between these effects on the occupied orbitals. Consequently, the LC clearly produces the canonical HOMOs close to the CCSD Dyson and experimental ones, except for the HOMO of benzene molecule that mixes with the HOMO − 1 for the CCSD Dyson orbitals. This indicates that the orbital analyses using the photoionization cross sections are available as a direct test for the quality of DFT functionals.},

Besides the obvious advantage of being spin-pure, the presented method combines the compactness of the configurational ansatz with the known efficiency of the HCI algorithm and a variety of algorithmic and conceptual ideas to achieve a high level of performance. In particular, through pruning of the selected configurational space after HCI selection by means of a more strict criterion, a more compact wavefunction representation is obtained. Moreover, the underlying logic of the method allows us to minimize the number of redundant matrix-matrix multiplications while making use of just-in-time compilation to achieve fast diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. The critical search for 2-electron connections within the configurational space is facilitated by a tree-based representation thereof as suggested previously by Gopal et al. Usage of a prefix-based parallelization and batching during the calculation of the PT2-correction leads to a good load balancing and significantly reduced memory requirements for these critical steps of the calculation. In this way, the need for a semistochastic approach to the PT2 correction is avoided even for large configurational spaces. Finally, several test-cases are discussed to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the presented method.},

  abstract     = {With the rise of quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods, the interest in the calculation of molecular assemblies has increased considerably. The structures and dynamics of such assemblies are usually governed to a large extend by intermolecular interactions. As a result, the corresponding potential energy surfaces are topological rich and possess many shallow minima. Therefore, local structure optimizations of QM/MM molecular assemblies can be challenging, in particular if optimization constraints are imposed. To overcome this problem, structure optimization in normal coordinate space is advocated. To do so, the external degrees of freedom of a molecule are separated from the internal ones by a projector matrix in the space of the Cartesian coordinates. Here we extend this approach to Cartesian constraints. To this end, we devise an algorithm that adds the Cartesian constraints directly to the projector matrix and in this way eliminates them from the reduced coordinate space in which the molecule is optimized. To analyze the performance and stability of the constrained optimization algorithm in normal coordinate space, we present constrained minimizations of small molecular systems and amino acids in gas phase as well as water employing QM/MM constrained optimizations. All calculations are performed in the framework of auxiliary density functional theory as implemented in the program deMon2k.},

  abstract     = {Fragmentation-based methods for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shift calculations have become more and more popular in first-principles calculations of large molecules. However, there are many options for a fragmentation-based method to select, such as theoretical methods, fragmentation schemes, the number of levels of theory, etc. It is important to study the optimal combination of the options to achieve a good balance between accuracy and efficiency. Here we investigate different combinations of options used by a fragmentation-based method, the eXtended ONIOM (XO) method, for 13 C chemical shift calculations on a set of organic and biological molecules. We found that: (1) introducing Hartree-Fock exchange into density functional theory (DFT) could reduce the calculation error due to fragmentation in contrast to pure DFT functionals, while a hybrid functional, xOPBE, is generally recommended; (2) fragmentation schemes generated from the molecular tailoring approach (MTA) with small level parameter n , for example, n = 2 and the degree-based fragmentation method (DBFM) with n = 1, are sufficient to achieve satisfactory accuracy; (3) the two-level XO (XO2) NMR calculation is superior to the calculation with only one level of theory, as the second level (i.e., low level) of theory provides a way to well describe the long-range effect. These findings are beneficial to practical applications of fragmentation-based methods for NMR chemical shift calculations of large molecules.},

  abstract     = {Conformational space annealing (CSA), a global optimization method, has been applied to various protein structure modeling tasks. In this paper, we applied CSA to the cryo-EM structure modeling task by combining the python subroutine of CSA (PyCSA) and the fast relax ( FastRelax ) protocol of PyRosetta. Refinement of initial structures generated from two methods, rigid fitting of predicted structures to the Cryo-EM map and de novo protein modeling by tracing the Cryo-EM map, was performed by CSA. In the refinement of the rigid-fitted structures, the final models showed that CSA can generate reliable atomic structures of proteins, even when large movements of protein domains were required. In the de novo modeling case, although the overall structural qualities of the final models were rather dependent on the initial models, the final models generated by CSA showed improved MolProbity scores and cross-correlation coefficients to the maps. These results suggest that CSA can accomplish flexible fitting and refinement together by sampling diverse conformations effectively and thus can be utilized for cryo-EM structure modeling.},

Thus, accurately predicting the maximum UV–Vis wavelength ( λ max ) values is critical in designing dye-conjugated material. Extensive metadynamics simulations were carried out to generate capsanthin conformers at various levels of the extended tight-binding method. Benchmarking the time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) methods help understand the results of a particular functional and allows a comparison between results obtained with different functional. The long-range correction (LC) scheme in LC-TD-DFT-D4/ωB97X/def2-SVP has been found to reproduce the experimental λ max , and exhibited the effect of conformational changes to the calculated wavelengths. On the other hand, an inexpensive yet efficient LC-TD-DFTB method reproduced the experimental λ max insensitive to conformational changes.},

To this end, a static exploration of the potential energy surface (PES) was carried together with the analysis of the free-energy surface (FES), both surfaces being evaluated at density functional theory level and different exchange-correlation functionals. While the concerted mechanism has been clearly discharged, the characteristics of the stepwise PT significantly depends on the chosen functionals, some suggesting a clear stepwise mechanism characterized by a stable reaction intermediates and two transitions states, whereas other approaches propend for a asynchronous PT, with a single TS. These features appear on both PES and FES, albeit some differences appears due to their different nature.},

Various aromaticity indices including NICS, ACID, EDDB together with isodesmic reactions support the adaptive σ aromaticity in these rhenacyclopropene rings. As the T1state of these species is formed by the ππ* excitation, the σ-aromaticity of these three-membered rings in the S0state could hold in the T1state.

Analyses of electronic properties indicate that the doped Cr atom can only enhance the stability of larger silver clusters. Optical absorption and photoelectron spectra of AgnCr isomers have been predicted and can be used for their structural identification. The icosahedral Ag12Cr cluster with large energy level gap can be seen as a superatom. The adsorption capacity of Cr atom in AgnCr cluster to CO is much higher than that of free Cr atom. The intensity of IR and Ramam spectra can be dramatically enhanced when CO is absorbed on AgnCr cluster that Cr atom is encapsulated by Ag atoms. Moreover, the red shift of IR and Raman spectra of CO adsorbed on these clusters is also very small compared to free CO. Magnetism calculations show that the magnetic moment of AgnCr clusters decreases linearly fromn= 6 to 12 and increases linearly fromn= 12 to 16. The total magnetic moment of AgnCr cluster is mainly localized on the Cr atom. The change of magnetic moment of Cr atom is related to the charge transfer between Cr and Ag atoms.},

  abstract     = {Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) systems have promising applications in different organic electronic devices. In this work, we investigated the effect of 20 different substituent groups on the optoelectronic properties of DPP-based derivatives as the donor (D)-material in an organic photovoltaic (OPV) device. For this purpose, we employed Hammett&#39;s theory (HT), which quantifies the electron-donating or -withdrawing properties of a given substituent group. Machine learning (ML)-basedσm,σp,σm0,σp0,σp+,σp−,σI, andσRHammett&#39;s constants previously determined were used. Mono- (DPP-X1) and di-functionalized (DPP-X2) DPPs, where X is a substituent group, were investigated using density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT (TDDFT), and ab initio methods. Several properties were computed using CAM-B3LYP and the second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction, ADC(2), an ab initio wave function method, including the adiabatic ionization potential (IPA), the electron affinity (EAA), the HOMO-LUMO gaps (Eg), and the maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax), the first excited state transition1S0→1S1energies (∆E) (the optical gap), and exciton binding energies. From the optoelectronic properties and employing typical acceptor systems, the power conversion efficiency (PCE), open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) were predicted for a DPP-based OPV device. These photovoltaic properties were also correlated with the machine learning (ML)-based Hammett&#39;s constants. Overall, good correlations between all properties and the different types ofσconstants were obtained, except for theσIconstants, which are related to inductive effects. This scenario suggests that resonance is the main factor controlling electron donation and withdrawal effects. We found that substituent groups with largeσvalues can produce higher photovoltaic efficiencies. It was also found that electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) reducedEgand∆Econsiderably compared to the unsubstituted DPP-H. Moreover, for every decrease (increase) in the values of a given optoelectronic property of DPP-X1systems, a more significant decrease (increase) in the same values was observed for the DPP-X2, thus showing that the addition of the second substituent results in a more extensive influence on all electronic properties. For the exciton binding energies, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm identified groups of substituents characterized by average values (centroids) of Hammett&#39;s constants that can drive the search for new DDP-derived materials. Our work presents a promising approach by applying HT on molecular engineering DPP-based molecules and other conjugated molecules for applications on organic optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Allostery plays a crucial role in regulating protein activity, making it a highly sought-after target in drug development. One of the major challenges in allosteric drug research is the identification of allosteric sites. In recent years, many computational models have been developed for accurate allosteric site prediction. Most of these models focus on designing a general rule that can be applied to pockets of proteins from various families. In this study, we present a new approach using the concept of Learning to Rank (LTR). The LTR model ranks pockets based on their relevance to allosteric sites, that is, how well a pocket meets the characteristics of known allosteric sites. After the training and validation on two datasets, the Allosteric Database (ASD) and CASBench, the LTR model was able to rank an allosteric pocket in the top three positions for 83.6\% and 80.5\% of test proteins, respectively. The model outperforms other common machine learning models with higher F1 scores (0.662 in ASD and 0.608 in CASBench) and Matthews correlation coefficients (0.645 in ASD and 0.589 in CASBench). The trained model is available on the PASSer platform (https://passer.smu.edu) to aid in drug discovery research.},

  abstract     = {Cyclopropane ring is a very common motif in organic/bio-organic compounds. The chemical bonding of this strained ring is taught to all chemistry students. This three-membered cyclic, C3ring is quite reactive which has attracted both, synthetic and theoretical chemists to rationalize/correlate its stability and bonding with its reactivity and physical properties over a century. There are a few bonding models (mainly the Bent–Bond model and Walsh model) of this C3ring that are debated to date. Herein, we have carried out energy decomposition analysis coupled with natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA-NOCV) to study the two most reactive bonds of cyclopropane rings of 49 different organic compounds containing different functional groups to obtain a much deeper bonding insight toward a more general bonding model of this class of compounds. The EDA-NOCV analyses of fragment orbitals and susequent bond formation revealed that the nature of the CC bond of the cyclopropane (splitting two bonds at a time out of three CC bonds) ring is preferred to form two dative covalent CC bonds (between a singlet olefin-fragment and an excited singlet carbene-fragment with a vacant sp2orbital and a filled p-orbital) for the majority (37/49) of compounds over two covalent electron sharing bonds in some (7/49) compounds (between an excited triplet olefin and triplet carbene), while a few (5/49) compounds show flexibility to adopt either the electron sharing or dative covalent bond as both are equally possible. The effects of functional groups on the nature of chemical bond in cyclopropane rings have been studied in detail. Our bonding analyses are in line with the QTAIM analyses which produce small negative values of the Laplacian, significantly positive values of bond ellipticity, and accumulation of electron densities around the ring critical point of C3-rings. These corresponding QTAIM parameters of C3-rings are quite different for CC single bonds of normal hydrocarbons as expected. The chemical bonding in the majority of cyclopropane rings can be very similar to those of metal–olefin systems.},

  abstract     = {Collective variable (CV)-based enhanced sampling techniques are widely used today for accelerating barrier-crossing events in molecular simulations. A class of these methods, which includes temperature accelerated molecular dynamics (TAMD)/driven-adiabatic free energy dynamics (d-AFED), unified free energy dynamics (UFED), and temperature accelerated sliced sampling (TASS), uses an extended variable formalism to achieve quick exploration of conformational space. These techniques are powerful, as they enhance the sampling of a large number of CVs simultaneously compared to other techniques. Extended variables are kept at a much higher temperature than the physical temperature by ensuring adiabatic separation between the extended and physical subsystems and employing rigorous thermostatting. In this work, we present a computational platform to perform extended phase space enhanced sampling simulations using the open-source molecular dynamics engine OpenMM. The implementation allows users to have interoperability of sampling techniques, as well as employ state-of-the-art thermostats and multiple time-stepping. This work also presents protocols for determining the critical parameters and procedures for reconstructing high-dimensional free energy surfaces. As a demonstration, we present simulation results on the high dimensional conformational landscapes of the alanine tripeptide in vacuo, tetra-N-methylglycine (tetra-sarcosine) peptoid in implicit solvent, and the Trp-cage mini protein in explicit water.},

A thorough benchmark showed that this model, in conjunction with cost-effective revDSD-PBEP86-D3(BJ) reference geometries, offers an optimal compromise between accuracy and computational cost. If improved geometries are sought, the most effective option is to add MP2-F12 core-valence correlation corrections to CCSD(T)-F12b/jun-cc-pVTZ geometries without the need of performing any extrapolation to the complete basis set limit. In the same vein, CCSD(T)-F12b/jun-cc-pVTZ harmonic frequencies are remarkably accurate without any additional contribution.

  abstract     = {As emphasized in a recent review article (Chem. Rev.2022, 122, 14180), organic solar cell (OSC) photoconversion efficiency has been rapidly evolving with results increasingly comparable to those of traditional inorganic solar cells. Historically, OSC performance improvement focused first on the morphology of P3HT:PC61BM solar cells then went through different stages to shift lately interest towards nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) as a replacement ofPC61BM acceptor (ACC) molecule. Here, we use density-functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT to investigate four novel NFAs of A-D-A (acceptor-donor-acceptor) form derived from the recently synthesized IDIC-4Cl (Dyes Pigm.2019, 166, 196). Our level of theory is carefully evaluated for IDIC-4Cl and then applied to the four novel NFAs in order to understand how chemical modifications lead to physical changes in cyclic voltammetry (CV) frontier molecular orbital energies and absorption spectra in solution. Finally we design and apply a new type of Scharber plot for NFAs based upon some simple but we think reasonable assumptions. Unlike the original Scharber plots where a larger DON band gap favors a larger PCE, our modified Scharber plot reflects the fact that a smaller ACC band gap may favor PCE by filling in gaps in the DON acceptor spectrum. We predict that only the candidate molecule with theleastgood acceptor A, with thehighestfrontier molecular orbital energies, andone of the largerCV lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)−highest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO) gaps, will yield a PM6:ACC PCE exceeding that of the parent IDIC-4Cl ACC. This candidate also shows the largest oscillator strength for the primary1(HOMO, LUMO) charge- transfer transition and the largest degree of delocalization of charge transfer of any of the ACC molecules investigated here.},

  abstract     = {The semiempirical GFNn-xTB (n=1,2) tight-binding methods are extended with a spin-dependent energy term (spin-polarization), enabling the fast and efficient screening of different spin states for transition metal complexes. While GFNn-xTB methods inherently can not differentiate properly between high-spin (HS) and low-spin (LS) states, this shortcoming is corrected with the presented methods termed spGFNn-xTB. The performance of spGFNn-xTB methods for spin state energy splittings is evaluated on a newly compiled benchmark set of 90 complexes (27 HS and 63 LS complexes) containing 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals (termed TM90S) employing DFT references at the TPSSh-D4/def2-QZVPP level of theory. The challenging TM90S set contains complexes with charges between−4 and +3, spin multiplicities between 1 and 6, and spin-splitting energies that range from−47.8 to 146.6 kcal/mol with a mean average of 32.2 kcal/mol. On this set the (sp)GFNn-xTB methods, the PM6-D3H4 method, and the PM7 method are evaluated with spGFN1-xTB yielding the lowest MAD of 19.6 kcal/mol followed by spGFN2-xTB with 24.8 kcal/mol. While for the 4d and 5d subsets small or no improvements are observed with spin-polarization, large improvements are obtained for the 3d subset with spGFN1-xTB yielding the smallest MAD of 14.2 kcal/mol followed by spGFN2-xTB with 17.9 kcal/mol and PM6-D3H4 with 28.4 kcal/mol. The correct sign of the spin state splittings is obtained with spGFN2-xTB in 89\% of all cases closely followed by spGFN1-xTB with 88\%. On the full set, a pure semiempirical vertical spGFN2-xTB//GFN2-xTB-based workflow for screening purposes yields a slightly better MAD of 22.2 kcal/mol due to error compensation, while being qualitative correct for one additional case. In combination with their low computational cost (scanning spin states in seconds), the spGFNn-xTB methods represent robust tools for pre-screening steps of spin state calculations and high-throughput workflows.},

The symmetry-decomposed VDD charge analysis augments the symmetry-decomposed energy decomposition analysis (EDA) so that the charge flow associated with Pauli repulsion and orbital interactions can be quantified both per atom and per irrep, for example, for σ, π, and δ electrons.

Chemical building block libraries are the fundamental component of virtually any FBDD campaign. Current trends focus on smaller and smarter libraries that offer synthetically amenable starting points for rational lead generation. Therefore, there remains an ever-increasing need for new methods to generate fragment libraries to seed early-stage drug discovery programs.

This study explores the inhibition mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by ebselen, an organoselenium drug that shows potent inhibitory activity. By using a combination of multiple computational methods including molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and density functional theory calculations, the complete covalent inhibition process of ebselen is simulated for the first time. Two possible pathways with different bound conformations of ebselen are identified. The hydrolysis of the enzyme-ebselen adduct is found to be the rate-determining step. The simulation results show that the behavior of water molecules at the hydrolysis site is crucial to distinguish the two paths energetically. Our simulations, which are in agreement with existing experimental results, provide a theoretical basis for the rational design and mechanism exploration of ebselen-based inhibitors.},

In this mechanism, the bridged hydroperoxo is reduced by hydroperoxo ligand rather than by Fe(III). On the one hand, the NTAFe(III)OOH is sluggish to undergo hydrogen abstraction; on the other hand, it is a good nucleophile that may perform aldehyde deformylation. The present calculations suggest that both ˙OH and Fe(IV)O are generated in the NTA-assisted Fenton system. However, the polycarboxylate ligand provides a favorable environment for H2O2to accumulate around iron ion through hydrogen bonding.

  abstract     = {The chain-of-states (CoS) constant advance replicas (CAR) method and its climbing image variant (CI-CAR) for locating minimum energy paths (MEPs) and transition states are reported. The CAR algorithm applies the Lagrange multiplier method for imposing holonomic constraints on a chain-of-replicas, aiming to maintain equal mass-weighted/scaled root-mean-square (RMS) distances between the adjacent replicas by removing the sliding-down displacements contributed by the potential gradients during path optimization. Two contextual regularization schemes with clear geometrical interpretations are implemented to jointly promote high convergence and numerical robustness of the CAR algorithm. We show that the constrained reaction path can be solved normally within 5 steps of Lagrange multiplier updates with remarkably high numerical precision via the CAR approach. The efficacy of the CAR methods is demonstrated by testing on multiple analytical, classical, and quantum mechanical transition paths: the Müller potential, the alanine dipeptide isomerization, the helix unwinding of the VIVITLVMLKKK 12-mer peptide, and the Baker set of reactions. We also explore the potential of applying adaptive momentum (AdaM) optimizers for locating optimal transition paths under complex conformational changes. Most importantly, we discuss extensively the differences and connections between our newly proposed CAR methods and several related methods, with focuses on the reaction path with holonomic constraints (RPCons) approach of Brokaw et al. [J. Chem. Theory Comput.2009,5(8), 2050–2061] and the state-of-the-art string method (SM) of E et al. [J. Chem.

NMR calculations were run at the ZORA relativistic level, with and without spin-orbit coupling using few selected GGA and hybrid functionals, namely BP86, PBE, B3LYP, and PBE0. We also tested solvent effects both at the optimization level and at the NMR calculation step. At the ZORA-SO-PBE0 (COSMO) level of theory we find a very good performance of the computational protocol that allows to discard or retain possible structures/conformations based on the agreement between the calculated chemical shift and the experimental value.},

  abstract     = {The numerical ill-conditioning associated with approximating an electron density with a convex sum of Gaussian or Slater-type functions is overcome by using the (extended) Kullback–Leibler divergence to measure the deviation between the target and approximate density. The optimized densities are non-negative and normalized, and they are accurate enough to be used in applications related to molecular similarity, the topology of the electron density, and numerical molecular integration. This robust, efficient, and general approach can be used to fit any non-negative normalized functions (e.g., the kinetic energy density and molecular electron density) to a convex sum of non-negative basis functions. We present a fixed-point iteration method for optimizing the Kullback–Leibler divergence and compare it to conventional gradient-based optimization methods. These algorithms are released through the free and open-source BFit package, which also includes a L2-norm squared optimization routine applicable to any square-integrable scalar function.},

We found that the adsorption ofH2Ois dominated by about 65\% of electrostatics, which causes a low surface sensitivity and weak interactions. On the contrary, the adsorptions of HF and HCl are driven by strong hydrogen bonds resulting in a highly surface-dependent ratio of 30–60\% electrostatic versus orbital contribution. Among the stoichiometric surfaces, the shortest and strongest hydrogen bonds and consequently most covalent bonding patterns are found withinYF3·HCl. However, when including the preparation energy, each surface favors the adsorption of HF over HCl, which reproduces the higher affinity of yttrium towards fluoride over chloride, previously known for solutions, also for the solid state.},

Thermodynamic analysis is often performed by sampling many atomistic conformations using molecular simulations that employ either explicit or implicit water models. However, it remains unclear to what extent thermodynamic results from different solvation models are reliable at the molecular level. In this study, we quantify the influence of both solvation models on folding stability at the individual backbone and side chain resolutions. We assess the residue-specific folding free energy components of aβ-sheet protein and a helical protein using trajectories resulting from TIP3P explicit and generalized Born/surface area implicit solvent simulations of model proteins. We found that the thermodynamic discrepancy due to the implicit solvent mostly originates from charged side chains, followed by the under-stabilized hydrophobic ones. In contrast, the contributions of backbone residue in both proteins were comparable for explicit and implicit water models. Our study lays out the foundation for detailed thermodynamic assessment of solvation models in the context of protein simulation.},

Part of the validation process for this methodology was done withCunAum(n+m≤XforX=14,19,38,55) andAunAgn(n=10,20,30,40,50,60,70, and 75).

A search has been done for the lowest energies ofLinnanoclusters with 2–8 atoms using the DFT approach and forLi3,Li4,Li2H,Li3Husing DLPNO-CCSD(T) approach. NQGA successfully performed the MP2 optimizations for(H2O)11cluster. In all cases, the proposed genetic algorithm located the previously reported global minima with very efficient performance. The new proposed methodology makes it possible to optimize cluster geometries directly using high-level ab initio methods relinquishing any bias introduced by a classical approach. Our results show that this proposed method has great potential applications due to its flexibility and efficiency in identifying global minima in the tested atomic systems.},

Different error sources, like errors in the ground-statepKavalues, the excitation energies in solution for the neutral and (de-)protonated species, basis set effects, and contributions beyond implicit solvation are investigated and their contributions to the total error inpKa∗are discussed. Density functional theory in combination with the conductor like screening model for real solvents and an empirical linear Gibbs free energy relationship are used to predict the ground-statepKavalues. For the test set, this approach gives more accuratepKavalues for the acids than for the bases. Time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) and second-order wave function methods in combination with the conductor like screening model are applied to compute excitation energies in water. Some TD-DFT functionals fail for several species to predict correctly the order of the lowest excitations. Where experimental data for absorption maxima in water is available, the implicit solvation model leads with the applied electronic structure methods in most cases for the excitation energies in water to an overestimation for the protonated and to an underestimation for the deprotonated species. The magnitude and sign of the errors depend on the hydrogen bond donating and accepting ability of the solute. We find that for aqueous solution this results generally in an underestimation in thepKachanges from the ground to the excited state for photoacids and an overestimation for photobases.},

  abstract     = {We performed a theoretical analysis of the BIPS photochemical cycle using an extensive set of forty hybrid functionals and taking into account a highly polar solvent (methanol). The functionals with a small fraction of the exact Hartree-Fock exchange (\%HF) showed the predominant S0→ S2transition with the strengthening of the CspiroO bond. At the same time, functionals with medium and high\%HF (including those with long-range correction) gave a dominant S0→ S1transition with weakening or breaking of the CspiroO bond, which corresponds to the experimental results. The influence of a highly polar solvent on the photochemical electrocyclic transformations of BIPS turned out to be significant. The number of functionals causing dissociation of the CspiroO bond decreased from 10 to 7 compared to the gas phase. The magnitude of the oscillator strength has increased by approximately one and a half times. Structural distortions of the BIPS molecule during excitation (both with and without CspiroO bond cleavage) significantly decreased in methanol compared to the gas phase. The two strong hydrogen bonds of methanol molecules with the oxygen and nitrogen atoms of spiropyran also have a significant effect on its excitation. They lead to a change in the predominant transition from S0→ S2to S0→ S1for five functionals. The number of functionals giving dissociation of the CspiroO bond decreased from seven to four (M08HX, M052X, CAM-B3LYP, and M11). After the opening of the excited BIPS molecule, both of its strong H-bonds with methanol are preserved. Of this set of four functionals, only M052X and CAM-B3LYP exhibited the dominant HOMO-1 → LUMO configuration observed in high-level computations by other authors. Therefore, both of these functionals are recommended for modeling the photochemical cycle of this spiropyran. The photochemical cycle of BIPS was theoretically analyzed. The redistribution of the electron density in this cycle was quantitatively described using the differences in NPA of the atomic charges. The most important result of this analysis was the electrostatic mechanism of the approach of Cspiroand oxygen atoms at the fourth stage, which causes further reduction of the CspiroO bond.},

Peroxide radicals could abstract a hydrogen atom from methyl group onR1, forming unwanted by-products. It should be noted that the hydrogen atoms of HOO˙ is easy to be abstracted by CC double bond and simultaneously the oxygen atom is connected to the CH moiety to form an alkyl peroxy radical (Rad11), greatly limiting the selectivity.

  abstract     = {The presence of carboxyl groups in a molecule delivers an affinity to metal cations and a sensitivity to the chemical environment, especially for an environment that can give rise to intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Carboxylate groups can also induce intramolecular interactions, such as the formation of hydrogen bonds with donor groups, leading to an impact on the conformational space of biomolecules. In the latter case, the protonation state of the amino groups plays an important role. In order to provide an accurate description of the modifications induced in a carboxylated molecule by the formation of hydrogen bonds, one needs a compromise between a quantum chemical description of the system and the necessity to take into account explicit solvent molecules. In this work, we propose a bottom-up approach to study the conformational space and the carboxylate stretching band of (bio)organic anions. Starting from the anions in a continuum solvent, we then move to calculations using a microsolvation approach including one explicit water molecule per polar group, immersed in a continuum. Finally, we run QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the solvation properties and to explore the anions conformational space. The results thus obtained are in good agreement with the description given by the microsolvation approach and they bring a more detailed description of the solvation shell and of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds.},

Here we present results from three examples: the NFK potential, the RPs of the Witting reaction, and finding saddle points for a set of five chemical reaction benchmarks. The results showed that the NESB method has three advantages: to decrease the number of iterations, shrink the length of the pathways from reducing unnecessary fluctuations, and find TS structures by converging to paths close to the MEPs for systems that have sharp curves on the MEPs.},

  abstract     = {The knowledge of individual hydrogen bond (HB) strength in molecular clusters is indispensable to get insights into the bulk properties of condensed systems. Recently, we have developed the molecular tailoring approach based (MTA-based) method for the estimation of individual HB energy in molecular clusters. However, the direct use of this MTA-based method to large molecular clusters becomes progressively difficult with the increase in the size of a cluster. To overcome this caveat, herein, we propose the use of linear scaling method (such as the original MTA method) for the estimation of single-point (SP) energies of large-sized parent molecular cluster and their respective fragments. Because the fragments of the MTA-based method, for the estimation of HB energy, are further fragmented, this proposed strategy is called asFragments-in-Fragments (Frags-in-Frags) method. The SP energies of fragments and parent cluster calculated by theFrags-in-Fragsapproach were utilized to estimate the individual HB energy. The estimated individual HB energies, in various molecular clusters, byFrags-in-Fragsmethod are found to be in excellent linear agreement with their MTA-based counterparts (R2= 0.9975 of 348 data points). The difference being less than 0.5 kcal/mol in most of the cases. Furthermore, RMSD is 0.43 kcal/mol, MAE is 0.33 kcal/mol, and the standard deviation is 0.44 kcal/mol. Importantly, theFrags-in-Fragsmethod not only enables the reliable estimation of HB energy in large molecular clusters but also requires less computational time and can be possible even with off-the-shelf hardware.},

  abstract     = {FSATOOL is an integrated molecular simulation and data analysis program. Its old molecular dynamics engine only supports simulations in vacuum or implicit solvent. In this work, we implement the well-known smooth particle mesh Ewald method for simulations in explicit solvent. The new developed engine is runnable on both CPU and GPU. All the existed analysis modules in the program are compatible with the new engine. Moreover, we also build a complete deep learning module in FSATOOL. Based on the module, we further implement two useful trajectory analysis methods: state-free reversible VAMPnets and time-lagged autoencoder. They are good at searching the collective variables related to the conformational transitions of biomolecules. In FSATOOL, these collective variables can be further used to construct a bias potential for the enhanced sampling purpose. We introduce the implementation details of the methods and present their actual performances in FSATOOL by a few enhanced sampling simulations.},

  abstract     = {Discovery of target-binding molecules, such as aptamers and peptides, is usually performed with the use of high-throughput experimental screening methods. These methods typically generate large datasets of sequences of target-binding molecules, which can be enriched with high affinity binders. However, the identification of the highest affinity binders from these large datasets often requires additional low-throughput experiments or other approaches. Bioinformatics-based analyses could be helpful to better understand these large datasets and identify the parts of the sequence space enriched with high affinity binders.BinderSpaceis an open-source Python package that performs motif analysis, sequence space visualization, clustering analyses, and sequence extraction from clusters of interest. The motif analysis, resulting in text-based and visual output of motifs, can also provide heat maps of previously measured user-defined functional properties for all the motif-containing molecules. Users can also run principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analyses on whole datasets and on motif-related subsets of the data. Functionally important sequences can also be highlighted in the resulting PCA and t-SNE maps. If points (sequences) in two-dimensional maps in PCA or t-SNE space form clusters, users can perform clustering analyses on their data, and extract sequences from clusters of interest. We demonstrate the use ofBinderSpaceon a dataset of oligonucleotides binding to single-wall carbon nanotubes in the presence and absence of a bioanalyte, and on a dataset of cyclic peptidomimetics binding to bovine carbonic anhydrase protein.BinderSpaceis openly accessible to the public via the GitHub website:https://github.com/vukoviclab/BinderSpace.},

The triacylglycerides used in this study are both saturated and unsaturated, as well as symmetrical and asymmetrical, to test the robustness of both the force field and the direct heating methodology described in this paper. Given the nonequilibrium nature of a melting system, a larger number of simulations are required to ensure that the results are sufficiently converged, that is, with little fluctuation and a small confidence interval. The study also highlights the importance of the presence of defects, in this case as voids, to lower the melting nucleation energy barrier of the crystals and avoid superheating of the systems being tested. The size of these defects is much larger than what would be found in a physical crystal, however, the simple and robust procedure that was developed allows the accurate prediction of melting points of the different triacylglycerides.},

Present investigation aims to probe the structure, stability, and properties of coinage metal (M)@C18complexes using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The DFT results unequivocally show that even Cu@C18, Ag@C18, and Au@C18complexes substantially preserve the ground state polyynic structure of C18. It is also worth to mention that only Au@C18is a stable D9hstructure, however the symmetry is distorted in the case of Cu@C18and Ag@C18. Due to computational limitations, in this investigation the M@C18complexes were scrutinized using the C2vsub abelian group of D9h. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of D9hconformers are a singleta1and two same value singletsa1⊕b1generated from doublete, respectively. The non-covalent interaction index (NCI), quantum theory of atoms in molecule (QTAIM), and energy decomposition analysis (EDA) vividly explains the interaction between a coinage metal atom and C18ring.

It was applied to the ethene molecule to consider its effect on the electron dynamics, both during the application of the laser pulse and for up to 100 fs after the pulse was switched off. Four laser pulse frequenciesω= 0.2692, 0.2808, 0.2830, and 0.2900 a.u. were chosen to correspond to excitation energies mid-way between the (S1,S2), (S2,S3), (S3,S4) and (S4,S5) electronic states, respectively. Scalar quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) was used to quantify the shifts of the C1C2 bond critical points (BCPs). Depending on the frequenciesωselected, the C1C2 BCP shifts were up to 5.8 times higher after the pulse was switched off compared with a staticE-field with the same magnitude. Next generation QTAIM (NG-QTAIM) was used to visualize and quantify the directional chemical character. In particular, polarization effects and bond strengths, in the form of bond-rigidity vs. bond-flexibility, were found, for some laser pulse frequencies, to increase after the laser pulse was switched off. Our analysis demonstrates that NG-QTAIM, in partnership with ultrafast laser irradiation, is useful as a tool in the emerging field of ultrafast electron dynamics, which will be essential for the design, and control of molecular electronic devices.},

Unlike the replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) method, solvent temperatures are the same in all replicas, while solute temperatures are different and are exchanged frequently between replicas for exploring various solute structures. Here, we apply the gREST scheme to large biological systems containing over one million atoms using a large number of processors in a supercomputer. First, communication time on a multi-dimensional torus network is reduced by matching each replica to MPI processors optimally. This is applicable not only to gREST but also to other multi-copy algorithms. Second, energy evaluations, which are necessary for the multistate bennet acceptance ratio (MBAR) method for free energy estimations, are performed on-the-fly during the gREST simulations. Using these two advanced schemes, we observed 57.72 ns/day performance in 128-replica gREST calculations with 1.5 million atoms system using 16,384 nodes in Fugaku. These schemes implemented in the latest version of GENESIS software could open new possibilities to answer unresolved questions on large biomolecular complex systems with slow conformational dynamics.},

  abstract     = {The Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) ensemble defined by the excess chemical potential,μex, volume, and temperature, in the context of molecular simulations allows for variations in the number of particles in the system. In practice, GCMC simulations have been widely applied for the sampling of rare gasses and water, but limited in the context of larger molecules. To overcome this limitation, the oscillatingμexGCMC method was introduced and shown to be of utility for sampling small solutes, such as formamide, propane, and benzene, as well as for ionic species such as monocations, acetate, and methylammonium. However, the acceptance of GCMC insertions is low, and the method is computationally demanding. In the present study, we improved the sampling efficiency of the GCMC method using known cavity-bias and configurational-bias algorithms in the context of GPU architecture. Specifically, for GCMC simulations of aqueous solution systems, the configurational-bias algorithm was extended by applying system partitioning in conjunction with a random interval extraction algorithm, thereby improving the efficiency in a highly parallel computing environment. The method is parallelized on the GPU using CUDA and OpenCL, allowing for the code to run on both Nvidia and AMD GPUs, respectively. Notably, the method is particularly well suited for GPU computing as the large number of threads allows for simultaneous sampling of a large number of configurations during insertion attempts without additional computational overhead. In addition, the partitioning scheme allows for simultaneous insertion attempts for large systems, offering considerable efficiency. Calculations on the BK Channel, a transporter, including a lipid bilayer with over 760,000 atoms, show a speed up of ~53-fold through the use of system partitioning. The improved algorithm is then combined with an enhancedμexoscillation protocol and shown to be of utility in the context of the site-identification by ligand competitive saturation (SILCS) co-solvent sampling approach as illustrated through application to the protein CDK2.},

Examples range from the use of radicals as spin qubits in quantum information processing to the radical pair reactions in proteins that may allow migratory birds to sense the direction of the Earth&#39;s magnetic field. Accurate modeling of spin relaxation, however, is non-trivial. Bloch–Redfield–Wangsness theory derives a quantum mechanical master equation from system-bath interactions in the Markovian limit that provides a comprehensive framework for describing spin relaxation. Unfortunately, the construction of the master equation is system-specific and often resource-heavy.

  abstract     = {In this study, structural, electronic, optical, thermoelectric, and thermodynamics properties of vacancy-ordered double perovskites Rb2XCl6(X = Se, Ti) were explored theoretically. The results revealed that Rb2SeCl6 and Rb2TiCl6are indirect band gap (Eg) semiconductors withEgvalues of 2.95 eV, and 2.84 eV respectively. The calculated properties (phonons, elastic constant, Poisson&#39;s ratio, and Pugh&#39;s ratio) revealed that both materials are dynamically and chemically stable and can exhibit brittle (Rb2SeCl6)and ductile (Rb2TiCl6) nature. From the analysis of optical parameters, it was noticed that the refractive index of the materials has a value of 1.5–2.0 where light absorption was found from the visible to the ultraviolet region. The thermoelectric properties determined by using the BoltzTrap code demonstrated that at room temperature, the Figure of merit (ZT) was found to be 0.74 and 0.76 for Rb2SeCl6and Rb2TiCl6, respectively. Despite a moderate value of ZT in such materials, further studies might explore effective methods for tuning the electronic band gap and improving the thermoelectric response of the material for practical energy production applications.},

  abstract     = {Stabilizing the exotic chemical species possessing multiple bonds is often extremely challenging due to insufficient orbital overlap, especially involving one heavier element. Bulky aryl groups and/or carbene as ligand have previously stabilized the SiSi, GeGe, and BB triple bonds. Herein, theoretical calculations have been carried out to shed light on the stability and bonding of elusive silaboryne/germaboryne (Si/GeB triple bond) stabilized by donor base ligands ((cAAC)BE(Me)(L); E = Si, L = cAACMe, NHCMe, PMe3; E = Ge, L = cAACMe). The heavier analogues (Sn, Pb) have been further studied for comparison. Additionally, the effects of bulky substituents at the Si and N atoms on the structural parameters and stability of those species have been investigated. Energy decomposition analysis coupled with natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA-NOCV; for Si) showed that cAAC/NHC ligands could stabilize the exotic BSi-Me species more efficiently than PMe3ligands. The BSi partial triple bond of the corresponding species possesses a mixture of one covalent electron sharing BSi σ-bond and two dative π-bonds (B ← Si, B → Si).},

Low-energy structures for these clusters were fully searched through a self-developed genetic algorithm code combined with DFT calculations. The calculations show that all the two Cr atoms prefer to stay together to form a strong CrCr bond, which—except for size 20—is shorter than the nearest neighbor distance in Cr bulk. Sizes 15 and 16 adopt a wheel-like structure as the structural motif with the extra Ge atoms capped on the top, while larger sizes (n= 17–20) prefer fullerene-like Cr2@Ge12motifs. From the results of the average binding energies of Cr2Gen−, one can conclude that it is easier to form larger size clusters. In these lowest-lying isomers except for size 16, the two Cr atoms contribute opposite magnetic moments for the total magnetic moments of 1 μB, showing an antiferromagnetic state.},

The molecular orbital and EDA-NOCV analysis suggest dative quadruple bonds between the transition metal and beryllium, viz., one Be→Mσbond, one Be←Mσbond, and two Be←M π bonds. The strength of these bonding interactions varies based on the ligands coordinated to the transition metal. The Be←Mσbond is stronger than the Be→Mσbond when the ligand is PMe3,whereas the reverse order is observed when the ligand is CO. This is attributed to the higher π acceptor strength of CO as compared to PMe3. Since these complexes have M–Be dative quadruple bonds, the beryllium center is susceptible to ambiphilic reactivity, as indicated by high proton and hydride affinity values.},

Thus, the researchers around the globe are finding ways to decrease the amount of CO2in the atmosphere. Converting CO2into valuable chemicals like formic acid is one of the best ways to address this issue, but the stability of the CO2molecule poses a great challenge in its conversion. To date various metal-based and organic catalysts are available for the reduction of CO2. Still there is a great need for better, robust and economic catalytic systems and the advent of functionalized nanoreactors based on metal organic frame works (MOF) have opened a new dimension in this field. Thus, in the present work UiO-66 MOF functionalized with alanine boronic acid (AB) have been theoretically investigated for the reaction of CO2with H2. The density functional theory (DFT) based calculations were carried out to probe the reaction pathway. The result shows that the proposed nanoreactors can efficiently catalyze the CO2hydrogenation. Further, the periodic energy decomposition analysis (pEDA) unveils important insights about the catalytic action of the nanoreactor.},

KTT-1 is hard to be released from the HDAC2/KTT-1 complex, compared to the HDAC1/KTT-1 complex and the residence time of KTT-1 in HDAC2 is longer than that in HDAC1. To explore the physical origin of this kinetic selectivity, we performed replica-exchange umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations for formation of both complexes. The calculated potentials of mean force suggest that KTT-1 is stably bound to HDAC2 and that it is easily disassociated from HDAC1. In the direct vicinity of the KTT-1 binding site in both enzymes, there exists a conserved loop consisting of four consecutive glycine residues (Gly304-307 for HDAC2; Gly299-302 for HDA1). The difference between the two enzymes comes from a single un-conserved residue behind this loop, namely, Ala268 in HDAC2 and Ser263 in HDAC1. The Ala268 contributes to the tight binding of KTT-1 to HDAC2 by the linear orientation of Ala268, Gly306, and one carbon atom in KTT-1. On the other hand, Ser263 cannot stabilize the binding of KTT-1 to HDAC1, because it is relatively further away from the glycine loop and because the directions of the two forces are not in line.},

We adopted the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree methodology to solve the nuclear molecular Hamiltonian, and to address issues on the T-R couplings. Motivated by experimental X-ray observations on the CO2orientation in the D and T sI cages, we aim to evaluate the effect of the CO2–water interaction on quantum dynamics. Thus, we first compared semiempirical and ab initio-based pair interaction model potentials against first-principles DFT-D calculations for ascertaining the importance of nonadditive many-body effects on such guest–host interactions. Our results reveal that the rotational and translational excited states quantum dynamics is remarkably different, with the pattern and density of states clearly affected by the underlying potential model. By analyzing the corresponding the probability density distributions of the calculated T-R eigenstates on both semiempirical and ab initio pair CO2–water nanocage potentials, we have extracted information on the altered CO2guest local structure, and we discussed it in connection with experimental data on the orientation of the CO2molecule in the D and T sI clathrate cages available from neutron diffraction and13Csolid-state NMR studies, as well as in comparison with previous molecular dynamics simulations. Our calculations provide a very sensitive test of the potential quality by predicting the low-lying T-R states and corresponding transitions for the encapsulated CO2molecule. As such spectroscopic observables have not been measured so far, our results could trigger further detailed experimental and theoretical investigations leading to a quantitative description of the present guest–host interactions.},

  abstract     = {The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 exists in two major conformational states, namely the ‘open’ and ‘closed’ states which are also known as the ‘up’ and ‘down’ states, respectively. In its open state, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the protein is exposed for binding with ACE2, whereas the spike RBD is inaccessible to ACE2 in the closed state of the protein. In the current work, we have performed all-atom microsecond simulations of the full-length trimeric spike protein solvated in explicit aqueous medium with an average system size of ~0.7 million atoms to understand the molecular nature of intra- and inter-chain interactions, water-bridged interactions between different residues that contribute to the stability of the open and closed states of the protein, and also the free energy landscape for transition between the open and closed states of the protein. We have also examined the changes of such interactions that are associated with switching from one state to the other through both unbiased and biased simulations at all-atom level with total run length of 4 μs. Interestingly, after about 0.8 μs of unbiased molecular dynamics run of the spike system in the open state, we observed a gradual transition of the monomeric chain (B) from open to its partially closed or down state. Initially the residues at the interface of chain B RBD in the open state spike protein were at non-hydrogen-bonding distances from the residues of chain C RBD. However, the two RBDs gradually came closer and finally the residue S459 of the RBD of chain B made a hydrogen bond with F374 of chain C in the last 200 ns of the simulation along with formation of a few more hydrogen bonds involving other residues. Since no transition from closed to the open state of the protein is observed in the present 1 μs unbiased simulation of the closed state protein, the current study seems to suggest that the closed conformational state is preferred for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in aqueous medium. Furthermore, calculations of the free energy surface of the conformational transition from open (up) to the closed (down) state using a biased simulation method reveal a free energy barrier of ~3.20 kcal/mol for the transition of RBD from open to the closed state, whereas the barrier for the reverse process is found to be significantly higher.},

Here, we predicted the HB strength (Eint) of OCNH motif with H2O for commonly observed 37 rings in drugs with DFT method M06L/6-311++G(d,p). The HB strength is rationalized in terms of molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) topology parameters ΔVn(NH)and ΔVn(CO)which describe the relative electron deficient/rich nature ofNH andCO, respectively, with respect to the reference formamide. TheEintof formamide is −10.0 kcal/mol whereas theEintof ring systems is in the range −8.6 to −12.7 kcal/mol—a minor increase/decrease compared to the formamide. The variations inEintare addressed using the MESP parameters ΔVn(NH)and ΔVn(CO)and proposed the hypothesis that a positive ΔVn(NH)enhances NH…Owinteraction while a negative ΔVn(CO)enhances the CO…Hwinteraction. The hypothesis is proved by expressingEintjointly as ΔVn(NH)and ΔVn(CO)and also verified for twenty FDA approved drugs. The predictedEintfor the drugs using ΔVn(NH)and ΔVn(CO)agreed well with the calculatedEint. The study confirms that even delicate variations in the electronic feature of a molecule can be quantified in terms of MESP parameters and they provide a priori prediction of the HB strength. The MESP topology analysis is recommended to understand the tunability of HB strength in drug motifs.},

  abstract     = {Integral equation theory (IET) provides an effective solvation model for chemical and biological systems that balances computational efficiency and accuracy. We present a new software package, the expanded package for IET-based solvation (EPISOL), that performs 3D-reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) calculations to obtain the solvation structure and free energies of solute molecules in different solvents. In EPISOL, we have implemented 22 different closures, multiple free energy functionals, and new variations of 3D-RISM theory, including the recent hydrophobicity-induced density inhomogeneity (HI) theory for hydrophobic solutes and ion-dipole correction (IDC) theory for negatively charged solutes. To speed up the convergence and enhance the stability of the self-consistent iterations, we have introduced several numerical schemes in EPISOL, including a newly developed dynamic mixing approach. We show that these schemes have significantly reduced the failure rate of 3D-RISM calculations compared to AMBER-RISM software. EPISOL consists of both a user-friendly graphic interface and a kernel library that allows users to call its routines and adapt them to other programs. EPISOL is compatible with the force-field and coordinate files from both AMBER and GROMACS simulation packages. Moreover, EPISOL is equipped with an internal memory control to efficiently manage the use of physical memory, making it suitable for performing calculations on large biomolecules. We demonstrate that EPISOL can efficiently and accurately calculate solvation density distributions around various solute molecules (including a protein chaperone consisting of 120,715 atoms) and obtain solvent free energy for a wide range of organic compounds. We expect that EPISOL can be widely applied as a solvation model for chemical and biological systems. EPISOL is available athttps://github.com/EPISOLrelease/EPISOL.},

This study shows that methods relying on continuous translation of origin of the current densityIBrωtinduced by optical magnetic fields provide an effective solution to the problem of choices (i) and (ii), in that they yield origin independentIBwithin the algebraic approximation, for any basis set. Frequency-dependent magnetizabilities are also invariant with respect to (iii), as a consequence of symmetry, for a number of molecular point groups. In molecules of lower symmetries, computed magnetizabilities depend on origin of the multipole expansion. Large basis set computations carried out for water, ammonia, methane, ethane, ethylene, boranylborane, and hydroxilamine, at the DFT level, have been reported to document these statements. A comparison is made for results obtained within the conventional common origin approach for static magnetic field. Sum rules for invariance of computed properties are discussed.

Beyond the density analysis, we show that the scheme is quite suitable for the electron localization function and its complex topology. With this speed-up of the parallelized process used to generate 3d-grids, this new scheme is several orders of magnitude faster than the original grid-based method implemented in our laboratory (TopMod09). The efficiency of our implementation (TopChem2) was also compared with well-known grid-based algorithms designed to assign the grid points to basins.

The best model built by Random Forest (RF) and Morgan fingerprints achieved the G-mean value of 0.84 on the external test set. As an application of our classification model, virtual screening was performed against Drugbank molecules in order to identify the potential inhibitors based on the confidence score by RF model. Nine potential molecules were identified, which were further subject to molecular docking studies to evaluate the virtual screening results of the best RF model.

  abstract     = {The probe rheology simulation technique is a technique for measuring the viscosity of a fluid by measuring the motion of an inserted probe particle. This approach has the benefit of greater potential accuracy at a lower computational cost than other conventional simulation techniques used for the calculation of mechanical properties, such as the Green–Kubo approach and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, and the potential to allow for sampling local variations of properties. This approach is implemented and demonstrated for atomistically detailed models. The viscosity of four different simple Newtonian liquids is calculated from both the Brownian motion (passive mode) and the forced motion (active mode) of an embedded probe particle. The probe particle is loosely modeled as a nano-sized diamond particle: a rough sphere cut out of an FCC lattice made of carbon atoms. The viscosities obtained from the motion of the probe particle are compared with those obtained from the periodic perturbation method, and good agreement between the two sets of values is observed once the probe-fluid interaction strength (i.e.,εijin the pair-wise Lennard–Jones interaction) is two times higher than their original values, and the artificial hydrodynamic interactions between the probe particle and its periodic images are accounted for. The success of the proposed model opens new opportunities for applying such a technique in the rheological characterization of local mechanical properties in atomistically detailed molecular dynamics simulations, which can be directly compared with or help guide experiments of similar nature.},

The main motion of VLP units turned out to be the bending at the junction between the P1 subdomain (that sits in the VLP shell) and the P2 subdomain (that protrudes outside) of the major VP1 protein, this resulting in a correlated wagging motion of the P2 subdomains with respect to the VLP surface. The fluctuations of the P2 subdomain were found to be more pronounced and the P2 domain made a greater angle with the normal to the VLP surface for the GII.2 strain, which could explain the inability of this strain to bind the histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs).},

Substitution of the heterocyclic ring with electron withdrawing groups results in formation of extremely strong Lewis superacids. Two of them, namely AlC5Cl5and AlC5(CN)5are the strongest Lewis acids described in the literature so far. Whereas, anions formed after the addition of fluoride anion to substituted aluminabenzene-based Lewis acids, while characterized by somewhat lower electronic stability than the least coordinating anions hitherto known, are considerably more stable in terms of thermodynamic stability (measured by the propensity to electrophile attack). On this account they are expected to act as counterions for the most reactive cations. The proposed Lewis acids may be prone to the isomerization and dimerization, whereas studied anions are expected to be stable with regard to such processes.},

  abstract     = {A major difference between amyloid precursor protein (APP) isoforms (APP695 and APP751) is the existence of a Kunitz type protease inhibitor (KPI) domain which has a significant impact on the homo- and hetero-dimerization of APP isoforms. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of dimer formation remain elusive. To characterize the role of the KPI domain in APP dimerization, we performed a single molecule pull down (SiMPull) assay where homo-dimerization between tethered APP molecules and soluble APP molecules was highly preferred regardless of the type of APP isoforms, while hetero-dimerization between tethered APP751 molecules and soluble APP695 molecules was limited. We further investigated the domain level APP-APP interactions using coarse-grained models with the Martini force field. Though the model initial ternary complexes (KPI-E1, KPI-KPI, KPI-E2, E1-E1, E2-E2, and E1-E2) generated using HADDOCK (HD) and AlphaFold2 (AF2), the binding free energy profiles and the binding affinities of the domain combinations were investigated via the umbrella sampling with Martini force field. Additionally, membrane-bound microenvironments at the domain level were modeled. As a result, it was revealed that the KPI domain has a stronger attractive interaction with itself than the E1 and E2 domains, as reported elsewhere. Thus, the KPI domain of APP751 may form additional attractive interactions with E1, E2 and the KPI domain itself, whereas it is absent in APP695. In conclusion, we found that the APP751 homo-dimer formation is predominant than the homodimerization in APP695, which is facilitated by the presence of the KPI domain.},

  abstract     = {Recently, halogen bonding (XB) has received increased attention as a new type of non-covalent interaction widely present in nature. In this work, quantum chemical calculations at DFT level have been carried out to investigate halogen bonding interactions between COn(n= 1 or 2) and dihalogen molecules XY (X = F, Cl, Br, I and Y = Cl, Br, I). Highly accurate all-electron data, estimated by CCSD(T) calculations, were used to benchmark the different levels of computational methods with the objective of finding the best accuracy/computational cost. Molecular electrostatic potential, interaction energy values, charge transfer, UV spectra, and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis were determined to better understand the nature of the XB interaction. Density of states (DOS) and projected DOS were also computed. Hence, according to these results, the magnitude of the halogen bonding is affected by the halogen polarizability and electronegativity, where for the more polarizable and less electronegative halogen atoms, the σ-hole is bigger. Furthermore, for the halogen-bonded complexes involving CO and XY, the OC∙∙∙XY interaction is stronger than the CO∙∙∙XY interaction. Thus, the results presented here can establish fundamental characteristics of halogen bonding in media, which would be very helpful for applying this noncovalent interaction for the sustainable capture of carbon oxides.},

  abstract     = {In designing three-dimensional (3-D) molecular stars, it is very difficult to enhance the molecular rigidity through forming the covalent bonds between the axial and equatorial groups because corresponding axial groups will generally break the delocalized π bond over equatorial frameworks and thus break their star-like arrangement. In this work, exemplified by designing the 3-D stars Be2©Be5E5+(E = Au, Cl, Br, I) with three delocalized σ bonds and delocalized π bond over the central Be2©Be5moiety, we propose that the desired covalent bonding can be achieved by forming the delocalized σ bond(s) and delocalized π bond(s) simultaneously between the axial groups and equatorial framework. The covalency and rigidity of axial bonding can be demonstrated by the total Wiberg bond indices of 1.46–1.65 for axial Be atoms and ultrashort Be-Be distances of 1.834–1.841 Å, respectively. Beneficial also from the σ and π double aromaticity, these mono-cationic 3-D molecular stars are dynamically viable global energy minima with well-defined electronic structures, as reflected by wide HOMO-LUMO gaps (4.68–5.06 eV) and low electron affinities (4.70–4.82 eV), so they are the promising targets in the gas phase generation, mass-separation, and spectroscopic characterization.},

However, the impact of this replacement on electronic properties, especially gap energy and bulk Rashba splitting remains unclear since electrostatic interactions from organic cations can play a crucial role. Through first-principles calculations, we investigated how organic/inorganic cations impact the electronic properties ofMAPbI3andCsPbI3perovskites. Although at high temperatures the organic cation can assume spherical-like configurations due to its rotation into the cages, our results provide a complete electronic mechanism to show, from a chemical perspective based on ab initio calculations at0K, how theMAdipoles suppression can reduce theMAPbI3gap energy by promoting a degeneracy breaking in the electronic states from thePbI3framework, while the dipole moment reinforcement is crucial to align theory↔experiment, increasing the bulk Rashba splitting through higherPboff-centering motifs. The lack of permanent dipole moment inCsresults inCsPbI3polymorphs with a pronouncedPbon-centering-like feature, which causes suppression in their respective bulk Rashba effect.},

The single-reference methods produce mostly consistent results up to about 5.5 eV. By contrast, the CAS second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2) results depend sensitively on the employed parameters. At the CAS self-consistent field level, the energies of the brightππ*states are strongly overestimated while doubly excited states appear too low and mix with theseππ*states. This mixing hampers the CASPT2 step, leading to inconsistent results. Only by increasing the number of states in the state-averaging step to about 40—to cover all brightππ*states embedded in the double excitations—and employing extended multistate CASPT2 could CASPT2 results consistent with experiment be obtained. We assign the four bands in the molecule&#39;s spectrum: The weakest band at 3.7 eV arises from thenNO2π*states, the second one at 4.4 eV from theππ*(Lb) state, the shoulder at 5.2 eV from theππ*(La) state, and the maximum at 5.7 eV from theππ*(Ba/Bb) states.

Various proteins involve prosthetic groups such as heme for their functions, and adequate consideration of the prosthetic groups is vital for protein–ligand docking. Here, we extend the GalaxyDock2 protein–ligand docking algorithm to handle ligand docking to heme proteins. Docking to heme proteins involves increased complexity because the interaction of heme iron and ligand has covalent nature. GalaxyDock2-HEME, a new protein–ligand docking program for heme proteins, has been developed based on GalaxyDock2 by adding an orientation-dependent scoring term to describe heme iron-ligand coordination interaction. This new docking program performs better than other noncommercial docking programs such as EADock with MMBP, AutoDock Vina, PLANTS, LeDock, and GalaxyDock2 on a heme protein–ligand docking benchmark set in which ligands are known to bind iron. In addition, docking results on two other sets of heme protein–ligand complexes in which ligands do not bind iron show that GalaxyDock2-HEME does not have a high bias toward iron binding compared to other docking programs. This implies that the new docking program can distinguish iron binders from noniron binders for heme proteins.},

However, a very high percentage of cryo-EM structures correspond to resolutions of 3–5 Å, making the structures difficult to be used inin silicodrug design. In this study, we analyze how useful cryo-EM protein structures are forin silicodrug design by evaluating ligand docking accuracy. From realistic cross-docking scenarios using medium resolution (3–5 Å) cryo-EM structures and a popular docking tool Autodock-Vina, only 20\% of docking succeeded, when the success rate doubles in the same kind of cross-docking but using high-resolution (&lt;2 Å) crystal structures instead. We decipher the reason for failures by decomposing the contribution from resolution-dependent and independent factors. The heterogeneity in the protein side-chain and backbone conformations is identified as the major resolution-dependent factor causing docking difficulty from our analysis, while intrinsic receptor flexibility mainly comprises the resolution-independent factor. We demonstrate the flexibility implementation in current ligand docking tools is able to rescue only a portion of failures (10\%), and the limited performance was majorly due to potential structural errors than conformational changes. Our work suggests the strong necessity of more robust method developments on ligand docking and EM modeling techniques in order to fully utilize cryo-EM structures for in silico drug design.},

  abstract     = {Accurate estimation of solvation free energy (SFE) lays the foundation for accurate prediction of binding free energy. The Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) or generalized Born (GB) combined with surface area (SA) continuum solvation method (PBSA and GBSA) have been widely used in SFE calculations because they can achieve good balance between accuracy and efficiency. However, the accuracy of these methods can be affected by several factors such as the charge models, polar and nonpolar SFE calculation methods and the atom radii used in the calculation. In this work, the performance of the ABCG2 (AM1-BCC-GAFF2) charge model as well as other two charge models, that is, RESP (Restrained Electrostatic Potential) and AM1-BCC (Austin Model 1-bond charge corrections), on the SFE prediction of 544 small molecules in water by PBSA/GBSA was evaluated. In order to improve the performance of the PBSA prediction based on the ABCG2 charge, we further explored the influence of atom radii on the prediction accuracy and yielded a set of atom radius parameters for more accurate SFE prediction using PBSA based on the ABCG2/GAFF2 by reproducing the thermodynamic integration (TI) calculation results. The PB radius parameters of carbon, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus, chloride, bromide and iodine, were adjusted. New atom types,on,oi,hn1,hn2,hn3, were introduced to further improve the fitting performance. Then, we tuned the parameters in the nonpolar SFE model using the experimental SFE data and the PB calculation results. By adopting the new radius parameters and new nonpolar SFE model, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the SFE calculation for the 544 molecules decreased from 2.38 to 1.05 kcal/mol. Finally, the new radius parameters were applied in the prediction of protein-ligand binding free energies using the MM-PBSA method. For the eight systems tested, we could observe higher correlation between the experiment data and calculation results and smaller prediction errors for the absolute binding free energies, demonstrating that our new radius parameters can improve the free energy calculation using the MM-PBSA method.},

Furthermore, fundamental quantum chemistry methods such as Hartree-Fock self-consistent field (HF-SCF) and the complete active space SCF (CASSCF) are also implemented. The Kylin 1.0 program possesses the following features: (1) a matrix product operator (MPO) formulation-based efficient DMRG implementation for describing static electron correlation within a large active space composed of more than 100 orbitals, supporting bothU1n×U1SzandU1n×SU2Ssymmetries; (2) an efficient second-order DMRG-self-consistent field (SCF) implementation; (3) an externally contracted multi-reference CI (MRCI) and Epstein-Nesbet PT with DMRG reference wave functions for including the remaining dynamic electron correlation outside the large active spaces. In this paper, we introduce the capabilities and numerical benchmark examples of the Kylin 1.0 program.},

At the same time, the formally charged groups have not been as extensively and systematically studied as their neutral counterparts.

  abstract     = {The logarithm ofn-octanol–water partition coefficient (logP) is frequently used as an indicator of lipophilicity in drug discovery, which has substantial impacts on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity of a drug candidate. Considering that the experimental measurement of the property is costly and time-consuming, it is of great importance to develop reliable prediction models for logP. In this study, we developed a transfer free energy-based logP prediction model-FElogP. FElogP is based on the simple principle that logP is determined by the free energy change of transferring a molecule from water ton-octanol. The underlying physical method to calculate transfer free energy is the molecular mechanics-Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA), thus this method is named as free energy-based logP (FElogP). The superiority of FElogP model was validated by a large set of 707 structurally diverse molecules in the ZINC database for which the measurement was of high quality. Encouragingly, FElogP outperformed several commonly-used QSPR or machine learning-based logP models, as well as some continuum solvation model-based methods. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (R) between the predicted and measured values are 0.91 log units and 0.71, respectively, while the runner-up, the logP model implemented in OpenBabel had an RMSE of 1.13 log units and R of 0.67. Given the fact that FElogP was not parameterized against experimental logP directly, its excellent performance is likely to be expanded to arbitrary organic molecules covered by the general AMBER force fields.},

A detailed understanding of the interactions between TAR-Binding Proteins (TBP) and RNA will facilitate the discovery of new anti-AIDS drugs. In order to characterize and explore the key interactions between RNA and TBP, we focused on the wild type (WT) and three mutant TBPs (TBP6.9, TBP6.7, and TBP6.3) with RNA, multiple molecular dynamics simulation and energy computation were performed. The results showed that 12 key residues played a major role in the interaction between TBP and RNA. The mutated residues of TBP changed the interaction between their surrounding residues and RNA, thus affecting the binding of TBP to RNA. In addition, structural and energy analyses showed that in contrast with WT TBP-RNA complex, the mutated residues had little effect on the backbone structure of TBP, but changes in the van der Waals interactions and electrostatic interaction associated with the side chains are responsible for the altered the binding between three mutant TBPs and RNA complexes. The discovery of TBP-RNA recognition mechanism in our work provides some useful insights and new opportunities for the development of anti-aids drugs.},

  abstract     = {Solvent-mediated interactions contribute to ligand binding affinities in computational drug design and provide a challenge for theoretical predictions. In this study, we analyze the solvation free energy of benzene derivatives in water to guide the development of predictive models for solvation free energies and solvent-mediated interactions. We use a spatially resolved analysis of local solvation free energy contributions and define solvation free energy arithmetic, which enable us to construct additive models to describe the solvation of complex compounds. The substituents analyzed in this study are carboxyl and nitro-groups due to their similar sterical requirements but distinct interactions with water. We find that nonadditive solvation free energy contributions are primarily attributed to electrostatics, which are qualitatively reproduced with computationally efficient continuum models. This suggests a promising route for the development of efficient and accurate models for the solvation of complex molecules with varying substitution patterns using solvation arithmetic.},

  abstract     = {The nucleation of sulfuric acid–water clusters is a significant contribution to the formation of aerosols as precursors of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Depending on the temperature, there is an interplay between the clustering of particles and their evaporation controlling the efficiency of cluster growth. For typical temperatures in the atmosphere, the evaporation of H2SO4H2O clusters is more efficient than the clustering of the first, small clusters, and thus their growth is dampened at its early stages. Since the evaporation rates of small clusters containing anHSO4−ion are much smaller than for purely neutral sulfuric acid clusters, they can serve as a central body for the further attachment of H2SO4H2O molecules. We here present an innovative Monte Carlo model to study the growth of aqueous sulfuric acid clusters around central ions. Unlike classical thermodynamic nucleation theory or kinetic models, this model allows to trace individual particles and thus to determine properties for each individual particle. As a benchmarking case, we have performed simulations atT=300Ka relative humidity of 50\% with dipole and ion concentrations ofcdipole=5×108−109cm−3andcion=0−107cm−3. We discuss the runtime of our simulations and present the velocity distribution of ionic clusters, the size distribution of the clusters as well as the formation rate of clusters with radiiR≥0.85nm. Simulations give reasonable velocity and size distributions and there is a good agreement of the formation rates with previous results, including the relevance of ions for the initial growth of sulfuric acid–water clusters. Conclusively, we present a computational method which allows studying detailed particle properties during the growth of aerosols as a precursor of CCN.},

  abstract     = {Designing movesets providing high quality protein conformations remains a hard problem, especially when it comes to deform a long protein backbone segment, and a key building block to do so is the so-called tripeptide loop closure (TLC). Consider a tripeptide whose first and last bonds (N1Cα;1andCα;3C3) are fixed, and so are all internal coordinates except the sixϕψi=1,2,3dihedral angles associated to the threeCαcarbons. Under these conditions, the TLC algorithm provides all possible values for these six dihedral angles–there exists at most 16 solutions. TLC moves atoms up to∼5Åin one step and retains low energy conformations, whence its pivotal role to design move sets sampling protein loop conformations. In this work, we relax the previous constraints, allowing the last bond (Cα;3C3) to freely move in 3D space–or equivalently in a 5D configuration space. We exhibit necessary geometric constraints in this 5D space for TLC to admit solutions. Our analysis provides key insights on the geometry of solutions for TLC. Most importantly, when using TLC to sample loop conformations based onmconsecutive tripeptides along a protein backbone, we obtain an exponential gain in the volume of the5m-dimensional configuration space to be explored.},

Analysis of the global reactivity indices permits us to characterizeFNP10as a strong electrophile andAY11as a strong nucleophile. Four reactive pathways associated with the ortho/meta regioselective channels and endo/exo stereoselective approaches modes have been explored and characterized in the gas phase and in the benzene solvent. The analysis of the relative energies associated with the different reaction pathways indicates that the 32CA reactions of the azomethine ylide (AY)with the nitroalkene (FNP) is meta regioselective with high endo stereoselectivity. This result is in good agreement with the experimental observations. electron localization function topological analysis of the most favored reactive pathways allows for characterizing the mechanism of this 32CA reactions as a non-concerted two-stage one-step mechanism. Finally, non-covalent interactions and quantum theory of atoms in molecule analyses at the meta/endo transition state structure indicate that the presence of different several weak interactions, namely, CF and NH contributed in favoring the formation of a meta-endo cycloadduct.},

We investigate the changes in the electronic and magnetic properties of a TATA-DNA sequence when functionalized with different chemical groups; using the first-principles density functional theory specifically, the TATA-DNA sequences were functionalized with methyl groups (CH3, methylation), amino groups (NH2, amination), imine groups (NH, imination), chloroamine groups (NCl2, chloramination), H-adatom (hydrogenation), and Cl-adatom (chlorination). The functional groups were anchored at nitrogen atoms from adenine and oxygen atoms from thymine at sites pointed as reactive regions. We demonstrated that chemical functionalization induces significant changes in charge transfer, hydrogen bond distance, and hydrogen bond energy. The hydrogenation and imination increased the hydrogen bond energy. Results also revealed that the chemical functionalization of DNA molecules exhibit a ferromagnetic ground state, reaching magnetization up to 4.665 μBand complex magnetic ordering. We further demonstrated that the functionalization could induce tautomerism (proton migration in the base pair systems). The present study provides a theoretical basis for understanding the functionalization further into DNA molecules and visualizing possible future applications.},

The present work attempts to gauge dipole–dipole interactions&#39; ability without fragmentation. A suitable anisotropic damping function is also introduced to work with anisotropic QDO.

However, these functions do not always provide good approximations for nuclei with large mass number. The two-parameter Fermi (2pF) distribution and more realistic distributions describe well even nuclei with large mass number but do not have analytical NAI formulas. We propose a new function model called augmented Gaussian 12 (AG12), which has sufficient number of parameters and analytical NAI formulas. With the proposed fitting scheme, the AG12 charge distribution model optimally reproduces 2pF and the more realistic charge distributions. Moreover, AG12 fitted to 2pF model reproduces the energy difference of hydrogen-like ions well between the Gaussian distribution and 2pF models. Calculations using AG12 also suggested necessity to use more realistic nuclear charge distributions than 2pF.},

  abstract     = {Flexible loops are paramount to protein functions, with action modes ranging from localized dynamics contributing to the free energy of the system, to large amplitude conformational changes accounting for the repositioning whole secondary structure elements or protein domains. However, generating diverse and low energy loops remains a difficult problem. This work introduces a novel paradigm to sample loop conformations, in the spirit of the hit-and-run (HAR) Markov chain Monte Carlo technique. The algorithm uses a decomposition of the loop into tripeptides, and a novel characterization of necessary conditions for Tripeptide Loop Closure to admit solutions. Denotingmthe number of tripeptides, the algorithm works in an angular space of dimension 12 m. In this space, the hyper-surfaces associated with the aforementioned necessary conditions are used to run a HAR-like sampling technique. On classical loop cases up to 15 amino acids, our parameter free method compares favorably to previous work, generating more diverse conformational ensembles. We also report experiments on a 30 amino acids long loop, a size not processed in any previous work.},

  abstract     = {Modern Density Functional Theory models are now suitable for many molecular and condensed phase studies. The study of noncovalent interactions, a well-known drawback, is no longer an insurmountable obstacle through design and empirical corrections. However, using empirical corrections as in the DFT-D methods might not be an all-in-one solution. This work uses a simple system, X2-H2O with X = Cl or Br, with two different interactions, halogen-bonded (XB) and hydrogen-halogen (HX), to investigate the capability of current density functional approximations (DFA) in predicting interaction energies with eight different exchange-correlation functionals. SAPT(DFT) provides, for all the studied cases, better predictions than the widely used supermolecular approach. In addition, the components of the interaction energy suggest where some of the shortcomings originate in each DFA. The analysis of the functionals used confirms that PBE0 and ω-B97X-D have a physically correct behavior. Using SAPT(DFT) and PBE0, and ω-B97X-D, we obtained the interaction energy of Cl2and Br2inside different clathrate cages and satisfactorily compared with wavefunction results; hence, the lower and upper limits of this value are defined: Cl2@512, −5.3 ± 0.3 kcal/mol; Cl2@51262, −5.5 ± 0.1 kcal/mol; Br2@51262, −7.6 ± 1.0 kcal/mol; Br2@51263, −10.6 ± 1.0 kcal/mol; Br2@51264, −10.9 ± 0.8 kcal/mol.},

  abstract     = {Although cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements in solution have been widely used to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital energy (EHOMO) of semiconducting organic molecules, an understanding of the experimentally observed discrepancies due to the solvent used is lacking. To explain these differences, we investigate the solvent effects onEHOMOby combining density functional theory and molecular dynamics calculations for four donor molecules with a common backbone moiety. We compare the experimentalEHOMOvalues to the calculated values obtained from either implicit or first solvation shell theories. We find that the first solvation shell method can capture theEHOMOvariation arising from the functional groups in solution, unlike the implicit method. We further applied the first solvation shell method to other semiconducting organic molecules measured in solutions for different solvents. We find that theEHOMOobtained using an implicit method is insensitive to solvent choice. The first solvation shell, however, producesEHOMOvalues that are sensitive to solvent choices and agrees with published experimental results. The solvent sensitivity arises from a hierarchy of three effects: (1) the solute electronic state within a surrounding dielectric continuum, (2) ambient temperature or solvent atoms changing the solute geometry, and (3) electronic interactions between the solute and solvents. The implicit method, on the other hand, only captures the effect of a dielectric environment. Our findings suggest thatEHOMOobtained by CV measurements should account for the influence of solvent when the results are reported, interpreted, or compared to other molecules.},

In addition, several structural possibilities for a BexMg1−xO solid solution have been investigated for a Be content between 6\% and 22\%; for those, dynamically stable structures have been found, displaying large polarization values, more covalent BeO bonds, and a tendency for tetrahedral Be coordination.

  abstract     = {Gold and silver subnanoclusters with few atoms are prominent candidates for catalysis-related applications, primarily because of the large fraction of lower-coordinated atoms exposed and ready to interact with external chemical species. However, an in-depth energetic analysis is necessary to characterize the relevant terms within the molecular adsorption process that can frame the interactions within the Sabatier principle. Herein, we investigate the interaction between Agnand Aunsubnanoclusters (clu,n= 2–7) and N2, NO, CO, and O2molecules, using scalar-relativistic density functional theory calculations within van der Waals D3 corrections. The onefold top site is preferred for all chemisorption cases, with a predominance of linear (≈180°) and bent (≈120°) molecular geometries. A larger magnitude of adsorption energy is correlated with smaller distances between molecules and clusters and with the weakening of the adsorbates bond strength represented by the increase of the equilibrium distances and decrease of molecular stretching frequencies. From the energetic decomposition, the interaction energy term was established as an excellent descriptor to classify subnanoclusters in the adsorption/desorption process concomitant with the Sabatier principle. The limiting cases: (i) weak molecular adsorption on the subnanoclusters, which may compromise the reaction activation, where an interaction energy magnitude close to 0 eV is observed (e.g., physisorption in N2/Ag6); and (ii) strong molecular interactions with the subnanoclusters, given the interaction energy magnitude is larger than at least one of the individual fragment binding energies (e.g., strong chemisorption in CO/Au4and NO/Au4), conferring a decrease in the desorption rate and an increase in the possible poisoning rate. However, the intermediate cases are promising by involving interaction energy magnitudes between zero and fragment binding energies. Following the molecular closed-shell (open-shell) electronic configuration, we find a predominant electrostatic (covalent) nature of the physical interactions for N2⋯clu and CO ⋯clu (O2⋯clu and NO⋯clu), except in the physisorption case (N2/Ag6) where dispersive interaction is dominant. Our results clarify questions about the molecular adsorption on subnanoclusters as a relevant mechanistic step present in nanocatalytic reactions.},

  abstract     = {A new theoretical method, referred to as Generalized Langevin Mode Analysis (GLMA), is proposed to analyze the mode of structural fluctuations of a biomolecule in solution. The method combines the two theories in the statistical mechanics, or the Generalized Langevin theory and the RISM/3D-RISM theory, to calculate the second derivative, or the Hessian matrix, of the free energy surface of a biomolecule in aqueous solution, which consists of the intramolecular interaction among atoms in the biomolecule and the solvation free energy. The method is applied to calculate the wave-number spectrum of an alanine dipeptide in water for which the optical heterodyne-detected Raman-induced spectroscopy (RIKES) spectrum is available to compare with. The theoretical analysis reproduced the main features of the experimental spectrum with respect to the peak positions of the four bands around ~90 cm−1, ~240 cm−1, ~370 cm−1, and 400 cm−1, observed in the experimental spectrum, in spite that the physics involved in the two spectrum was not exactly the same: the experimental spectrum includes the contributions from the dipeptide and the water molecules interacting with the solute, while the theoretical one is just concerned with the solute molecule, influenced by solvation. Two major discrepancies between the theoretical and experimental spectra, one in the band intensity around ~100 cm−1, and the other in the peak positions around ~370 cm−1, are discussed in terms of the fluctuation mode of water molecules interacting with the dipeptide, which is not takenexplicitlyinto account in the theoretical analysis.},

After validating the reliability of the models, a genetic algorithm was coupled with the Des-Pot Grid algorithm to generate new molecules from a predefined pool of molecular fragments and predict their bioactivity and cytotoxicity.

Recently, we have demonstrated that the transition state, dictating folding kinetics, is characterized as the state of maximum dynamic cooperativity, i.e., the state of maximum correlations between amino acid contact formations. Here, we investigate the evolutionary conservation of those amino acids contributing significantly to the dynamic cooperativity. We find a strong indication of a new kind of relationship—necessary but not sufficient causality—between the evolutionary conservation and the dynamic cooperativity: larger contributions to the dynamic cooperativity arise from more conserved residues, but not vice versa. This holds for all the protein systems for which long folding simulation trajectories are available. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic demonstration of any kind of evolutionary conservation of amino acids relevant to folding kinetics.},

Utilizing multiple long-time MD simulations of AzoChignolin and Chignolin in MeOH and water, we estimated Markov models to examine folding kinetics of both peptides. We show that while AzoChignolin mimics Chignolin&#39;s structure well, the folding kinetics are quite different. Not only folding times but also intermediate states differ, particularly Chignolin is able to fold in MeOH into anα-helical intermediate which is impossible to form in AzoChignolin. The Markov models demonstrate that AzoChignolin&#39;s kinetics are generally faster, specifically when comparing the two main microfolding processes of hydrophobic collapse and turn formation. Photoswitchable loops are used frequently to understand the kinetics of elementary protein folding nucleation. However, our results indicate that intermediates and folding kinetics may differ between natural loops and photoswitchable variants.},

To gain more understanding, we have performed energy decomposition analysis based on many-body expansion, and have compared the results from the XO-PBC method, that is, the eXtended ONIOM method (XO) with the periodic boundary condition (PBC), with those from some commonly used dispersion corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) methods. It is shown here that, with the XYG3 doubly hybrid functional chosen as the target high level to capture the intra- and short-range intermolecular interactions, and the periodic PBE as the basic low level to take long range interactions into account, the XO-PBC(XYG3:PBE) method not only obtains the correct experimental stability orderings, but also predicts reasonable polymorph energy ranges for all three cases. Our results have demonstrated the usefulness of the present theoretical methods, in particular XO-PBC, while highlighted the importance of a better treatment of different kinds of interactions to be beneficial to polymorph control.},

Our findings demonstrate that the non-nuclear attractors (NNAs) are an essential component of the high-spin lithium clusters and play a key role in keeping them stable. Based on IQA energy terms, an electrostatic destabilizing interaction between the lithium atoms works against the cluster formation. On the other hand, the interactions between lithium atoms and NNA basins are stabilizing and outweigh the lithium-lithium destabilizing effects. In fact, NNAs tend to draw lithium atoms together and stabilize the resulting cluster. The high-spin clusters of lithium can be regarded as electrostatically driven compounds since the electrostatic components are primarily responsible for the stabilizing interactions between NNAs and Li atoms. The only exception is3Li2, which lacks NNA and has a non-repellent lithium–lithium interaction. Indeed, in the3Li2, the interatomic electrostatic component is negligibly small, and the exchange-correlation term leads to a weak bonding interaction.},

Each atom is exactly part of one heptagon and two hexagon rings so that two heptagons do not share the same edge or vertex. Such pattern, called hyperbolic soccer ball obeys the isolated-heptagon rule with the minimum possible number of hexagons between heptagons similar to the isolation of pentagons from hexagons in the C60 fullerene. Both of the designed P surfaces are unbalanced, that is, they have two unequal sides, and belong to space groupsP432of the cubic system, andP4/nccof the tetragonal system, respectively. Unit cells have a multiple of 24 heptagons similar to the only one previously known in literature Schwarzite with the hyperbolic soccer ball pattern—the D surface of Vanderbilt and Tersoff. The geometry of the periodic structures and unit cell parameters were fully optimized by DFT calculations using CASTEP software with PBE and PBESOL functionals under generalized gradient approximation. The effect of P and D surface dilution by hexagons on the calculated density, elastic and electronic properties is discussed.},

  abstract     = {The prediction of (un)binding rates and free energies is of great significance to the drug design process. Although many enhanced sampling algorithms and approaches have been developed, there is not yet a reliable workflow to predict these quantities. Previously we have shown that free energies and transition rates can be calculated by directly simulating the binding and unbinding processes with our variant of the WE algorithm “Resampling of Ensembles by Variation Optimization”, or “REVO”. Here, we calculate binding free energies retrospectively for three SAMPL6 host-guest systems and prospectively for a SAMPL9 system to test a modification of REVO that restricts its cloning behavior in quasi-unbound states. Specifically, trajectories cannot clone if they meet a physical requirement that represents a high likelihood of unbinding, which in the case of this work is a center-of-mass to center-of-mass distance. The overall effect of this change was difficult to predict, as it results in fewer unbinding events each of which with a much higher statistical weight. For all four systems tested, this new strategy produced either more accurate unbinding free energies or more consistent results between simulations than the standard REVO algorithm. This approach is highly flexible, and any feature of interest for a system can be used to determine cloning eligibility. These findings thus constitute an important improvement in the calculation of transition rates and binding free energies with the weighted ensemble method.},

Thus, we systematically investigate here the behavior of non-polarizable Zn2+models for their ability to reproduce experimentally determined metal coordination and ligand binding in metalloproteins. The benchmarking is performed in challenging environments, including mono- (carbonic anhydrase II) and bimetallic (metallo-β-lactamase VIM-2) ligand binding sites. We identify key differences in the performance between the Zn2+models with regard to the preferred ligating atoms (charged/non-charged), attraction of water molecules, and the preferred coordination geometry.

In this work, a simple approximation of Ewald 1D sum is introduced with its error rigorously controlled. To investigate the impacts on the efficiency and accuracy by different parts, a pairwise potential is calculated for a series of screening parameters (α) and radial distances (ρ) between two point charges. A mapping between the sum of trigonometric functions in Ewald 1D method and the sum of specific vectors further reveals the different converging speeds of different Fourier parts.

Peptide therapeutics show significant potential for this viral disease due to their efficiency, safety, and specificity. Here, two thousand seven hundred eight antibacterial peptides were screened computationally targeting the Main protease (Mpro) of SARS CoV-2. Six top-ranked peptides according to their binding scores, binding pose were investigated by molecular dynamics to explore the interaction and binding behavior of peptide-Mpro complexes. The structural and energetic characteristics of Mpro-DRAMP01760 and Mpro-DRAMP01808 complexes fluctuated less during a 250 ns MD simulation. In addition, three peptides (DRAMP01760, DRAMP01808, and DRAMP01342) bind strongly to Mpro protein, according to the free energy landscape and principal component analysis. Peptide helicity and secondary structure analysis are in agreement with our findings. Interaction analysis of protein-peptide complexes demonstrated that Mpro&#39;s residue CYS145, HIS41, PRO168, GLU166, GLN189, ASN142, MET49, and THR26 play significant contributions in peptide-protein attachment. Binding free energy analysis (MM-PBSA) demonstrated the energy profile of interacting residues of Mpro in peptide-Mpro complexes. To summarize, the peptides DRAMP01808 and DRAMP01760 may be highly Mpro specific, resulting disruption in a viral replication and transcription. The results of this research are expected to assist future research toward the development of antiviral peptide-based therapeutics for Covid-19 treatment.},

The variation in hydration free energy with percentage disorder of the selected proteins is investigated through its nonelectrostatic and electrostatic components. A decrease in hydration free energy is observed with an increase in percentage disorder, indicating favorable interactions of the disordered proteins with the solvent. This confirms the role of percentage disorder in determining the aggregation propensity of proteins which is measured in terms of the hydration free energy in addition to their respective mean net charge and mean hydrophobicity. The hydration free energy is decoupled into energetic and entropic terms. A residue-wise decomposition analysis of the hydration free energy for the selected proteins is evaluated. The decomposition shows that the disordered regions contribute more than the ordered ones for the intrinsically disordered protein regions. The dominant role of electrostatic interactions is confirmed from the residue-wise decomposition of the hydration free energy. The results depict that the negatively charged residues contribute more to the total hydration free energy for the proteins with negative mean net charge, while the positively charged residues contribute more for proteins with positive mean net charge.},

According to recent studies, not only the nature of the cluster molecules, but also the macroscopic structure of the materials determines their non-linear optical properties. Here we present a systematic study of cluster dimers of the compounds AdR4and [(RT)4S6] (T = Si, Ge, Sn) with R = methyl, phenyl or 1-naphthyl to gain fundamental knowledge about the interactions in the materials. For all compounds, a similar type of dimer structures with a staggered arrangement of substituents was determined as the energetically most favorable configuration. The binding energy between the dimers, determined by including London dispersion interactions, increases with the size of the core and the substituents. The cluster interactions can be classified as substituent-substituent-dominated (small cores, large substituents) or core–core-dominated (large cores, small substituents). Among various possible dimer conformers, those with small core–core distances are energetically preferred. Trimer and tetramer clusters display similar trends regarding the minimal core–core distances and binding energies. The much lower energy barrier determined for the rotation of substituents as compared to the rotation of the cluster dimers past each other indicates that the rotation of substituents more easily leads to different conformers in the material. Thus, understanding the interaction of the cluster dimers allows an initial assessment of the interactions in the materials.},

  abstract     = {Activation of the dinitrogen triple bond is a crucial step in the overall fixation of atmospheric nitrogen into usable forms for industrial and biological applications. Current synthetic catalysts incorporate metal ions to facilitate the activation and cleavage of dinitrogen. The high price of metal-based catalysts and the challenge of catalyst recovery during industrial catalytic processes has led to increasing interest in metal-free catalysts. One step toward metal-free catalysis is the use of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs). In this study, we have examined 18 functionalized carbenes as FLPs to elucidate the influence of steric and electronic effects on the activation of dinitrogen. To test the effects of functionalization on dinitrogen activation, we have performed density functional theory (DFT), multireference, non and extended transition state-natural orbital for chemical valence (ETS-NOCV) calculations. Our results suggest that functional groups which introduce strong electron-withdrawing effects and/or engage in extended π/π* systems lead to the lowering of the dissociation energy of the dinitrogen bond, which further contributes to greater nitrogen activation. We conjecture that these effects are due to enhanced back-bonding capability of the p orbital of the carbene carbon atoms to the adjacent nitrogen atoms (increasing Lewis basicity of the carbene carbon atom) and enhanced stability of dissociated products. Our concluding remarks include opportunities to extend this activation study to explore the entire catalytic cycle with promising functionalized carbenes for experimental evaluation.},

The calculated binding energies of the size variants of the truncated system, including only a restricted number of atoms around the ligand, are compared to the energy obtained from a full system. The result shows that the systems could be truncated to a radius of 8 Å from neutral ligands within an error of 0.7 kcal/mol, and 12 Å from charged ligands within an error of 1.1 kcal/mol for calculating the binding energy in solution.},

In this work, we propose a new genetic algorithm software, GAMaterial, implemented in Python3.x, that performs global searches to elucidate the structures of atomic clusters, doped clusters or materials and atomic clusters on surfaces. For all these applications, it is possible to accelerate the GA search by using machine learning (ML), the ML@GA method, to build subsequent populations. Results for ML@GA applied for the dopant distributions in atomic clusters are presented. The GAMaterial software was applied for the automatic structural search for the Ti6O12cluster, doping Al in Si11(4Al@Si11) and Na10supported on graphene (Na10@graphene), where DFTB calculations were used to sample the complex search surfaces with reasonably low computational cost.

  abstract     = {Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) is a significant and crucial physical quantity that can be applied to a large number of scenarios, such as the prediction of nucleophilic or electrophilic attacks, fitting atomic charges, σ-hole, and so forth. The computational cost for the MEP has anO(N2) scaling with the increase of atoms, which is intractable and laborious for macromolecules. Herein, a density fitting molecular electrostatic potential (DF-MEP) is used to reduce the computational costs for the macromolecular MEP. It is found that the accuracy of DF-MEP is almost identical to the conventional molecular electrostatic potential (Conv-MEP), while the computational costs can be reduced to anO(N) scaling, for example, the computational time of 699,200 grids for the Trp-cage molecule (304 atoms) only takes 16.6 s at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP level of theory with 16 CPU cores compared with 3060.2 s for the Conv-MEP method.},

Results of a chosen set of functionals were compared to post-HF methods (EOM-CCSD, NEVPT2, CASPT2, and MRCI). In addition, the semiempirical OM2/MNDO method using MRCISD computational level was confronted with the above-mentioned techniques. Despite the fact that the first excited state has a significant double-excitation character some functionals were able to qualitatively determine the correct state order (where the lowest excited state has aAg−character). The most successful functionals in transition energies predictions were PBE, TPSS and BLYP in Tamm-Dancoff approach (TDA), which had the smallest root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) scoring towards the experimental values. Regarding RMSD scoring, the OM2/MNDO method performed fairly well, too. Besides absorption spectra, lifetimes of the first two excited states were estimated based on a stochastic approach exploring a swarm of OM2/MNDO hopping dynamics using the Tully fewest switch algorithm for each molecule. The longest lifetime of the first excited state (S1) was found for decapentaene (about 5 ps). Further elongation of the conjugated chain caused a mild decrease of this value to ca 1.5 ps for docosaundecaene.},

Extreme-pressure anti-wear additives, such as tricresyl phosphate (TCP), are mixed with base oil to prevent wear through the formation of a lubricant film on the substrate. We studied the effect of liquid pressure on the decomposition pathway of TCP in base oil molecules (2,5-dimethylhexane) using hybrid quantum-classical simulations with density functional theory for electrons. At a temperature of 300 K, we found that: (i) bond-breaking barrier energies of both the OC and PO bonds of TCP decrease monotonically as the liquid pressure increases; (ii) the bond-breaking barrier energy of PO is lower than that of OC at pressures of 0 and 2.0 GPa, but is higher at a pressure of 5.0 GPa; and (iii) the applied pressure significantly lowers the bond-breaking barrier energies of both OC and PO when the PO bond of TCP is directed upward from the substrate. These findings are explained by the inhomogeneous distribution of base oil molecules around TCP and the steric repulsion of the PO bond of TCP. These results indicate that the internal structures of the lubricant films are pressure-dependent.},

From the calculations, descriptors such as the singlet-triplet splitting, the natural orbital (NO) occupations and aromaticity indexes are used to provide structural and energetic analysis. The boron and nitrogen atoms form an isoelectronic pair of two carbon atoms, which was used for the complete substitution of these units in the acene series. The structural analysis confirms the effects originated from the insertion of a uniform pattern of electronegativity difference within the molecular systems. The covalent bonds tend to be strongly polarized which does not happen in the case of a carbon-only framework. This effect leads to a charge transfer between neighbor atoms resulting in a more strengthened structure, keeping the aromaticity roughly constant along the chain. The singlet-triplet splitting also agrees with this stability trend, maintaining a consistent gap value for all molecules. The BN-n-acenes molecules possess a ground state with monoconfigurational character indicating their electronic stability. The low-lying singlet excited states have charge transfer character, which proceeds from nitrogen to boron.},

  abstract     = {Since atomic or functional-group properties in the bulk are generally not available from experimental methods, computational approaches based on partitioning schemes have emerged as a rapid yet accurate pathway to estimate the materials behavior from chemically meaningful building blocks. Among several applications, a comprehensive and systematically built database of atomic or group polarizabilities and related opto-electronic quantities would be very useful not only to envisage linear or non-linear optical properties of biomacromolecules but also to improve the accuracy of classical force fields devoted to simulate biochemical processes. In this work, we propose the first entries of such database that contains distributed polarizabilities and dipole moments extracted from fragments of peptides. Twenty three prototypical conformers of the dipeptides alanine–alanine and glycine–glycine were used to extract functional groups such asCH2,CHCH3,NH2,COOH,CONH, thus allowing construction of a diversity of chemically relevant environments. To evaluate the accuracy of our database, reconstructed properties of larger peptides containing up to six residues of alanine and glycine were tested against density functional theory calculations at the M06-HF/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory. The procedure is particularly accurate for the diagonal components of the polarizability tensor with errors up to 15\%. In order to include solvent effects explicitly, the peptides were also surrounded by a box of water molecules whose distribution was optimized using the CHARMM force field. Solvent effects introduced by a classical dipole–dipole interaction model were compared to those obtained from polarizable-continuum model calculations.},

For the last system our goal is to achieve good predictive accuracy with only a few training points. Therefore, we assess for these systems a self-correcting multilayer GPR model, in which the prediction is corrected by a chain of additional GPR models. In our adaptive regularization scheme, we impose no noise on the training data, but use an approach based on the data itself to account for its impurity. The strength of this strategy is that the data points are treated differently based on their importance and that the regularization can still be controlled by a single parameter. We assess how the accuracy of the prediction depends on this parameter. We can show that the new regularization scheme as well as the multilayer approach results in more robust predictors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the predictor can be in good agreement with the density-functional theory results.},

The representations thus obtained are particularly well suited for pathway construction in double-ended methods for transition state search and optimizations with nonlinear constraints. Analytical gradients for the transformation between the coordinate systems were derived for analytical geometry optimizations purely inZ-matrix coordinates. The geometry optimization was coupled with a Symbolic Algebra package to support arbitrary nonlinear constraints inZ-matrix coordinates, while retaining analytical energy gradient conversion. The difference to the commonly used nonhierarchical IC transformations is discussed. Sample applications are provided for a number of common chemical reactions and illustrative examples.},

In this paper, a scheme is proposed based on the polarizable dipole–dipole interaction model and used to rapidly estimate the intermolecular many-body polarization effect in water clusters. We use a bond-dipole-based polarization function to evaluate the polarization energy. We regard two OH bonds of a water molecule as two bond-dipoles and set the permanent OH bond-dipole moment of a water molecule to be 1.51 Debye. We estimate the induced OH bond-dipole moment via a simple formula in which only one correction factor is needed. This scheme is then applied to tens of water clusters to calculate the three- and four-body interaction energies. The three-body interaction energies of 93 water clusters produced by our scheme are compared with those produced by the counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ, MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ, M06-2X/jul-cc-pVTZ methods, by the AMOEBApro13, iAMOEBA, AMOEBA+, AMOEBA+(CF) methods, and by the MB-pol method. The four-body interaction energies of 47 water clusters yielded by our scheme are compared with those yielded by the counterpoise-corrected MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ and M06-2X/ jul-cc-pVTZ methods, by the AMOEBApro13, AMOEBA+, AMOEBA+(CF) methods, and by the MB-pol method. The comparison results show that the scheme proposed in this paper can reproduce the counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ three-body interaction energies and reproduce the counterpoise-corrected MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ four-body interaction energies both accurately and efficiently. We anticipate the scheme proposed here can be useful for computer simulations of liquid water and aqueous solutions.},

In this work, we report a computational study to investigate the synthesis of ethoxycarbonyldifluoromethylated oxindoles fromN-arylmethacrylamides. The reaction tolerates a diverse range of acrylamides, shows yields ranging from approximately 38\%–96\%. We have applied density functional theory (DFT) to explore the reaction mechanism, kinetics and thermodynamics to gain further understanding. We demonstrate that a radical-based ring closure reaction is energetically more favorable than a heterolytic process, that the rate-determining step is the formation of the arylmethacrylamide radical, and that the product yields and selectivities are consistent with experiment. The results demonstrate that theoretical methods can prove useful to understand how such reaction and could be potentially employed to rapidly explore the reaction scope further.},

  abstract     = {The nudged elastic band (NEB) method is utilized to find reaction paths (RPs) using discretized intermediate structures called “images” between a reactant and a product. In fact, NEB calculations do not always converge because of the bent of RPs. Mathematically, more images are needed for complex curves, and here, we focused on the curvature. In this study, we propose a new method for calculating the curvature of the RPs as well as a method for weighting the spring constant of the NEB with the curvature, which we named the curvature weighted NEB (CW-NEB) method. In addition, we will propose the CW-NEB method with the climbing image (CI) method (CW-CI-NEB). To show the efficiency of our method, calculations for the ene-reaction of the CW-CI-NEB method were performed and compared with those of the CI-NEB methods. The CW-CI-NEB methods converged in shorter iteration times than the CI-NEB calculation, which was found by gathering the bent of RPs.},

  abstract     = {Quantum chemical calculations were carried out to investigate the nature of the bonding between a neutral Be3ring and noble gas atom. Electronic structure calculation for these complexes was carried out at different computational levels in association with natural bond orbital, quantum theory of atoms in molecules, electron localization function, symmetry adapted perturbation theory, and molecular electrostatic potential surface analysis of Be3complexes. The Be atoms in the Be3moiety are chemically bonded to one another, with the BeBe bond dissociation energy being ~125 kJ mol−1. The Be3ring interacts with the noble gases through non-covalent interactions. The binding energies of the noble gas atoms with the Be3ring increases with increase in their atomic number. The non-covalent interaction index, density overlap region indicator and independent gradient model analyses reveal the presence of non-covalent inter-fragment interactions in the complexes. Energy decomposition analysis reveals that dispersion plays the major role towards stabilizing these systems.},

Key new features are: implementation of the full family of vertical and adiabatic harmonic models, vibrational analysis in curvilinear coordinates, extension to several electronic spectroscopies and implementation of time-dependent approaches. The use of curvilinear valence internal coordinates allows the adoption of quadratic model potential energy surfaces (PES) of the initial and final states expanded at arbitrary configurations. Moreover, the implementation of suitable projectors provides a robust framework for defining reduced-dimensionality models by sorting flexible coordinates out of the harmonic subset, so that they can then be treated at anharmonic level, or with mixed quantum classical approaches. A set of tools to facilitate input preparation and output analysis is also provided. We show the program at work in the simulation of different spectra (one and two-photon absorption, emission and resonance Raman) and internal conversion rate of a typical rigid molecule, anthracene. Then, we focus on absorption and emission spectra of a series of flexible polyphenyl molecules, highlighting the relevance of some of the newly implemented features.

  abstract     = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19, has continued to mutate and spread worldwide despite global vaccination efforts. In particular, the Omicron variant, first identified in South Africa in late November 2021, has become the dominant strain worldwide. Compared to the original strain identified in Wuhan, Omicron features 50 genetic mutations, with 15 mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, which binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for viral entry. However, it is not completely understood how these mutations alter the interaction and binding strength between the Omicron RBD and ACE2. In this study, we used a combined steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation and experimental microscale thermophoresis (MST) approach to quantify the interaction between Omicron RBD and ACE2. We report that the Omicron brings an enhanced RBD-ACE2 interface through N501Y, Q498R, and T478K mutations; the changes further lead to unique interaction patterns, reminiscing the features of previously dominated variants, Alpha (N501Y) and Delta (L452R and T478K). Among the Q493K and Q493R, we report that Q493R shows stronger binding to ACE2 than Q493K due to increased interactions. Our MST data confirmed that the Omicron mutations in RBD are associated with a five-fold higher binding affinity to ACE2 compared to the RBD of the original strain. In conclusion, our results could help explain the Omicron variant&#39;s prevalence in human populations, as higher interaction forces or affinity for ACE2 likely promote greater viral binding and internalization, leading to increased infectivity.},

  abstract     = {Si69 and Si75, typical commodities of silane coupling agents, are often employed in tire recipes to work as the bridges connecting silica and polymers, with which rolling resistance and wet traction are enhanced without loss in abrasion resistance. In this article, the reactivities of Si69 and Si75 with silica and various rubbers were theoretically investigated by using density functional theory (DFT). When the agents were coupled with silica, not only the acid+water condition but also the pure acid condition was confirmed to readily trigger the condensation reactions. The corresponding Gibbs free energy barriers were related to the charge distributions of reaction regions. As the agents suffered from the homolysis of central SS bonds, the generatedsingle-S-tailer radicals (RS·) showed significantly higher reactivities of both the radical addition and the α-H transfer reactions with rubbers, due to the stronger radical philicities of the terminal sulfur radicals with larger condensed local softnesses [s0(S)]. When the agents underwent the heterolysis of central SS bonds, the terminal sulfur anions with smaller s−(S) indices, however, facilitated the nucleophilic addition reactions with rubbers. Several derivative indices based on the condensed local softnesses were also proposed here to shed light on the reactivities from the viewpoint of the relationship between energy barriers and electronic characteristics. The above findings pave the way for the design of new kinds of silane coupling agents using computer-aided techniques, and meanwhile, provide references for the practical application of Si69 and Si75 to the silica/rubbers systems.},

We found that the transition probabilities decrease at large replica indices when the combinations are sequentially assigned to the state labels as in the originally proposed list. To solve this problem, we propose to modify the list by randomly assigning the combinations to the state labels. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of amyloid-β(16–22) peptides using RPST with the “randomly assigned” list (RPST-RA) and RPST with the “sequentially assigned” list (RPST-SA). The results show the decreases in the transition probabilities in RPST-SA are eliminated, and the sampling efficiency is improved in RPST-RA.},

We apply the toolkit in four situations in which different electronic-structure properties of organic molecules in the presence of a solvent or a complex biological environment are computed: the reduction potential of the nucleobases in acetonitrile, an energy decomposition analysis of tyrosine interacting with water, the absorption spectrum of an azobenzene derivative integrated into a voltage-gated ion channel, and the absorption and emission spectra of the luciferine/luciferase complex. These examples show that the toolkit can be employed in a manifold of situations for both the electronic ground state and electronically excited states.

In this work, we evaluate the performance of DFT against experimental redox potentials and bond dissociation enthalpies (BDEs) for zirconocene complexes directly relevant to ethylene polymerization catalysis. We also examined the ability of DFT to compute the fourth atomic ionization potential of zirconium and the effect the basis set selection has on the ionization potential computed with CCSD(T). Generally, the atomic ionization potential and redox potentials are very well reproduced by DFT, but we discovered relatively large deviations of DFT-calculated BDEs compared to experiment. However, evaluation of BDEs with CCSD(T) suggests that experimental values should be revisited, and our CCSD(T) values should be taken as most accurate.},

We find that by either modulating the electronic effects of a generic iron-catalyst by a set of ligands, that is, CO, BF, PH3, BN(CH3)2, or by manipulating structural effects through the introduction of bidentate ligands, that is, PH2(CH2)nPH2withn= 6–1, one can significantly decrease the reaction barrier for the CX bond activation. The combination of both tuning handles causes a decrease of the CH activation barrier from 10.4 to 4.6 kcal mol−1. Our activation strain and Kohn-Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal that the electronic tuning works via optimizing the catalyst–substrate interaction by introducing a strong second backdonation interaction (i.e., “ligand-assisted” interaction), while the mechanism for structural tuning is mainly caused by the reduction of the required activation strain because of the pre-distortion of the catalyst. In all, we present design principles for iron-based catalysts that mimic the favorable behavior of their well-known palladium analogs in the bond-activation step of cross-coupling reactions.},

  abstract     = {Traditional π-covalent interactions have been proved in the non-metal halogen bond adducts formed by chloride and halogenated triphenylamine-based radical cations. In this study, we have rationally designed two metal-involving halogen bond adducts with π-covalency property, such as [L1-Pd···I-PTZ]+(i.e., 1) and [L2-Pd···I-PTZ]+(i.e., 2), in which the square-planar palladium complexes serve as halogen bond acceptor and 3,7-diiodo-10H-phenothiazine radical cation (i.e., [I-PTZ]•+) acts as halogen bond donor. Noncovalent interaction analysis and quantum theory of atoms in molecules analysis revealed that there are notable halogen bond interactions along the Pd···I direction without genuine chemical bond formed in both designed adducts. Energy decomposition analysis together with natural orbital for chemical valence calculations were performed to gain insight into their bonding nature, which demonstrated the presence of remarkable π-covalent interactions and σ-covalent interactions in both 1 and 2. We therefore proposed a new strategy for building the metal-involving halogen bonds with π-covalency property, which will help the further development of new types of halogen bonds.},

  abstract     = {To improve the catalytic activity of 3dtransition metal catalysts, redox-active ligands are a promising tool. These ligands influence the oxidation state of the metal center as well as the ground spin-state and make the experimental determination of both properties challenging. Therefore, first-principles calculations, in particular employing density functional theory with a proper choice of exchange-correlation (xc) functional, are crucial. Common xc functionals were tested on a simple class of metal complexes: homoleptic, octahedral tris(diimine) iron(II) complexes. The spin-state energy splittings for most of these complexes showed the expected linear dependence on the amount of exact exchange included in the xc functionals. Even though varying redox-activity affects the electronic structure of the complexes considerably, the sensitivity of the spin-state energetics to the exact exchange admixture is surprisingly small. For iron(II) complexes with highly redox-active ligands and for a broad range of ligands in the reduced tris(diimine) iron(I) complexes, self-consistent field convergence to local minima was observed, which differ from the global minimum in the redox state of the ligand. This may also result in convergence to a molecular structure that corresponds to an energetically higher-lying local minimum. One criterion to detect such behavior is a change in the sign of the slope for the dependence of the spin-state energy splittings on the amount of exact exchange. We discuss possible protocols for dealing with such artifacts in cases in which a large number of calculations makes checking by hand unfeasible.},

  abstract     = {The necessity of the recent incorporation of new external variables in the context of conceptual DFT (CDFT) is discussed based on the ever-increasing portfolio of experimental reaction conditions in the endeavor of experimentalists to synthesize new molecules with unprecedented properties. Electric and magnetic fields (εandB), mechanical forces (F), and confinement are proposed as valuable new variables, extending conventional CDFT and its associated response functions. A finite field approach is used to calculate the evolution of both global and local descriptors in a selected series of atomic and molecular applications, and from it derive new response function involving, with one exception, the first derivative to the field considered. The electric field results, displaying, for example, a case of a field-induced enantioselectivity in the Fukui function, may be instrumental in the recent upsurge of chemistry in oriented external electric fields. The study of atomic electronegativity and hardness in magnetic fields displays a piecewise behavior, associated to configurational jumps upon increasing field strength and reveals an overall compression of their ranges for stronger fields, which may be guiding upon investigating chemistry in extremely high fields like in white dwarfs. The evolution of the electronegativity and hardness of diatomics under mechanical force can elegantly be traced back to differences in their equilibrium distance in the neutral, cationic, and anionic state. The well-known reduction of the polarizability under confinement can be seen as a fore-runner of the increasing hardness of atoms under pressure, presently under investigation. Periodicity showing up in a spontaneous way in the variety of properties is a leitmotiv in this study, as well as the interconnections/analogies between the different response functions.},

Reliable quantum chemical computations were employed to assess the nature, binding strength, and selectivity of ionic, and neutral guests with benzenoid hosts. Optimized complex structures reveal that alkali and ammonium ions are found to be in the hydrophobic cavity, while halide ions are outside, while both complexes elicit substantial binding energy. The origin of the selectivity of host toward the guest has been traced to the interaction and deformation energies, and the nature of associated interactions is quantified using energy decomposition and the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules analyses. While the larger hosts lead to loosely bound complexes, as assessed by the longer intermolecular distances, the binding strengths are proportional to the size of the host systems. The binding of cationic complexes is electrostatic or polarization driven while exchange term dominates the anionic complexes. In contrast, dispersion contribution is a key in neutral complexes and plays a pivotal role in stabilizing the polyatomic complexes.},

The quantum computer excels at treating a moderate number of orbitals within an active space in a fully quantum mechanical manner. We present a quantum phase estimation calculation on F2in a (2,2) active space on Rigetti&#39;s Aspen-11 QPU. While this is a promising start, it also underlines the need for carefully selecting the orbital spaces treated by the quantum computer. In this work, a scheme for selecting such an active space automatically is described and simulated results obtained using both the quantum phase estimation (QPE) and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithms are presented and combined with a subtractive method to enable accurate description of the environment. The active occupied space is selected from orbitals localized on the chemically relevant fragment of the molecule, while the corresponding virtual space is chosen based on the magnitude of interactions with the occupied space calculated from perturbation theory. This protocol is then applied to two chemical systems of pharmaceutical relevance: the enzyme [Fe] hydrogenase and the photosenzitizer temoporfin. While the sizes of the active spaces currently amenable to a quantum computational treatment are not enough to demonstrate quantum advantage, the procedure outlined here is applicable to any active space size, including those that are outside the reach of classical computation.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the SHARK integral generation and digestion engine is described. In essence, SHARK is based on a reformulation of the popular McMurchie/Davidson approach to molecular integrals. This reformulation leads to an efficient algorithm that is driven by BLAS level 3 operations. The algorithm is particularly efficient for high angular momentum basis functions (up toL= 7 is available by default, but the algorithm is programmed for arbitrary angular momenta). SHARK features a significant number of specific programming constructs that are designed to greatly simplify the workflow in quantum chemical program development and avoid undesirable code duplication to the largest possible extent. SHARK can handle segmented, generally and partially generally contracted basis sets. It can be used to generate a host of one- and two-electron integrals over various kernels including, two-, three-, and four-index repulsion integrals, integrals over Gauge Including Atomic Orbitals (GIAOs), relativistic integrals and integrals featuring a finite nucleus model. SHARK provides routines to evaluate Fock like matrices, generate integral transformations and related tasks. SHARK is the essential engine inside the ORCA package that drives essentially all tasks that are related to integrals over basis functions in version ORCA 5.0 and higher. Since the core of SHARK is based on low-level basic linear algebra (BLAS) operations, it is expected to not only perform well on present day but also on future hardware provided that the hardware manufacturer provides a properly optimized BLAS library for matrix and vector operations. Representative timings and comparisons to the Libint library used by ORCA are reported for Intel i9 and Apple M1 max processors.},

Within this formalism, exchange interactions between magnetic centers determine the ground-state multiplicity and energy separation between the ground and excited states. In this contribution, we extract exchange coupling constants (J) for a set of iron (III) binuclear and tetranuclear complexes from all-electron calculations using non-collinear spin-flip time-dependent density functional theory (NC-SF-TDDFT). For 12 binuclear complexes withJ-values ranging from −6 to −132 cm−1, our benchmark calculations using the short-range hybridωPBEh functional and 6-31G(d,p) basis set agree well with the experimentally derived values (mean absolute error of 4.7 cm−1). For the tetranuclear SMMs, the computedJconstants are within 6 cm−1from the experimentally derived values. We explore the range of applicability of the Heisenberg model by analyzing bonding patterns in these Fe(III) complexes using natural orbitals (NO), their occupations, and the number of effectively unpaired electrons. The results illustrate the efficiency of the spin-flip protocol for computing the exchange couplings and the utility of the NO analysis in assessing the validity of effective spin Hamiltonians.},

This DFT study treats tetragonal, trigonal, and digonal lantern-type complexes with the formamidinate, guanidinate, and formate ligands, besides some others. Formal bond orders (ranging from zero to two) are assigned to all the NiNi bonds on the basis of MO occupancy considerations. A VB-based electron counting approach assigns plausible resonance structures to the dinickel cores. Model tetragonal complexes with the dimethylformamidinate and the dithioformate ligands have singlet ground states whose non-covalently bonded NiNi distances are close to those in their experimentally known counterparts. Trigonal dinickel complexes are unknown, but are predicted to have quartet ground states with NiNi bonds of order 0.5. The model digonal complexes are predicted to have triplet ground states, but the predicted NiNi bond lengths are longer than those found in their experimentally known counterparts. This could owe to inadequate treatment of electron correlation by DFT in these short NiNi bonds with their multiconfigurational character. All the NiNi bond distances here are categorized into ranges according to the NiNi bond orders of 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2, no NiNi bonds of order higher than two being identified. The NiNi bonds of given order in these lantern-type complexes are consistently shorter than the corresponding NiNi bonds in dinickel complexes having carbonyl ligands, attributable to the metalmetal bond lengthening effect of CO ligands.},

To facilitate organocatalysis, several new cyclic carbenes are being introduced, four-membered NHCs are of special interest. Whether these NHCs can exhibit catalytic influence or not, can be evaluated by exploring the potential energy surface (PES) of the benzoin condensation reaction. Quantum chemical analysis has been carried out to compare the PES of these four-membered NHCs with that of standard five-membered NHCs to explore their catalytic ability. The barrier for the first step of the reaction for the formation of BI is comparable in all the cases. But the barrier for the second step of the reaction leading to the benzoin formation from BI is estimated to be very high for the four membered NHCs. These results indicate that the probability of identifying and isolating the BI is very high in comparison to the completion of benzoin condensation reaction in the case of the four-membered NHCs.},

Trivalent Ac exhibits the highest affinities toward hard acids (such as charged oxophilic donors, fluoride), so its classification as a hard acid is justified. Natural population analysis quantified the involvement of 5f orbitals on Ac to be about 30\% of total valence electron natural configuration indicating that Ac is a member of the actinide series. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to study the pairwise correlations among the bond lengths, ΔGreaction energies, charges on Ac and donor atoms, and data from EDA-NOCV and QTAIM.

  abstract     = {Copper guanidine-quinoline complexes are an important class of bioinorganic complexes that find utilization in electron and atom transfer processes. By substitution of functional groups on the quinoline moiety the electron transfer abilities of these complexes can be tuned. In order to explore the full substitution space by simulations, the accurate theoretical description of the effect of functional groups is essential. In this study, we compare three different methods for the theoretical description of the structures. We use the semi-empirical tight-binding method GFN2-xTB, the density functional TPSSh and the double-hybrid functional B2PLYP. We evaluate the methods on five different complex pairs (Cu(I) and Cu(II) complexes), and compare how well calculated energies can predict the redox potentials. We find even though B2PLYP and TPSSh yield better accordance with the experimental structures. GFN2-xTB performs surprisingly well in the geometry optimization at a fraction of the computational cost. TPSSh offers a good compromise between computational cost and accuracy of the redox potential for real-life complexes.},

Nonelectrostatic corrections including adjustable parameters are also added. For neutral solutes, ESE-EE yields a mean absolute error (MAE) in ΔGsolv° of 1.5 kcal/mol foraqueoussolutions; 1.0 kcal/mol for nonaqueouspolar proticsolvents; 0.9 kcal/mol forpolar aproticsolvents; and about 0.6 kcal/mol fornonpolarsolvents. Since ESE-EE only requires a molecular geometry as input for a ΔGºsolvprediction, it can be utilized for a rapid screening of ΔGºsolvfor large neutral molecules. However, for ionic solutes, ESE-EE yields larger errors (typically several kcal/mol) and is recommendable for preliminary estimations only. Upon a special refitting, ESE-EE is able to yield partition coefficients with a good accuracy.},

Subsequent vibrational structure calculations based on second-order vibrational perturbation theory, VPT2, and vibrational configuration interaction theory, VCI, were used to determine rotational constants, centrifugal distortion constants, vibrationally averaged geometrical parameters and (an)harmonic vibrational frequencies. The impact of core-correlation effects is discussed in detail. Rovibrational VCI calculations were used to simulate the gas phase spectra of these species and an in-depth analysis of theν7band of aminoborane is provided.

Our group has also introduced electrophilicity based new global and local reactivity descriptors and also new associated electronic structure principles, which are important indicators of structure, stability, bonding, reactivity, interactions, and dynamics in a wide variety of physico-chemical systems and processes. This index along with its local counterpart augmented by the associated electronic structure principles could properly explain molecular vibrations, internal rotations and various types of chemical reactions. The concept of the electrophilicity index has been extended to dynamical processes, excited states, confined environment, spin-dependent and temperature-dependent situations, biological activity, site selectivity, aromaticity, charge removal and acceptance, presence of external perturbation through solvents, external electric and magnetic fields, and so forth. Although electrophilicity and its local variant can adequately interpret the behavior of a wide variety of systems and different physico-chemical processes involving them, their predictive potential remains to be explored. An exhaustive review on all these aspects will set the tone of the future research in that direction.},

A banner example involves phosphorus as it occurs in nature as P4instead of P2, given its weak π-bonds or strong σ-bonds. The P2synthetic value has brought Lewis bases and metal coordination stabilization strategies. Herein, we discuss the unrealized encapsulation alternative using the well-known fullerenes&#39; capability to form endohedral and stabilize otherwise unstable molecules. We chose the most stable fullerene structures from Cn(n = 50, 60, 70, 80) and experimentally relevant from Cn(n = 90 and 100) to computationally study the thermodynamics and the geometrical consequences of encapsulating P2inside the fullerene cages. Given the size differences between P2and P4, we show that the fullerenes C70–C100are suitable cages to side exclude P4and host only one molecule of P2with an intact triple bond. The thermodynamic analysis indicates that the process is favorable, overcoming the dimerization energy. Additionally, we have evaluated the host-guest interaction to explain the origins of their stability using energy decomposition analysis.},

The addition of this contribution to the Hartree-Fock full calculation (FC) energies provides a good estimate of the total energies at Møller–Plesset second-order perturbation theory (MP2)/coupled-cluster method with singles and doubles (CCSD) (T)-level theory using augmented Dunning basis sets. The estimated energies for several test clusters show an excellent agreement with their FC counterparts, with a substantial wall-clock time saving employing off-the-shelf hardware. Furthermore, the complete basis set (CBS) limit for MP2 energy computed using the two-body approach also agrees with its CBS energy with its FC counterpart.},

Our assessment delves into the linear-elastic and finite-strain regimes to understand both polymorphs&#39; structural and mechanical responses to deformation. We find that the in-plane NPR is shown to be only parallel to the bonds in α-BeH2and remains along the uniaxial tensile path. Concomitantly, an out-of-plane transition toward auxetic is also revealed in regions exhibiting conventional Poisson&#39;s ratios, making α-BeH2a bidirectionally auxetic material.

We found that planar hypercoordinate motifs consisting of monocyclic boron rings and metals withσ+πdual aromaticity can be regarded as one promising layer, which can support the suspended X2(X = Zn, Cd, Hg) dimers. By detailed investigations of thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of 60 species, eventually, MB7X2−and MB8X2(X = Zn, Cd; M = Be, Ru, Os; Be works only for Zn-based cases) clusters were verified to be the global-minimum two-layer molecular rotors.

Previous studies on η5coordination of fullerene cage are reported for pseudo fullerenes whereas the present study deals with sandwich complexes of (C60CN)−with Fe(II), Ru(II), Cr(II), Mo(II), and Ni(II) and multi-decker sandwich complexes of CN–fullerides with Fe(II). The structural parameters of these complexes and the corresponding Cp−complexes showed very close resemblance. Analysis of the metal-to-carbon bonding molecular orbitals showed that sandwich complex [Fe(η5-(C60CN)−)2] exhibit bonding features very similar to that of ferrocene. Also, a 6-fold decrease in the band gap energy is observed for [Fe(η5-(C60CN)−)2] compared to ferrocene. The energy of dissociation (ΔE) of the ligand (C60CN)−from [Fe(η5-(C60CN)−)2] is slightly lower than the ΔEof a Cp* ligand from a ferrocene derivative wherein each cyclopentadienyl unit is substituted with four tertiary butyl groups. The (C60CN)−ligand behaved as one of the bulkiest ligands in the chemistry of sandwich complexes. Further, the coordinating ability of the dianion, (C60(CN)2)2−is evaluated which showed strong coordination ability simultaneously with two metal centers leading to the formation of multi-decker sandwich and pearl-necklace type polymeric structures.},

Natural orbital shapes are used to read out the oxidation state (OS) of the f-elements, and the atomic orbital energies and radii are used to explain the trends. The highest OSs reveal a “volcano”-type variation: For An = Ac – Np, the OSs are equal to the number of available valence electrons, that is, AcIII, ThIV, PaV, UVI, and NpVII. Starting with plutonium as the turning point, the highest OSs in the most stable AnO4isomers then decrease as PuV, AmV, and CmIII, indicating that the 5f-electrons are hard to be fully oxidized off from Pu onward. The variations are related to the actinoid contraction and to the 5f-covalency characteristics. Combined with previous work on OSs, we review their general trends throughout the periodic table, providing fundamental understanding of OS-relevant phenomena.},

The Ullmann coupling reaction is the most applied synthetic route today, but the nature of the organometallic intermediate is still under discussion. We investigate the bonding nature of prototypical intermediate species (phenyl, naphthyl, anthracenyl, phenanthryl, and triphenylenyl) on the Cu(111) surface with a combination of plane wave and atomic orbital basis set methods using density functional theory calculations with periodic boundary conditions. The surface bonding is shown to be of covalent nature with a polarized shared-electron bond supported by π-back donation effects using energy decomposition analysis for extended systems (pEDA). The bond angle of the intermediates is determined by balancing dispersion attraction and Pauli repulsion between adsorbate and surface. The latter can be significantly reduced by adatoms on the surface. We furthermore investigate how to choose computational parameters for pEDA of organic adsorbates on metal surfaces efficiently and show that bonding interpretation requires consistent choice of the density functional.},

It is shown that the insulating 2D-BN network possesses a strong localization of electron density on the nitrogen atoms. In turn, for a carbon-containing sheet, we found a highly delocalized electron density and an appreciable overlap of pzorbitals of neighboring C6rings, which might be a reason for the conductive properties of the material.},

The main conclusion is that, regardless of the size of the Be cluster, neither the structure of ammonia nor that of the Be clusters are preserved due to a systematic dissociation of its NH bonds and a spontaneous H-shift toward the available Be atoms. This H migration not only leads to rather stable BeH bonds, but dramatically enhances the strength of the BeN bonds as well. Accordingly, the maximum stability is found for the interaction with the beryllium trimer, leading to a complex with three NBe and three BeH bonds. Another maximum in stability, although lower than that reached forn= 3, is found for the Be heptamer, since fromn= 6, a new NBe bond is formed, so that complexes fromn= 6 ton= 10 are characterized by the formation of a NBe4moiety, whose stability reaches a maximum atn= 7. The bonding characteristics of the different species formed are analyzed by means of AIM, NBO, ELF and AdNDP approaches.},

Theσdonation is relative invariant over the series of dinitrogen complexes and has no significant effect on the NN bond strength, whereas theπbackdonation causes a considerable elongation of the NN bond.

The energy decomposition approach based on the block-localized wavefunction method, which combines the computational efficiency of molecular orbital theory and the chemical intuition of ab initio valence bond theory, was applied to the above anion-π complexes, in order to elucidate the nature and selectivity of these interactions. The overall attraction is mainly governed by the frozen energy component, in which the electrostatic interaction is included. Remarkable binding strengths with F-[n]CPPs can be attributed to the accumulated anion-π interactions between the anion and each conjugated ring on the hoop, while for F-BBs, additional stability results from the curved frameworks, which distribute electron densities unequally on π-faces. Interestingly, the strongest host was proved to be the F-[5]BNNH, which exhibits the most significant anisotropy of the electrostatic potential surface due to the difference in the electronegativities of nitrogen and boron. The selectivity of each host for anions was explored and the importance of the often-overlooked Pauli exchange repulsion was illustrated. Chloride anion turns out to be the most favorable anion for all receptors, due to the smallest ionic radius and the weakest destabilizing Pauli exchange repulsion.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we propose a numerical method to localize many-electron excited states. To characterize the electronic structure of the electronic excited states of a system, quantum chemistry methods typically yield a delocalized description of the excitations. Some a priori localization methods have been developed to provide an intuitive local picture of the excited states. They typically require a good strategy to separate the system of interest from its environment, or a set of a priori localized orbitals, that may reduce their computational accuracy. Here, we introduce an a posteriori method to localize delocalized many-body excited states directly obtained from quantum chemistry calculations. A localization metric for the excited states is defined from their representation as electron–hole pairs, which is encoded in the transition density matrix. This novel a posteriori strategy thus allows to localize excitons within a volume around selected fragments of a complex molecular system without tempering with its quantum chemical treatment. The method is tested onπ-stacked oligomers of phenanthrenes and pyrenes. It is found to efficiently localize and separate the excitons according to their character while preserving the information about delocalized many-body states at a low computational cost.},

The ROET, which is an expansion of the reaction electronic theories (e.g., the frontier orbital theory) in terms of orbital energies, elucidates the reactive orbitals driving reactions and the charge transferability indices of the reactions. Performing the ROET analyses of these reactions shows that the charge transfer directions given in the rule-based diagrams of the electronic theory are reproduced even for the functional groups of charge transfer destinations in all but only two processes for 38 reaction processes. The ROET analyses also make clear the detailed orbital-based pictures of these bond formation reactions: that is, the use of the out-of-plane antibondingπorbitals in acidic conditions (enol-mode) and in-plane antibondingπorbitals in basic conditions (enolate-mode), which explain the experimentally assumed mechanisms such as theπ-bond formations in acidic conditions andσ-bond formations atα-carbons in basic conditions. Furthermore, the ROET analyses explicate that the methyl group initially accepts electrons and then donates them to the bond formations in the target reactions. It is, consequently, suggested that the ROET serves a theoretical foundation for the electronic theory of organic chemistry.},

We show that the network benefits from advanced information by comparing it with several machine learning models and molecular representations. Models included logistic regression, support vector machine, CatBoost, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Molecular representations included extended-connectivity fingerprints, Morgan fingerprints, SMILESVec embeddings, and textual. Classification and regression objectives were assessed for each model and feature set. The goal of each classification model was to separate zero- and non-zero-yielding reactions. The models were trained and evaluated on a proprietary dataset of 10 reaction types. Also, the models were benchmarked on two public single reaction type datasets.

The valence electrons of F are polarized by the majority spin electrons of Mn, and in turn, spin polarize their 1s electrons. When a pseudopotential is used, such a spin polarization of the core functions of Mn and F can obviously not take place. The importance of such a spin polarization can be appreciated by comparing (i) the spin density at the Mn and F nuclear position, and then the Fermi contact constant, a crucial quantity for the hyperfine coupling, and (ii) the ferromagnetic–antiferromagnetic energy difference, when obtained with an all electron or a pseudopotential scheme, and exploring how the latter varies with pressure. This difference is as large as 50\% of the all electron datum, and is mainly due to the rigid treatment of the F ion core. The effect of five different functionals on the core spin polarization is documented.},

Here, a series of [(S3C(0))Fe(II/I/0)-N2]n-complexes in different charged/spin states containing a coordinated σ- and π-donor C(0)-atom which possesses eight outer shell electrons [carbone, (Ph3P)2C(0); Ph3P→C(0)←PPh3] and three S-donor sites (i.e.-S-Ar), have been studied by DFT, QTAIM, and EDA-NOCV calculations. The effect of the weak field ligand on Fe-centres and the subsequent N2-binding has been studied by EDA-NOCV analysis. The role of the oxidation state of Fe and N2-binding in different charged and spin states of the complex have been investigated by EDA-NOCV analyses. The intrinsic interaction energies of the Fe−N2bond are in the range from −42/−35 to −67 kcal/mol in their corresponding ground states. The S3C(0) donor set is argued here to be closer to the actual coordination environment of one of the six Fe-centres of nitrogenase. In comparison, the captivating model complexes reported by Holland et al. and Peter et al. possess a stronger π-acceptor C-ring (S2Cringdonor, π-C donor) and stronger donor set like CP3(σ-C donor) ligands, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Algorithms that automatically explore the chemical space have been limited to chemical systems with a low number of atoms due to expensive involved quantum calculations and the large amount of possible reaction pathways. The method described here presents a novel solution to the problem of chemical exploration by generating reaction networks with heuristics based on chemical theory. First, a second version of the reaction network is determined through molecular graph transformations acting upon functional groups of the reacting. Only transformations that break two chemical bonds and form two new ones are considered, leading to a significant performance enhancement compared to previously presented algorithm. Second, energy barriers for this reaction network are estimated through quantum chemical calculations by a growing string method, which can also identify non-octet species missed during the previous step and further define the reaction network. The proposed algorithm has been successfully applied to five different chemical reactions, in all cases identifying the most important reaction pathways.},

  abstract     = {The hydrogen evolution effect of ZrS2carrier loaded with transition metal single-atom (SA) was explored by first-principles method. ZrS2was constructed with transition metal single-atom and dual-atom. The structure–activity relationship of supported single-atom catalysts was described by electronic properties and hydrogen evolution kinetics. The results show that the ZrS2carrier-loaded atomic-level catalysts are more likely to occur in acidic environments, where the Mo SA load has a higher hydrogen precipitation capacity than the Pt SA. In the case of dual-atom adsorption, most of the hydrogen reduction processes are higher than that of single atom loading, which indicates that the outer orbital hybridization is more likely to lead to the interfacial charge recombination of the catalyst. Thereinto, Ni/Pt @ZrS2has the lowest Gibbs free energy (0.08 eV), and the synergistic effect of transition metals induces the deviation of the center of the d-band from the Fermi level and improves the dissociation ability of H ions. The design provides a new catalytic model for the HER and provides some ideas for understanding the two-site catalysis.},

  abstract     = {A combined method of the Dirac–Hartree–Fock (DHF) method and the reference interaction-site model (RISM) theory is reported; this is the initial implementation of the coupling of the four-component relativistic electronic structure theory and an integral equation theory of molecular liquids. In the method, the DHF and RISM equations are solved self-consistently, and therefore the electronic structure of the solute, including relativistic effects, and the solvation structure are determined simultaneously. The formulation is constructed based on the variational principle with respect to the Helmholtz energy, and analytic free energy gradients are also derived using the variational property. The method is applied to the iodine ion (I−), methyl iodide (CH3I), and hydrogen chalcogenide (H2X, where X = O–Po) in aqueous solutions, and the electronic structures of the solutes, as well as the solvation free energies and their component analysis, solvent distributions, and solute–solvent interactions, are discussed.},
