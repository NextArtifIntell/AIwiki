  abstract     = {We give a review of some recent developments in embeddings of time series and dynamic networks. We start out with traditional principal components and then look at extensions to dynamic factor models for time series. Unlike principal components for time series, the literature on time-varying nonlinear embedding is rather sparse. The most promising approaches in the literature is neural network based, and has recently performed well in forecasting competitions. We also touch on different forms of dynamics in topological data analysis (TDA). The last part of the article deals with embedding of dynamic networks, where we believe there is a gap between available theory and the behavior of most real world networks. We illustrate our review with two simulated examples. Throughout the review, we highlight differences between the static and dynamic case, and point to several open problems in the dynamic case.},

Two major issues involved are to detect the existence of clusters and to determine their number. We propose a new test statistic for detecting whether a data set consists of multiple clusters and a new procedure to determine the number of clusters. The proposed method is based on the jumps, that is, the increments, in the heights of the dendrogram when a hierarchical clustering is applied to the data. We use autoregressive sieve bootstrap to obtain a reference distribution of the test statistics and propose an iterative procedure to find the number of clusters. The clusters found are internally homogeneous according to the test statistics used in the analysis. The performance of the proposed procedure in finite samples is investigated by Monte Carlo simulations and illustrated by some empirical examples. Comparisons with some existing methods for selecting the number of clusters are also investigated.},

However, the validity of employing factor models in a specific application has received less attention. This article proposes test statistics for testing the symmetry in cross-correlation matrices of a high-dimensional stochastic process implied by exact factor models. A rejection of symmetry indicates that the use of an exact factor model is questionable. Both simulations and real examples are used to demonstrate the applications and to study the finite-sample performance of the proposed test statistics. Empirical results show that the proposed test statistics are effective in identifying cases where exact factor models are not appropriate, providing valuable guidance for choosing factor models in a high-dimensional setting.},

Part I establishes a representation result by which, under mild assumptions on the covariance operator of the cross-section, any FTS admits a canonical representation as the sum of a common and an idiosyncratic component; common components are driven by a finite and typically small number of scalar factors loaded via functional loadings, while idiosyncratic components are only mildly cross-correlated. Building on that representation result, Part II is dealing with the identification of the number of factors, their estimation, the estimation of their loadings and the common components, and the resulting forecasts. We provide a family of information criteria for identifying the number of factors, and prove their consistency. We provide average error bounds for the estimators of the factors, loadings, and common components; our results encompass the scalar case, for which they reproduce and extend, under weaker conditions, well-established similar results. Under slightly stronger assumptions, we also provide uniform bounds for the estimators of factors, loadings, and common components, thus extending existing scalar results.

  abstract     = {In many different fields realizations of stationary time series might be recorded at irregular points in time, resulting in observed unevenly spaced samples. These missing observations can happen for several reasons, depending on the mechanisms that record the data or external conditions that force the missing observations. In this article, we first focus on the question if we can estimate the mean of a stationary time series when data are not equally spaced. We show that any unevenly spaced sample can be used to estimate the mean of an underlying stationary linear time series. Specifically, we do not impose any restrictions on sampling structure and times, as long as they are independent of the underlying time series. We provide an expression for the sample mean estimator and we establish its asymptotic properties and the central limit theorem. Subsequently we studentize estimation which allows to build confidence intervals for the mean. Finite sample properties of the estimator for the mean are investigated in a Monte Carlo study which confirms good performance of such estimation procedure.},

We consider a class of time series models consisting in the parametrization of the first two conditional moments which – by contrast with classical location-scale dynamic models – do not impose further constraints on the conditional distribution/moments. Quasi-likelihood estimators (QLE) are obtained by solving estimating equations deduced from those two conditional moments. Conditions ensuring the existence and asymptotic properties (consistency and asymptotic normality) of such estimators are provided. We propose optimal QLEs in Godambe&#39;s sense, deduced from a condition obtained by Chandra and Taniguchi (2001, Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics 53, 125–141). The particular case of the quasi-maximum likelihood estimators is considered. For pure location models, a data-driven procedure for optimally choosing the QLE is proposed.

Specifically, a dissimilarity matrix is formed using the energy distance statistic to measure the separation between the finite-dimensional distributions for the component time series. Once the pairwise dissimilarity matrix is calculated, a hierarchical clustering method is then applied to obtain the dendrogram. This procedure is completely nonparametric as the dissimilarities between stationary distributions are directly calculated without making any model assumptions. In order to justify this procedure, asymptotic properties of the energy distance estimates are derived for general stationary and ergodic time series. The method is illustrated in a simulation study for various component time series that are either linear or nonlinear. Finally, the methodology is applied to two examples; one involves the GDP of selected countries and the other is the population size of various states in the U.S.A. in the years 1900–1999.},

In particular, our underlying process is defined as the product of a (0,1)-valued independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sequence and the inverted conditional mean, which, in turn, depends on past reciprocal observations in such a way that is larger than unity. The probability structure of the model is studied in the context of the stochastic recurrence equation theory, while estimation of the model parameters is performed with the exponential quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (EQMLE). The consistency and asymptotic normality of the EQMLE are both established under general regularity assumptions. Finally, the usefulness of our proposed model is illustrated with two real datasets.},

We develop an asymptotic pointwise test of predictive ability using the critical values of a Normal distribution, and a uniform test with asymptotic distribution that is approximated using a p -value transformation and Wild bootstrap methods. These theoretical insights are illustrated in an extensive simulation exercise and also in an empirical application to forecasting high-frequency based realized volatility measures.

Estimating the variance function normally proceeds in two steps: estimating the conditional mean model, then using the residuals to estimate the variance function. In this article, a non-parametric approach is proposed to estimate the complicated parametric conditional mean model in the first step. The approach turns out to provide a convenient solution to the problem and achieve robustness to any structural break features in the conditional mean model without the need of estimating them parametrically. In the second step, kernel-smoothed squares of the truncated first-step residuals are shown to consistently estimate the variance function. In Monte Carlo simulations, we show that our proposed method performs very well in the presence of explosive and stationary collapse segments compared with the popular rolling standard deviation estimator that is commonly used in economics and finance. As an empirical illustration of our new approach, we apply the volatility estimator to recent Bitcoin data.},

  abstract     = {A new robust stochastic volatility (SV) model having Student- t marginals is proposed. Our process is defined through a linear normal regression model driven by a latent gamma process that controls temporal dependence. This gamma process is strategically chosen to enable us to find an explicit expression for the pairwise joint density function of the Student- t response process. With this at hand, we propose a composite likelihood (CL) based inference for our model, which can be straightforwardly implemented with a low computational cost. This is a remarkable feature of our Student- t process over existing SV models in the literature that involve computationally heavy algorithms for estimating parameters. Aiming at a precise estimation of the parameters related to the latent process, we propose a CL expectation–maximization algorithm and discuss a bootstrap approach to obtain standard errors. The finite-sample performance of our CL methods is assessed through Monte Carlo simulations. The methodology is motivated by an empirical application in the financial market. We analyze the relationship, across multiple time periods, between various US sector Exchange-Traded Funds returns and individual companies&#39; stock price returns based on our novel Student- t model. This relationship is further utilized in selecting optimal financial portfolios. Generalizations of the Student- t SV model are also proposed.},

  abstract     = {Count time series are widely encountered in practice. As with continuous valued data, many count series have seasonal properties. This article uses a recent advance in stationary count time series to develop a general seasonal count time series modeling paradigm. The model constructed here permits any marginal distribution for the series and the most flexible autocorrelations possible, including those with negative dependence. Likelihood methods of inference are explored. The article first develops the modeling methods, which entail a discrete transformation of a Gaussian process having seasonal dynamics. Properties of this model class are then established and particle filtering likelihood methods of parameter estimation are developed. A simulation study demonstrating the efficacy of the methods is presented and an application to the number of rainy days in successive weeks in Seattle, Washington is given.},

  abstract     = {Herein, we propose a novel non-parametric frequency Granger causality test. We apply a filtering process in the time domain to remove possible spurious causality, thereby eliminating potential interference. Thereafter, in the frequency domain, we perform a local kernel regression for each frequency and test the non-causality hypothesis from the distance between each estimate to zero. We provide asymptotic results for strict stationary series concerning α -mixing conditions. Our method can also perform group causality tests, a feature that is absent in most alternative methods. Monte Carlo experiments illustrate that our method is comparable, and in some cases, performs better than alternative methods in the literature. Finally, we test the causality between monetary policy variables and stock prices.},

  abstract     = {By locating the running maxima and minima of a time series, and measuring the current deviation from them, it is possible to generate processes that are relevant for the analysis of the business cycle and for characterizing bull and bear phases in financial markets. First, the measurement of the time distance from the running peak originates a first-order Markov chain, whose characteristics can be used for testing time-reversibility of economic dynamics and specific types of asymmetries in financial markets. Second, the gap processes can be combined to provide a non-parametric measure of the growth cycle. The article derives the time series properties of the gap process and other related processes that arise from the same measurement context, and proposes new non-parametric tests of time-reversibility and new measures of the output gap.},

  abstract     = {The Wiener–Hopf equations are a Toeplitz system of linear equations that naturally arise in several applications in time series. These include the update and prediction step of the stationary Kalman filter equations and the prediction of bivariate time series. The celebrated Wiener–Hopf technique is usually used for solving these equations and is based on a comparison of coefficients in a Fourier series expansion. However, a statistical interpretation of both the method and solution is opaque. The purpose of this note is to revisit the (discrete) Wiener–Hopf equations and obtain an alternative solution that is more aligned with classical techniques in time series analysis. Specifically, we propose a solution to the Wiener–Hopf equations that combines linear prediction with deconvolution. The Wiener–Hopf solution requires the spectral factorization of the underlying spectral density function. For ease of evaluation it is often assumed that the spectral density is rational. This allows one to obtain a computationally tractable solution. However, this leads to an approximation error when the underlying spectral density is not a rational function. We use the proposed solution with Baxter&#39;s inequality to derive an error bound for the rational spectral density approximation.},

Specifying the MSV model as a multivariate state-space model, we carry out a two-step penalized procedure. We provide the asymptotic properties of the two-step estimator and the oracle property of the first-step estimator when the number of parameters diverges. The performances of our method are illustrated through simulations and financial data. Supplementary Material presenting technical proofs is available online.},
