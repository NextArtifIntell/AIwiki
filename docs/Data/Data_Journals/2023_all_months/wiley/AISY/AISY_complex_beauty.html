However, the current demonstrated applications of DONNs are largely image classification tasks, which undermine the prospect of developing and utilizing such hardware for other ML applications. Herein, the deployment of an all-optical reconfigurable DONNs system for scientific computing is demonstrated numerically and experimentally, including guiding two-dimensional quantum material synthesis, predicting the properties of two-dimensional quantum materials and small molecular cancer drugs, predicting the device response of nanopatterned integrated photonic power splitters, and the dynamic stabilization of an inverted pendulum with reinforcement learning. Despite a large variety of input data structures, a universal feature engineering approach is developed to convert categorical input features to images that can be processed in the DONNs system. The results open up new opportunities for employing DONNs systems for a broad range of ML applications.},

In this study, using convolutional neural networks and Siamese neural networks as classifiers and comparators, the performance plunge is revealed and thus considerable dissimilarity between the signatures on different media is implied. To further explore this, cubic Bézier curves are fitted to the signatures using the least square method for quantitative statistical analysis. By analyzing the visual changes in the morphology of strokes, several features of signatures are selected and computed, and the paired t -test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test are implemented, which provides a deeper substantiation and explanation of the findings.},

Genotype matrix based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is often used in ML for genome-to-phenotype prediction. Genotype matrix has an inherent defect, as the feature spaces it generates across different individuals or groups are inconsistent, and this hinders the application of ML. To overcome the challenge, a genome descriptor, Genic SNPs Composition Tool (GSCtool) is developed, which counts the number of SNPs in each gene of the genome so the dimension of the feature vectors equals the number of annotated genes in a species. Compared to using the genotype matrix, using GSCtool significantly decreases the model training time and has a higher accuracy of phenotype prediction. GSCtool also achieves good performance in variety identification, which is useful in crop variety protection. In general, GSCtool will help facilitate the application and study of genomic ML.

However, redeployment to new purposes requires substantial resources, from redesign to revalidation. Despite most pneumatic artificial muscles surpassing the power and contraction performance of natural muscles, natural muscles largely remain unmatched in terms of their versatility and complex performance. This is likely due to artificial muscle&#39;s low effective strain and high radial expansion, limiting parallel operating efficiencies. To address these challenges, a class of compact versatile pneumatic actuators, called multilayer artificial muscle (MAM), that are capable of deployment to different applications through configurable modularity, is presented. The MAMs are biomimetically inspired by the sarcomere, the building block for natural muscle architecture. Similarly, MAM can extend and contract as well as be rearranged to mimic muscle-like actions and functions, such as a caterpillar locomotion robot and an entire robotic arm. The MAMs are fabricated through multilayer, multimaterial, low-cost additive manufacturing, which offers certain advantages such as higher extension, contraction force, and durability. MAMs have the potential to provide a crucial fundamental building block toward future versatile reconfigurable architecture.},

Herein, a roll-to-roll (R2R) gravure, a typical high-throughput additive manufacturing method, is explored to print WeHLs where six diodes and six capacitors are integrated. To meet the high-throughput manufacturing speed (90 mm s −1 ) of the R2R gravure system, six different electronic inks are formulated to print the WeHLs to harvest ±10 V from the smartphone&#39;s NFC carrier. To attain a practical device yield under the given printing speed, the web tension, nip force, doctor blade angle, and overlay printing registration accuracy are well controlled and optimized to print six different layers within a high overlay printing accuracy, while printing patterns to connect two electrodes with a height difference greater than 3 μm. The fully R2R-printed WeHLs can successfully harvest energy from the smartphone&#39;s NFC carrier with the conversion efficiency of 50%.},

  abstract     = {Herein, the impact of cross-temperature on 3D NAND flash memory is modeled by considering adjacent cells using machine learning. The cells comprising NAND flash memory exhibit diverse states and connectivity patterns. To effectively capture this complexity, the 3D NAND flash is converted to graph structure and the graph neural network (GNN) is leveraged, known for its exceptional performance in handling graph data. To the best of the authors&#39; knowledge, this is the first attempt to model 3D NAND flash memory using GNN. This method has good generalization performance across various retention times and temperatures, achieving a remarkable overlap of 95.28% between ground truth and predicted distributions. Moreover, two applications of this method are introduced that contribute to the NAND flash memory improvement. One is a GNN-assist program, which leverages well-trained GNN to suppress the degradation affected by cross-temperature, resulting in reduced shift and narrower distribution width. The other is the sensitivity decomposition to identify parameters influencing the cell at cross-temperature. It is found that cross-temperature impact extends beyond physically connected cells to adjacent cells at close distances. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into modeling 3D NAND flash memory using GNNs and offers practical methods for enhancing NAND flash memory reliability.},

  abstract     = {Glioblastoma tumor recurrences often occur in brain tissue areas harboring infiltrating tumor cells, resembling healthy tissue in brain imaging. Demarcating infiltrative regions for aggressive resections is critical for improving prognostic outcomes but is challenging in neurosurgery. Herein, a multilayer sigmoid-activated convolutional neural network (MLS-CNN) is developed for rapidly distinguishing glioma tumor infiltration in brain tissue histology. Unlike conventional multiclass classifiers, the MLS-CNN employs sigmoidal activation to accommodate coexisting classes within patch images. 59 811 image patches (25 807 infiltrating edge, 15 178 normal brain, 18 826 cellular tumor) from 73 brain tissue samples are extracted to train the classifier. The model achieves an accuracy of 91.70% (sensitivity: 91.62%; specificity: 91.78%) and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.964 in distinguishing infiltrating edges, outperforming the current state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) (accuracy: 89.45; AUC: 0.947). The MLS-CNN is computationally efficient, generating predictions within 11.5 s in comparison to 81.4 s for ViT. The predictions strongly correlate with In Situ Hybridization expression intensities, validating the utility of the MLS-CNN model in spatial genomics investigations in gliomas. The robust model can therefore serve as an automatic and accurate classifier to help pathologists identify infiltrative glioma for better diagnosis and patient outcomes in brain oncology.},

  abstract     = {The robotics field has witnessed a rapid increase in the popularity of soft pneumatic robots due to their adaptability to unstructured environments and safe human–robot interaction. However, many of them are still controlled by rigid solenoid valves and microcontrollers. Recent research works have introduced various electronics-free computational devices for soft robotic applications. Yet, connecting these individual components into pneumatic circuits still remains challenging. The manual circuit design, fabrication, and piping process can bring inefficient circuit layout, redundant tubing, unreliable fittings, and potentially human mistakes. This work presents an open-source toolbox for automatically designing pneumatic circuits for soft robotic applications. The toolbox takes the desired computation function along with some space constraints as inputs, and generates a 3D-printable file of a pneumatic circuit that can be fabricated and used directly. This is achieved by efficiently positioning the logic gates and air channels while considering the workspace constraints, fabrication limits, material cost, and system complexity. The versatility of the design automation algorithm has been tested with two different truth tables and six different workspaces. The work also showcases utilizing the toolbox to design a computational circuit that governs the movements of a soft robotic hand with four pneumatic actuators.},

  abstract     = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) become popular choices for processing spatiotemporal input data and enabling low-power event-driven spike computation on neuromorphic processors. However, direct SNN training algorithms are not well compatible with error back-propagation process, while indirect conversion algorithms based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) are usually accuracy–lossy due to various approximation errors. Both of them suffer from lower accuracies compared with their reference ANNs and need lots of time steps to achieve stable performance in deep architectures. In this article, a novel conversion framework is presented for deep SNNs with negative-spike dynamics, which takes a quantization constraint and spike compensation technique into consideration during ANN-to-SNN conversion, and a truly lossless accuracy performance with their ANN counterparts is obtained. The converted SNNs can retain full advantages of simple leaky-integrate-and-fire spiking neurons and are very suited for hardware implementation. In the experimental results, it is shown that converted spiking LeNet on MNIST/FashionMNIST and VGG-Net on CIFAR-10 dataset yield the state-of-the-art classification accuracies with quite shortened computing time steps and much fewer synaptic operations.},

  abstract     = {Untethered microrobotic grasping has enabled the precise manipulation of small components in difficult-to-reach environments. However, the fabrication of deformable grasping robots at small scales requires advanced materials and fabrication technologies. Alternatively, multiple microrobots can be used to surround and grasp objects. By collaborating, microrobots can perform complex tasks that they would not be capable of executing individually. The complexity of controlling multiple untethered microrobots has limited the applications of collaborative microrobots to two-dimensional operations. To fill this gap, this work proposes a collaborative microrobotic system for three-dimensional grasping operations. The system is based on the control of two magnetic agents and the exploitation of the magnetic interactions between them to grasp, manipulate, and assemble passive components. A custom-made closed-loop controller is developed to automatically stabilize the system, achieving pose control of a grasped passive component (of 2 mm in size) with a precision of 300 μm in position and 10° in orientation. The main advantage of the proposed system is its capability to reconfigure the magnetic agents for other operations, as demonstrated by the assembly of a microgear and subsequent reconfiguration to power the assembled mechanism.},

  abstract     = {To increase the reliability of the printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing process, automated optical inspection is often employed for soldering defect detection. However, traditional approaches built on handcrafted features, predefined rules, or thresholds are often susceptible to the variation of the acquired images’ quality and give unstable performances. To solve this problem, a deep learning-based soldering defect detection method is developed in this article. Like many real-life deep learning applications, the number of available training samples is often limited. This creates a challenging low-data scenario, as deep learning typically requires massive data to perform well. To address this issue, a multitask learning model is proposed, namely, PCBMTL, that can simultaneously learn the classification and segmentation tasks under low-data regimes. By acquiring the segmentation knowledge, classification performance is substantially improved with few samples. To facilitate the study, a soldering defect image dataset, namely, PCBSPDefect, is built. It focuses on the dual in-line packages (DIP) at the PCB back side, DIP at the PCB front side, and flat flexible cables. Experimental results show that the proposed PCBMTL outperforms the best existing approaches by over 5–17% of average accuracy for different datasets.},

  abstract     = {Numerous proposals and recommendations have been made in the development of underwater undulation robots, but very few studies have focused on the undulation characteristics of undulation robots. The undulating mode of the clearnose skate utilizing the activation of the pectoral fins in undulatory bursts is particularly suitable for slow and efficient swimming. Inspired by the working principle of the clearnose skate , herein, an undulation robotic structure is presented. Considering the hydrodynamic skeleton and propulsion mechanism of the clearnose skate , the solution is based on a piezoelectric composite for realizing undulatory propulsion. This approach leverages the converse piezoelectric effect and modal coupling to produce the desired undulating motion, thereby achieving the undulation design of the robot. The proposed robotic structure can realize the propulsion mode using piezoelectric composites to undulate in the same direction and can use the clockwise or counterclockwise undulation of piezoelectric composites to achieve the steering mode. In addition, finite element analysis is employed as an approach to investigate the undulation characteristics and transient vibration characteristics of the robot. The operational efficiency of the robotic structure is assessed through experiments. The results show that the propulsion mode achieves the speed of 3.33 body-length s −1 . The steering mode exhibits the steering velocities of 17.4 deg s −1 .},

Physical reservoirs have been realized using spintronic oscillators, atomic switch networks, volatile memristors, etc. However, these devices are intrinsically energy-dissipative due to their resistive nature, increasing their power consumption. Therefore, memcapacitive devices can provide a more energy-efficient approach. Herein, volatile biomembrane-based memcapacitors are leveraged as reservoirs to solve classification tasks and process time series in simulation and experimentally. This system achieves a 99.6% accuracy for spoken-digit classification and a normalized mean square error of in a second-order nonlinear regression task. Furthermore, to showcase the device&#39;s real-time temporal data processing capability, a 100% accuracy for an epilepsy detection problem is achieved. Most importantly, it is demonstrated that each memcapacitor consumes an average of 41.5 fJ of energy per spike, regardless of the selected input voltage pulse width, while maintaining an average power of 415 fW for a pulse width of 100 ms, orders of magnitude lower than those achieved by state-of-the-art devices. Lastly, it is believed that the biocompatible, soft nature of our memcapacitor renders it highly suitable for computing applications in biological environments.},

This approach performs poorly during buckling and when material properties change with time, and is untenable for shape-changing robots that don&#39;t have a well-defined resting (unactuated) shape. Herein, these limitations are overcome using stretchable shape sensing (S3) sheets that fuse orientation measurements to estimate 3D surface contours without making assumptions about the underlying robot geometry or material properties. The S3 sheets can estimate the shape of target objects to an accuracy of ≈3 mm for an 80 mm long sheet. The authors show the S3 sheets estimating their shape while being deformed in 3D space and also attached to the surface of a silicone three-chamber pneumatic bladder, highlighting the potential for shape-sensing sheets to be applied, removed, and reapplied to soft robots for shape estimation. Finally, the S3 sheets detecting their own stretch up to 30% strain is demonstrated. The approach introduced herein provides a generalized method for measuring the shape of objects without making strong assumptions about the objects, thus achieving a modular, mechanics model-free approach to proprioception for wearable electronics and soft robotics.},

  abstract     = {Microbiome has emerged as a promising indicator or predictor of human diseases. However, previous studies have typically labeled each specimen as either healthy or with a specific disease, ignoring prevalence of complications or comorbidities in actual cohorts, which may confound the microbial–disease associations. For instance, a patient may suffer from multiple diseases, making it challenging to detect their health status accurately. Furthermore, host phenotypes like physiological characteristics and lifestyles can alter microbiome structure, but such information has not yet been fully utilized in data models. To address these issues, a highly explainable deep learning (DL) method called Meta-Spec is proposed. Using a deep neural network (DNN)-based approach, it encodes and embeds refined host variables with microbiome features, enabling the detection of multiple diseases simultaneously. Experiments show that Meta-Spec outperforms regular machine learning (ML) strategies for multilabel disease screening in several cohorts. More importantly, Meta-Spec successfully detects comorbidities that are often missed by other approaches. In addition, for its high interpretability, Meta-Spec captures key factors that shape disease patterns from host variables and microbes. Hence, these efforts improve the feasibility and sensitivity of microbiome-based disease screening in practical scenarios, representing a significant step toward personalized medicine and better health outcomes.},

Previously the authors have shown that planar rotating magnetic fields assemble μm-scale superparamagnetic beads into circular μbots that roll along surfaces. In this, gravity is required to pull μbots near the surface; however, this is not necessarily practical in complex geometries. Here, the authors show that rotating magnetic fields, in tandem with directional magnetic gradient forces, can be used to roll μbots on surfaces regardless of orientation. Simplifying implementation, a spinning permanent magnet is used to generate differing ratios of rotating and gradient fields, optimizing control for different environments. This use of a single magnetic actuator sidesteps the need for complex electromagnet or tandem field setups, removes requisite gravitational load forces, and enables μbot targeting in complex 3D biomimetic microenvironments.},

Moreover, the inspected area is very small. Herein, a simple, inexpensive, and ultrasensitive NDT method for identifying and classifying the geometries of subsurface defects using commercial cameras, digital image correlation software, and object detection (OD) algorithms is developed. Three OD algorithms—Faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN), Mask R-CNN, and you-only-look-once (YOLO)v3—are evaluated for their ability to locate defects and identify defect geometries. Specifically, bounding boxes of two sizes (large and small) are applied to the regions of defect-induced perturbations in strain tensors, which serve as virtual representatives of invisible subsurface defects. The performance of the proposed approach is validated on test datasets of known and unknown defect types. The experimental results confirm that the proposed approach can effectively utilize the surface deformation field information to accurately and reliably locate and identify subsurface defects. The method is nondestructive and low cost, enables real-time detection, is robust against noise-dominated deformation fields, and can be applied to various structural deformations. The method is therefore suitable for multiscale structural health monitoring and characterization of internal defects in materials.},

  abstract     = {Analog compute-in-memory (CIM) systems are promising candidates for deep neural network (DNN) inference acceleration. However, as the use of DNNs expands, protecting user input privacy has become increasingly important. Herein, a potential security vulnerability is identified wherein an adversary can reconstruct the user&#39;s private input data from a power side-channel attack even without knowledge of the stored DNN model. An attack approach using a generative adversarial network is developed to achieve high-quality data reconstruction from power leakage measurements. The analyses show that the attack methodology is effective in reconstructing user input data from power leakage of the analog CIM accelerator, even at large noise levels and after countermeasures. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, an example of CIM inference of U-Net for brain tumor detection is attacked, and the original magnetic resonance imaging medical images can be successfully reconstructed even at a noise level of 20% standard deviation of the maximum power signal value. This study highlights a potential security vulnerability in emerging analog CIM accelerators and raises awareness of needed safety features to protect user privacy in such systems.},

  abstract     = {Three dimensional (3D) robot measurement systems, with binocular planar structured light cameras (3D cameras) installed at the terminal flange of robots, are widely used to measure complete workpieces by stitching point clouds obtained from various sampled poses. To ensure accurate stitching, hand–eye calibration is necessary. However, 3D cameras often demonstrate low precision in measuring jumping edges and vertices, resulting in challenges when selecting appropriate calibrators and calibration methods for hand–eye calibration. We propose a simple and high-precision hand–eye calibration method for 3D robot measurement systems. Initially, a single sphere is utilized as the calibrator, and its poses are observed using specific robotic motions. Subsequently, the hand–eye calibration problem is formulated as a well-known equation, relying solely on the high-precision relative pose of the robot. Finally, a novel simultaneous solution for and the corresponding closed-form initial solution are introduced. Simulations and experiments confirm that the proposed method exhibits high noise resistance and achieves high-precision calibration, even with a limited calibration data quantity. Compared with traditional methods, the fitting error of the proposed method can be reduced from over 0.9 mm to less than 0.6 mm.},

  abstract     = {Deep-sea exploration remains a challenging task as the extreme hydrostatic pressure environment, darkness, and suspended sediment launch severely hinder the capability of deep-sea vehicles. As a complement to underwater camera, tactile perception becomes especially important in situations where machine vision is limited. However, tactile sensors utilized in deep sea, which should be able to detect pressure changes of only hundreds of pascals under high hydrostatic pressure, are still lacking. To tackle the challenge imposed by hydrostatic pressure, a simulated deep-sea environment flexible sensor (SDEFS) is proposed, consisting of a force sensor array and a bending sensor based on hydrogels for tactile sensing in 50 MPa hydrostatic pressure environments. The force sensor is unaffected by the hydrostatic pressure and achieves high sensitivity of 82.62 N −1 under 100 MPa hydrostatic pressure. The SDEFS is utilized to classify objects based on the difference in hardness. It can accurately classify seven objects on the ground, and three objects in an underwater environment with hydrostatic pressure of 50 MPa, with total recognition accuracies of 98.3% and 96%, respectively. With high force measurement sensitivity and accurate recognition ability under water, the SDEFS is expected to provide very valuable haptic sensing and feedback in deep-sea exploration.},

  abstract     = {Pneumatic soft actuators possess relatively fast response, inherent high flexibility, and achieve extraordinary shape morphing under large deformations. Conventionally, the entire body of soft pneumatic robots needs to be designed for specific applications. Herein, a soft pneumatic actuator design with structured fabrics as actuator skins, which has high bending stiffness variation that can accomplish multiple tasks and different deformation modes in a single body, is proposed. By adjusting the structured skin, the developed soft actuator can be tailored to achieve various deformations. It is experimentally shown that the bending stiffness of the actuator can be adjusted from 108 to 5654 N m −1 . The blocking force of the actuator in bending is comparable with that of conventional fabric-reinforced pneumatic actuators, while the actuator skins are reusable and programmable. In application, the actuators are used to construct a bionic soft gripper with multiple degrees of freedom. By switching between three grasping modes, the gripper successfully fulfills a series of tasks including lifting weights up to 1 kg and grasping objects ranging from a grain of grape to a large iron basin. This work opens up an avenue for designing structured skins for pneumatic robots with programmable deformation modes and versatile functions.},

However, commonly used tumor markers lack sensitivity and specificity for screening purposes. Herein, 10 diagnostic models for 10 common types of cancer are developed by extreme gradient boosting, incorporating 66 laboratory parameters. The datasets consist of a retrospective cohort of 737 503 training and 184 012 validation cases, and a prospective cohort of 174 894 cases for model testing. The areas under the curve of the 10 diagnostic models range from 0.763 to 0.993. Notably, the different models have varying numbers of identical parameters among the 66 test features. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanation analysis reveals that 54 nontumor markers contributed significantly to the models. Cosine similarity analysis and clustering analysis demonstrate that some of the 10 cancers share common pathophysiological characteristics. Feature-based inference graph models are thus performed and infer relationships between nontumor index parameters and cancers with strong correlations. In conclusion, a machine learning-based pan-cancer early warning system has been established in this study, which can guide doctors in selecting more accurate testing indicators and assessing the risk of 10 types of cancer with greater precision.},

However, such an approach cannot provide specific instructions or facilitate immediate feedback for improvement of the shooting motion. In this article, a method is presented to quantitatively evaluate four key action indicators of shooting basketballs using a machine-learning model based on Bayesian optimization of a light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM). Important motion data for the model are collected by micro-inertial measurement units embedded in a wrist motion sensor and an internet of things (IoT) smart basketball. Basketball shooting motion data are collected from 16 subjects and used for model training and data testing, and four important action indicators that influence the shot quality are selected for quantitative assessment. The LightGBM model is then developed for the regression prediction of the four action indicators of shooting. In the results, it is indicated that for an individual player, the highest correlation scores of the four indexes range from 97.6% to 99.3%. The proposed approach for quantitatively assessing shooting indexes can provide objective and data-based guidance to improve players’ shooting performance. Foreseeably, the prediction model can be embedded into a chip of a wearable device to evaluate the real-time shot quality quantitatively.},

  abstract     = {Optical neural networks (ONNs) hold great potential for faster and more energy-efficient information processing in coherent photonic circuits. To realize ONNs, linear combinations and nonlinear activation functions have to be implemented in an optical fashion. Optical nonlinearities are, however, still difficult to achieve, and existing designs are usually too inflexible to offer different activation functions as used in artificial neural networks. Herein, the nonlinear properties of the large and highly adaptive class of photoswitchable chemical compounds is made accessible as activation functions in ONNs by employing photo-induced isomerization in azobenzenes to steer activation behavior through nonlinear modulation of an information-carrying optical signal. The strength of the nonlinearity can be controlled by the chemical concentration while a physically motivated model describes the experimental data for systematically varied photoswitching parameters, resulting in a tunable yet interpretable activation function. Employing such an activation function in a neural network then allows to gauge its strength and perform established classification tasks. The work combines recent advances with photoswitchable chemical compounds and optical neural networks to enable control over the design of nonlinear activation functions, thus opening exciting perspectives for explaining the emergence of intelligent behavior in neural networks.},

The subject computing system achieves excellent performance when used for hand-written digit recognition, second-order nonlinear dynamical tasks, and nonlinear autoregressive moving average (NARMA).

Soft universal grippers take full advantage of this adaptability, facilitating effective and safe grasping of various objects. However, due to their predominantly soft material composition, these grippers have limited lifetimes, especially when operating in unstructured and unfamiliar environments. The self-healing universal gripper (SHUG) is proposed, which can grasp various objects and recover from substantial realistic damages autonomously. It integrates damage detection, heat-assisted healing, and healing evaluation. Notably, unlike other universal grippers, the entire SHUG can be fully reprocessed and recycled. The gripper&#39;s functionality relies on the particle jamming of steel balls enclosed within a self-healing membrane. Thanks to the thermoreversible covalent Diels–Alder bonds in self-healing polymer membrane, the gripper is able to recover from macroscopic damages including scratches and punctures. Temperature-assisted healing is regulated in a closed-loop manner using an embedded thermocouple and Joule heater. Experimental validation demonstrates the adaptability, resilience, and recyclability of the SHUG.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer great potential in various fields like superconductivity, quantum systems, and topological materials. However, designing them systematically remains challenging due to the limited pool of fewer than 100 experimentally synthesized 2D materials. Recent advancements in deep learning, data mining, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations have paved the way for exploring new 2D material candidates. Herein, a generative material design pipeline known as the material transformer generator (MTG) is proposed. MTG leverages two distinct 2D material composition generators, both trained using self-learning neural language models rooted in transformers, with and without transfer learning. These models generate numerous potential 2D compositions, which are plugged into established templates for known 2D materials to predict their crystal structures. To ensure stability, DFT computations assess their thermodynamic stability based on energy-above-hull and formation energy metrics. MTG has found four new DFT-validated stable 2D materials: NiCl 4 , IrSBr, CuBr 3 , and CoBrCl, all with zero energy-above-hull values that indicate thermodynamic stability. Additionally, GaBrO and NbBrCl 3 are found with energy-above-hull values below 0.05 eV. CuBr 3 and GaBrO exhibit dynamic stability, confirmed by phonon dispersion analysis. In summary, the MTG pipeline shows significant potential for discovering new 2D and functional materials.},

  abstract     = {A ferroelectric thin-film transistor (FeTFT)-based synaptic device with an indium–gallium–zinc oxide (IGZO) channel and a metal–ferroelectric–metal–insulator–semiconductor (MFMIS) structure is reported. The fabricated FeTFT exhibits a highly linear conductance response (| α | = 0.21) with a large dynamic range ( G max / G min ≈ 53.2), although identical program pulses are applied to the device. In addition, because the inner metal layer of the FeTFTs has an MFMIS structure, the electric field is uniformly applied to the entire IGZO channel, which reduces the cycle-to-cycle variation ( σ = 0.47%) in the conductance responses. In the system simulation with the measured synaptic characteristics, the high classification accuracy of ≈97.0% is achieved in the MNIST image set, verifying the feasibility of FeTFT-based neuromorphic systems.},

  abstract     = {Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) facilitate communication between the brain and external devices, providing an alternative solution for individuals with upper limb disabilities. The decoding of brain movement commands in BCIs relies on signal feature extraction and classification. Herein, the BNCI Horizon 2020 dataset is employed, which consists of electroencephalographic signals from ten participants with subacute and chronic cervical spinal cord injuries. These participants perform or attempt five distinct types of arm and hand movements. To extract signal features, a novel technique is introduced that estimates movement-related cortical potentials and incorporates them into the processing pipeline. Moreover, a time-frequency domain representation of the dataset is used as input for the classifier. Given the promising outcomes demonstrated by deep learning models in BCI classification, a pretrained ConvNet AlexNet is adopted to decode the motor tasks. The proposed method exhibits a remarkable average accuracy of 76.0% across all five categories, representing a significant advancement over existing state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of the convolutional layers in the model is conducted to gain comprehensive insights into the classification process. By examining the ConvNet filters and activations, the method contributes to a deeper understanding of the electrophysiology that underlies attempted movement.},

  abstract     = {In wearable robotics, soft actuation principles have been increasingly explored and tested due to their safety and comfort in human–robot interactions. Herein, a braided flat-tube artificial muscle (BFAM) is presented. BFAMs are fabricated by braiding cotton threads together with an inexpensive lay-flat tube (LFT) in a specific conform-to-LFT weaving method. They generate uniaxial contractions when powered by compressed fluids. The basic structure and working mechanism of the proposed BFAM are explained, and a quasistatic model is also developed. A comparison with other fluidic driven soft actuators is made and tabulated. Based on experimental studies, the proposed BFAM can contract close to 30% and yield force outputs more than 150 times their weight at an air pressure of 0.12 MPa. BFAM can be braided with multiple layers of flat tube without large increase of size. Experimental studies have shown that more layers of flat tube give a larger strain and output force up to four layers, beyond which layer increase does not yield visible improvement in strain and output force. Finally, potential applications of BFAM to arm joint actuations are illustrated to show its easy fitting to wearable robotics.},

Moreover, the effects of wing morphing on the centroid, inertia matrix, and aerodynamic characteristics of the drone are explored herein, and a nonlinear dynamic model is established. Furthermore, a novel cooperative strategy that combines wing morphing with aileron deflection for roll control is introduced, and a flight controller based on this cooperative strategy is developed. Finally, the superiority of the cooperative strategy and the accuracy of the dynamic modeling have been validated in the outdoor flights of the morphing wing drone.},

This study investigates the robustness of fully connected, convolutional, residual, and spike-timing-dependent plasticity-based SNNs against hardware nonidealities using the MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets. In response to these challenges, a novel hybrid residual SNN (HRSNN) is proposed that incorporates a new neuron circuit and a weight-dependent loss function. The HRSNN in a high-intensity noise environment is evaluated using the neuromorphic DVS128 Gesture dataset. The achieved accuracy rate of 92.71% is only 2.15% lower than that of the noise-free environment. These results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed HRSNN under high-intensity noise conditions and present new possibilities for the advancement of neuromorphic computing in noisy environments.},

Inspired by the versatile foraging process of predators, this work demonstrates that micromotors doing spontaneous multipattern motion with microvortex can greatly enhance “on-the-fly” enrichment, demonstrated by highly sensitive surface-enhanced Raman scattering detection. It leverages an axis-asymmetric bowl-shaped structure and the nonlinear Ag–AgCl reaction, realizing alternating low-velocity swinging forward and accelerated steering motions for prolonged interaction and large work area. Moreover, the bowl-shaped microstructure bestows a micro-vortex above the Ag side due to the competition of electric potential and pressure gradient, also extending interaction time during the acceleration. Consequently, it exhibits at least an order of magnitude larger enhancement of detection signals than the counterparts. This proof-of-concept study highlights the significance of motion mode and structure design in guiding flow field, offering substantial benefits for applications.},

  abstract     = {Spatial manipulation of liquid droplets holds great significance in various areas from laboratory research to everyday life. Unfortunately, current manipulators are limited to lower responsivity and unreliable durability together with swinging-dependent manner. Herein, an ultrarobust, sensitive, and swinging-independent droplet-spatial manipulator is reported, namely, magnetically actuated shape-morphing microshutters (MASM) enabled by laser printing and soft transfer technique. Leveraging the loading/discharging of a remote magnet, the MASM can be reversibly switched between a bending mode and an erect mode within 1 s, thereby modulating the three-phase contact line (TCL). The underlying hydrodynamics is that B-mode MASM renders a longer TCL and an exaggerated adhesion force ( F a ), thereby pinning the surface droplets under the assistance of a magnetic field. Once the magnetic trigger is removed, the bent shutters reverse back to the E-mode so as to grant a shorter TCL and smaller F a . Based on this phenomenon, the droplet&#39;s capture/release can be readily realized in response to magnetic stimuli. Last but not least, by taking advantage of an optimized MASM, pattern-free configuration and droplets on-demand marriage and targeted chemical reaction together with programmable circuit remedy are deployed. This work provides impetus for researchers in constructing intelligent droplet manipulation systems for multidisciplinary areas.},

  abstract     = {The key obstacle to the realization of a scalable quantum computer is overcoming environmental and control errors. Topological quantum computation attracts great attention because it emerges as one of the most promising approaches to solving these problems. Various theoretical schemes for building topological quantum computation have been proposed. However, experimental implementation has always been a great challenge because it has proved to be extremely difficult to create and manipulate topological qubits in real systems. Therefore, topological quantum computation has not been realized in experiments yet. Herein, the first experimental simulation of topological quantum computation with classical circuits is reported. Based on the proposed new scheme with circuits, not only Majorana-like edge states are simulated experimentally, but also T junctions are constructed for simulating the braiding process. Furthermore, the feasibility of simulated topological quantum computing through a set of one- and two-qubit unitary operations is demonstrated. Finally, the simulation of Grover&#39;s search algorithm demonstrates that simulated topological quantum computation is ideally suited for such tasks. The developed circuit-based topological quantum-computing simulator can provide important references for developing future topological quantum circuits.},

High-temperature annealing improves crystal quality and carrier mobility, leading to efficient carrier generation and transport. The annealed ZnO NPs exhibit increased band edge luminescence and reduced deep-level emission. Their larger surface grain size decreases oxygen adsorption, resulting in enhanced desorption by photoexcited carriers during UV exposure. The annealed devices show higher excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and slower decay rates after UV termination, indicating better long-term memory. They also demonstrate accelerated learning processes with fewer pulse cycles required to reach 100% EPSC. Overall, this research highlights the significance of high-temperature annealing for improving long-term memory in ZnO NP-based optical synaptic devices, offering insights for advanced memory devices.},

Movement-type simulations, viz., the esports game Street Fighter (SF), recapitulate the complex multicharacter interactions and, concurrently, generate the millisecond-level control challenges of human athletes. Herein, the physical and mental signatures of the SF agent (it is called SF R2) are controlled by utilizing a previously unreported model-free, natural, deep reinforcement learning algorithm “Decay-based Phase-change memristive character-type Proximal Policy Optimization” (DP-PPO) through an assemblage of hybrid case-type training processes; and an integrated training configuration for time-trial evaluations, as well as competitions with a world&#39;s best SF player, is developed. A short length of time utilized by the SF R2 to defeat the opponent and, simultaneously, maintaining a good health level is achieved, as well as excellent handling of imperfect information settings. Training studies reveal a moderate maneuver etiquette in the SF R2, along with rapid, effective head-to-head competitions with one of the world&#39;s best SF player.

Although most fusion methods can achieve good performance, there are still shortcomings in extracting feature information from source images, which make it difficult to balance the thermal radiation region information and texture detail information in the fused image. To address the above issues, an expectation maximization (EM) learning framework based on adversarial generative networks (GAN) for infrared and visible image fusion is proposed. The EM algorithm (EMA) can obtain maximum likelihood estimation for problems with potential variables, which is helpful in solving the problem of lack of labels in infrared and visible image fusion. The axial-corner attention mechanism is designed to capture long-range semantic information and texture information of the visible image. The multifrequency attention mechanism digs the relationships between features at different scales to highlight target information of infrared images in the fused result. Meanwhile, two discriminators are used to balance two different features, and a new loss function is designed to maximize the likelihood estimate of the data with soft class label assignments, which is obtained from the expectation network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of EMA-GAN over the state-of-the-art.},

Herein, the design of a diffractive processor is presented that can all-optically perform multispectral quantitative phase imaging of transparent phase-only objects within a snapshot. The design utilizes spatially engineered diffractive layers, optimized through deep learning, to encode the phase profile of the input object at a predetermined set of wavelengths into spatial intensity variations at the output plane, allowing multispectral QPI using a monochrome focal plane array. Through numerical simulations, diffractive multispectral processors are demonstrated to simultaneously perform quantitative phase imaging at 9 and 16 target spectral bands in the visible spectrum. The generalization of these diffractive processor designs is validated through numerical tests on unseen objects, including thin Pap smear images. Due to its all-optical processing capability using passive dielectric diffractive materials, this diffractive multispectral QPI processor offers a compact and power-efficient solution for high-throughput quantitative phase microscopy and spectroscopy.},

In addition, the FBD interface exhibits significant advantages of flexibility and a compact structure.

Current recognition methods for HRRP sequences mainly focus on the temporal information of HRRP sequences, which cannot fully utilize the temporal and spatial information contained in HRRP sequences. Moreover, most of these methods fail in long-range modeling and global information extraction of HRRP sequences. To solve above problems, a HRRP sequence recognition method based on transformer with temporal–spatial fusion and label smoothing (TSF–transformer–LS) is proposed. TSF–transformer–LS contains temporal transformer blocks and spatial transformer blocks, which are used to extract deep global features of HRRP sequences in the time domain and space domain, respectively. Then, an attention fusion mechanism is developed to realize the adaptive fusion of temporal and spatial features. Moreover, label smoothing is used to add noise to sample labels, which can solve the overfitting problem of transformer caused by a large amount of noise hidden in HRRP in real scenes. Experiments on MSTAR, a standard dataset, show that the proposed method outperforms other methods in recognition performance. Furthermore, the effectiveness and interpretability of the method are explored.},

Furthermore, three deformation modes are studied and compared: the conventional nondeformable mode, the sine-based mode, and the instantaneous mode. Finally, a series of extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate various performance metrics of this innovative untethered biomimetic robotic fish, including thrust, swimming speed, yaw stability, turning radius, and turning rate. The results demonstrate that the introduction of active deformation of the caudal fin significantly enhances the swimming performance in the aforementioned indices when compared to the conventional nondeformable mode. Notably, the instantaneous mode exhibits best performance in terms of thrust, swimming speed, turning radius, and turning rate, while the sine-based mode demonstrates the best yaw stability.

Ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs) with excellent controllability and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility are favorable to achieving synaptic functions with low power consumption and high scalability. However, because of the only nonvolatile ferroelectric (Fe) characteristics in the FeFET, it is difficult to develop bioplausible short-term synaptic elements for spatiotemporal information processing. By judiciously combining defects (DE) and Fe domains in gate stacks, a compact artificial synapse featuring spatiotemporal information processing on a single Fe–DE fin FET (FinFET) is proposed. The devices are designed to work in a separate DE mode to induce short-term plasticity by spontaneous charge detrapping, and a hybrid Fe–DE mode to trigger long-term plasticity through the coupling of defects and Fe domains. The capability of the compact synapse is demonstrated by differentiating 16 temporal inputs. Moreover, the highly controllable static electricity of advanced FinFETs leads to an ultralow power of 2 fJ spike −1 . An all Fe–DE FinFET reservoir computing (RC) system is then constructed that achieves a recognition accuracy of 97.53% in digit classification. This work enables constructing RC systems with fully advanced CMOS-compatible devices featuring highly energy-efficient and low-hardware systems.},

Then, a continuum mechanics model is built to predict the deformation of the magnetic tip by combining the dipole model and the Cosserat-rod model. Moreover, a trajectory planning algorithm is developed to navigate the MG through vessels. Furthermore, trajectory following experiments within three vascular phantoms confirm that the proposed model and algorithm are reliable and capable of navigating the MG through the desired trajectory. Finally, two extra navigation experiments are implemented in 3D vascular phantom, which show that the MCGRS can be remotely controlled to manipulate the MG to actively steer and reach the target site. The system and methods will build the foundation for automatic control of MG and help to improve the autonomy.},

However, traditional methods are limited in terms of computations and holistic learning of human skeletal sequences. In this article, a new time-series skeleton joint data imaging method is infused into an improved convolutional neural network to handle these problems. First, the raw time-series data of 33 body nodes are transformed to red–green–blue images by encoding the 3D positional information to one pixel. Second, the LeNet-5 network is enhanced by expanding the receptive field, introducing coordinate attention and the smooth maximum unit to improve smoothness and feature extraction. Third, the ability of coded images to express human activities is studied in various environments. It is shown in the experimental results that the method achieves an impressive accuracy of 98.02% in recognizing 25 daily human activities, such as running, writing, and walking. In addition, it is shown that the number of floating point operations, parameters, and inference time of the method are 0.08%, 0.47%, and 3.05%, respectively, of the average values for six other networks (including AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and MobileNet).

  abstract     = {Floor-cleaning robots play a crucial role in both industrial and domestic spaces. However, these robots often face challenges due to hazardous components in their environment, which can cause them to fail and prevent them from performing at their best. This situation necessitates continuous research in the field of floor-cleaning robots. However, most of these efforts focus on improving the robots’ perception capabilities by incorporating additional sensors. Nevertheless, incorporating more sensors is an expensive solution for most cleaning robots. Alternatively, in this research, the feasibility of introducing a safe path on a predefined hazard map is explored. The proposed method aims to trade-off between area coverage and the safety of the cleaning robot. Herein, the failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) method is introduced as a tool to classify the hazards and implement a safety-ensured coverage path-planning process. In this approach, the risk factor defined for a point in the environment serves as the key parameter to assess the safety of the algorithm&#39;s suggested path. To validate and evaluate the proposed method, this article utilizes the hTetro mobile robot. In the experimental results, it is demonstrated that the proposed method can reduce high-risk movements of the robot compared to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {A new level of freedom is made possible by orbital angular momentum (OAM), which can be used to create twisted ultrasonic motors for particle manipulation and control. For steady and free-flowing particle management, it is essential to produce acoustic OAM beams of high order and high quality. However, this task is difficult due to the phased array&#39;s fundamental restriction of insufficient resolution or aperture. Herein, a generic approach is presented to inverse design that may be used to improve the OAM beam quality and produce twisted ultrasonic motors in free space. In comparison to the previous direct-design method, up to a 14% improvement in amplitude uniformity and a 12 dB improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of OAM modes are achieved. These notable benefits enable the ultrasonic motor to operate with a straightforward and compact system while enabling steady particle rotation in free space with an undersampled phased array, which is not possible with the conventional technique. This study paves the way for effective particle control, high-fidelity communication, and other OAM-based technologies by providing an inverse-design framework for optimizing OAM.},

Compared with electromagnet motors, smart-material-based rotary motors may exhibit more flexibility, robustness, and adaptability. Herein, a lightweight, compact dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) rotary motor with remarkable performance is reported. The motor is driven by a multilayered, slightly-prestretched (&lt;10%) dielectric elastomer (DE) composite membrane which consists of low-loss silicone as the DE layers and single-walled carbon nanotube as electrodes. When operating at frequencies around its resonance, it achieves a maximum rotating speed of 2,850 rpm (to the best of the authors&#39; knowledge, the fastest among all reported DEA rotary motors so far), torque of 0.655 mN m, and power of 34.7 mW with optimized transmission parameters. To demonstrate the motor&#39;s practical application, an off-the-shelf air vehicle propeller is driven by the motor, and a lift of 26 mN (1.54 times the DEA membrane&#39;s own weight) is obtained. An underwater robot driven by a water propeller is designed and a high speed of 175 mm s −1 (1.58 bl s −1 ) is obtained.

CT-TFETs cointegrated with charge-trapping metal–oxide–semiconductor FETs (CT-MOSFETs) through complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor logic process exhibit ≈2,000× lower on-current ( I on ) and ≈3,000× lower off-current ( I off ) than CT-MOSFETs, rendering them suitable for high-accuracy large-scale neuromorphic systems. According to the experimental and simulation results, CT-TFETs outperform CT-MOSFETs in terms of more accurate analog vector-matrix multiplication than that of CT-MOSFETs due to the following two reasons: first, CT-TFETs feature a lower voltage (IR) drop resulting from lower I on than that of CT-MOSFETs. Second, the former is more robust to the IR drops than the latter due to weak channel length modulation. For example, unlike CT-MOSFETs, the proposed CT-TFETs exhibit ignorable weight degradation in spite of the 1 Ω wire resistance. CT-TFET arrays show ≈700× lower power consumption and ≈10% higher MNIST classification accuracy than CT-MOSFET arrays, making CT-TFET arrays promising for extensive and versatile neuromorphic computing applications.},

This study aims to develop a reliable, home-based point-of-care testing (POCT) tool for early screening of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) coinfected with Talaromyces marneffei infection. Employing a “From weak to strong” deduction strategy for feature selection, data from 464 AIDS patients across four cohorts between February 5th, 2014, and January 8th, 2022, are analyzed. The top three features consistently observed are D-dimer, cluster of differentiation 4+, and aspartate transaminase. Based on these features, the simplest risk-scoring model is constructed, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.91, 0.80, and 0.69 in the hold-out cohort, external cohort 1, and external cohort 2, respectively. This “From weak to strong” deduction strategy identifies advantageous clinical features, enabling the development of simplified clinical risk scores with multiple biomarkers. To facilitate practical implementation, enhanced POCT tools are introduced, specifically a strip with segmented testing capabilities that demonstrates sensitivity and strong correlation with clinical scoring models. Furthermore, an open-access website and a free Android mobile app are created to support community utilization. The findings underscore the effectiveness of the innovative deduction strategy and enhanced test strips, which enable bedside measurements without laboratory dependency.},

These challenges hinder the improvement of recognition precision and capability in the wearable systems. Furthermore, the computational consumption for the recognition increases as more sensors are used to extensively gather information for distinguishing between complex motions. Herein, a wearable recognition system based on deep-learning-enhanced strain sensors for distinguishing between the complex motions of the human body is presented. A strain sensor based on peak–valley microstructures is fabricated and packaged to improve consistency and stability. Moreover, a lightweight hybrid convolutional neural network long short-term memory model is designed to lower the computational costs of the deep learning process. In particular, by designing Butterworth filtering and Z -score normalization algorithms, the error in feature extraction caused by sensor signal fluctuation is reduced, thereby improving the recognition accuracy of the proposed wearable system to 95.72% for seven gait motions and 100% for four different continuous series of Tai Chi forms.},

Moreover, one of the brain&#39;s remarkable properties is its ability to process complex information by resolving it on different timescales. In synapse-emulating artificial devices, some form of memory (e.g., hysteresis in current–voltage characteristics) is required. One of the important characteristics of biological synapses is the coexistence of short- and long-term memory, also called plasticity. However, a broader exploration of memory at multiple timescales in materials remains limited. Herein, the first example of synaptic transistors utilizing colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) as active material is reported. It is demonstrated that PbS-CQDs, with metal halide and perovskite-like ligands, are ideal as an active material for synaptic transistors exhibiting both short- and long-term plasticity. Most interestingly, by changing the chemistry of the quantum dot outer monolayer, a drastic change in the temporal response of the learning is observed, demonstrating the possibility of engineering materials exhibiting learning at multiple timescales, similar to the biological synapses.},

Proposed model shows the robust decoupled pressure-sensing capability with high accuracy of ≈96.23% using two input features. It also enables accurate pressure prediction under both the thermally steady and transition regions, which indicates significant potential for a precise measurement system.

First, multistate future actions of neighboring vehicles, whose driving styles vary, are estimated and fed into a decision-making module for risk assessment. Then, based on the Stackelberg game theory, the ego vehicle and the rear object vehicle are modeled as two players in the game, and their optimal decisions are obtained. In addition, the path-planning model incorporates a potential-field model that utilizes several potential functions to explain the varied styles and physical limitations of the surrounding vehicles. Finally, the trajectory of the ego vehicle is obtained through model predictive control that is based on the outputs of the decision-making and constructed potential-field models. The results of simulation experiments that used designed scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method effectively manages various social interactions and generates safe and appropriate trajectories for autonomous vehicles. In addition, the simulation results demonstrate that considering multistate trajectories caused the decision-making and path-planning modules to be appropriate for unpredictable environmental conditions.},

  abstract     = {Sleep problems are serious issues that make life difficult for all people, including sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, which causes breathlessness for more than 10 s, is linked to severe health problems due to the serious damage it can induce. To mitigate the risk of these disorders, the monitoring of patients has become increasingly challenging. Wearable technologies offer an effective healthcare solution for remote patient monitoring and diagnosis. A novel wearable system based on Arduino technology is introduced, specifically designed to monitor the breath patterns of patients. The analysis of breath data from patients holds great importance for the diagnosis and continuous monitoring of sleep apnea. To address this need, an advanced image processing system based on deep learning techniques is presented. This system automatically detects respiratory patterns, including inhalation, exhalation, and breathlessness. The device has an average of 97.6% sensitivity, 79.7% specificity, and 96% accuracy in identifying breath patterns. The designed device can offer patients and healthcare institutions a simple, inexpensive, noninvasive, and ergonomic system for the analysis of breath patterns that can be further extended for sleep apnea diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel approach to enhance the maneuverability and adaptability of legged robots in challenging environments is proposed. This approach involves the integration of soft inflatable sensing skin, which provides additional mobile modes and environmental adaptability. The inflated skin&#39;s structural properties, such as buoyancy, volumed shape, and physical compliance, enable quadruped robots to extend their mobility to stable swimming and crawling modes. The inflated skin also offers physical protection through cushioning and backing effects, allowing robots to roll down stair-like structures. Furthermore, the integration of tactile sensors provides the host robot with accurate and intuitive contact information, enabling increased environmental adaptability and responsive behavior. The robot can protect itself from impacts, detect and detour obstacles, and dynamically interact with its surrounding environment. Overall, the proposed approach offers a synergistic integration of soft inflatable sensing skin and tactile sensors to enhance legged robots’ maneuverability and adaptability in harsh environments. The integrated system enables robots to achieve challenging missions, extending their capabilities beyond conventional locomotive modes. The proposed approach has significant potential applications in fields such as search and rescue, surveillance, and exploration.},

  abstract     = {The brain has great capacity for computation and efficient resolution of complex problems, far surpassing modern computers. Neuromorphic engineering seeks to mimic the basic principles of the brain to develop systems capable of achieving such capabilities. In the neuromorphic field, navigation systems are of great interest due to their potential applicability to robotics, although these systems are still a challenge to be solved. This work proposes a spike-based robotic navigation and environment pseudomapping system formed by a bioinspired hippocampal memory model connected to a posterior parietal cortex (PPC) model. The hippocampus is in charge of maintaining a representation of an environment state map, and the PPC is in charge of local decision-making. This system is implemented on the SpiNNaker hardware platform using spiking neural networks. A set of real-time experiments are applied to demonstrate the correct functioning of the system in virtual and physical environments on a robotic platform. The system is able to navigate through the environment to reach a goal position starting from an initial position, avoiding obstacles and mapping the environment. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first implementation of an environment pseudomapping system with dynamic learning based on a bioinspired hippocampal memory.},

  abstract     = {Resistive switching devices are candidates to be used as weight for the future hardware realization of neuronal networks. Herein, these resistive switches base on oxygen vacancy migration and can be toggled between different resistance states. Internal processes lead to a variability over time in these states. To understand this, a dynamical model is developed, which links the internal physical mechanism to the current response. Thereby, the electronic current is calculated by tunneling processes over oxygen vacancies. The model allows to understand the physical transport properties and the current–voltage dependence. Integrating ionic hopping processes clarifies the variability in the electronic conduction. The derived model does not require empirical input parameters and only depends on the properties of the materials. This allows to use literature values and independently compare them to electrical measurements. The model predicts the experiments correctly. Thereupon, the physical properties of the conduction are investigated with respect to the transport over discrete energy levels, which change under the hopping of oxygen vacancies. Afterwards, the current level and variability are simulated for increasing oxygen vacancy concentrations to investigate analog switching, which is required for neuronal network layers. Finally, the variability is tested with multiple interacting cells in a neuronal layer.},

Specifically, physical layer (PHY) security has been put forth as a cost-effective alternative to cryptographic mechanisms that can circumvent the need for explicit key exchange between communication devices. Herein, a space–time-modulated digitally-coded metamaterial (MTM) leaky wave antenna (LWA) is proposed that can enable PHY security by achieving the functionalities of directional modulation (DM) using a machine learning-aided branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) optimized coding sequence. Theoretically, it is first shown that the proposed space–time MTM antenna can achieve DM through both the spatial and spectral manipulation of the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signal. Simulation results are then provided as proof-of-principle, demonstrating the applicability of the approach for achieving DM in various communication settings. Furthermore, a prototype of the proposed architecture controlled by a field-programmable gate array is realized, which achieves DM via an optimized coding sequence carried out by the learning-aided B&amp;B algorithm corresponding to the states of the MTM LWA&#39;s unit cells. Experimental results confirm the theory behind the space–time-modulated MTM LWA in achieving DM, which is observed via both the spectral harmonic patterns and bit error rate measurements.},

While model-based planning has demonstrated reliability, it is beneficial to incorporate human demonstrations and align the results with human behaviors. This work aims at bridging the gap between model-based planning and driver imitation by proposing a constraint imitative trajectory planning method (CITP). CITP integrates artificial potential field and dynamic movement primitives, which have achieved both the ability to imitate human demonstrations as well as ensure safety constraints. During the planning process, CITP first encodes human demonstrations, local driving target, and traffic obstacles as attractive or repulsive effects, and then the trajectory planning problem is solved through model predictive optimization. To address the dynamics of traffic scenarios, a hierarchical planning strategy is proposed based on the division of planning process. CITP is designed with five modules, including LSTM-based target generation, encoding attractive and repulsive effects with target, demonstrations and obstacles, and trajectory planning with model predictive optimization. Data collection and experiments are carried out based on CARLA driving simulator, and the effectiveness in terms of both safety and consistency with human behavior are reported.},

Herein, an acoustic and optical sensor-fusion-based system-termed multimodal unmanned aerial vehicle 3D trajectory exposure system (MUTES) is presented to detect and track drone targets. MUTES combines multiple sensor modules including microphone array, camera, and lidar. The 64-channel microphone array provides semispherical surveillance with high signal-to-noise ratio of sound source estimation, while the long-range lidar and the telephoto camera are capable of subsequent precise target localization in a narrower but higher definition field of view. MUTES employs a coarse-to-fine, passive-to-active localization strategy for wide-range detection (semispherical) and high-precision 3D tracking. To further increase the fidelity, an environmental denoising model is trained, which helps to select valid acoustic features from a drone target, thus overcomes the drawbacks of the traditional sound source localization approaches when facing noise interference. The effectiveness of the proposed sensor-fusion approach is validated through field experiments. To the best of the knowledge, MUTES provides the farthest detection range, highest 3D position accuracy, strong anti-interference capability, and acceptable cost for unverified drone intruders.},

  abstract     = {Two significant issues in biosensors that can&#39;t be solved by conventional analytical methods are selectivity among likely biological interfering molecules and background noise in clinical samples. The application of embedded machine learning in the removal of background interference, which is extremely common in complex matrix solutions such as cerebrospinal fluid, is still unexplored. The implementation of machine learning into devices and sensors can enhance their reliability to discriminate responses. In addition, implementing these models into portable devices can further improve the usage of point-of-care devices, continuous monitoring, and viral mutation assessments. Herein, the requirements to implement an embedded AI model (TinyML) into low-power portable systems and its use in the electrochemical field are presented. The application of TinyML to discriminate between interference of uric acid and ascorbic acid, both well-known abundant electrochemically active species, in neurotransmitter detection, is explored, reaching overall accuracy of 98.1% for 32-bit float point unit and 96.01% after 8-bit quantization, with the usage of 4.55% of the custom-made potentiostat memory. The model can be improved simply by having the trade-off between memory and accuracy. The research suggests that TinyML can be a key component in future medical devices, allowing data processing in real time and with increasing reliability.},

  abstract     = {Perceiving surface characteristics through tactile interaction typically requires high-resolution devices or precise spatial scanning to record and analyze a significant amount of information. However, most available tactile sensors require complicated technological processes, redundant layouts, and data acquisition circuits, which limits their ability to provide a real-time static perception and feedback for potential applications such as robotic manipulation. Drawing inspiration from the sliding tactile (ST) perception mode of the human fingertip, a robust and flexible ST sensor with a low array density of 2.7 cells cm −2 is reported. This innovative sensor has a soft and cambered configuration that allows it to rapidly and accurately recognize the 3D surface features of objects, including grooves as small as 500 μm. Benefiting from the strong correlation between collected electronic responding and local deformation of sensing cell, the ST sensor can adaptively reconstruct surface patterns with the assistance of deep learning, even on unstructured objects. The pattern recognition system based on the robot is demonstrated by accurately classifying a set of mahjong tiles with nearly 100% accuracy, surpassing human tactile perception capabilities in the same task.},

Hard-magnetic soft materials are shown to provide new opportunities for metachronal wave-modulated robotic locomotion by multi-agent active morphing in response to external magnetic fields. However, the design and optimization of such magnetic soft robots can be complex, and the fabrication and magnetization processes are often delicate and time-consuming. Herein, a computational model is developed that integrates granular models into a magnetic–lattice model, both of which are implemented in the highly efficient parallel computing platform large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS). The simulations accurately reproduce the deformation of single cilium, the metachronal wave motion of multiple cilia, and the crawling and rolling locomotion of magnetic cilia soft robots. Furthermore, the simulations provide insight into the spatial and temporal variation of friction forces and trajectories of cilia tips. The results contribute to the understanding of metachronal wave-modulated locomotion and potential applications in the field of soft robotics and biomimetic engineering. The developed model also provides a versatile computational framework for simulating the movement of magnetic soft robots in realistic environments and has the potential to guide the design, optimization, and customization of these systems.},

Significant bottlenecks exist in the field of multiview facial expression recognition (MFER) including a lack of high-quality MFER datasets, and the limited model robustness in real-world MFER scenarios. Therefore, this article first introduces a metahuman-based MFER dataset (MMED), which effectively addresses the issues of insufficient quantity and quality in existing datasets. Second, a conditional cascade VGG (ccVGG) model is proposed, which can adaptively adjust expression feature extraction based on the input image&#39;s pose information. Finally, a hybrid training and few-shot learning strategy are proposed that integrates our MMED dataset with a real-world dataset and quickly deploys it in real-world application scenarios using the proposed Meta-Dist few-shot learning method. Experiments on the Karolinska Directed Emotional Face (KDEF) dataset demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits improved robustness in multiview application scenarios and achieves a recognition accuracy improvement of 28.68% relative to the baseline. It demonstrates that the proposed MMED dataset can effectively improve the training efficiency of MFER models and facilitate easy deployment in real-world applications. This work provides a reliable dataset for the MFER studies and paves the way for robust FER in any view for real-world deployment.},

However, conductive hydrogels exhibit weak mechanical stability, which limits their applications. Therefore, sufficient mechanical properties and fatigue resistance are usually needed to fulfill their application requirements. Herein, the research frontiers of sensors based on mechanically robust conductive hydrogels are reviewed. While published papers always focus on the configuration design and application of sensors and the improvement of sensing performance, research on the network design of hydrogels and their effects on mechanical properties and sensing performance are limited. It is attempted in this review to fill this gap by focusing on the design principles of mechanically enhanced conductive hydrogels and their applications in flexible electronic devices. Herein, hydrogels’ structural designs, toughening mechanisms, mechanical properties, and sensing applications are discussed. The different working mechanisms of flexible sensors composed of tough conductive hydrogels and their applications are also reviewed.

While both procedures use 99m Tc-isotopes, the two vary in signal and background intensity. To understand how the different levels of image guidance impact surgical decision-making, computer-vision algorithms are used to extract the DROP-IN probe kinematic form clinical videos. 44 PCa patients undergo SLN (25) and PSMA-targeted (19) resections. PSMA-PET/CT and SPECT/CT create preoperative roadmaps, and intraoperative probe signal intensities are recorded. Using neural network-based software, probe trajectories are extracted from videos to extract multiparametric kinematics and generate decision-making and dexterity scores. PSMA-targeted resections yield significantly lower nodal signal intensities in preoperative SPECT-CT scans (three-fold; p = 0.01), intraoperative probe readouts (eight-fold; p &lt; 0.001), and signal-to-background ratios (SBR; two-fold; p &lt; 0.001). Kinematics assessment reveal that the challenges encounter during PSMA-targeted procedures converted to longer target identification times and increase in probe pick-ups (both five-fold; p &lt; 0.001). This results in a fourfold reduction in the decision-making score ( p &lt; 0.001).

The issue arises because aerial robots with agile mobility lack sufficient rotors for manipulation tasks, while those with manipulation ability are too large for agile mobility. To tackle this problem, a novel aerial robot unit named TRADY, tilted-rotor-equipped aerial robot with autonomous in-flight assembly and disassembly capability, is introduced. The TRADY unit can self-assemble/disassemble with another unit in mid-air, adjusting the aircraft&#39;s control freedom by switching between under-actuated and fully-actuated control models. The system implementation involves a docking mechanism design, optimized rotor configuration, as well as a control system with the ability to switch between under-actuated and fully-actuated controllers. A proposed state transition method compensates for discrete changes during the controller switchover process. Also, a motion strategy for assembly/disassembly with hazardous condition recovery behavior is presented. Finally, through experiments, TRADY demonstrated a 90 % success rate in executing assembly/disassembly motions, and in the assembly state, it can utilize full-pose tracking and generate over nine times the torque of a single unit. This is the first aerial robot developed to perform both assembly and disassembly while seamlessly transitioning between fully-actuated and under-actuated models.},

Herein, SLEPA is applied to optimal molecule generation by combining an irreducible Markov chain in the space of fragment multisets and a probabilistic fragment assembler such as MoLeR. The weighted samples from SLEPA are used to identify salient fragments for the highest occupied molecular orbitals-lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO-LUMO) gap maximization and minimization, and the relationship between the identified fragments and the electronic structures is elucidated.

  abstract     = {Cell counting and segmentation are critical tasks in biology and medicine. The traditional methods for cell counting are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human errors. Recently, deep learning-based cell counting methods have become a trend, including point-based counting methods, such as cell detection and cell density prediction, and non-point-based counting, such as cell number regression prediction. However, the point-based counting method heavily relies on well-annotated datasets, which are scarce and difficult to obtain. On the other hand, nonpoint-based counting is less interpretable. The task of cell counting by dividing it into two subtasks is approached: cell number prediction and cell distribution prediction. To accomplish this, a deep learning network for spatial-based super-resolution reconstruction (SSRNet) is proposed that predicts the cell count and segments the cell distribution contour. To effectively train the model, an optimized multitask loss function (OM loss) is proposed that coordinates the training of multiple tasks. In SSRNet, a spatial-based super-resolution fast upsampling module (SSR-upsampling) is proposed for feature map enhancement and one-step upsampling, which can enlarge the deep feature map by 32 times without blurring and achieves fine-grained detail and fast processing. SSRNet uses an optimized encoder network. Compared with the classic U-Net, SSRNet&#39;s running memory read and write consumption is only 1/10 of that of U-Net, and the total number of multiply and add calculations is 1/20 of that of U-Net. Compared with the traditional sampling method, SSR-upsampling can complete the upsampling of the entire decoder stage at one time, reducing the complexity of the network and achieving better performance. Experiments demonstrate that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance in cell counting and segmentation tasks. The method achieves nonpoint-based counting, eliminating the need for exact position annotation of each cell in the image during training. As a result, it has demonstrated excellent performance on cell counting and segmentation tasks. The code is public on GitHub (https://github.com/Roin626/SSRnet).},

To overcome this challenge, inspiration is drawn from an African elephant ( Loxodonta Africana ), which can employ both fingertip extensions on the trunk tip to efficiently grasp dispersed granular food all at once by mediating state transition of granules. Herein, this bio-inspired intelligent strategy is integrated into a soft pneumatic gripper for transporting dispersed granules. To evaluate the critical actuation pressures while grasping granules, a library is constructed experimentally, and the effects of the initial relative height and relative lifting speed on the grasping success rate are examined. It is indicated in the experimental results that this trunk-inspired robotic strategy leads to a success rate of over 90% and saves ≈50% duration of manipulation compared to the individual gripping fashion.

  abstract     = {Magnetic soft robots featuring untethered actuation and high mechanical compliance have promising applications ranging from bionics to biomedicine. However, their fixed magnetization profiles pose a challenge for adaptive shape transformation in unpredictable environments and dynamic tasks. Herein, a reprogrammable magnetic soft composite is reported by encapsulating magnetic neodymium–iron–boron microparticles with low melting alloy (LMA) and embedding them into the elastomer. Utilizing the phase transition of the LMA, the magnetic microparticles can be reoriented under an external magnetic field and they can be immobilized through LMA solidification, allowing the robot to obtain a new magnetization profile corresponding to its temporary shape. By changing the LMA composition, the robot with multiple programming temperatures can be fabricated and its local magnetization profiles can be selectively programmed in different temperature ranges. A bioinspired crawler with multimode locomotion, a reconfigurable robotic gripper capable of adaptable grasping, and reconfigurable electronic circuits are also demonstrated. This work may pave the way for the next-generation magnetic soft robots and reconfigurable devices.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by human brain, the emerging analog-type memristor employed in neuromorphic computing systems has attracted tremendous interest. However, existing analog memristors are still far from accurate tuning of multiple conductance states, which are crucial from the device-level view. Herein, a reliable analog memristor based on ion-slicing single-crystalline LiNbO 3 (LNO) thin film is demonstrated. The highly ordered LNO crystal structure provides a stable pathway of oxygen vacancy migration, which is contributed to a stable Mott variable-range hopping process in trap sites. Excellent analog switching characteristics with high reliability and repeatability, including long retention/great endurance with small fluctuation (fluctuated within 0.22%), a large dynamic range of two orders of magnitude, hundreds of distinguishable conductance states with tunable linearity, and ultralow cyclic variances for multiple weight updating (down to 0.75%), are realized with the proposed memristor. As a result, a multilayer perceptron with a high recognition accuracy of 95.6% for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset is realized. The proposed analog memristive devices based on ion-slicing single-crystalline thin films offer a novel strategy for fabricating high-performance memristors that combined linear tunability and long-term repeatability, opening a novel avenue for neuromorphic computing application.},

  abstract     = {Many aquatic and aerial animals have evolved highly sensitive flow receptors to help them survive in challenging environments. The biological flow receptors, such as filiform hairs, lateral lines, and seal whiskers, are elegantly designed with interesting biomechanical processing principles for extreme sensitivity, exhibiting obvious morphological intelligence. For instance, superficial neuromasts on the surface of fish body have an elongated cupula to enhance flow detection with a magnified drag. The flow-induced mechanical information is transferred to arrayed hair bundles in the neuromasts, which show spontaneous oscillation and mechanical coupling effects for a high mechanical sensitivity. In this review, the biomechanical principles of morphological intelligence in biological flow field receptors are discussed, with an emphasis on the functions of stimulus enhancement, noise reduction, and nonlinear oscillation. In addition, the recent achievements in flow sensors with morphological intelligence are summarized in this article. Though there is still a big gap in principle discovery and practical application of morphological intelligence in engineered sensors, it can be anticipated that the field of intelligent flow sensing will be significantly promoted by the establishment of morphological intelligence models.},

  abstract     = {Soft sensing technologies provide a novel alternative for state estimation in wearables and robotic systems. They allow one to capture intrinsic state parameters in a highly conformable manner. However, due to the nonlinearities in the materials that make up a soft sensor, it is difficult to develop accurate models of these systems. Consequently, design of these soft sensors is largely user defined or based on trial and error. Since these sensors conform and take the shape of the sensing body, these issues are further exacerbated when they are installed. Herein, a framework for the automated design optimization of soft sensors using closed-loop 3D printing of a recyclable hydrogel-based sensing material is presented. The framework allows direct printing of the sensor on the sensing body using visual feedback, evaluates the sensor performance, and iteratively improves the sensor design. Following preliminary investigations into the material and morphology parameters, this is demonstrated through the optimization of a sensorized glove which can be matched to specific tasks and individual hand shapes. The glove&#39;s sensors are tuned to respond only to particular hand poses, including distinguishing between two similar tennis racket grip techniques.},

Current autonomous decision-making systems suffer from limited rationality and insufficient intelligence during operation processes. Recent studies have proposed methods based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address these issues. However, DRL methods typically face challenges related to weak interpretability, lack of convergence guarantees, and high-computing power requirements. To address these issues, a novel technique for large-scale air defense decision-making by combining a DRL technique with game theory is discussed. The proposed method transforms the target assignment problem into a potential game that provides theoretical guarantees for Nash equilibrium (NE) from a distributed perspective. The air-defense decision problem is decomposed into separate target selection and target assignment problems. A DRL method is used to solve the target selection problem, while the target assignment problem is translated into a target assignment optimization game. This game is proven to be an exact potential game with theoretical convergence guarantees for an NE. Having simulated the proposed decision-making method using a digital battlefield environment, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated.},

This waste stems from three key factors: i) air losses from idle SCs arranged in arrays, ii) inadequate sealing on target surfaces leading to air leaks, and iii) damage from sharp objects resulting in leaking perforations. To overcome these challenges, in this article, a comprehensive approach is presented that involves the development of a i) self-closing, ii) multi-material, and iii) self-healing system based on reversible elastomers cross-linked via the Diels–Alder (DA) reaction. The system incorporates a fully autonomous self-closing mechanism to prevent energy waste in SC arrays during periods of non-contact. Fluid–structure interaction simulations are utilized to analyze the design. Versatility and stability are achieved by incorporating hyper-flexible and stiff elastomers in a multi-material design, supported by covalent DA cross-links that ensure robustness through high-strength multi-material interfaces. These DA cross-links also enable self-healing capabilities, allowing the SCs to recover from macroscopic damages within 1 day at ambient conditions or in a single hour with mild heating (80–90 °C), restoring full performance. Additionally, in the article, a recycling method is introduced for multi-material SCs based on the mechanical separation of reversible polymers.},

Soft resistive sensors are susceptible to mechanical stimuli and detecting temperature selectively remains a challenge. In this study, soft flexible thermistors are developed for detecting temperature changes based on the positive temperature coefficient (PTC) effect, selectively. By thermomechanical analysis and differential scanning calorimetry, it is observed that thermoplastic elastomers with higher thermal expansion and semicrystalline morphology result in a sensitive thermistor response. To achieve a high sensitivity in temperature and low sensitivity in the detection of mechanical stimulus, a low-carbon filler content is required. The opposite trend is seen for the piezoresistive sensors for mechanical strain detection. Both sensory material types are compatible with thermoplastic material extrusion-based additive manufacturing. The method is used for the fabrication of the sensing elements and an open-source prosthetic hand. The strain sensor detects the bending of the fingers and the temperature sensor detects the temperature when in contact with a heated surface, successfully. In addition, the temperature sensor is used as a tactile sensor to detect contact with a non-heated surface.

A dataset of transmission spectra and structural parameters of NAs is generated using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations and is converted to vivid structural colors using the corresponding transmission spectrum. A bidirectional neural network is used to train the transmission spectrum and structural color together. The accuracy of predicting the structural parameters using a desired spectrum is tested and found to be up to 0.99, with a determination coefficient of reproducing the desired spectrum and color to be 0.97 and 0.96, respectively. These values are higher compared to those when only training for spectrum, but requiring less training time. This strategy is able to inverse design the NAs in less than 1 s to maximize surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement by matching transmission resonance and laser excitation wavelength, and accurately regenerate colored images in 7.5 s, allowing for nanoscale printing at a resolution of approximately 100 000 dots in −1 .

  abstract     = {Dysarthria is common in movement disorders, such as Wilson&#39;s disease (WD), Parkinson&#39;s disease, or Huntington&#39;s disease. Dysarthria severity assessment is often indispensable for the management of these diseases. However, such assessment is usually labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. To seek efficient and cost-effective solutions for dysarthria assessment, an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered acoustic analysis system is proposed and its performance in a valuable sample of WD, an ideal disease model with mainly mixed dysarthria, is verified. A test-retest reliability analysis yields excellent reproducibility in the acoustic measures (mean intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.81). Then, a system for dysarthria assessment is trained with WD patients ( n = 65) and sex-matched healthy controls ( n = 65) using a machine learning approach. The system achieves reasonable performance in evaluating dysarthria severity with either stepwise classification or regression (all areas under the curve &gt;80%; mean absolute error = 6.25, r = 0.79, p &lt; 0.0001). The diadochokinesis and sustained phonation tasks contribute the most to prediction, and the corresponding acoustic features can provide significant and independent contributions. The present study demonstrates the feasibility and good performance of the AI-powered acoustic analysis framework, offering the potential to facilitate early screening and subsequent management of dysarthria.},

  abstract     = {Multimaterial 3D printing is an attractive route for low-cost fabrication of electronic systems having different types of embedded devices. Herein, tunable thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)-based conductive composite filaments are presented for development of either strain sensors or different circuit elements. The filaments are developed with two filler materials, namely, silver and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). The influences of filler aspect ratio (AR), concentration, functionalization, and morphology on the composites&#39; mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties are studied. Printed tracks of the 10 wt% high-AR MWCNT/TPU filament exhibit a maximum electrical conductivity of 0.92 S cm −1 and withstand powers &gt;1 W and currents &gt;100 mA. The filament shows negligible change in impedance over the frequency range 1 kHz–1 MHz and a change in the resistance of &lt;5% with 90° bending. Conversely, printed tracks using filaments with 3 wt% low-AR MWCNT exhibit a change in resistance of ≈30% with 90° bending, allowing a clear distinction between various bending angles, and thus could be used for embedded strain/bend sensors. These results suggest that, with the correct optimization, multimaterial additive manufacturing can be utilized with tunable conductive filaments to fabricate complex 3D electronic systems by constructing reliable circuit tracks, bendable interconnects, and sensors.},

  abstract     = {As a friendly tool, the soft gripper can be used directly for grasping vulnerable objects in underwater environments. These tasks are generally performed by teleoperation based on the visual feedback, rather than the soft actuators’ sensing information. However, vision sensors’ function may be restricted in some complex underwater environments with poor visibility and narrow spaces. This will greatly reduce the efficiency of the underwater operations. Therefore, soft actuators strongly require an organism-like perception system to sense environmental stimuli and can be applied to complex underwater environments. To address the problem, a multidirectional external perception soft actuator based on two flexible optical waveguide sensors is developed and machine learning methods are utilized to build its perceptual model herein. The experimental results indicate that the soft actuator can recognize 12 contact positions based on the sensing model, and the identifying accuracy is up to 99.82%. Additionally, according to the contact location feedback, teleoperation can be more efficiently completed in unknown underwater environments.},

In the immediate previous work, the image quality of the predicted frames was low and a lot of scene detail was lost. To preserve the structural details of objects and improve overall image quality in the predicted frames, several novel ideas are proposed herein. A filter has been designed to remove noise from dense optical flow components resulting from frame rate inconsistencies. The Pix2Pix base network has been modified and a structure-aware SSIM-based perpetual loss function has been implemented. A new dataset of 20 000 training input images and 2000 test input images with a 500 ms delay between the target and input frames has been created. Without any additional video transformation steps, the proposed improved model achieved PSNR of 23.1; SSIM of 0.65; and MS-SSIM of 0.80, a substantial improvement over our previous work. A Fleiss’ kappa score of &gt;0.40 (0.48 for the modified network and 0.46 for the perpetual loss function) proves the reliability of the model.},

The proposed FBG sensor utilizes two tiny nitinol rods as a backbone to attach the long-grating FBG element fiber, enabling high strain transfer, shape sensing for large bending deformation, and preventing chirping failure and fiber sliding when bending. Its distal end is set free to slide and synchronizes with the extended length and reflects shapes for large bending deformation (up to 320° with a linearity of 99.96%), while its proximal end is fixed. The small packaged sensor unit enables modular design, easy assembly, and high repeatability with negligible effects on the soft finger&#39;s bending performances. The artificial neural network model is utilized to process the input of two sensing modalities, reducing errors from material nonlinearity, fabrication, and assembly of soft fingers while improving shape estimation&#39;s accuracy and transferability with average errors of 0.90 mm (0.69%) and 1.55 mm (1.19%) for whole shape and distal end position, respectively.

Nonlinear dynamics in physical systems provide a computational capability that is unique to reservoirs. It is, however, difficult to find an appropriate task for a reservoir because of the complexity of nonlinear information processing. The information processing capacity has recently been used to clarify systematically the tasks that are solved by reservoirs; it quantifies the memory capacity of reservoirs in accordance with the order of nonlinearity. Herein, an experimental evaluation of the information processing capacity of a spintronic oscillator consisting of nanostructured ferromagnets is reported. The spintronic reservoir state is electrically manipulated by adding a delayed-feedback circuit. The total capacity reaches a maximum of 5.6 at the edge of the echo state property. A trade-off between the linear and nonlinear components of the capacity is also found. The result can be used to better understand the nonlinear information processing in reservoirs and to find good matches between reservoirs and tasks. As an example, a function-approximation task is performed and it is found that it can be efficiently solved when the reservoir state is appropriately tuned so that its information processing capacity matches that of the task.},

Herein, open-source software package GeoV for the 3D reconstruction and analysis of GUV shapes from confocal microscopy z-stacks is presented. The accuracy of the reconstruction by comparing the output for the Hausdorff distance of the surface, the curvature, and the bending energy to ground truth data for simulated shapes of different complexities is quantified. Next, GeoV on a variety of confocal microscopy datasets, including z-stacks from spherical GUVs and GUVs deformed with DNA origami, adherent GUVs, DNA droplets, and cells, is tested. Additionally, the effect of membrane-binding DNA origami on the vesicle shape, volume, and bending energy is quantified. It is found that osmotic deflation and attachment of DNA origami can increase the bending energy of GUVs by a factor of 10.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, human-machine interfaces (HMI) are continuing to affect human lifestyles. Artificial skin is a new type of HMI sensor that enables a seamless connection between human and electronic devices. Currently, artificial skin is mostly prepared from rigid materials, which lack flexibility and scalability, thus impeding the development of HMI. Hydrogel, consisting of 3D polymer network and water is similar to human tissues and is therefore an excellent candidate for artificial skin in HMI. The conventional HMI of hydrogel-based artificial skin includes touch pad and machine control based on capacitive or resistive sensors. However, the energy supply of HMI depends on battery which requires frequent recharging and replacement. Therefore, hydrogel-based self-powered artificial skin is expected to become primary interaction medium for the forthcoming generation of HMI. This article reviews the development of hydrogel-based self-powered artificial skin for HMI. Various power supply mechanisms of hydrogel-based artificial skin are discussed. The materials for self-powered artificial skin are introduced, including ionic hydrogel, ionic-liquid hydrogel, metal-based hydrogel, carbon-based and MXene-based hydrogel, and conductive polymer-based hydrogel. The application of the hydrogel-based self-powered artificial skin in HMI is also reviewed. Finally, the challenges and development trends in HMI are outlined.},

  abstract     = {Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) requires precise selection of a single sperm cell in a dish to be injected into an oocyte. This task is challenging due to high sperm velocity, collision with other sperm cells, and changes in the imaging focus. Herein, a new model is proposed, which is based on a multilayer long short-term memory (LSTM) network combined with linear extrapolation calculation, for predicting the future location of individual sperm cells based on their previous paths. The model is trained with a unique loss function, constructed from the predicted location and trajectory, and results in low mean location error predictions. The results are based on comparing different input sequences length, number of time frames ahead, and motility parameters of sperm cells. This model can provide faster and more accurate sperm motility predictions, better tracking, and aid automatic sperm capturing technologies.},

  abstract     = {A deep learning (DL)-based approach for analysis is proposed. Using synthetic XRD data for a DL approach is inevitable due to the lack of real-world XRD data. There are two main challenges when conducting a DL-based XRD analysis: generating realistic XRD data including all possible perturbations, such as peak shift, broadening, texture, and noisy background, and generalizing the DL model applicability to all ICSD entries. To address both the perturbation and generalizability issues, a large-scale computation is required because it would be infeasible with typical lab-scale computation. Cloud computing infrastructures are leveraged for parallel computations and to obtain symmetry classification test accuracies of 98.95%, 97.18%, and 96.03% for the crystal system, extinction group, and space group, respectively. A stricter individual compound-based train and test dataset-splitting scheme also produces reasonable test accuracies of 92.25%, 87.34%, and 84.39%, which are still state-of-the-art records. Crucially, the DL model trained on synthetic data is assessed using real-world experimental XRD datasets to ensure its practical applicability. When tested on the real-world experimental XRD dataset, the model achieves a test accuracy of 90.38% in predicting crystal systems.},

However, most of their control systems rely on permanent magnet-based systems, which are unfeasible for large-scale environments, such as in vivo applications. Herein, an electromagnetic system comprising orthogonal pairs of coils is used to generate global magnetic fields, that is, magnetic fields that are applied equally to large volumes, for the multimodal locomotion of ferrofluidic robots composed of magnetic micro-/nanoparticles. Three main magnetic field configurations, with their respective locomotion mechanisms, are explored: uniform rotating fields for droplet fission–fusion motions and locomotion; magnetic trapping point-based locomotion for single- and collective-droplet manipulation; and field-free region-based dragging locomotion and selective droplet control. The effectiveness of the proposed multimodal locomotion mechanisms and potential applications are experimentally demonstrated in minichannels through selective mixing, targeted delivery, and optimized magnetic heating applications. These locomotion mechanisms using global fields enable the use of fluidlike magnetic microrobots in large-volume applications.},

These robots made from flexible materials are generally with low stiffness and have limited capability to perform tasks that require the application of large forces. Soft artificial muscles (AMs) with variable stiffness are promising solutions for soft robots to handle larger payloads. However, the existing actuators need to overcome their small range of stiffness variation and slow response. Further, it is difficult to integrate self-sensing into existing actuators. Herein, a novel electric AM with variable stiffness and self-sensing referencing smooth muscle contraction in nature is proposed. The AM consists of two pieces of soft anode mesh, a flexible cathode and a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gel dielectric layer, where the cathode is also a resistive sensor. The stiffness variation is induced by the friction change caused by electrostatic adsorption. Compared with the existing PVC gel actuation technology, the new design integrated the dielectric and the cathode layers and combined the sensing function. Also, the rigid anode and cathode are replaced by the soft ones, respectively, which makes the AM suitable for soft robotics or wearable devices.},

This has motivated the concept of Smart Tracers that could record the local chemical concentrations, temperature, or other conditions as they progress through reactors. Herein, the design constraints and advantages of Smart Tracers by simulating their operation in a laminar flow reactor model conducting chemical reactions of various orders are analyzed. It is noted that far fewer particles are necessary to completely map even the most complex concentration gradients compared with their conventional counterparts. Design criteria explored herein include sampling frequency, memory storage capacity, and ensemble number necessary to achieve the required accuracy to inform a reactor model. Cases of severe particle diffusion and sensor noise appear to bind the functional upper limit of such probes and require consideration for future design. The results of the study provide a starting framework for applying the new technology of microrobotics to the broad and impactful set of problems classified as chemical reactor analysis.},

Herein, an offline programming guidance (OLPG) scheme for aggregated MNPs is proposed based on a real-time aggregation volume estimator. The proposed aggregation volume estimator based on a magnetic drug-targeting simulator reflects volume changes of aggregated MNPs; hence, it can model a magnetic force acting on aggregated MNPs in real time while enhancing targeting performance. The proposed guidance system is evaluated using a simulation testbed and in vitro model of the rat brain, which yields comparable results at different fluid viscosities, flow velocities, target areas, and flow types. The OLPG with the aggregation volume estimator improves targeting performance by 116%–409% compared with the default mode, and by 111%–180% compared to the performance without the aggregation volume estimator. Furthermore, a guidance margin predicts enhanced targeting performance (root-mean-square error &lt; 5%) irrespective of the flow environment. The proposed guidance strategy has the potential to overcome the problems caused by the lack of an imaging modality, control-system complexity, and low targeting performance.},

  abstract     = {Herein, physical reservoir computing with a redox-based ion-gating reservoir (redox-IGR) comprising Li x WO 3 thin film and lithium-ion conducting glass ceramic (LICGC) is demonstrated. The subject redox-IGR successfully solves a second-order nonlinear dynamic equation by utilizing voltage pulse driven ion-gating in a Li x WO 3 channel to enable reservoir computing. Under the normal conditions, in which only the drain current ( I D ) is used for the reservoir states, the lowest prediction error is 8.15 × 10 −4 . Performance is enhanced by the addition of I G to the reservoir states, resulting in a significant lowering of the prediction error to 5.39 × 10 −4 , which is noticeably lower than other types of physical reservoirs (memristors and spin torque oscillators) reported to date. A second-order nonlinear autoregressive moving average (NARMA2) task, a typical benchmark of reservoir computing, is also performed with the IGR and good performance is achieved, with a normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 0.163. A short-term memory task is performed to investigate an enhancement mechanism resulting from the I G addition. An increase in memory capacity, from 2.35 without I G to 3.57 with I G , is observed in the forgetting curves, indicating that enhancement of both high dimensionality and memory capacity is attributed to the origin of the performance improvement.},

Herein, a self-powered and stretchable optical fiber strain sensor is reported with distributed sensing capability based on mechanoluminescent optical fiber, where mechanoluminescent phosphors with different emission color light are discretely integrated onto the outer cladding of the elastomer optical fiber. Based on the wavelength coding technique and time-domain filtering comparison method, the capability of strain magnitude quantification (10–60%) and strain location identification together in a single stretchable optical fiber is successfully realized, even at multiple positions simultaneously in the strain-applied situation. Moreover, this stretchable optical fiber strain sensor shows insensitivity to bending, compression, and temperature disturbances and outstanding durability (&gt;8000 cycles). Due to the excellent light confinement of the elastomer optical fiber, demonstrations such as bright-field measurement, saline water operation, and wearable glove application exhibit its potential as a promising technology for future self-powered distributed optical sensing systems.},

Instead of relying on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) or vision and communication for agents to actively estimate and control the state of the multibody dynamics, lightweight air dampers to make the multiagent system inherently stable at its equilibrium state, permitting the robots to safely carry a load at a constant velocity are employed. This is achieved without additional state estimation or active correction. The proposed framework is proven stable and verified by simulations and extensive flight experiments. Lightweight mechanical dampers (under 7 g) are shown to be effective in attenuating undesired oscillations and overcoming disturbances. To this end, a team of four robots cooperatively transporting a payload over 20 m in open space is demonstrated, and three robots safely transporting a point-mass payload over a distance of 45 m outdoors. The promising outcomes highlight the benefits of the passive strategy, which demands minimal hardware components and computation to realize the sophisticated aerial transport task.},

Specifically, electrical parameter measurements (EPMs) and power-delay product of industrial high- k metal gate DRAM peripheral 29-stage ring oscillator circuits, including NMOS, PMOS, and interconnects, are focused on. The proposed methods find an optimized input to achieve a lower NN output variance in the gradient descent than one multilayer perceptron (MLP) and mean ensemble of MLPs even when considering the variabilities of the devices and interconnects.

Moreover, adding the learnable layer secures versatility for various parametric datasets. The methods improve the prediction accuracy ( R 2 ) by 5.6–15.6% in sparse data space compared to one MLP and the mean ensemble, decrease the NN output variance of the optimized input by 73.0–81.6% compared to one MLP and the mean ensemble, and are successfully verified by implementing it on EPMs of 3977 test patterns of 314 wafers and 16 lots.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by the unique neurophysiology of the octopus, a hierarchical framework is proposed that simplifies the coordination of multiple soft arms by decomposing control into high-level decision-making, low-level motor activation, and local reflexive behaviors via sensory feedback. When evaluated in the illustrative problem of a model octopus foraging for food, this hierarchical decomposition results in significant improvements relative to end-to-end methods. Performance is achieved through a mixed-modes approach, whereby qualitatively different tasks are addressed via complementary control schemes. Herein, model-free reinforcement learning is employed for high-level decision-making, while model-based energy shaping takes care of arm-level motor execution. To render the pairing computationally tenable, a novel neural network energy shaping (NN-ES) controller is developed, achieving accurate motions with time-to-solutions 200 times faster than previous attempts. The hierarchical framework is then successfully deployed in increasingly challenging foraging scenarios, including an arena littered with obstacles in 3D space, demonstrating the viability of the approach.},

The body dynamics of Miura-ori (aka its vertices displacements), which is excited by a simple harmonic base excitation, can be exploited as the reservoir computing resource. By recording these dynamics with a high-resolution camera and image processing program and then using linear regression for training, it is shown that the origami reservoir has sufficient computing capacity to estimate the weight and position of a payload. It can also recognize the input frequency and magnitude patterns. Furthermore, multitasking is achievable by simultaneously applying two targeted functions to the same reservoir state matrix. Therefore, it is demonstrated that Miura-ori can assess the dynamic interactions between its body and ambient environment to extract meaningful information—an intelligent behavior in the mechanical domain. Given that Miura-ori has been widely used to construct deployable structures, lightweight materials, and compliant robots, enabling such information perception tasks can add a new dimension to the functionality of such a versatile structure.},

  abstract     = {Acoustic manipulation is a technique that uses sound waves to move particles, droplets, or cells. Closed-loop control methods based on complex, time-varying acoustic fields have been demonstrated, but usually require accurate models of the acoustic fields or many training experiments for successful manipulation. Herein, a new adaptive control method is proposed for the acoustic manipulation of single and multiple particles inside microfluidic chips. The method is based on online machine learning of the acoustic fields. Starting with no knowledge of the fields, the controller can manipulate particles even on the first attempt, and its performance improves in subsequent attempts, yet can still readapt if the models are invalidated by a sudden change in system parameters. The controller can generalize: it can use information learned from one task to improve its performance in other tasks. Despite the machine-learning nature of the controller, the internal models of the controller have a physical interpretation and correspond to the experimentally observed acoustic fields. The online adaptiveness of the controller should make it easier to use in practical applications, such as particle and cell sorting, microassembly, labs-on-chips, and diagnostic devices, as the method does not require extensive training or prior models.},

Herein, an event-based stereo visual odometry (VO) system via adaptive time-surface (TS) and truncated signed distance function (TSDF), namely, T-ESVO, is proposed . The system consists of three carefully designed components, including the event processing unit, the mapping unit, and the tracking unit. Specifically, the event processing unit adopts a novel spatial–temporal adaptive TS that can deal with different camera motions in various environments. The mapping unit introduces the TSDF to describe the 3D representation of environments and achieves depth estimation based on the global historical depth information contained in the environmental TSDF description. The tracking unit achieves the 6-DoF pose estimation through an 3D–2D registration method based on the left/right TS selection mechanism and the depth point selection mechanism. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed system are evaluated on various datasets, and the experimental results show that T-ESVO achieves good performance in both accuracy and robustness when compared with other state-of-the-art event-based stereo VO systems.},

Herein, the development of hybrid piezoelectric–magnetic self-sensing actuator (HPMSA) that can both sense and actuate is proposed. This iron oxide/functionalized carbon nanotube/polyvinylidene fluoride film optimizes both piezoelectric and magnetic properties through dual-alignment fabrication, utilizing strong element bonds for simultaneous alignment. Magnetic nanoparticles are advantageous over nanorods due to latter&#39;s randomized shape anisotropy decreasing magnetization. The dual magnetic and mechanical processing increases polar β -crystal content to 88%, where magnetic alignment alone increases degree of crystallinity to 66%. As a vibration damper, HPMSA operates within 40–600 Hz frequency, with a sensing sensitivity of 2.5 mV g −1 and 0.72 m s −2 weighted acceleration damping, lowering passenger health risks. Piezoelectric and magnetic relationship shows 0.19 V increase with 125 mT applied. The flexible HPMSA can integrate onto a curved surface and sense/dampen vibrations of an air motor, propeller drone, and simulated tremors. The HPMSA provides tremendous potential and understanding into multi-stimuli-responsive/functional materials, simultaneous alignment, and vibration control in the next generation of transportation vehicles for human safety.},

  abstract     = {Origami and kirigami have become foundations for programmable sheet materials that fold along flexible creases. However, since they are originated from folded paper that allows no in-plane sheet deformation, they suffer from limited folding energy arising from narrow creases, and large varieties of crease patterns are completely non-foldable due to over-constraint. Herein, a new strategy that breaks the limitations of the conventional crease-induced folding kinematics by leveraging a folding effect from in-plane shear deformation of the sheet is reported, and it is referred to as shearigami. It is shown that shearigami extends the realm of foldable structures to include the strictly non-foldable origami patterns such as degree-3 vertices, and the sheet-stored self-folding energy outperforms the crease-stored energy by a potentially two orders of magnitude. Shearigami also inherits the mathematical framework of paper folding and provides a unified view that regards origami and kirigami as two special cases. Herein, self-folding shearigami models are experimentally demonstrated based on previously non-foldable patterns, including artificial muscles with rapid shear-induced extension. The way is paved toward active structures and architectured materials with design freedom and self-folding capabilities beyond origami and kirigami.},

  abstract     = {Organic synaptic transistors (OSTs) using intrinsic polymer semiconductors are demonstrated to be suitable for neuromorphic bioelectronics. However, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based copolymers are not applicable to neuromorphic computing systems because the DPP polymer film has demonstrated only short-term plasticity with short retention (&lt;50 ms) in synaptic devices because of their intrinsic difficulty of electrochemical doping. To expand their applications toward neuromorphic computing that requires long-term plasticity, artificial synapses with extended retention time should be developed. Herein, molecular tailoring approach to extend the retention time in the ion-gel-gated OSTs that use DPP is suggested. The molecular structure is controlled by changing alkyl spacer lengths of side chains. As a result, the doping process is more favorable in DPP with long alkyl spacer, which is confirmed by high doping concentration and slow dedoping rate. Therefore, dedoping of ions is more suppressed in DPP with long alkyl side chain that exhibits extended retention time (≈800 s) of the OSTs. These optimized DPP-based OSTs obtain high pattern recognition accuracy of ≈96.0% in simulations of an artificial neural network. Molecular tailoring strategies provide a guideline to overcome the intrinsic problem of short synaptic retention time of the OSTs for use in neuromorphic computing.},

  abstract     = {Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has emerged as a valuable diagnostic tool in prostate lesion assessment. However, training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) inevitably involves magnetic resonance (MR) images from multiple cohorts. There always exists variation in scanning protocol among cohorts, inducing significant changes in data distribution between source and target domains. This challenge has greatly limited clinical adoption on a large scale. Herein, a coarse mask-guided deep domain adaptation network (CMD 2 A-Net) is proposed to develop a fully automated framework for prostate lesion detection and classification (PLDC). No category or mask label is required from the target domain. A coarse segmentation module is trained to cover the possible lesion-related regions, so that attention maps can be generated to dedicate the local feature extraction of lesions within those regions. Experiments are performed on 512 mpMRI sets from datasets of PROSTATEx (330 sets) and two cohorts, A (74 sets) and B (108 sets). Using ensemble learning, CMD 2 A-Net accomplishes an AUC of 0.921 in cohort A and 0.913 in cohort B, demonstrating its transferability from a large-scale public dataset PROSTATEx to small-scale target domains. Results from an ablation study also support its effectiveness in classification between benign and malignant lesions, compared to the state-of-the-art models.

  abstract     = {Biodegradable materials decompose and return to nature. This functionality can be applied to derive robotic systems that are environmentally friendly. This study presents a fully biodegradable soft actuator, which is one of the key elements in “green” soft robotics. The working of the actuator is based on an electrohydraulic principle, which is similar to that of hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic actuators. The actuator developed in this study consists of a dielectric film made of polylactic acid (PLA) and polybutylene adipate -co -terephthalate (PBAT), with soybean oil as the dielectric liquid and electrodes made from a mixture of gelatin, glycerol, and sodium chloride (NaCl). The synthesized biodegradable electrode material exhibits a Young&#39;s modulus of 0.06 MPa and resistivity of 258 Ω·m when the mass fraction of NaCl relative to the amount of gelatin and glycerol is 10 wt%. The softness and resistivity of the electrode material results in actuation strain values of 3.2% (at 1 kV, corresponding to 1.2 kV mm −1 ) and 18.6% (at 10 kV, corresponding to 9.6 kV mm −1 ) for the linear-type and circular-type actuators, respectively. These values obtained for the biodegradable electrohydraulic soft actuators are comparable to those of nonbiodegradable actuators of the same type, representing the successful implementation of the concept.},

  abstract     = {Technology advancements in energy storage, photocatalysis, and sensors have generated enormous impedimetric data. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results play an essential role in analyzing the interfacial properties of materials. Nonetheless, in many situations, the data is misinterpreted due to the complexity of the electrochemical system or the compromise between the experimental result and the theoretical model, resulting in partiality in the interpretation process, especially for the impedimetric results. Typically, the experimenter interprets impedimetric results using a searching approach based on a theoretical model until the best-fitting model is obtained, which is a time-consuming process, and errors can occur. To reduce misinterpretation by the experimenter, herein, the machine-learning strategy is demonstrated for the classification of an EIS circuit model and parameter prediction using a deep neural network (DNN). The DNN model shows a highly accurate classifier for the commonly used EIS circuit with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of more than 0.95. Additionally, the model demonstrates high accuracy in the prediction of EIS parameters on a complex EIS system, with a maximum R 2 of 0.999. These reveal that the machine-learning strategy may open a new room for studying electrochemical systems.},

Specifically, the driving trajectory will inevitably have intersections with other vehicles whose driving intentions can&#39;t be directly observed. Herein, a two-stage algorithm framework that is decomposed into the longitudinal and lateral planning processes for online merging planning is proposed. An improved particle filter is used to estimate the driving models of surrounding vehicles for predicting their future driving intentions. Based on Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), different action spaces are evaluated for longitudinal merging gap selection and lateral interactive merging operation, while heuristic pruning is used to reduce the computation cost. Moreover, the coefficients related to the driving styles are introduced, and their influences on merging performance are analyzed. Finally, the proposed algorithm is implemented in a two-lane simulation environment. The results show that the proposal has outperformed other baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Since HfO x -based ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) are attractive compared to perovskite-based FTJs and other emerging memory devices, they are being actively studied recently. They have advantages such as a simple metal–insulator–metal structure, complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility, non-destructive operation, and low power consumption. Moreover, doped HfO x -based FTJs are in the spotlight in terms of neuromorphic engineering as a way of advancing from the von Neumann structure. In particular, Al dopant is effective for inducing ferroelectric properties due to its smaller radius than that of Hf. The optimal concentration of Al varies depending on the device materials and the annealing conditions during deposition. Therefore, in-depth research is required for neuromorphic applications. Herein, the properties of FTJ devices according to Al doping concentrations are analyzed. Subsequently, using the device with the highest remanent polarization, neuromorphic applications are implemented, including spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), long-term potentiation, and depression. The characteristics in different frequency regions are also studied to satisfy the demand for fast switching. Finally, the FTJ device is used as a physical reservoir in reservoir computing for efficient processing of time-dependent inputs.},

  abstract     = {Optoelectronic devices based on optically responsive materials have gained significant attention due to their low cross talk and reduced power consumption. These devices rely on light-induced changes in conductance states, which are used to create synaptic weights for image recognition tasks in neural networks. However, a major drawback of such devices is the rapid decay of conductance states after light stimulus removal, which hinders their long-term memory and performance without a continuous external stimulus in place. To address this issue, a platform neural network scheme is proposed to counter the natural decay of conductance in optoelectronic devices. The approach restores the memory effect of the devices and significantly enhances their performance by several orders of magnitude without using additional energy-intensive techniques like training pulses or gate fields. Herein, the model is validated experimentally using optoelectronic devices fabricated with two different materials, BP and doped In 2 O 3 , and demonstrates the restoration of memory/image retention ability to any material system being studied for optoelectronic synapses and vision. This approach has important implications for the practical application of neuromorphic visual processing technologies, bringing them closer to real-world applications.},

Here, the primary use of SWT at the interface with MSE is identified using specifically created categories. This overview highlights promising opportunities for the application of SWT to MSE, such as enhancing the quality of experimental processes, enriching data with contextual information in knowledge graphs, or using ontologies to perform specific queries on semantically structured data. While interdisciplinary work between the two fields is still in its early stages, a great need is identified to facilitate access for nonexperts and develop and provide user-friendly tools and workflows. The full potential of SWT can best be achieved in the long term by the broad acceptance and active participation of the MSE community. In perspective, these technological solutions will advance the field of MSE by making data FAIR. Data-driven approaches will benefit from these data structures and their connections to catalyze knowledge generation in MSE.},

Motile cilia are also able to sense many mechanical or fluidic cues. Inspired by the motile cilia in nature, a type of artificial cilia that can both actuate and sense is investigated. These artificial cilia can operate their sensing and actuation individually to sense the flow speed and collaboratively transport objects. More importantly, they can also sense the viscosity of the fluid and the distance from the wall by beating and feeling their own motion. In the latter function, two different sensing modes (modes 1 and 2) are proposed for low and high Reynolds numbers. They are investigated through both computational fluid dynamics and experiments. It is found that mode 1 can sense a wall distance up to 3 times the body length of the cilium, while mode 2 can sense up to 2 times. Such sensing of distance can be further converted into the ability to compute the morphology of the boundary inside the fluid. This work can be useful for small-scale soft robots that work inside fluid and other flow control applications.},

Therefore, robotic manipulators need high-resolution touch sensors that are compact, robust, inexpensive, and efficient. The soft vision-based haptic sensor presented herein is a miniaturized and optimized version of the previously published sensor Insight. Minsight has the size and shape of a human fingertip and uses machine learning methods to output high-resolution maps of 3D contact force vectors at 60 Hz. Experiments confirm its excellent sensing performance, with a mean absolute force error of 0.07 N and contact location error of 0.6 mm across its surface area. Minsight&#39;s utility is shown in two robotic tasks on a 3-DoF manipulator. First, closed-loop force control enables the robot to track the movements of a human finger based only on tactile data. Second, the informative value of the sensor output is shown by detecting whether a hard lump is embedded within a soft elastomer with an accuracy of 98%. These findings indicate that Minsight can give robots the detailed fingertip touch sensing needed for dexterous manipulation and physical human–robot interaction.},

  abstract     = {Interface-type (IT) metal/oxide Schottky memristive devices have attracted considerable attention over filament-type (FT) devices for neuromorphic computing because of their uniform, filament-free, and analog resistive switching (RS) characteristics. The most recent IT devices are based on oxygen ions and vacancies movement to alter interfacial Schottky barrier parameters and thereby control RS properties. However, the reliability and stability of these devices have been significantly affected by the undesired diffusion of ionic species. Herein, a reliable interface-dominated memristive device is demonstrated using a simple Au/Nb-doped SrTiO 3 (Nb:STO) Schottky structure. The Au/Nb:STO Schottky barrier modulation by charge trapping and detrapping is responsible for the analog resistive switching characteristics. Because of its interface-controlled RS, the proposed device shows low device-to-device, cell-to-cell, and cycle-to-cycle variability while maintaining high repeatability and stability during endurance and retention tests. Furthermore, the Au/Nb:STO IT memristive device exhibits versatile synaptic functions with an excellent uniformity, programmability, and reliability. A simulated artificial neural network with Au/Nb:STO synapses achieves a high recognition accuracy of 94.72% for large digit recognition from MNIST database. These results suggest that IT resistive switching can be potentially used for artificial synapses to build next-generation neuromorphic computing.},

  abstract     = {Conventional vision systems suffer from lots of data handling between memory and processing units. Inspired by how humans recognize noisy images and the flexible modulation on the timescale of ion dynamics inside an emerging memtransistor, a novel neuromorphic vision system is reported based on the ion-modulated memtransistors. By controlling the ion-doping processes under adequate stimuli strengths, both short-term and long-term ion dynamics can be utilized to deliver energy-efficient data processing. When dealing with image reconstructions, the short-term accumulation effect of the device can help filter noises in a set of received noisy images while enhancing the original pattern information. The increased contrast can help distinguish the actual contents. To demonstrate systematic performances with the reconfiguration of devices, the nonlinear relationship between channel conductance variation and the amplitude of gate pulses into the network-level simulation is extracted. Also, with the nonvolatile conductance change characteristic, the task of recognizing noisy images is performed to verify the versatility of ion-modulated memtransistors in the neuromorphic artificial vision systems.

Herein, a strategy is introduced for building modular soft machines that can be innervated in ways that conform to their body extension or shape changes, based on modular soft electronics. The development of soft electronic adhesive interlocking (SEAL) technology allows for instant, robust, and repeatable integration of soft electronic modules that can “innervate” and activate modular soft actuators and machines in a reconfigurable manner. Demonstrations of soft robotic tentacles and their grasping capability show that the robot function can be adapted to or reconfigured within the body with a length extended more than 10 times. The modular strategy presented herein can offer a unique promise to build up future robots with dynamic, reconfigurable functions.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental challenge of pneumatically powered soft robotic devices is the scalability of fluidic control systems to address each actuated degree of freedom, as the required electromechanical valves are bulky and expensive. Previous solutions have compromised the reprogrammability and/or the bandwidth of the fluidic system. This article describes and models a fluidic subsystem, a fluidic matrix circuit (FMC) , that enables the independent control of many ( N 2 $N^{2}$ ) actuators using a limited number ( 2 ⁢ N $2 N$ ) of electromechanical valves. The fundamental unit, a fluidic logic module (FLM) , generates a bidirectional pressure signal (vacuum or positive pressure) based on the state of the mass flow through it. Thus and array of pneumatic actuators can be addressed individually using an array of FLMs integrated into a matrix (i.e., an FMC), with electromechanical valves to switch the mass flow through each row and column of the matrix. The resulting refresh rates are an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches. This concept with a prototype FMC able to control 25 actuators using 10 electromechanical valves for applications including a fluidic shape display and a wearable haptic vest is demonstrated. This approach could enable more complex and sophisticated soft robotic devices with scalable control hardware.},

Herein, inspired by the functions of skin somatosensory signal generation and processing, an artificial intelligence-motivated skin-like optical fiber tactile (SOFT) sensor is proposed. It features multifunctional touch interaction capabilities including tactile amplitude and position and tensile strain. Four fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) are embedded in a skin-like three-layer laminate structure of the SOFT sensor, forming a flexible tactile sensing array with a stretchability larger than 20%. Fusing the two-level cascaded neural network, the position and magnitude of the contact force can be distinguished simultaneously. The recognition accuracy for contact position is up to 92.41% and the error is less than 4.2% within the force range of 0–3.5 N. Several SOFT sensor-based interactive applications including pressure password interface and music playback are achieved by combining the artificial intelligence spatiotemporal dynamic logic analysis. Furthermore, the sensor is also capable of complex scenes involving tension and tactile sensing, such as dexterous hand perception and human–robot interaction control. This work provides novel insights into artificial intelligence-based integrated skin that shows broad promise in intelligent prosthetics and bionic robotic.},

In contrast, fabric-based inflatable structures offer high stiffness-to-weight ratio solutions for soft robotics, but their actuation has been little explored. Herein, a new class of pneumatic soft grippers is presented that exploits the in-plane overcurvature effect of inextensible fabric flat balloons upon inflation. A star-shaped gripper contracts radially under pressure producing a gripping force on the object whose intensity can be modulated by the pressure input. First, the kinematics and mechanics of a single V-shaped actuator are studied through experiments, finite element simulations, and analytical models. Then, these results are leveraged to predict the mechanical response of the entire star, optimize its geometry, and maximize contraction and stiffness. It is shown that the gripping performance can be improved by stacking several stars with silicon-coated corners. It is expected that the flexibility, robustness, scalability, and ease of fabrication of this methodology will lead to a new generation of lighter and larger actuators capable of developing higher forces and moving delicate and irregularly shaped objects while maintaining reasonable complexity.},

To guide the robot&#39;s design, experiments are conducted on test appendages to identify the morphological and actuation parameters for forward thrust generation. Obstacle sensing is observed in granular media by measuring the increased force on the moving appendage caused by changes in the granular flow around it. These results are integrated into an untethered robot capable of subsurface locomotion in a controlled granular bed like natural, loosely packed sand. The robot achieves subsurface “swimming” at a speed of 1.2 mm s −1 , at a depth of 127 mm, faster than any other reported untethered robot at this depth, while also detecting obstacles during locomotion via force sensors embedded in the appendages. Finally, subsurface robot locomotion in natural sand at the beach is demonstrated, a feat no other robot has accomplished, showcasing how underactuated structures enable movement and sensing in granular environments with limited limb control.},

Hence, improving flexibility and designability of the stimuli-responsive soft grippers for better grasping ability are highly desired. Inspired by the biological structure of octopuses, a class of temperature-driven polylactic acid grippers is fabricated by 4D printing in this work, which consists of two types of bilayer structures, separately imitating the web and tentacles of an octopus. Compared with the traditional pure-bending soft grippers, the integrated structure results in a 1.5 times wider reachable area and enhanced flexibility. The complex grasping behaviors are predicted with the 4D printing parameters (i.e., printing paths and printing speeds) using the reduced bilayer plate theory. Moreover, a method for determining the printing parameters of the gripper is provided to realize the desired grasping behavior depending on different objects. The feasibility of the design method is experimentally verified by gasping three distinctive objects, including an egg, a weight, and a Metatron&#39;s cube, which is in good agreement with the simulation results.

  abstract     = {Aerial robots can autonomously collect temporal and spatial high-resolution environmental data. This data can be utilized to develop mathematical ecology models to understand the impact of climate change on the habitat. In case of drone malfunction, the incorporated materials can threaten vulnerable environments. The recent introduction of transient robotics enables the development of biodegradable, environmental-sensing drones capable of degrading in their environment. However, manufacturing methods for environmental-sensing transient drones are rarely discussed. Herein, a manufacturing framework and material selection process featuring biopolymer-based, high-strength composite cryogels, and printed carbon-based electronics for transient drones are highlighted. It is found that gelatin- and cellulose-based cryogels mechanically outperform other biopolymer composites while having a homogeneous microstructure and high stiffness-to-weight ratio. The selected materials are used to manufacture a flying-wing air-frame, while the incorporated sensing skin is capable of measuring the elevons’ deflection angles as well as ambient temperature. It is demonstrated in the results how gelatin–cellulose cryogels can be used to manufacture lightweight transient drones, while printing carbon-conductive electronics is a viable method for designing sustainable, integrated sensors. The proposed methods can be used to guide the development of lightweight and rapidly degrading robots, featuring eco-friendly sensing capabilities.
