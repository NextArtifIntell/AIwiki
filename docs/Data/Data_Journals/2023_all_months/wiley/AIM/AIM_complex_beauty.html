  abstract     = {Machine Learning systems rely heavily on annotated instances. Such annotations are frequently done by human experts, or by tools developed by experts, and so the central message of this book, Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgment (Kahneman, Sibony, and Sunstein 2021) is of considerable importance to AI/Machine Learning community. The core message is that if a number of experts are asked to annotate tasks that involve judgments, these responses will frequently differ. This observation poses a problem for how analysts choose a particular annotated dataset (from the group), or process the set of responses to give a “balanced” response, or whether to reject all the annotated datasets. A further important aspect of this book is the case studies which demonstrate that differences in judgments between fellow experts have been reported in a significant number of disciplines including, business, the law, government, and medicine. Kahneman, Sibony and Sunstein (2021), referred to as KSS subsequently, discuss how Expert Biases can be reduced, but the main focus of this book is a discussion of Noise, that is, differences that often occur between fellow experts, and how Noise can often be reduced. To address the last point KSS have formulated a set of six decision hygiene principles which include the recommendation that complex tasks should be subdivided, and then each subtask should be solved separately. A further principle is that each task should be solved by individual experts before the various judgments are discussed with fellow experts. Effectively, the book being reviewed covers three main topics: First, it reports several motivating studies that show how judgments of fellow experts varied significantly in the pricing of insurance premiums, and in setting the lengths of custodial sentences. These motivating studies very effectively illustrate the central concepts of Judgment, Noise, and Bias; that section also provides definitions of these core concepts and discusses how Noise is often amplified in group meetings. Secondly, the authors provide detailed discussion of further studies, in a variety of domains, which report the levels of disagreement between experts. Thirdly, KSS discusses how to reduce the levels of Noise between experts, as noted above, the authors refer to these as Principles of Noise Hygiene. These three parts are interwoven in a complex way throughout the book; in our view, the best overview of the book is given in the section Review and Conclusions: Taking Noise Seriously (KSS, p. 361).},

However, this is a challenging task that requires the holistic integration of multimodal information with temporal dependencies and reasoning, as well as social and physical commonsense. In addition, the development of appropriate systematic evaluation methods is essential. In this context, we introduce the Video Turing Test (VTT), a blind test used to evaluate human-likeness in terms of video comprehension ability. Moreover, we propose Vincent as a video understanding AI. We explain the configuration of VTT, the architecture of Vincent to prepare for VTT and the proposed evaluation methods for video comprehension. We also estimate the current intelligence level of AI based on our results and discuss future research directions.},

  abstract     = {Social and moral norms are a fabric for holding human societies together and helping them to function. As such they will also become a means of evaluating the performance of future human–machine systems. While machine ethics has offered various approaches to endowing machines with normative competence, from the more logic-based to the more data-based, none of the proposals so far have considered the challenge of capturing the “spirit of a norm,” which often eludes rigid interpretation and complicates doing the right thing. We present some paradigmatic scenarios across contexts to illustrate why the spirit of a norm can be critical to make explicit and why it exposes the inadequacies of mere data-driven “value alignment” techniques such as reinforcement learning RL for interactive, real-time human–robot interaction. Instead, we argue that norm learning, in particular, learning to capture the spirit of a norm, requires combining common-sense inference-based and data-driven approaches.},

  abstract     = {In many real-world applications of AI, the set of actors and tasks are not constant, but instead change over time. Robots tasked with suppressing wildfires eventually run out of limited suppressant resources and need to temporarily disengage from the collaborative work in order to recharge, or they might become damaged and leave the environment permanently. In a large business organization, objectives and goals change with the market, requiring workers to adapt to perform different sets of tasks across time. We call these multiagent systems (MAS) open agent systems (OASYS), and the openness of the sets of agents and tasks necessitates new capabilities and modeling for decision making compared to planning and learning in closed environments. In this article, we discuss three notions of openness: agent openness, task openness, and type openness. We also review the past and current research on addressing the novel challenges brought about by openness in OASYS. We share lessons learned from these efforts and suggest directions for promising future work in this area. We also encourage the community to engage and participate in this area of MAS research to address critical real-world problems in the application of AI to enhance our daily lives.},

However, with this proliferation, there is also a growing recognition that many of the central open problems within AI are connected to how the user interacts with these systems. To name two prominent examples, consider the problems of explainability and value alignment. Each problem has received considerable attention within the wider AI community, and much promising progress has been made in addressing each of these individual problems. However, each of these problems tends to be studied in isolation, using very different theoretical frameworks, while a closer look at each easily reveals striking similarities between the two problems. In this article, I wish to discuss the framework of human-aware AI (HAAI) that aims to provide a unified formal framework to understand and evaluate human–AI interaction. We will see how this framework can be used to both understand explainability and value alignment and how the framework also lays out potential novel avenues to address these problems.},

However, these systems lack reliability and accuracy resulting in manual human verification of the detected edges. This paper presents a neural network architecture that automatically detects the weld seam edge between two metals with high accuracy. We augment this system with a preclassifier that filters out anomalous workpieces (e.g., incorrect placement). Finally, we justify our design choices by evaluating against several existing deep network pipelines as well as proof through real-world use.

Although artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) algorithms have been developed for prelabeling HD maps, a significant gap remains in accuracy and robustness between AI-based methods and traditional manual pipelines. Additionally, building large-scale annotated datasets and advanced machine learning algorithms for AI-based HD map labeling systems can be resource-intensive. In this paper, we present and summarize the Tencent HD Map AI (THMA) system, an innovative end-to-end, AI-based, active learning HD map labeling system designed to produce HD map labels for hundreds of thousands of kilometers while employing active learning to enhance product iteration. Utilizing a combination of supervised, self-supervised, and weakly supervised learning, THMA is trained directly on massive HD map datasets to achieve the high accuracy and efficiency required by downstream users. Deployed by the Tencent Map team, THMA serves over 1000 labeling workers and generates more than 30,000 km of HD map data per day at its peak. With over 90% of Tencent Map&#39;s HD map data labeled automatically by THMA, the system accelerates traditional HD map labeling processes by more than tenfold, significantly reducing manual annotation burdens and paving the way for more efficient HD map production.},

Despite recent developments of forecasting algorithms in the machine learning community, there is a lack of general and advanced algorithms specifically considering requirements from the power industry perspective. In this paper, we present eForecaster, a unified AI platform including robust, flexible, and explainable machine learning algorithms for diversified energy forecasting applications. Since October 2021, multiple commercial bus load, system load, and renewable energy forecasting systems built upon eForecaster have been deployed in seven provinces of China. The deployed systems consistently reduce the average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 39.8% to 77.0%, with reduced manual work and explainable guidance. In particular, eForecaster also integrates multiple interpretation methods to uncover the working mechanism of the predictive models, which significantly improves forecasts adoption and user satisfaction.},

  abstract     = {Underserved communities face critical health challenges due to lack of access to timely and reliable information. Nongovernmental organizations are leveraging the widespread use of cellphones to combat these healthcare challenges and spread preventative awareness. The health workers at these organizations reach out individually to beneficiaries; however, such programs still suffer from declining engagement. We have deployed Saheli , a system to efficiently utilize the limited availability of health workers for improving maternal and child health in India. Saheli uses the Restless Multi-armed Bandit (RMAB) framework to identify beneficiaries for outreach. It is the first deployed application for RMABs in public health, and is already in continuous use by our partner NGO, ARMMAN. We have already reached ∼130K beneficiaries with Saheli , and are on track to serve one million beneficiaries by the end of 2023. This scale and impact has been achieved through multiple innovations in the RMAB model and its development, in preparation of real world data, and in deployment practices; and through careful consideration of responsible AI practices. Specifically, in this paper, we describe our approach to learn from past data to improve the performance of Saheli &#39;s RMAB model, the real-world challenges faced during deployment and adoption of Saheli , and the end-to-end pipeline.},

Through this environment, ChatGPT successfully simulates the creation of a new improved model, called GPT 4 , which combines the concepts of GPT in AI (generative pretrained transformer) and GPT in physics (generalized probabilistic theory). We show that GPT 4 can use its built-in mathematical and statistical capabilities to simulate and analyze physical laws and phenomena. As a demonstration of its language capabilities, GPT 4 also generates a limerick about itself. Overall, our results demonstrate the promising potential for human-AI collaboration in scientific discovery, as well as the importance of designing systems that effectively integrate AI&#39;s capabilities with human intelligence.},

Using those, Jeopardy! questions, we find that for high confidence Watson questions the three systems perform with similar accuracy as Watson. We also find that both BARD and ChatGPT perform with the accuracy of a human expert and that the sets of their correct answers are rated highly similar using a Tanimoto similarity score. However, in addition, we find that both systems can change their solutions to the same input information on subsequent uses. When given the same Jeopardy! category and question multiple times, both BARD and ChatGPT can generate different and conflicting answers. As a result, the paper examines the characteristics of some of those questions that generate different answers to the same inputs. Finally, the paper discusses some of the implications of finding the different answers and the impact of the lack of reproducibility on testing such systems.},

We argue that the assessment of human–AI (HAI) systems must be effective but must also be efficient. Bench testing of a prototype of an HAI system cannot require extensive series of large-scale experiments with complex designs. Some of the constraints that are imposed in traditional laboratory research just are not appropriate for the empirical evaluation of HAI systems.

The algorithm determines how similar actual election results are as compared to the predicted results from polling and a regression model of other regions that have similar demographics. We use k-means to partition electoral regions into clusters such that demographic homogeneity is maximized among clusters. We then use a novelty detection algorithm implemented as a one-class support vector machine where the clean data is provided in the form of polling predictions and regression predictions.

Our main contributions are a dataset extracted from Wikipedia that spans the past 120 years and a language model-based method that helps analyze how polarized a candidate is. Our data are divided into two parts, background information and political information about a candidate, since our hypothesis is that the political views of a candidate should be based on reason and be independent of factors such as birthplace, alma mater, and so forth. We further split this data into four phases chronologically, to help understand if and how the polarization amongst candidates changes. This data has been cleaned to remove biases. To understand the polarization, we begin by showing results from some classical language models in Word2Vec and Doc2Vec. And then use more powerful techniques like the Longformer, a transformer-based encoder, to assimilate more information and find the nearest neighbors of each candidate based on their political view and their background. The code and data for the project will be available here: “ https://github.com/samirangode/Understanding_Polarization ”},

Usually, when chatbots are referenced in connection with elections, they often draw negative reactions due to the fear of mis-information and hacking. Instead, in this work, we explore how chatbots may be used to promote voter participation in vulnerable segments of society like senior citizens and first-time voters. In particular, we have built a system that amplifies official information while personalizing it to users&#39; unique needs transparently (e.g., language, cognitive abilities, linguistic abilities). The uniqueness of this work are (a) a safe design where only responses that are grounded and traceable to an allowed source (e.g., official question/answer) will be answered via system&#39;s self-awareness (metacognition), (b) a do-not-respond strategy that can handle customizable responses/deflection, and (c) a low-programming design-pattern based on the open-source Rasa platform to generate chatbots quickly for any region. Our current prototypes use frequently asked questions (FAQ) election information for two US states that are low on an ease-of-voting scale, and have performed initial evaluations using focus groups with senior citizens. Our approach can be a win-win for voters, election agencies trying to fulfill their mandate and democracy at large.},

  abstract     = {It is well documented that there has been significant enthusiasm across the globe in respect of using AI for all forms of social activity. However, the electoral process – the time, place, and manner of elections within democratic nations – is one of few sectors in which there has been limited penetration of AI. Electoral management bodies in many countries have recently started exploring and deliberating over the use of AI in the electoral process. In this paper, we consider five avenues within the core electoral process which have potential for AI usage, and map the challenges involved in using AI within them. These five avenues are: voter list maintenance, determining polling booth locations, polling booth protection processes, voter authentication, and video monitoring of elections. Within each avenue, we lay down the context, illustrate current or potential usage of AI, and discuss extant or potential ramifications of AI usage, as well as potential directions for mitigating risks when considering AI usage. We believe that the scant current usage of AI within electoral processes provides a very rare opportunity to deliberate on the risks and mitigation possibilities prior to actual and widespread AI deployment. This paper is an attempt to map the horizons of risks and opportunities in using AI within electoral processes and to help shape the debate around the topic.},

The use of robots that operate in spaces in which humans are physically co-present is growing at a dramatic rate. We are seeing more and more robots in our warehouses, on our streets, and even in our homes. All of these robots will interact with humans in some way, whether intentionally or unintentionally. To be successful, their interactions with humans will have to be carefully designed. For more than a decade, the field of HRI has been growing at the intersection of robotics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) , human-computer interaction (HCI), psychology, and other fields; however, until quite recently, it has been a largely academic area, with university researchers proposing, implementing, and reporting on experiments at a limited scale. With the current increase of commercially-available robots, HRI is starting to make its way into the robotics industry in a meaningful way. This symposium brought together HRI researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and national research laboratories to find common ground, understand the different constraints at play, and determine how to effectively work together.},

  abstract     = {As more and more AI agents are used in practice, it is time to think about how to make these agents fully autonomous so that they can (1) learn by themselves continually in a self-motivated and self-initiated manner rather than being retrained offline periodically on the initiation of human engineers and (2) accommodate or adapt to unexpected or novel circumstances. As the real-world is an open environment that is full of unknowns or novelties, the capabilities of detecting novelties, characterizing them, accommodating/adapting to them, and gathering ground-truth training data and incrementally learning the unknowns/novelties become critical in making the AI agent more and more knowledgeable, powerful and self-sustainable over time. The key challenge here is how to automate the process so that it is carried out continually on the agent&#39;s own initiative and through its own interactions with humans, other agents and the environment just like human on-the-job learning. This paper proposes a framework (called SOLA) for this learning paradigm to promote the research of building autonomous and continual learning enabled AI agents. To show feasibility, an implemented agent is also described.},

However, there are risks associated with AI deployments including failures of model robustness and security, explainability and interpretability, bias and fairness, and privacy and ethics. While there are international efforts to define governance standards for responsible AI, these are currently only principles-based, leaving organizations uncertain as to how they can prepare for emerging regulations or evaluate their effectiveness. We propose the use of anticipatory thinking and a flexible model risk audit (MRA) framework to bridge this gap and enable organizations to take an advantage of the benefits of responsible AI. This approach enables organizations to characterize risk at the model level and to apply the anticipatory thinking employed by high reliability organizations to achieve responsible AI deployments.},

We make this argument in terms of two aspects of human cognition that are related to anticipatory thinking: context and creativity. We then use the parallels between context, creativity, and anticipatory thinking to support our belief that cognitive priming plays a key role in various aspects of anticipatory thinking. As part of this analysis, we also discuss its broader implications, including how it can be used to improve computational systems that do anticipatory thinking, as well as how it can be leveraged to improve anticipatory thinking in people.},

To improve crowdsourced forecasting accuracy, we developed SAGE, a hybrid forecasting system that combines human and machine generated forecasts. The system provides a platform where users can interact with machine models and thus anchor their judgments on an objective benchmark. The system also aggregates human and machine forecasts weighting both for propinquity and based on assessed skill while adjusting for overconfidence. We present results from the Hybrid Forecasting Competition (HFC)—larger than comparable forecasting tournaments—including 1085 users forecasting 398 real-world forecasting problems over 8 months. Our main result is that the hybrid system generated more accurate forecasts compared to a human-only baseline, which had no machine generated predictions. We found that skilled forecasters who had access to machine-generated forecasts outperformed those who only viewed historical data. We also demonstrated the inclusion of machine-generated forecasts in our aggregation algorithms improved performance, both in terms of accuracy and scalability. This suggests that hybrid forecasting systems, which potentially require fewer human resources, can be a viable approach for maintaining a competitive level of accuracy over a larger number of forecasting questions.},

Each mission supports a product family with multiple support teams, each requiring different skills for the engineers. We discuss three important aspects of such a large-scale deployment: (i) The use of a centralized team with a common machine learning infrastructure and practices to support the entire enterprise. (ii) The processes and quality of such a deployment from the perspective of one support mission, namely, IBM&#39;s z/OS family. (iii) Careful monitoring of the deployed models to detect drifts in the routing behavior. Despite vast differences in the technical contents of the support missions, it is possible to define common processes and metrics across the enterprise, without requiring a dedicated machine learning team for each mission. In addition, we provide examples of the business policies and metrics from the perspective of the z/OS mission to demonstrate the utility of the approach and the outcome.},

AI should aim to cooperate, not automate, by supporting and leveraging the creativity and problem-solving capabilities of designers. The challenge for such AI is how to infer designers&#39; goals and then help them without being needlessly disruptive. We introduce AI-assisted design, a new framework for creating such AI, built around generative user models, which allow it to infer and adapt to designers&#39; goals, reasoning, and capabilities.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses a key question of why businesses are failing to maximize business value from their artificial intelligence (AI) investments and proposes a strategic decision-making framework for AI decision-making to address this problem. We suggest that a firm&#39;s business strategy must drive AI-driven business outcomes and measurements, which in turn should drive the AI implementation decisions. Very often, we find that businesses fail to successfully cast business problems into AI problems. To bridge this gap, we propose that firms use a performance management system such as objectives and key results (OKRs) to ensure that the business and AI goals &amp; objectives are well defined, tightly aligned, and made transparent across the company, and the AI efforts are approached in an integrated manner by the different parts of a firm. We use McDonald&#39;s use of AI initiatives as a business use case to demonstrate support for our AI decision-making framework. We argue that using the business strategy as a primary driver will enable firms to solve the right problems using AI, turning it to be a source of technology innovation and competitive advantage.},

In this overview, we showcase Seq2Pat , a constraint-based sequential pattern mining (SPM) tool with a high-level declarative user interface. The library finds frequent patterns in large sequence databases subject to constraints. We highlight key benefits especially desirable in industrial settings where scalability, explainability, rapid experimentation, reusability, and reproducibility are of great practical interest. We then bridge SPM with supervised machine learning via dichotomic pattern mining (DPM). DPM exploits the dichotomy between outcomes correlated with patterns that uniquely distinguish them. Last, we present an automated feature extraction powered by Seq2Pat and DPM to discover high-level insights and boost downstream machine learning models for intent prediction in digital behavior analysis.},

It aims to attract users&#39; interest and improve user experience by highlighting product characteristics with textual descriptions. In this paper, we report our experience deploying the proposed Automatic Product Copywriting Generation (APCG) system into the JD.com e-commerce product recommendation platform. It consists of two main components: (1) natural language generation, which is built from a transformer–pointer network and a pretrained sequence-to-sequence model based on millions of training data from our in-house platform; and (2) copywriting quality control, which is based on both automatic evaluation and human screening. For selected domains, the models are trained and updated daily with the updated training data. In addition, the model is also used as a real-time writing assistant tool on our live broadcast platform. The APCG system has been deployed in JD.com since February 2021. By September 2021, it has generated 2.53 million product descriptions, and improved the overall averaged click-through rate (CTR) and the conversion rate (CVR) by 4.22 and 3.61%, compared to baselines, respectively, on a year-on-year basis. The accumulated gross merchandise volume (GMV) made by our system is improved by 213.42%, compared to the number in February 2021.},

  abstract     = {Micronutrient deficiency (MND), which is a form of malnutrition that can have serious health consequences, is difficult to diagnose in early stages without blood draws, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect and process. It is even more difficult at a public health scale seeking to identify regions at higher risk of MND. To provide data more widely and frequently, we propose an accurate, scalable, low-cost, and interpretable regional-level MND prediction system. Specifically, our work is the first to use satellite data, such as forest cover, weather, and presence of water, to predict deficiency of micronutrients such as iron, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin A, directly from their biomarkers. We use real-world, ground truth biomarker data collected from four different regions across Madagascar for training, and demonstrate that satellite data are viable for predicting regional-level MND, surprisingly exceeding the performance of baseline predictions based only on survey responses. Our method could be broadly applied to other countries where satellite data are available, and potentially create high societal impact if these predictions are used by policy makers, public health officials, or healthcare providers.},

  abstract     = {During the past decade, great significant advancements have been witnessed in the domain of automatic product description generation. As the services provided by e-commerce platforms become diverse, it is necessary to dynamically adapt the patterns of descriptions generated. The selling point of products is an important type of product description for which the length should be as short as possible while still conveying key information. In addition, this kind of product description should be eye-catching to the readers. Currently, product selling points are normally written by human experts. Thus, the creation and maintenance of these contents incur high costs. These costs can be significantly reduced if product selling points can be automatically generated by machines. In this paper, we report our experience developing and deploying the intelligent online selling point extraction (IOSPE) system to serve the recommendation system in the JD.com e-commerce platform. In addition, an interactive tool is released for merchants in JD.COM, which additionally allow them to select and customize the selling points with flexibility. Since July 2020, IOSPE has become a core service for 62 key categories of products (covering more than four million products). So far, it has generated more than 0.1 billion selling points, thereby significantly scaling up the selling point creation operation and saving human labor. These IOSPE-generated selling points have increased the click-through rate (CTR) by 1.89% and the average duration the customers spent on the products by more than 2.03% compared to the previous practice, which are significant improvements for such a large-scale e-commerce platform.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a promising technology to transform the healthcare industry. Due to the highly sensitive nature of patient data, federated learning (FL) is often leveraged to build models for smart healthcare applications. Existing deployed FL frameworks cannot address the key issues of varying data quality and heterogeneous data distributions across multiple institutions in this sector. In this paper, we report our experience developing and deploying the Contribution-Aware Federated Learning (CAreFL) framework for smart healthcare. It provides an efficient and accurate approach to fairly evaluate FL participants’ contributions to model performance without exposing their private data, and improves the FL model training protocol by allowing the best performing intermediate sub-models to be distributed to participants for FL training. Since its deployment by Yidu Cloud Technology Inc. in March 2021, CAreFL has served eight well-established medical institutions in China to build healthcare decision support models. It can perform contribution evaluations close to three times faster than the best existing approach and has improved the average accuracy of the resulting models by more than 2% compared to the previous system (which is significant in industrial settings). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first CAreFL successfully deployed in the healthcare industry.},
