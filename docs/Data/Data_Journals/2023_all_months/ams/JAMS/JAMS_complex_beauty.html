The equivariance is with respect to a group whose connected component is a torus. Character computation is done in two steps. First, we treat the case of distinguished $p$-characters: those that are not contained in a proper Levi. Here we essentially show that the category of equivariant modules we consider is a cell quotient of an affine parabolic category $\mathcal {O}$. For this, we prove an equivalence between two categorifications of a parabolically induced module over the affine Hecke algebra conjectured by the first named author. For the general nilpotent $p$-character, we get character formulas by explicitly computing the duality operator on a suitable equivariant K-group.},

  abstract     = {In 1981, Erdős and Hajnal asked whether the sum of the reciprocals of the odd cycle lengths in a graph with infinite chromatic number is necessarily infinite. Let $\mathcal {C}(G)$ be the set of cycle lengths in a graph $G$ and let $\mathcal {C}_{\mathrm {odd}}(G)$ be the set of odd numbers in $\mathcal {C}(G)$. We prove that, if $G$ has chromatic number $k$, then $\sum _{\ell \in \mathcal {C}_{\mathrm {odd}}(G)}1/\ell \geq (1/2-o_k(1))\log k$. This solves Erdős and Hajnal’s odd cycle problem, and, furthermore, this bound is asymptotically optimal. In 1984, Erdős asked whether there is some $d$ such that each graph with chromatic number at least $d$ (or perhaps even only average degree at least $d$) has a cycle whose length is a power of 2. We show that an average degree condition is sufficient for this problem, solving it with methods that apply to a wide range of sequences in addition to the powers of 2. Finally, we use our methods to show that, for every $k$, there is some $d$ so that every graph with average degree at least $d$ has a subdivision of the complete graph $K_k$ in which each edge is subdivided the same number of times. This confirms a conjecture of Thomassen from 1984.},

We prove that for $\epsilon &gt;0$ sufficiently small (but independent of $\nu$), initial data which are $O(\epsilon \nu ^{1/3})$-Sobolev space perturbations from the global Maxwellians lead to global-in-time solutions which converge to the global Maxwellians as $t\to \infty$. The solutions exhibit uniform-in-$\nu$ Landau damping and enhanced dissipation. Our main result is analogous to an earlier result of Bedrossian for the Vlasov–Poisson–Fokker–Planck equation with the same threshold. However, unlike in the Fokker–Planck case, the linear operator cannot be inverted explicitly due to the complexity of the Landau collision operator. For this reason, we develop an energy-based framework, which combines Guo’s weighted energy method with the hypocoercive energy method and the commuting vector field method. The proof also relies on pointwise resolvent estimates for the linearized density equation.},

Our second result is a formula for volume of hyperbolic orthoschemes, generalizing the formula of Lobachevsky in dimension three to an arbitrary dimension.

  abstract     = {For $(t,x) \in (0,\infty )\times \mathbb {T}^{\mathfrak {D}}$, the generalized Kasner solutions (which we refer to as Kasner solutions for short) are a family of explicit solutions to various Einstein-matter systems that, exceptional cases aside, start out smooth but then develop a Big Bang singularity as $t \downarrow 0$, i.e., a singularity along an entire spacelike hypersurface, where various curvature scalars blow up monotonically. The family is parameterized by the Kasner exponents $\widetilde {q}_1,\cdots ,\widetilde {q}_{\mathfrak {D}} \in \mathbb {R}$, which satisfy two algebraic constraints. There are heuristics in the mathematical physics literature, going back more than 50 years, suggesting that the Big Bang formation should be dynamically stable, that is, stable under perturbations of the Kasner initial data, given say at $\lbrace t = 1 \rbrace$, as long as the exponents are “sub-critical” in the following sense: $\underset {\substack {I,J,B=1,\cdots , \mathfrak {D}\\ I &lt; J}}{\max } \{\widetilde {q}_I+\widetilde {q}_J-\widetilde {q}_B\}&lt;1$. Previous works have rigorously shown the dynamic stability of the Kasner Big Bang singularity under stronger assumptions: (1) the Einstein-scalar field system with $\mathfrak {D}= 3$ and $\widetilde {q}_1 \approx \widetilde {q}_2 \approx \widetilde {q}_3 \approx 1/3$, which corresponds to the stability of the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker solution’s Big Bang or (2) the Einstein-vacuum equations for $\mathfrak {D}\geq 38$ with $\underset {I=1,\cdots ,\mathfrak {D}}{\max } |\widetilde {q}_I| &lt; 1/6$. In this paper, we prove that the Kasner singularity is dynamically stable for all sub-critical Kasner exponents, thereby justifying the heuristics in the literature in the full regime where stable monotonic-type curvature-blowup is expected. We treat in detail the $1+\mathfrak {D}$-dimensional Einstein-scalar field system for all $\mathfrak {D}\geq 3$ and the $1+\mathfrak {D}$-dimensional Einstein-vacuum equations for $\mathfrak {D}\geq 10$; both of these systems feature non-empty sets of sub-critical Kasner solutions. Moreover, for the Einstein-vacuum equations in $1+3$ dimensions, where instabilities are in general expected, we prove that all singular Kasner solutions have dynamically stable Big Bangs under polarized $U(1)$-symmetric perturbations of their initial data. Our results hold for open sets of initial data in Sobolev spaces without symmetry, apart from our work on polarized $U(1)$-symmetric solutions. Our proof relies on a new formulation of Einstein’s equations: we use a constant-mean-curvature foliation, and the unknowns are the scalar field, the lapse, the components of the spatial connection and second fundamental form relative to a Fermi–Walker transported spatial orthonormal frame, and the components of the orthonormal frame vectors with respect to a transported spatial coordinate system. In this formulation, the PDE evolution system for the structure coefficients of the orthonormal frame approximately diagonalizes in a way that sharply reveals the significance of the Kasner exponent sub-criticality condition for the dynamic stability of the flow: the condition leads to the time-integrability of many terms in the equations, at least at the low derivative levels. At the high derivative levels, the solutions that we study can be much more singular with respect to $t$, and to handle this difficulty, we use $t$-weighted high order energies, and we control non-linear error terms by exploiting monotonicity induced by the $t$-weights and interpolating between the singularity-strength of the solution’s low order and high order derivatives. Finally, we note that our formulation of Einstein’s equations highlights the quantities that might generate instabilities outside of the sub-critical regime.},

  abstract     = {We prove the existence of a locally dense set of real polynomial automorphisms of $\mathbb C^2$ displaying a wandering Fatou component; in particular this solves the problem of their existence, reported by Bedford and Smillie in 1991. These Fatou components have non-empty real trace and their statistical behavior is historic with high emergence. The proof is based on a geometric model for parameter families of surface real mappings. At a dense set of parameters, we show that the dynamics of the model displays a historic, high emergent, stable domain. We show that this model can be embedded into families of Hénon maps of explicit degree and also in an open and dense set of $5$-parameter $C^r$-families of surface diffeomorphisms in the Newhouse domain, for every $2\le r\le \infty$ and $r=\omega$. This implies a complement of the work of Kiriki and Soma [Adv. Math. 306 (2017), pp. 524–588], a proof of the last Taken’s problem in the $C^{\infty }$ and $C^\omega$-case. The main difficulty is that here perturbations are done only along finite-dimensional parameter families. The proof is based on the multi-renormalization introduced by Berger [ Zoology in the Hénon family: twin babies and Milnor’s swallows , 2018].},

We compute the Lie algebra cohomology of $T(X)$ with coefficients in $\mathbf k$. The answer is given in topological terms relative to any embedding $\mathbf k\subset \mathbb {C}$ and is analogous to the classical Gel′fand-Fuchs computation for smooth vector fields on a $C^\infty$-manifold. Unlike the $C^\infty$-case, our setup is purely algebraic: no topology on $T(X)$ is present. The proof is based on the techniques of factorization algebras, both in algebro-geometric and topological contexts.},

  abstract     = {This work concerns a map $\varphi \colon R\to S$ of commutative noetherian rings, locally of finite flat dimension. It is proved that the André-Quillen homology functors are rigid, namely, if $\mathrm {D}_n(S/R;-)=0$ for some $n\ge 1$, then $\mathrm {D}_i(S/R;-)=0$ for all $i\ge 2$ and ${\varphi }$ is locally complete intersection. This extends Avramov’s theorem that draws the same conclusion assuming $\mathrm {D}_n(S/R;-)$ vanishes for all $n\gg 0$, confirming a conjecture of Quillen. The rigidity of André-Quillen functors is deduced from a more general result about the higher cotangent modules which answers a question raised by Avramov and Herzog, and subsumes a conjecture of Vasconcelos that was proved recently by the first author. The new insight leading to these results concerns the equivariance of a map from André-Quillen cohomology to Hochschild cohomology defined using the universal Atiyah class of $\varphi$.},

Consequently, based on recent results of Wu [ Tightness and local fluctuation estimates for the KPZ line ensemble , 2021], Dimitrov and Matetski [Ann. Probab. 49 (2021), pp. 2477–2529], the KPZ line ensemble converges to the Airy line ensemble. For the KPZ equation we are able to start from a continuous function plus a finite collection of narrow wedges. For nearest neighbour exclusions, we can take (discretizations) of continuous functions with $|h(x)|\le C(1+\sqrt {|x|})$ for some $C&gt;0$, or one narrow wedge. For non-nearest neighbour exclusions, we are restricted at the present time to a class of (random) initial data, dense in continuous functions in the topology of uniform convergence on compacts. The method is by comparison of the transition probabilities of finite range exclusion processes and the totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes using energy estimates.},

  abstract     = {Classifying endotrivial $kG$-modules, i.e., elements of the Picard group of the stable module category for an arbitrary finite group $G$, has been a long-running quest. By deep work of Dade, Alperin, Carlson, Thévenaz, and others, it has been reduced to understanding the subgroup consisting of modular representations that split as the trivial module $k$ direct sum a projective module when restricted to a Sylow $p$-subgroup. In this paper we identify this subgroup as the first cohomology group of the orbit category on non-trivial $p$-subgroups with values in the units $k^\times$, viewed as a constant coefficient system. We then use homotopical techniques to give a number of formulas for this group in terms of the abelianization of normalizers and centralizers in $G$, in particular verifying the Carlson–Thévenaz conjecture—this reduces the calculation of this group to algorithmic calculations in local group theory rather than representation theory. We also provide strong restrictions on when such representations of dimension greater than one can occur, in terms of the $p$-subgroup complex and $p$-fusion systems. We immediately recover and extend a large number of computational results in the literature, and further illustrate the computational potential by calculating the group in other sample new cases, e.g., for the Monster at all primes.},

  abstract     = {We give a fully faithful integral model for simply connected finite complexes in terms of $\mathbb {E}_{\infty }$-ring spectra and the Nikolaus–Scholze Frobenius. The key technical input is the development of a homotopy coherent Frobenius action on a certain subcategory of $p$-complete $\mathbb {E}_{\infty }$-rings for each prime $p$. Using this, we show that the data of a simply connected finite complex $X$ is the data of its Spanier-Whitehead dual, as an $\mathbb {E}_{\infty }$-ring, together with a trivialization of the Frobenius action after completion at each prime. In producing the above Frobenius action, we explore two ideas which may be of independent interest. The first is a more general action of Frobenius in equivariant homotopy theory; we show that a version of Quillen’s $Q$-construction acts on the $\infty$-category of $\mathbb {E}_{\infty }$-rings with “genuine equivariant multiplication,” which we call global algebras. The second is a “pre-group-completed” variant of algebraic $K$-theory which we call partial $K$-theory . We develop the notion of partial $K$-theory and give a computation of the partial $K$-theory of $\mathbb {F}_p$ up to $p$-completion.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the problem of constructing fast matrix multiplication algorithms, Strassen (FOCS 1986, Crelle 1987–1991) introduced and developed the theory of asymptotic spectra of tensors. For any sub-semiring $\mathcal {X}$ of tensors (under direct sum and tensor product), the duality theorem that is at the core of this theory characterizes basic asymptotic properties of the elements of $\mathcal {X}$ in terms of the asymptotic spectrum of $\mathcal {X}$ , which is defined as the collection of semiring homomorphisms from $\mathcal {X}$ to the non-negative reals with a natural monotonicity property. The asymptotic properties characterized by this duality encompass fundamental problems in complexity theory, combinatorics and quantum information. Universal spectral points are elements in the asymptotic spectrum of the semiring of all tensors. Finding all universal spectral points suffices to find the asymptotic spectrum of any sub-semiring. The construction of non-trivial universal spectral points has been an open problem for more than thirty years. We construct, for the first time, a family of non-trivial universal spectral points over the complex numbers, called quantum functionals . We moreover prove that the quantum functionals precisely characterise the asymptotic slice rank of complex tensors. Our construction, which relies on techniques from quantum information theory and representation theory, connects the asymptotic spectrum of tensors to the quantum marginal problem and entanglement polytopes.},
