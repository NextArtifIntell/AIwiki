With a simple modification, a version of Newton‚Äôs iteration regains its local quadratic convergence to nonisolated zeros of smooth mappings assuming the solutions are semiregular as properly defined regardless of whether the system is square, underdetermined or overdetermined. Furthermore, the iteration serves as a de facto regularization mechanism for computing singular zeros from empirical data. Even if the given system is perturbed so that the nonisolated solution disappears, the iteration still locally converges to a stationary point that approximates a solution of the underlying system with an error bound in the same order of the data accuracy. Geometrically, the iteration approximately converges to the nearest point on the solution manifold. This extension simplifies nonlinear system modeling by eliminating the zero isolation process and enables a wide range of applications in algebraic computation.},

This allows us to define a general framework for solving optimization problems depending on two-dimensional minimization diagrams. The particular case of Voronoi diagrams is discussed to illustrate the general theory. A variety of numerical experiments is presented. The experiments include constructing Voronoi diagrams with cells of equal size, cells satisfying conditions on the relative size of their edges or their internal angles, cells with the midpoints of pairs of Voronoi and Delaunay edges as close as possible, or cells of varying sizes governed by a given function. Overall, the experiments show that the proposed methodology allows the construction of customized Voronoi diagrams using off-the-shelf well-established optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {A locally optimal preconditioned Newton-Schur method is proposed for solving symmetric elliptic eigenvalue problems. Firstly, the Steklov-Poincar√© operator is used to project the eigenvalue problem on the domain $\Omega$ onto the nonlinear eigenvalue subproblem on $\Gamma$, which is the union of subdomain boundaries. Then, the direction of correction is obtained via applying a non-overlapping domain decomposition method on $\Gamma$. Four different strategies are proposed to build the hierarchical subspace $U_{k+1}$ over the boundaries, which are based on the combination of the coarse-subspace with the directions of correction. Finally, the approximation of eigenpair is updated by solving a local optimization problem on the subspace $U_{k+1}$. The convergence rate of the locally optimal preconditioned Newton-Schur method is proved to be $\gamma =1-c_{0}T_{h,H}^{-1}$, where $c_{0}$ is a constant independent of the fine mesh size $h$, the coarse mesh size $H$ and jumps of the coefficients; whereas $T_{h,H}$ is the constant depending on stability of the decomposition.

  abstract     = {As a counterpoint to classical stochastic particle methods for linear diffusion equations, such as Langevin dynamics for the Fokker-Planck equation, we develop a deterministic particle method for the weighted porous medium equation and prove its convergence on bounded time intervals. This generalizes related work on blob methods for unweighted porous medium equations. From a numerical analysis perspective, our method has several advantages: it is meshfree, preserves the gradient flow structure of the underlying PDE, converges in arbitrary dimension, and captures the correct asymptotic behavior in simulations. The fact that our method succeeds in capturing the long time behavior of the weighted porous medium equation is significant from the perspective of related problems in quantization. Just as the Fokker-Planck equation provides a way to quantize a probability measure $\bar {\rho }$ by evolving an empirical measure $\rho ^N(t) = \frac {1}{N} \sum _{i=1}^N \delta _{X^i(t)}$ according to stochastic Langevin dynamics so that $\rho ^N(t)$ flows toward $\bar {\rho }$, our particle method provides a way to quantize $\bar {\rho }$ according to deterministic particle dynamics approximating the weighted porous medium equation. In this way, our method has natural applications to multi-agent coverage algorithms and sampling probability measures. A specific case of our method corresponds to confined mean-field dynamics of training a two-layer neural network for a radial basis activation function. From this perspective, our convergence result shows that, in the overparametrized regime and as the variance of the radial basis functions goes to zero, the continuum limit is given by the weighted porous medium equation. This generalizes previous results, which considered the case of a uniform data distribution, to the more general inhomogeneous setting. As a consequence of our convergence result, we identify conditions on the target function and data distribution for which convexity of the energy landscape emerges in the continuum limit.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the linear convection-diffusion equation in one dimension with periodic boundary conditions, and analyze the stability of fully discrete methods that are defined with local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) methods in space and several implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta methods in time. By using the forward temporal differences and backward temporal differences, respectively, we establish two general frameworks of the energy-method based stability analysis. From here, the fully discrete schemes being considered are shown to have monotonicity stability, i.e. the $L^2$ norm of the numerical solution does not increase in time, under the time step condition $\tau \le \mathcal {F}(h/c, d/c^2)$, with the convection coefficient $c$, the diffusion coefficient $d$, and the mesh size $h$. The function $\mathcal {F}$ depends on the specific IMEX temporal method, the polynomial degree $k$ of the discrete space, and the mesh regularity parameter. Moreover, the time step condition becomes $\tau \lesssim h/c$ in the convection-dominated regime and it becomes $\tau \lesssim d/c^2$ in the diffusion-dominated regime. The result is improved for a first order IMEX-LDG method. To complement the theoretical analysis, numerical experiments are further carried out, leading to slightly stricter time step conditions that can be used by practitioners. Uniform stability with respect to the strength of the convection and diffusion effects can especially be relevant to guide the choice of time step sizes in practice, e.g. when the convection-diffusion equations are convection-dominated in some sub-regions.},

These estimators pertain to a new Prager‚ÄìSynge identity and an associated equilibration procedure. They are reliable and efficient, and the error estimates are polynomial-degree-robust. In addition, when the domain is convex, the reliability constants are fully computable. The proposed error estimators are also cheap and easy to implement, as they are computed by solving divergence-constrained minimization problems over edge patches. Numerical examples highlight our key findings, and show that both estimators are suited to drive adaptive refinement algorithms. Besides, these examples seem to indicate that guaranteed upper bounds can be achieved even in non-convex domains.},

  abstract     = {This paper mainly studies the gradient-based Jacobi-type algorithms to maximize two classes of homogeneous polynomials with orthogonality constraints, and establish their convergence properties. For the first class of homogeneous polynomials subject to a constraint on a Stiefel manifold, we reformulate it as an optimization problem on a unitary group, which makes it possible to apply the gradient-based Jacobi-type (Jacobi-G) algorithm. Then, if the subproblem can always be represented as a quadratic form, we establish the global convergence of Jacobi-G under any one of three conditions. The convergence result for the first condition is an easy extension of the result by Usevich, Li, and Comon [SIAM J. Optim. 30 (2020), pp. 2998‚Äì3028], while other two conditions are new ones. This algorithm and the convergence properties apply to the well-known joint approximate symmetric tensor diagonalization. For the second class of homogeneous polynomials subject to constraints on the product of Stiefel manifolds, we reformulate it as an optimization problem on the product of unitary groups, and then develop a new gradient-based multiblock Jacobi-type (Jacobi-MG) algorithm to solve it. We establish the global convergence of Jacobi-MG under any one of the above three conditions, if the subproblem can always be represented as a quadratic form. This algorithm and the convergence properties are suitable to the well-known joint approximate tensor diagonalization. As the proximal variants of Jacobi-G and Jacobi-MG, we also propose the Jacobi-GP and Jacobi-MGP algorithms, and establish their global convergence without any further condition.

The key assumption is that the relaxation system satisfies Yong‚Äôs structural stability condition [J. Differential Equations, 155 (1999), pp. 89‚Äì132]. For the non-characteristic case, we derive a coupling condition at the interface to couple two systems in a domain decomposition setting. We prove the validity by the energy estimate and Laplace transform, which shows how the error of the domain decomposition method depends on the smaller relaxation time and the boundary-layer effects. In addition, we propose a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) numerical scheme for solving the interface problem with the derived coupling condition and prove the $L^2$ stability. We validate our analysis on the linearized Carleman model and the linearized Grad‚Äôs moment system and show the effectiveness of the DG scheme.},

On Shishkin-type meshes this method is known to be no greater than $O(N^{-(k+1/2)})$ accurate in the energy norm induced by the bilinear form of the weak formulation, where $N$ mesh intervals are used in each coordinate direction. (Note: all bounds in this abstract are uniform in the singular perturbation parameter and neglect logarithmic factors that will appear in our detailed analysis.) A delicate argument is used in this paper to establish $O(N^{-(k+1)})$ energy-norm superconvergence on all three types of mesh for the difference between the LDG solution and a local Gauss-Radau projection of the true solution into the finite element space. This supercloseness property implies a new $N^{-(k+1)}$ bound for the $L^2$ error between the LDG solution on each type of mesh and the true solution of the problem; this bound is optimal (up to logarithmic factors).

  abstract     = {In micro-fluidics, both capillarity and thermal fluctuations play an important role. On the level of the lubrication approximation, this leads to a quasi-linear fourth-order parabolic equation for the film height $h$ driven by space-time white noise. The (formal) gradient flow structure of its deterministic counterpart, the so-called thin-film equation, which encodes the balance between driving capillary and limiting viscous forces, provides the guidance for the thermodynamically consistent introduction of fluctuations. We follow this route on the level of a spatial discretization of the gradient flow structure, i.e., on the level of a discretization of energy functional and dissipative metric tensor. Starting from an energetically conformal finite-element (FE) discretization, we point out that the numerical mobility function introduced by Gr√ºn and Rumpf can be interpreted as a discretization of the metric tensor in the sense of a mixed FE method with lumping. While this discretization was devised in order to preserve the so-called entropy estimate, we use this to show that the resulting high-dimensional stochastic differential equation (SDE) preserves pathwise and pointwise strict positivity, at least in case of the physically relevant mobility function arising from the no-slip boundary condition. As a consequence, and as opposed to previous discretizations of the thin-film equation with thermal noise, the above discretization is not in need of an artificial condition at the boundary of the configuration space orthant $\{h&gt;0\}$ (which, admittedly, could also be avoided by modelling a disjoining pressure). Thus, this discretization gives rise to a consistent invariant measure, namely a discretization of the Brownian excursion (up to the volume constraint), and thus features an entropic repulsion. The price to pay over more direct discretizations is that when writing the SDE in It√¥‚Äôs form, which is the basis for the Euler-Mayurama time discretization, a correction term appears. We perform various numerical experiments to compare the behavior and performance of our discretization to that of a particular finite difference discretization of the equation. Among other things, we study numerically the invariance and entropic repulsion of the invariant measure and provide evidence for the fact that the finite difference discretization touches down almost surely while our discretization stays away from the $\partial \{h &gt; 0\}$.},

  abstract     = {A polyhedron $\mathbf {P} \subset \mathbb {R}^3$ has Rupert‚Äôs property if a hole can be cut into it, such that a copy of $\mathbf {P}$ can pass through this hole. There are several works investigating this property for some specific polyhedra: for example, it is known that all 5 Platonic and 9 out of the 13 Archimedean solids admit Rupert‚Äôs property. A commonly believed conjecture states that every convex polyhedron is Rupert. We prove that Rupert‚Äôs problem is algorithmically decidable for polyhedra with algebraic coordinates. We also design a probabilistic algorithm which can efficiently prove that a given polyhedron is Rupert. Using this algorithm we not only confirm this property for the known Platonic and Archimedean solids, but also prove it for one of the remaining Archimedean polyhedra and many others. Moreover, we significantly improve on almost all known Nieuwland numbers and finally conjecture, based on statistical evidence, that the Rhombicosidodecahedron is in fact not Rupert.},

If $\phi$ admits an inverse rational map $\phi ^{-1}$, it is a tri-linear birational map. In this paper, we address computational and geometric aspects about these transformations. We give a characterization of birationality based on the first syzygies of the entries. More generally, we describe all the possible minimal graded free resolutions of the ideal generated by these entries. With respect to geometry, we show that the set $\mathfrak {Bir}_{(1,1,1)}$ of tri-linear birational maps, up to composition with an automorphism of $\mathbb {P}_\mathbb {C}^3$, is a locally closed algebraic subset of the Grassmannian of $4$-dimensional subspaces in the vector space of tri-linear polynomials, and has eight irreducible components. Additionally, the group action on $\mathfrak {Bir}_{(1,1,1)}$ given by composition with automorphisms of $(\mathbb {P}_\mathbb {C}^1)^3$ defines 19 orbits, and each of these orbits determines an isomorphism class of the base loci of these transformations.},

Since all the hyperelliptic curves $X_0(n)$ are of genus $\leq 5$ and as a curve can have infinitely many quadratic points only if it is either of genus $\leq 1$, hyperelliptic or bielliptic, the question of describing the quadratic points on the bielliptic modular curves $X_0(n)$ naturally arises; this question has recently also been posed by Mazur. We answer Mazur‚Äôs question completely and describe the quadratic points on all the bielliptic modular curves $X_0(n)$ for which this has not been done already. The values of $n$ that we deal with are $n=60$, $62$, $69$, $79$, $83$, $89$, $92$, $94$, $95$, $101$, $119$ and $131$; the curves $X_0(n)$ are of genus up to $11$. We find all the exceptional points on these curves and show that they all correspond to CM elliptic curves. The two main methods we use are Box‚Äôs relative symmetric Chabauty method and an application of a moduli description of $\mathbb {Q}$-curves of degree $d$ with an independent isogeny of degree $m$, which reduces the problem to finding the rational points on several quotients of modular curves.},

Our assertion draws on the pointwise error estimate using the reproducing kernel of Jacobi polynomials and the Hilb-type formula on the asymptotic of the Bessel transforms. We also study the local superconvergence and show the gain in order and the subregions it occurs. As a by-product of this new argument, the undesired $\log n$-factor in the pointwise error estimate for the Legendre expansion recently stated in BabusÃÜka and Hakula [Comput. Methods Appl.

To this end, we first estimate the rank of a bivariate approximation, i.e., the rank of the continuous singular value decomposition. In comparison to the case of functions from Sobolev spaces with isotropic smoothness, compare Griebel and Harbrecht [IMA J. Numer. Anal. 34 (2014), pp. 28‚Äì54] and Griebel and Harbrecht [IMA J.

  abstract     = {The augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) is classic for canonical convex programming problems with linear constraints, and it finds many applications in various scientific computing areas. A major advantage of the ALM is that the step for updating the dual variable can be further relaxed with a step size in $(0,2)$, and this advantage can easily lead to numerical acceleration for the ALM. When a separable convex programming problem is discussed and a corresponding splitting version of the classic ALM is considered, convergence may not be guaranteed and thus it is seemingly impossible that a step size in $(0,2)$ can be carried on to the relaxation step for updating the dual variable. We show that for a parallel splitting version of the ALM, a step size in $(0,2)$ can be maintained for further relaxing both the primal and dual variables if the relaxation step is simply corrected by a rank-two matrix. Hence, a rank-two relaxed parallel splitting version of the ALM with a step size in $(0,2)$ is proposed for separable convex programming problems. We validate that the new algorithm can numerically outperform existing algorithms of the same kind significantly by testing some applications.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an interior penalty virtual element method (IPVEM) is developed for solving the biharmonic problem on polygonal meshes. By modifying the existing $H^2$-conforming virtual element, an $H^1$-nonconforming virtual element is obtained with the same degrees of freedom as the usual $H^1$-conforming virtual element, such that it locally has $H^2$-regularity on each polygon in meshes. To enforce the $C^1$ continuity of the solution, an interior penalty formulation is adopted. Hence, this new numerical scheme can be regarded as a combination of the virtual element space and discontinuous Galerkin scheme. Compared with the existing methods, this approach has some advantages in reducing the degree of freedom and capability of handling hanging nodes. The well-posedness and optimal convergence of the IPVEM are proven in a mesh-dependent norm. We also derive a sharp estimate of the condition number of the linear system associated with IPVEM. Some numerical results are presented to verify the optimal convergence of the IPVEM and the sharp estimate of the condition number of the discrete problem. Besides, in the numerical test, the IPVEM has a good performance in computational accuracy by contrast with the other VEMs solving the biharmonic problem.},

In this note we give a construction of an explicit $\lambda$-Poisson generic sequence over any alphabet and any positive $\lambda$, except for the case of the two-symbol alphabet, in which it is required that $\lambda$ be less than or equal to the natural logarithm of $2$. Since $\lambda$-Poisson genericity implies Borel normality, the constructed sequences are Borel normal.

A novel augmented Lagrangian method of multipliers (ALM) is then presented. Our method is originated from a generalization of the Hestenes-Powell augmented Lagrangian, and is a combination of the augmented Lagrangian and the interior-point technique. It shares a similar algorithmic framework with existing ALMs for optimization with inequality constraints, but it can use the second derivatives and does not depend on projections on the set of inequality constraints. In each iteration, our method solves a twice continuously differentiable unconstrained optimization subproblem on primal variables. The dual iterates, penalty and smoothing parameters are updated adaptively. The global and local convergence are analyzed. Without assuming any constraint qualification, it is proved that the proposed method has strong global convergence. The method may converge to either a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point or a singular stationary point when the converging point is a minimizer. It may also converge to an infeasible stationary point of nonlinear program when the problem is infeasible. Furthermore, our method is capable of rapidly detecting the possible infeasibility of the solved problem. Under suitable conditions, it is locally linearly convergent to the KKT point, which is consistent with ALMs for optimization with equality constraints. The preliminary numerical experiments on some small benchmark test problems demonstrate our theoretical results.},

Gearhart, Koshy and Tam have developed an acceleration technique for the Kaczmarz method that minimizes the distance to the desired solution in the direction of a full Kaczmarz step. The present paper generalizes this technique to an acceleration scheme that minimizes the Euclidean norm error over an affine subspace spanned by a number of previous iterates and one additional cycle of the Kaczmarz method. The key challenge is to find a formulation in which all parameters of the least-squares problem defining the unique minimizer are known, and to solve this problem efficiently. When only a single Kaczmarz cycle is considered, the proposed affine search is more effective than the Gearhart-Koshy/Tam line-search, which in turn is more effective than the underlying Kaczmarz method. A numerical experiment from the context of computerized tomography suggests that the proposed affine search has the potential to outperform the the Gearhart-Koshy/Tam line-search and the underlying Kaczmarz method in terms of the computational cost that is needed to achieve a given error tolerance.},

We show that the new discretisation enjoys the same excellent approximation properties as the classical Trefftz one, and prove stability and high-order convergence of the DG scheme. We introduce polynomial basis functions for the new discrete spaces and describe a simple algorithm to compute them.

  abstract     = {We consider the numerical analysis of the inchworm Monte Carlo method, which is proposed recently to tackle the numerical sign problem for open quantum systems. We focus on the growth of the numerical error with respect to the simulation time, for which the inchworm Monte Carlo method shows a flatter curve than the direct application of Monte Carlo method to the classical Dyson series. To better understand the underlying mechanism of the inchworm Monte Carlo method, we distinguish two types of exponential error growth, which are known as the numerical sign problem and the error amplification. The former is due to the fast growth of variance in the stochastic method, which can be observed from the Dyson series, and the latter comes from the evolution of the numerical solution. Our analysis demonstrates that the technique of partial resummation can be considered as a tool to balance these two types of error, and the inchworm Monte Carlo method is a successful case where the numerical sign problem is effectively suppressed by such means. We first demonstrate our idea in the context of ordinary differential equations, and then provide complete analysis for the inchworm Monte Carlo method. Several numerical experiments are carried out to verify our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {We establish improved uniform error bounds for the time-splitting methods for the long-time dynamics of the Schr√∂dinger equation with small potential and the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation (NLSE) with weak nonlinearity. For the Schr√∂dinger equation with small potential characterized by a dimensionless parameter $\varepsilon \in (0, 1]$, we employ the unitary flow property of the (second-order) time-splitting Fourier pseudospectral (TSFP) method in $L^2$-norm to prove a uniform error bound at time $t_\varepsilon =t/\varepsilon$ as $C(t)\widetilde {C}(T)(h^m +\tau ^2)$ up to $t_\varepsilon \leq T_\varepsilon = T/\varepsilon$ for any $T&gt;0$ and uniformly for $\varepsilon \in (0,1]$, while $h$ is the mesh size, $\tau$ is the time step, $m \ge 2$ and $\tilde {C}(T)$ (the local error bound) depend on the regularity of the exact solution, and $C(t) =C_0+C_1t$ grows at most linearly with respect to $t$ with $C_0$ and $C_1$ two positive constants independent of $T$, $\varepsilon$, $h$ and $\tau$. Then by introducing a new technique of regularity compensation oscillation (RCO) in which the high frequency modes are controlled by regularity and the low frequency modes are analyzed by phase cancellation and energy method, an improved uniform (w.r.t $\varepsilon$) error bound at $O(h^{m-1} + \varepsilon \tau ^2)$ is established in $H^1$-norm for the long-time dynamics up to the time at $O(1/\varepsilon )$ of the Schr√∂dinger equation with $O(\varepsilon )$-potential with $m \geq 3$. Moreover, the RCO technique is extended to prove an improved uniform error bound at $O(h^{m-1} + \varepsilon ^2\tau ^2)$ in $H^1$-norm for the long-time dynamics up to the time at $O(1/\varepsilon ^2)$ of the cubic NLSE with $O(\varepsilon ^2)$-nonlinearity strength. Extensions to the first-order and fourth-order time-splitting methods are discussed. Numerical results are reported to validate our error estimates and to demonstrate that they are sharp.},

The application of the inverse operator to some standard finite element space defines an approximation space with uniform algebraic approximation rates with respect to the mesh size parameter $H$. This holds even for under-resolved rough coefficients. However, the true challenge of numerical homogenization is the localized computation of a localized basis for such an operator-dependent approximation space. This paper presents a novel localization technique that leads to a super-exponential decay of its basis relative to $H$. This suggests that basis functions with supports of width $\mathcal O(H|\log H|^{(d-1)/d})$ are sufficient to preserve the optimal algebraic rates of convergence in $H$ without pre-asymptotic effects. A sequence of numerical experiments illustrates the significance of the new localization technique when compared to the so far best localization to supports of width $\mathcal O(H|\log H|)$.},

  abstract     = {Finding roots of univariate polynomials is one of the fundamental tasks of numerics, and there is still a wide gap between root finders that are well understood in theory and those that perform well in practice. We investigate the root-finding method of Weierstrass, also known as the Durand‚ÄìKerner-method: this is a root finder that tries to approximate all roots of a given polynomial in parallel. This method has been introduced 130 years ago and has since then a good reputation for finding all roots in practice except in obvious cases of symmetry. Nonetheless, very little is known about its global dynamics and convergence properties. We show that the Weierstrass method, like the well-known Newton method, is not generally convergent: there are open sets of polynomials $p$ of every degree $d \ge 3$ such that the dynamics of the Weierstrass method applied to $p$ exhibits attracting periodic orbits. Specifically, all polynomials sufficiently close to $Z^3 + Z + 175$ have attracting cycles of period $4$. Here, period $4$ is minimal: we show that for cubic polynomials, there are no periodic orbits of length $2$ or $3$ that attract open sets of starting points. We also establish another convergence problem for the Weierstrass method: for almost every polynomial of degree $d\ge 3$ there are orbits that are defined for all iterates but converge to $\infty$; this is a problem that does not occur for Newton‚Äôs method. Our results are obtained by first interpreting the original problem coming from numerical mathematics in terms of higher-dimensional complex dynamics, then phrasing the question in algebraic terms in such a way that we could finally answer it by applying methods from computer algebra. The main innovation here is the translation into an algebraic question, which is amenable to (exact) computational methods close to the limits of current computer algebra systems.},

Recently, LBreI has been extended to a larger class of nonconvex functions, along with several theoretical issues left for further investigation. In particular, the Lipschitz gradient continuity assumption precludes its use in many practical applications. In this study, we propose a generalized algorithmic framework to unify LBreI-type methods. Our main discovery is that the Lipschitz gradient continuity assumption can be replaced by a Lipschitz-like convexity condition in both convex and nonconvex cases. As a by-product, a class of bilevel optimization problems can be solved in the proposed framework, which extends the main result made by Cai et al. [Math. Comp. 78 (2009), pp. 2127‚Äì2136].

  abstract     = {Boundary integral numerical methods are among the most accurate methods for interfacial Stokes flow, and are widely applied. They have the advantage that only the boundary of the domain must be discretized, which reduces the number of discretization points and allows the treatment of complicated interfaces. Despite their popularity, there is no analysis of the convergence of these methods for interfacial Stokes flow. In practice, the stability of discretizations of the boundary integral formulation can depend sensitively on details of the discretization and on the application of numerical filters. We present a convergence analysis of the boundary integral method for Stokes flow, focusing on a rather general method for computing the evolution of an elastic capsule or viscous drop in 2D strain and shear flows. The analysis clarifies the role of numerical filters in practical computations.},

  abstract     = {Within the framework of parameter dependent Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), we develop a constructive approach based on Deep Neural Networks for the efficient approximation of the parameter-to-solution map. The research is motivated by the limitations and drawbacks of state-of-the-art algorithms, such as the Reduced Basis method, when addressing problems that show a slow decay in the Kolmogorov $n$-width. Our work is based on the use of deep autoencoders, which we employ for encoding and decoding a high fidelity approximation of the solution manifold. To provide guidelines for the design of deep autoencoders, we consider a nonlinear version of the Kolmogorov $n$-width over which we base the concept of a minimal latent dimension. We show that the latter is intimately related to the topological properties of the solution manifold, and we provide theoretical results with particular emphasis on second order elliptic PDEs, characterizing the minimal dimension and the approximation errors of the proposed approach. The theory presented is further supported by numerical experiments, where we compare the proposed approach with classical Principal Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)-Galerkin reduced order models. In particular, we consider parametrized advection-diffusion PDEs, and we test the methodology in the presence of strong transport fields, singular terms and stochastic coefficients.},

By computing explicit models for these double covers we find all pairs $(N, r)$ such that there exist infinitely many $j$-invariants of elliptic curves $E/\mathbb {Q}$ which are $N$-congruent with power $r$ to a quadratic twist of $E$. We also find an example of a $48$-congruence over $\mathbb {Q}$. We make a conjecture classifying nontrivial $(N,r)$-congruences between quadratic twists of elliptic curves over $\mathbb {Q}$. Finally, we give a more detailed analysis of the level $15$ case. We use elliptic Chabauty to determine the rational points on a modular curve of genus $2$ whose Jacobian has rank $2$ and which arises as a double cover of the modular curve $X(\mathrm {ns\,} 3^+, \mathrm {ns\,} 5^+)$.

Our method only assumes that we can evaluate the integrand function $f$ and does not assume a particular density nor the ability to sample from it. In particular, for the theoretical analysis we show a new result that the method of adding Bernoulli polynomials to a function to make it ‚Äúperiodic‚Äù on a box without changing its integral value over the box is equivalent to an orthogonal projection from a well chosen Sobolev space of dominating mixed smoothness to an associated periodic Sobolev space of the same dominating mixed smoothness, which we call a Korobov space. We note that the Bernoulli polynomial method is often not used because of its excessive computational complexity and also here we only make use of it in our theoretical analysis. We show that our new method of applying scaled lattice rules to increasing boxes can be interpreted as orthogonal projections with decreasing projection error. Such a method would not work on the unit cube since then the committed error caused by non-periodicity of the integrand would be constant, but for integration on the Euclidean space we can use the certain decay towards zero when the boxes grow. Hence we can bound the truncation error as well as the projection error and show higher-order convergence in applying scaled lattice rules for integration on Euclidean space. We illustrate our theoretical analysis by numerical experiments which confirm our findings.},

The resulting method is semiexplicit in the sense that the main time evolution step is explicit whereas the symmetric projection step is implicit. The symmetric projection binds potentially diverging copies of solutions, thereby remedying the main drawback of the extended phase space approach. Moreover, our semiexplicit method is symplectic in the original phase space. This is in contrast to existing extended phase space integrators, which are symplectic only in the extended phase space. We demonstrate that our method exhibits an excellent long-time preservation of invariants, and also that it tends to be as fast as and can be faster than Tao‚Äôs explicit modified extended phase space integrator particularly for small enough time steps and with higher-order implementations and for higher-dimensional problems.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a new numerical method and its analysis to solve eigenvalue problems for self-adjoint Schr√∂dinger operators, by combining the Feshbach‚ÄìSchur perturbation theory with the spectral Fourier discretization. In order to analyze the method, we establish an abstract framework of Feshbach‚ÄìSchur perturbation theory with minimal regularity assumptions on the potential that is then applied to the setting of the new spectral Fourier discretization method. Finally, we present some numerical results that underline the theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {The Restricted Additive Schwarz method with impedance transmission conditions, also known as the Optimised Restricted Additive Schwarz (ORAS) method, is a simple overlapping one-level parallel domain decomposition method, which has been successfully used as an iterative solver and as a preconditioner for discretised Helmholtz boundary-value problems. In this paper, we give, for the first time, a convergence analysis for ORAS as an iterative solver‚Äîand also as a preconditioner‚Äîfor nodal finite element Helmholtz systems of any polynomial order. The analysis starts by showing (for general domain decompositions) that ORAS is an unconventional finite element approximation of a classical parallel iterative Schwarz method, formulated at the PDE (non-discrete) level. This non-discrete Schwarz method was recently analysed in [Gong, Gander, Graham, Lafontaine, and Spence, Convergence of parallel overlapping domain decomposition methods for the Helmholtz equation ], and the present paper gives a corresponding discrete version of this analysis. In particular, for domain decompositions in strips in 2-d, we show that, when the mesh size is small enough, ORAS inherits the convergence properties of the Schwarz method, independent of polynomial order. The proof relies on characterising the ORAS iteration in terms of discrete ‚Äòimpedance-to-impedance maps‚Äô, which we prove (via a novel weighted finite-element error analysis) converge as $h\rightarrow 0$ in the operator norm to their non-discrete counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Spatial discretizations of time-dependent partial differential equations usually result in a large system of semi-linear and stiff ordinary differential equations. Taking the structures into account, we develop a family of linearly implicit and high order accurate schemes for the time discretization, using the idea of implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta methods and the relaxation techniques. The proposed schemes are monotonicity-preserving/conservative for the original problems, while the previous linearized methods are usually not. We also discuss the linear stability and strong stability preserving (SSP) property of the new relaxation methods. Numerical experiments on several typical models are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Shape spaces are fundamental in a variety of applications including image registration, morphing, matching, interpolation, and shape optimization. In this work, we consider two-dimensional shapes represented by triangular meshes of a given connectivity. We show that the collection of admissible configurations representable by such meshes forms a smooth manifold. For this manifold of planar triangular meshes we propose a geodesically complete Riemannian metric. It is a distinguishing feature of this metric that it preserves the mesh connectivity and prevents the mesh from degrading along geodesic curves. We detail a symplectic numerical integrator for the geodesic equation in its Hamiltonian formulation. Numerical experiments show that the proposed metric keeps the cell aspect ratios bounded away from zero and thus avoids mesh degradation along arbitrarily long geodesic curves.},
