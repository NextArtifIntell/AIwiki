Based on the relative virtual framework and the classical differential geometry curve theory, such method is divided into two parts: 1) the design of the relative trajectory-length-control (RTLC) guidance law against virtual stationary targets, and 2) the design of the prediction algorithms based on the guidance law or its characteristics. The former realizes RTLC, and the latter establishes the relationship between the desired relative trajectory length-to-go and the desired time-to-go, thus implementing impact-time control. Furthermore, based on the analytical properties of the guidance law in the relative arc-length domain, its performance, characteristics, and allowable impact time are analyzed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed guidance method and the validity of the theoretical findings are verified by numerical simulations results.},

Therefore, an aerodynamics-driven monoplane–biplane morphing (MBM) aircraft was proposed, which cruises as a high-aspect-ratio monoplane and takes off and lands as a biplane, switching between two patterns during flight. This concept of MBM was validated in our previous work via wind tunnel experiments. We further develop it beyond this phase and introduce its applications under real flight conditions here. We constructed a test plane with a wingspan of 6 m and conducted a series of flight experiments on it. To examine its performance and facilitate its initial flight test, we built aerodynamic and dynamic models of the aircraft to analyze its morphing behavior through simulations. The corresponding controller algorithm and hardware system were also developed. The successful implementation of these systems enables bidirectional morphing during flight from a large-span monoplane to a half-span biplane. The test results, comprising data and photographs, validated the success of these trials. The concept of MBM, the corresponding models, and the control algorithm for morphing were thus verified.},

To ensure fairness, the central database follows a first-come, first-served approach, accepting new operational intents as long as they do not conflict with any active ones. However, creating a viable operational intent is challenging due to moving obstacles. This paper introduces an innovative optimization-based procedure to automate the intent filing process. It utilizes a stacked hexagonal tessellation to model the airspace, offering adjustable granularity. Path finding is accomplished using integer programming on the hex grid. The integer program is solved on a grid canvas that includes only necessary cells, striking a balance between computational efficiency and optimality. Simulation experiments demonstrate the procedure’s effectiveness in generating feasible trajectories, even in scenarios with dense, omnidirectional air traffic. This procedure has the potential to become the foundational software core for low-altitude air traffic management systems, providing strategic deconfliction and constraint management services.},

The SSOCP possesses good real-time performance. However, one long-standing challenge is its unguaranteed convergence. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the descent property of the penalty function in the SSOCP. Using Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions, we obtain two important theoretical results: 1) the penalty function of the original nonlinear problem always descends along the iteration direction; 2) a sufficiently small trust region can decrease the penalty function. Based on these two results, we design an improved trust region shrinking algorithm with theoretically guaranteed convergence. In numerical simulations, we verify the proposed algorithm using a reentry trajectory optimization problem.},

We leverage theoretical advancement in the field of sampling-based motion planning in robotics and extend their application to achieve motion planning in astrodynamics. We present an astrodynamics-informed kinodynamic motion planning (AIKMP) algorithm that takes advantage of a spacecraft’s natural motion to compute a safe, fuel-efficient motion plan for spacecraft reconfiguration in a cluttered environment. This algorithm is developed in the relative orbital element space of the deputy spacecraft around a chief spacecraft that provides very useful geometric insight to relative spacecraft motion, as well as helps in generating an overall smooth final transfer trajectory without demanding additional postprocessing of the transfer solution. Through several example scenarios, we demonstrate that the AIKMP algorithm is regularly able to compute safe and fuel-efficient solutions to relative transfer problems. We also show that this algorithm iteratively improves on its computed solutions and thus holds the capability of finding near-optimal transfer solutions given a sufficient number of algorithm iterations—without requiring an initial guess of the solution.},

The main motivation behind this work is the Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometry mission, which will feature a large rotating microwave radiometer to provide observations of sea-surface temperature, sea-ice concentration, and sea-surface salinity. Due to the presence of highly uncertain inertial asymmetries in the rotating device, potentially large internal forces and torques can appear at interface between the spacecraft and the rotor, which can cause a significant degradation of the system performance and can even affect its stability. To counteract such unbalance effects, an active balancing system made of a suitable set of actuated movable masses and sensors is developed in this work. Exploiting the time-periodic nature of the underlying dynamics, a harmonic controller has been designed to command the positions of the actuated masses in such a way that the effects of rotor unbalance are significantly reduced. After extensive numerical simulations, accounting for both parametric uncertainties and exogenous disturbances in the model, a dedicated breadboard has been developed and experimental validation of the control law has been carried out.},

  abstract     = {Traditional spacecraft design paradigms rely on stiff bus structures with comparatively flexible appendages. More recent trends, however, trade deployed stiffness for packaging efficiency to stow apertures with larger areas inside existing launch vehicles. By leveraging recent advances in materials and structures, these spacecraft may be up to several orders of magnitude lighter and more flexible than the current state of the art. Motivated by the goal of achieving agility despite structural flexibility, this paper proposes and verifies a quantitative method for determining structure-based performance limits for maneuvering flexible spacecraft. The results demonstrate that, contrary to common assumptions, other constraints impose more restrictive limits on maneuverability than the dynamics of the structure. In particular, it is shown that an attitude control system’s available angular momentum and torque are often significantly more limiting than the compliance of the structure. Consequently, these results suggest that there is an opportunity to design less-conservative, higher-performance space systems that can either be maneuvered faster (assuming suitable actuators are available) or built using lighter-weight, less-stiff architectures that move the structure-based performance limits closer to those of the rest of the system.},

A segmented approach is analyzed where the acceleration profile over a given period of time is approximated as a piecewise-constant profile. Noisy measurements of the spacecraft’s position are collected throughout the acceleration profile, from which the constant acceleration for each segment of the piecewise-constant profile can be inferred. The primary contribution of this work is an analytical approximation for the sensitivity of each measurement with respect to the constant acceleration of each segment. The resulting analytically approximated sensitivity matrix enables an analytical reconstruction of the acceleration profile given a numerically simulated reference trajectory. Applications of the segmented approach for thrust inference for both discontinuous and continuous thrust profiles are demonstrated. In particular, the reconstruction of a simulated thruster degradation profile over the course of 60 h is shown.},

Once perturbations are imposed on two-body dynamics, one often studies the time evolution of the orbital elements. Moving in complexity beyond two-body perturbations [that is, studying the dynamics in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP)], the Keplerian orbital elements are no longer well defined in certain regions of phase space, especially when the gravitational attractions of both the primary and secondary bodies have similar magnitudes, as occurs in the vicinity of the libration points. In this work, we define a generalization of orbit elements that can be applied in these regions and others. Specifically, we define a set of semi-analytical action-angle orbital elements that are defined locally about any bounded special solution in the CR3BP: equilibria, periodic orbits, and quasi-periodic orbits. Local action-angle orbital elements are defined using action-angle coordinates in the Birkhoff–Gustavson normal form about the bounded invariant manifold. We include detailed examples around the five equilibria in the Earth–Moon CR3BP.},

When a spacecraft makes contact with the surface, it must maintain a desired contact force in order to capture a sample. The properties of the surface are unknown or uncertain before contact with the surface is made. Because the nominal robust controller may have poor performance in some surface property regimes, the goal is to improve performance using an adaptive controller. The adaptive controller performs system identification online to create an input–output model of the feedback-linearized system. From the input–output model, a block-observable canonical form is realized and the control input augmentation is determined by model predictive control. The resulting augmentation is added to the input of the robust controller to improve the closed-loop performance and maintain a desired contact force despite the unknown surface properties. The approach is applied to a variety of surface properties with linear and nonlinear contact models and multiple surface sampling maneuvers.},

  abstract     = {As outer space becomes increasingly congested, there exists a growing need for auxiliary spacecraft to perform support missions for existing satellites with guarantees for safety and mission success. We focus on a multispacecraft inspection mission, wherein a team of “deputy” spacecraft inspect a passive “chief” spacecraft by traveling to a set of inspection points while satisfying a set of safety constraints, namely, that they avoid aligning themselves with the sun, that they avoid colliding with one another, and that they avoid colliding with the chief. We model the deputy dynamics using the Clohessy–Wiltshire–Hill equations, and subsequently discretize the environment by exploiting elliptical natural motion trajectories. Using this finite state space, we construct a Markov decision process (MDP) model of the environment and determine the optimal sequence of inspection points for each deputy to visit by solving a vehicle routing problem. To ensure that the deputies satisfy the safety constraints, we form the product MDP of the original MDP and a nondeterministic Büchi automaton that encodes the sensing task and safety constraints. Using this product MDP, we propose a pair of decentralized algorithms that each seeks to minimize the weighted combination of the time and fuel required to safely complete the mission. The first is an offline algorithm that synthesizes a safe trajectory for each deputy that requires no communication at runtime, while the second is an online algorithm that enforces safety at runtime by leveraging communication between the deputies. We provide numerical examples demonstrating the efficacy of both proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a computational impact angle control guidance law against a stationary target considering the seeker’s field-of-view (FOV) limit based on a deep reinforcement learning (RL) method. The proposed guidance law generates the acceleration command as a sum of the baseline command and bias command where the bias command is learned through a sequence of learning stages. Each stage trains an RL agent that addresses the impact angle and the FOV limit constraint individually. This approach is favorable in that the succeeding training process tends to preserve the functionality of the guidance law attained in the previous stage. In addition, the proposed method can be easily extended to a missile model with additional elements such as rotational dynamics without the necessity of modifying the algorithm. The proximal policy optimization algorithm is used for training the RL agents. Numerical simulation is carried out under various conditions to analyze the performance and the effects of a design parameter on the performance. The learning strategy proposed in this study provides a way to apply a data-driven method to developing a guidance law under multiple design objectives and more realistic missile models.},

In particular, this paper focuses on the generation of the analytical transformations between osculating and mean elements under this perturbation. This is done using a power series expansion in the perturbation constant on all the variables of the system, and a time regularization based on the argument of latitude of the orbit. This enables the generation of analytic approximate solutions without the need to control the perturbed frequency of the system. The resultant approximations provide the osculating behavior of the problem as well as the transformations between osculating and mean elements for orbits at any eccentricity, including near-circular, elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic orbits. Several examples of application are presented to show the accuracy of the perturbation approach and their related transformations.},

The integration of these two components facilitates the design of direct transfers between moons within the context of the circular restricted three-body problem, and allows the inclusion of a variety of trajectory patterns, such as captures, landings, transits, and takeoffs, at the two ends of a transfer. The foundations and properties of the technique are illustrated through an application based on impulsive direct transfers between Ganymede and Europa. However, the methodology can be employed to assist in the design of more complex mission scenarios, such as moon tours.},

  abstract     = {A high-order optimal control strategy implemented in the Koopman operator framework is proposed in this work. The new technique exploits the Koopman representation of the solution of the equations of motion to develop an energy-optimal inverse control methodology. The operator theory can reformulate a nonlinear dynamic system of finite dimension into a linear system with an infinite number of dimensions. As a result, the state of any nonlinear dynamics is represented as a linear combination of high-order orthogonal polynomials, which creates the state transition polynomial map of the solution. Because the optimal control technique can be reduced to a two-point boundary value problem, the Koopman map is used to connect the state and control variables in time, such that optimal values are obtained through map inversion and polynomial evaluation. The new technique is applied to rendezvous applications in space, where the relative motion between two satellites is modeled with a high-order polynomial series expansion of the Lagrangian of the system, such that the Clohessy–Wiltshire equations represent the reduction of the high-order model to a linear truncation. The proposed numerical applications are analyzed to show the robustness and limitations of the novel technique.},

DMTU is applied to illumination data onboard a spacecraft to create a new observable for space navigation systems. It is shown that combining this new observable with intersatellite angle measurements creates an autonomous navigation system (Angles and Illumination Data Navigation [AIDnav]) capable of resolving the absolute orbits of both spacecraft. This novel navigation system is extremely low size, weight, and power, relying only on hardware already found on most spacecraft. It does not require cooperative spacecraft or more than one observer, nor does it require orbits or maneuvers that maximize observability. The performance of AIDnav is studied in a Monte Carlo simulation for a potential distributed Mars mission, and it is shown to be capable of determining an orbit with an average converged state error of 86 m and . This method of navigation is viable for many different orbital regimes, but is ideal for ride-along interplanetary missions, which will always have a nearby target to observe and an external source of navigation before capturing into orbit at the destination central body.},

These challenges motivate research into space-based navigation and observation capabilities that provide opportunities for autonomy. This paper demonstrates that relative optical measurements provide full inertial estimates of an agent and target spacecraft, while simultaneously enabling classification of unknown maneuvers in the cislunar environment. To achieve this objective two subtasks are demonstrated. First, the spacecraft-to-spacecraft absolute tracking method, which estimates the absolute state of two vehicles using relative measurements, is tested for observability and shown to produce consistent filter solutions given optical sensors. Second, maneuver classification is performed by labeling an estimated control profile generated from the optimal control based estimator. Collectively, this sequential methodology enables an agent craft to autonomously navigate itself while observing a target craft and classifying its maneuvers.},

  abstract     = {There is growing interest in commercial aircraft formation flight as a means of reducing both airspace congestion and the carbon footprint of air transportation. Wake vortex surfing has been proven to have significant fuel-saving benefits; however, commercial air transportation has yet to take advantage of these formation benefits due to understandable safety concerns. The realization of these formations requires serious consideration of safety contingencies during closer-in maneuvering of large commercial aircraft. Formation contingency scenarios are much more complex than those of individual aircraft and have not yet been studied in depth. This paper investigates the utility of an optimization modeling approach in generating maneuvering and escape paths for commercial formation aircraft by comparing model-generated paths with pilot-generated escape plans. Three high-altitude commercial aircraft formation scenarios are presented: formation join, formation emergency exit, and formation escape. The model-generated paths are evaluated and compared with pilot-generated escape plans using the author’s pilot expertise. Model results compare well with pilot intuition and are useful in presenting solutions not previously considered, in evaluating separation requirements for improvement of escape path planning, and in confirming the viability of the pilot-generated plans. The novel optimization model formulation presented in this paper is the first model capable of generating exit and escape paths comparable to pilot-generated plans. It is also the first model to incorporate path avoidance of persistent and drifting wake turbulence.},

Adaptive control has not been studied in the context of singularly perturbed plants. This paper introduces and evaluates three methods of adaptive control for multiple-timescale systems. Each method is a framework that is valid for a wide class of adaptive control methods. Full-order adaptive control (FOAC) applies adaptive control to the system as a whole. It is straightforward but can be sensitive to timescale effects. Reduced-order adaptive control (ROAC) applies adaptive control to either the fast or slow modes only. This simplifies synthesis but can also constrain the range of valid timescale separation. [K]Control of Adaptive Multiple-Timescale Systems (KAMS) fuses two adaptive control signals using multiple-timescale techniques. KAMS takes advantage of model reduction unlike FOAC, and allows for unstable fast dynamics unlike ROAC. Generalized formal definitions, stability criteria, and examples are developed and presented for each method. Results presented in the paper for the control of a Boeing 747-100/200 on approach show that KAMS has a desirable blend of performance and robustness because each reduced-order model is stabilized separately.},

  abstract     = {Studies of preview gust load alleviation and controllers via synthesis, simulation, wind tunnel tests, and test/simulation correlation are presented in this paper. University of Washington active aeroservoelastic wind tunnel model design, construction, and testing capabilities are used. The test article is a flexible half wing–body–tail model with active control surfaces of two ailerons and an elevator. The model moves in a combination of rigid-body and elastic motions. The commands of gust vanes are used both to generate gusts and to provide real-time preview gust encounter information. A discrete-time linear-time-invariant output feedback system is augmented with various preview lengths of information. The experimental results show that gust loads are reduced with gust preview information compared to feedback-only control and are halved with the fullest gust preview information compared to the open-loop case. The wind tunnel results validated the simulations and added insights to the performance of preview and control implementation. The closed-loop analysis quantified the margins and robustness of the systems and correlated with the time history of both simulations and experiments. This paper presents preview gust load alleviation robust control test results, not available so far, in a realistic experimental setting.},

First, the zero miss distance and desired impact directions are realized by a 3D vector impact angle control guidance (IACG) law whose time-to-go is predicted accurately and efficiently by a numerical algorithm. Then, by introducing an implicit trajectory-to-go function, the time-to-go control mechanism is clearly revealed under missile speed variation. Accordingly, a coordinated biased term is added to the 3D vector IACG law to ensure a simultaneous attack. Finally, considering the seeker’s field-of-view (FOV) limit, the resultant cooperative guidance law is further augmented by another biased term to prevent the lead angle from exceeding its upper bound. Unlike similar existing results, the proposed one can satisfy multiple complex spatial–temporal constraints without active speed control, thereby manifesting great practical significance. Several numerical simulations are provided to show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed cooperative guidance law.},

To safely integrate drone traffic into congested airspace, the current concept of operations for drone traffic management will reserve a static traffic volume for the whole planned trajectory, which is safe but inefficient. In this paper, we propose a dynamic traffic volume reservation method for the drone traffic management system based on a multiscale A* algorithm. The planning airspace is represented as a multiresolution grid world, where the resolution will be coarse for the area on the far side. Therefore, each drone only needs to reserve a temporary traffic volume along the finest flight path in its local area, which helps release the airspace back to others. Moreover, the multiscale A* can run nearly in real-time due to a much smaller search space, which enables dynamically rolling planning to consider updated information. To handle the infeasible corner cases of the multiscale algorithm, a hybrid strategy is further developed, which can maintain a similar optimal level to the classic A* algorithm while still running nearly in real-time. The presented numerical results support the advantages of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The question of how many impulses are necessary to optimize a transfer-type maneuver has remained open for decades. Recently, the introduction of optimal switching surfaces revealed the existence of iso-impulse trajectories with differing numbers of impulses for fixed-time rendezvous maneuvers. In this paper, the multiplicity of minimum- impulsive trajectories is studied for long-time-horizon maneuvers. One feature of these trajectories is that many of the impulses are applied at specific positions, which we coin as impulse anchor positions. Leveraging a novel analytic method, it is demonstrated that, under the inverse-square gravity model, multiple-impulse minimum- solutions can be generated from a two-impulse solution. In addition to recovering all impulsive solutions of a multirevolution benchmark problem, all solutions are classified, and it is shown that there are infinitely many optimal iso-impulse solutions. Two planet-centric problems are also solved to demonstrate that the proposed method is applicable to different transfer problems in addition to the benchmark problem. The proposed method provides analytic bounds on the lower (required) and upper (allowable) number of impulses for three classes of maneuvers: fixed-terminal-time rendezvous, free-terminal-time rendezvous, and phase-free transfer. A new interpretation of the primer vector for impulsive extremals with phasing orbits is proposed.},

Challenges associated with the higher-dimensional nature of QPOs present difficulties when using existing approaches to design transfers between them. This paper establishes a methodology to abate these issues. Fundamental to the approach is the treatment of orbits as tori and their manifolds as the associated whiskers. Utilizing this formulation, intersection curves, surfaces, or volumes between the manifolds are computed leveraging a robust multiparameter continuation scheme. Intersections are then used to seed a multiple shooting scheme to compute transfer trajectories between a pair of orbits. The approach is applied in the Earth–moon circular restricted three-body problem. Numerical examples demonstrate the benefits of considering QPOs in the preliminary stage of trajectory design, showing that leveraging these higher-dimensional solutions offers reductions in propellant cost and transfer time when compared to their periodic counterparts.},

A statistical analysis unveiled sudden transitions from order to disorder, interspersed with intervals of smooth evolution. There is a periodicity of approximately half a century in the episodes of disorder, suggesting a connection with the precession of the orbital plane, due to Earth’s oblateness and lunisolar perturbations. The third-degree harmonics of the geopotential also play a vital role. They introduce an asymmetry between the unstable equilibrium points, enabling the long libration mode. The unpredictability occurs just in a small fraction of the precession cycle, when the inclination is close to zero. A simplified model including only gravity harmonics up to degree 3 and the Earth and moon in circular coplanar orbits is capable of reproducing most features of the high-fidelity simulation.},

This problem is challenging in that the deputy is modeled to be underactuated; thrust is only allowable along a single axial direction (its local axis) and rotation is only allowed about its local axis. Furthermore, the deputy’s coupled translational and attitudinal dynamics (modeled via the Clohessy–Wiltshire equations with inputs) do not allow local controllability about the equilibrium point when linearized. To solve this underactuated ARPOD problem, we design a periodic bimodal switching control law that drives the deputy to a docking configuration with the chief. We model the system to have hybrid (i.e., continuous and discrete) dynamics and recast the docking objective as a set stabilization problem. The main result of this work is a rigorous proof that leverages properties of geometric control, Floquet theory, and homogeneity to show that the switching control law renders the objective set to be locally asymptotically stable. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the main result.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses an adaptive rigid-body pose-tracking control problem with unknown system parameters. The proposed control is based on a noncertainty equivalence (NCE) adaptive principle applied to the configuration manifold of rigid-body motion, i.e., special Euclidean group SE(3), and its tangent bundle TSE(3). The controller drives the system to follow an arbitrary reference trajectory with bounded time derivatives. The system states are composed of the elements of SE(3), consisting of rotations and translations, and the six-dimensional vector of angular and translational velocities in Euclidean space. Almost-global-asymptotic stability of the system is demonstrated using a Morse–Lyapunov stability analysis. Then, the performance of the proposed controller is verified and is compared to the results obtained by a certainty-equivalence (CE) adaptive control applied to exponential coordinates associated with the linear space of the Lie algebra . It is shown that the TSE(3)-based NCE adaptive control design can eliminate the performance degradation due to the cancellation of uncertain parameter effects that would otherwise appear when the CE adaptive controller is used. As a result, the proposed NCE-based adaptive pose-tracking controller recovers the closed-loop pose-tracking controller performance with the system parameters fully known to the controller.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a provably safe method for constrained reorientation of a spacecraft in the presence of input constraints, bounded disturbances, and fixed frequency zero-order-hold (ZOH) control inputs. The set of states satisfying all pointing and rate constraints, herein called the safe set, is expressed as the intersection of the sublevel sets of several constraint functions, which are subsequently converted into control barrier functions (CBFs). The method then extends prior results on utilizing CBFs with ZOH controllers to the case of relative-degree-2 constraint functions, as occurs in the constrained attitude reorientation problem. The developed sampled-data controller is also shown to remain provably safe in the presence of input constraints and bounded disturbances. Finally, the method is validated and compared to three prior approaches via both low-fidelity and mid-fidelity simulations.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a study of the reset step in the multiplicative extended Kalman filter (MEKF). This filter is widely used for spacecraft attitude estimation, which typically involves estimating the attitude and gyro drift in real time using external sensors such as star trackers. The basic idea of the MEKF is to use the quaternion or direction-cosine matrix as the “global” attitude parameterization and a three-component state vector for the “local” parameterization of attitude errors. The true attitude is expressed as the product of the error attitude and the estimate rather than as the sum of the error and the estimate. The reset operation moves the local error to the global variable. This reset does not add new information, but it changes the reference frame for the attitude error covariance. This results in an error-covariance reset that is very different from the measurement update of the error covariance in the MEKF. The effects of using an error-covariance reset in the MEKF are analyzed in this work. The results from this work can be applied to any application involving attitude estimation as part of its process, such as inertial navigation.},

The circular guidance law is augmented with a bias term to achieve impact time synchronization within a prescribed time. The analytical time-to-go expression under the circular guidance law is utilized to ensure the impact time cooperation accuracy. Not only convergence rate but also acceleration magnitude reduction is guaranteed due to the merits of the practical prescribed-time consensus. Moreover, based on the predicted interception point, the proposed guidance laws are extended to a nonmaneuvering target. Finally, numerical simulations in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional scenarios verify the effectiveness, robustness, and superiority of the proposed guidance laws.},

Contrary to its nonincremental counterpart (nonlinear dynamic inversion), this design method does not require a complete onboard model of the airframe dynamics and is therefore more robust against regular perturbations arising from aerodynamic variations. Therefore, INDI brings a natural design approach to desirable flying qualities. However, robustness against singular perturbations, which may arise due to transport delays, elastic airframe effects, or other types of badly modeled or unknown dynamics, is a known challenge for INDI-based control laws. Therefore, this paper addresses the question of robust stability and performance for INDI and its linear form (incremental dynamic inversion [IDI]) in the context of mixed regular and singular perturbations. This is done through analytical insights and by performing quantitative robustness assessments based on the structured singular value framework. Additionally, inversion loop augmentation solutions are investigated using robust synthesis techniques to improve the robustness characteristics of basic IDI designs.},

The guidance problem is first reformulated in the relative frame to help geometrically derive the necessary condition of interception without terminal maneuverability advantage in the 3-D space. A two-stage optimal guidance law is then analytically derived with bounded acceleration to satisfy the aforementioned necessary condition. Theoretical analysis is performed to interpret the working principle and physical meaning of the proposed law. The key feature of the proposed approach lies in its fast convergence rate and low acceleration requirement. Hence, in comparison with the existing optimal approaches, the proposed law can significantly improve the operational margin and decrease the risk of command saturation in the endgame. Extensive simulations are performed to support our findings.},

Based on the derived analytical uncertainty propagation, the robust energy-optimum and fuel-optimum orbital rendezvous problems are formulated as nonlinear programming ones. In particular, the robust energy-optimum rendezvous problem under the control-linear error model is converted into solving a one-dimensional equation.

  abstract     = {In recent years, space debris has become a threat for satellites operating in low Earth orbit. Even by applying mitigation guidelines, their number will still increase over the course of the century. As a consequence, active debris removal missions and on-orbit servicing missions have gained momentum at both academic and industrial level. The crucial step in both scenarios is the capability of navigating in the neighborhood of a target resident space object. This problem has been tackled many times in literature with varying level of cooperativeness of the target required. While several techniques are available when the target is cooperative or its shape is known, no approach is mature enough to deal with uncooperative and unknown targets. This paper proposes a hybrid method to tackle this issue called Coarse Model-Based Relative Navigation (CoMBiNa). The main idea of this algorithm is to split the mission into two phases. During the first phase, the algorithm constructs a coarse model of the target. In the second phase, this coarse model is used as a reference for a relative navigation technique, effectively shifting the focus toward state and inertia estimation. In addition, this paper proposes a strategy to leverage the structure of the selected navigation method to detect and reject outliers. To conclude, CoMBiNa is tested on a simulated environment to highlight its benefits and its shortcomings, while also assessing its applicability on a limited-resource single-board computer.},

The line-of-sight Doppler velocity measurement provides direct feedback to the velocity states and improves sensitivity to these state estimates. A novel Rauch–Tung–Striebel smoother framework is derived that is compatible with states exhibiting multiplicative error that enables seamless postprocessing of state estimates filtered with a multiplicative extended Kalman filter.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a neural-network-based unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to estimate and track the pose (i.e., position and orientation) of a known, noncooperative, tumbling target spacecraft in a close-proximity rendezvous scenario. The UKF estimates the target’s orbit and attitude relative to the servicer based on the pose information provided by a multitask convolutional neural network (CNN) from incoming monocular images of the target. To enable reliable tracking, the process noise covariance matrix of the UKF is tuned online using adaptive state noise compensation, which leverages a newly developed closed-form process noise model for relative attitude dynamics. This paper also introduces the Satellite Hardware-In-the-loop Rendezvous Trajectories (SHIRT) dataset to enable comprehensive analyses of the performance and robustness of the proposed pipeline. SHIRT comprises the labeled images of two representative rendezvous trajectories in a low Earth orbit created using both a graphics renderer and a robotic testbed. Specifically, the CNN is solely trained on synthetic data, whereas functionality and performance of the complete navigation pipeline are evaluated on real images from the robotic testbed. The proposed UKF is evaluated on SHIRT and is shown to have subdecimeter-level position and degree-level orientation errors at steady state.},

  abstract     = {The Virtual Super Optics Reconfigurable Swarm (VISORS) mission is a distributed telescope consisting of two 6U CubeSats separated by 40 m that will obtain high-resolution images of active solar regions in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum. This mission is challenging because the CubeSats must autonomously control their relative motion with unprecedented accuracy while operating in close proximity. This paper presents three contributions that enable the VISORS mission to meet its challenging requirements. First, passively safe absolute and relative orbit designs for distributed telescopes that provide regular periods of alignment with inertial targets are developed using relative eccentricity/inclination vector separation. Second, a guidance, navigation, and control system design is proposed to meet the demanding relative motion control requirements. Third, a concept of operations is proposed that minimizes mission operations load when the formation is not actively performing observations. This concept of operations includes a safety plan to address on-orbit anomalies. The performance of the guidance, navigation, and control system is validated through Monte Carlo simulations including all significant error sources and operational constraints. These simulations show that the mission requirements are met with margin, providing a preliminary demonstration of the feasibility of accurate autonomous formation control with CubeSats.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and reliable trajectory prediction (TP) is required in several air traffic management systems. Estimating the aircraft trajectory in a vertical plane typically requires the knowledge of a pair of operational instructions. A sequence of operational instructions specifies the aircraft intent, information that is seldom available, besides for the ownship trajectory planning system. In the execution of the trajectory, the aircraft is directed by the (auto)pilot through a series of sequential guidance modes that might override some of the planning instructions of the aircraft intent. Therefore, having reliable guidance mode information is fundamental for the next generation of air- or ground-based TP. The main goal of this contribution is to develop a methodology able to identify in real-time the active guidance modes for both vertical climb and descent profiles, using only Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast and Enhanced Mode-S Surveillance data. The proposed solution is based on an interacting multiple model (IMM) filtering approach, which uses a bank of filters, each one matched to a possible guidance mode. The guidance mode identification performance of the IMM-based solution is validated with i) a set of simulated representative trajectories and ii) real flight data obtained from flight data recorders.},

The strategy embeds collision avoidance elements and reduces the computational effort for calculating the pulses to be provided by the thrusters through opportune algebraic manipulations, a Runge–Kutta 4 propagation method using linearized state transition matrices, and implicit embedding of dynamically equivalent thrust models, leading to constant state propagation matrices. Furthermore, the inputs design optimization problem and the embedded collision avoidance scheme are modeled and explicitly crafted as convex problems, contributing positively to low computational requirements. The docking and collision avoidance capabilities of the proposed scheme are extensively tested in an environment that accounts for all the perturbations relevant to LEO frameworks, for realistic thrust schemes, and for uncertainties in the measurement. Numerical results assess which tumbling objects can be docked or not by means of the proposed schemes as a function of the tumbling rates versus the thrust capabilities and hardware uncertainty of the docker.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the problem of collision-free trajectory planning for a satellite swarm reconfiguration under perturbations and modeling uncertainties in a low Earth orbit (LEO). Determining exact trajectory planning solutions is computationally heavy as they require solving a mixed-integer nonlinear program owing to i) nonlinear relative dynamic models of satellites, ii) fuel-optimal assignment of satellites on the final formation, and iii) nonconvex collision avoidance constraints. To address these, first, a suitable linear model for trajectory planning is identified by quantifying modeling accuracy associated with various models capturing LEO perturbations. The effects of any residual modeling errors in the path prediction are mitigated by shrinking-horizon model-predictive feedback control, which updates the control command based on the latest satellite measurements. Secondly, an optimal swarm configuration is efficiently computed by decoupling the target-assignment algorithm from the trajectory optimization problem. Based on the estimated fuel expenditure for each satellite–target pairing, the target-assignment algorithm selects a configuration with minimal fuel consumption. Lastly, to determine collision-free, fuel-optimal maneuvers, two novel trajectory planning approaches, namely, distributed and decentralized trajectory optimization, are presented. While the former iteratively searches for collision-free feasible paths to optimal terminal configuration, the latter computes a near-optimal configuration with collision-free paths.},

Analytical representations obtained from these manifold approximations are instrumental in the synthesis of optimal trajectories for cislunar transport. A multivariate Chebyshev series is used to approximate the surfaces, thereby serving as tractable parametric representations of the complex properties of motion. It is demonstrated that the continuum of ballistic capture trajectories and their associated sensitivities on the manifold can be realized in functional form using simple algebraic operations. Two applications making use of the Chebyshev manifold approximations as a terminal constraint surface are presented. The first is a low-thrust trajectory optimization problem formulated such that the optimal free final state lying on the manifold is determined as an additional set of design parameters. The second is a guidance law designed to target the manifold in the vicinity of the nominal patch point. Each of these methods takes advantage of the Chebyshev approximations to provide additional flexibility for mission design in multibody dynamic environments. These applications offer tremendous optimism about the utility of function approximation methods in arriving at a formal representation for the invariant manifolds in the three-body problem for efficient generation of optimal trajectories.},

The properties of a four-dimensional rank-degenerate measurement model of the quaternion are analyzed. Four different approaches are suggested in order to reduce the dimension of the measurement equation, hinging on information optimization or on the spectral properties of the measurement matrix. While the measurement dimension’s reduction saves computations, it does not impair the exact statistical treatment of state-dependent process and measurement noises. As a result, the proposed filters are optimal and statistically consistent without tuning. The performance of the maximum information rate quaternion filter is verified via extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The test cases of spinning and rapidly tumbling rotations of a small satellite on a low Earth orbit are simulated. The filters process measurements of the sun vector, of the Earth magnetic field, and of rate gyros. The novel filters converge where a standard extended Kalman filter fails to do so under similar conditions.},

Torque applied to the system is assumed to be accurately known. When the inertia matrix is accurately known, the provided observer achieves exponential convergence, while an asymptotically converging adaptive observer is designed for cases when the inertia is unknown. The nonadaptive observer is shown to be robust to bounded inaccuracies in the knowledge of inertia and external torque acting upon the system. For the adaptive observer, conventional certainty equivalence methods require the angular rate states that are unavailable. To overcome this problem a novel update rule with additional control knobs is proposed, which uses just the attitude states for inertia parameter adaptation.

However, the positioning accuracy of ground-based navigation systems decreases with the distance from the Earth, significantly increasing the positioning uncertainty for interplanetary missions. Furthermore, ground-based navigation systems require extensive ground operations, and their limited bandwidth could lead to a point of full utilization in the future. The aim of this work is to introduce—for the first time—the concept of space navigation by optical pulsars, a novel technology that aims at overcoming the limits of ground-based navigation systems. This paper presents, first, an introduction to satellite navigation by using pulsars, discussing on the physical and timing properties of optical pulsars. Then, it investigates on the timing techniques allowing to reconstruct, process, and make use of a pulsar signal, leading to a position estimation. Finally, it reports the results of a clock error estimation performed on ground with real pulsar data and a first estimation of the achievable positioning accuracy in a simulated highly elliptical orbit around the Earth.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by the widely used smoothing techniques in image processing and statistical analysis, a novel smoothing homotopy paradigm is proposed in this paper for solving general optimal control problems with the indirect method. In contrast to the existing approaches, the sensitivity associated with the two-point-boundary-value problem (TPBVP) in optimal control is reduced by convoluting appropriate part of the TPBVP with a smoothing kernel. The homotopic process is applied to the bandwidth of the smoothing: a larger bandwidth produces a stronger smoothing effect, rendering the TPBVP better behaved and much easier to solve; a zero bandwidth results in no smoothing and thus leads to the original TPBVP. Depending on whether the Gaussian smoothing kernel or a non-Gaussian kernel is used in the particular implementation, two different smoothing homotopy methods are developed, each with distinctive features of its own. Challenging numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the working and effectiveness of the methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel methodology to enforce motion safety guarantees even in the event of a sudden loss of control capabilities by any agent within a multi-agent system. This passive safety methodology permits the replacement of point-evaluated constraints on the trajectory following a contingency with a single function of the integration constants of the equations of motion at contingency instants. The effects of uncertainties on the trajectory are compensated for through the method of variation of parameters. This permits a reduction in the number of required constraints by one polynomial degree in the number of discrete time samples, and allows computationally efficient enforcement of passive safety within a multi-agent optimal control problem, solvable using direct methods. The main application is distributed space systems employing miniaturized low-size-weight-and-power and commercial-off-the-shelf technology, which reduce mission financial costs at the expense of reliability. Experimental results for the upcoming VIrtual Super-resolution Optics with Reconfigurable Swarms mission, as well as complementary formation-flying test cases in eccentric orbits, demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methodology in achieving fault-tolerant safety guarantees, as well as computational efficiency.},

This process, which can be modeled as the composition of a linear moving average filter and a nonlinear decision function, inspired the work reported here to improve engineered sensing performance by maximizing the observability of particular neural-inspired composite measurement functions. We first present a tool to determine the observability of a linear system with measurement delay (the first element of the composition), and then use a Lie algebraic observability approach to study nonlinear autonomous systems with output delay (the second element of the composition). The Lie algebraic tools are then extended to address overall observability of systems with composite outputs as in the neural encoder model we adopt. The analytical outcomes are supported using the empirical observability Gramian, and optimal sensor placement on a bioinspired wing model is performed using metrics based on the empirical Gramian.},

Following the idea of worst-case testing, a deep Q-network agent is trained to identify input sequences that lead to detrimental system behavior. Because the analysis is based directly on the repeated interaction between the agent and the investigated system, no model simplifications are required, making the presented method applicable to highly complex systems. The capability of the learning-based worst-case analysis is demonstrated for the speed protection function of the hover flight control law of an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. The analysis discovers possible piloted maneuvers that violate the implemented protection algorithm. A root cause analysis of the emerging behavior reveals the neglect of an important flight mechanical coupling term in the design of the protection algorithm and ultimately leads to the revision and improvement of the controller. This demonstrates the benefits of the presented testing method for the design, verification, and validation of complex systems. The application to a high-fidelity system used for control law development of an actual eVTOL prototype currently under construction demonstrates the relevance of the method beyond academia.},

  abstract     = {The autonomous reacquisition of laser links between distributed spacecraft is the fundamental technique in missions to detect gravitational waves in space. It involves rapidly maneuvering three spacecraft’s attitudes to adjust their laser beams so that they can cover one another within regions of uncertainty that arise owing to various spatial disturbances and system errors. This paper develops a methodology within the framework of convex optimization to optimize the reacquisition procedure on board and to reduce the duration of reacquisition, and therefore the region of uncertainty changing over the temporal history. A sampling-based method of modeling is first developed to remodel the problem of reacquisition as an equivalent problem of convex optimization with additional minimum-function constraints. An approach to penalization relaxation is then presented to convexify the minimum-function constraint and significantly improve the convergence of the algorithm by overcoming the drawbacks of potential artificial infeasibility, zero-gradient singularity, and solution-chattering situations. Finally, a detailed characterization of task uncertainty is considered to improve the applicability of the proposed method. Numerical comparisons between the proposed method and the most relevant techniques researched in recent studies are provided under multiple, randomly generated simulation environments to demonstrate its efficiency, universality, and robustness.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new methodology for solar-sail attitude control that uses only momentum wheels. Different from conventional solar sails packaged in a central hub, the sailcraft is deployed in the direction of one side of the storage. In this single-wing configuration, the offset between the center of mass (c.m.) and center of pressure (c.p.) is large and lies in the sail plane. When specular reflection is dominant, solar-radiation-pressure (SRP) force vector points in the out-of-plane direction, thus causing an in-plane SRP torque orthogonal to the c.m./c.p. offset vector. Therefore, by placing a bias momentum in the c.m./c.p. direction, the sailcraft keeps rotating in the same plane while maintaining its orientation relative to the sun. Analysis reveals that the attitude motion of the one-winged momentum-biased solar sail is basically unstable, but the system can be stabilized in a neutral manner through minor control of the bias momentum. Furthermore, adding another control moment in the out-of-plane direction enables asymptotic stability. Control in the remaining in-plane direction makes it possible to avoid wheel saturation. Numerical simulations demonstrate that both attitude maintenance and maneuver can be performed and that the controller is robust to parameter errors.},

Satellite and DGVSCMG combined rotational dynamics is modeled in the framework of geometric mechanics. It is shown that the combined attitude dynamics is in control-affine form when the motor torques of the DGVSCMG are taken as control inputs. A single-loop hybrid robust nonsingular fast finite-time sliding mode control (NFFTSMC) is designed to ensure an unwinding-free attitude maneuver. In the proposed single-loop formulation, the respective motor torques of the DGVSCMG are computed directly using only one NFFTSMC without requiring the steering law, resulting in mathematical singularity-free attitude control. A novel sliding surface is also proposed to ensure that the rotor angular speed converges to its nominal value after the maneuver. This eliminates the need of repeated desaturation of the rotor spin rate, unlike all the steering-law-based control architecture. Unwinding-free global stability of the system using the proposed hybrid NFFTSMC is proved for the sliding and reaching phases. Simulation results are presented to substantiate the claim made, assuming the rigid satellite to be equipped with only one DGVSCMG.},

The traditional rigid-body dynamics modeling theory based on dual quaternions is only applicable to the case of modeling for the center of mass. When modeling appendages, the flexible appendages must be symmetrically configured to reduce the modeling complexity. However, in space operations, flexible appendages are usually not symmetrically installed, which significantly limits the applications of dual-quaternion theory. In this paper, we propose a new dual-quaternion derivative rule and a rigid-body dynamic modeling method suitable for any point. The theory can be applied to model flexible appendages with any configuration without changing the mathematical modeling framework. Finally, we demonstrate the integrated dynamic equation of a rigid–flexible coupling system considering the coupling of position and attitude, and we verify the correctness of the model by numerical simulation.},

This paper studies the design of an adaptive offline policy for a surface imaging task under the influence of maneuver noise via reinforcement learning (RL). An adaptive policy that responds to the changes in the environment is obtained by including asteroid parameters as part of the feedback state and randomizing them during the training. The proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to train the policy. The robustness of the policy is tested in an environment that has unmodeled dynamical effects. Further, the overall performance of the autonomous exploration scheme is studied by combining the RL-based policy with the previously proposed autonomous navigation strategy that is built around optical and measurements. The end-to-end simulations that combine both onboard navigation and guidance are performed using asteroid Bennu as an example target, and the results show that the proposed scheme is robust.},

Traditional solution methods require binary variables and mixed-integer programming (MIP), which is prohibitively slow and computationally expensive. This paper proposes a faster and computationally cheaper algorithm that can produce locally optimal solutions in seconds. This is achieved by blending sequential convex programming and numerical continuation into a single iterative solution process. The algorithm approximates discrete logic constraints with smooth functions and uses a homotopy parameter to control the accuracy of this approximation. The homotopy parameter is updated such that, by the time the algorithm converges, the smooth approximations enforce the exact discrete logic. The effectiveness of this approach is numerically demonstrated for a realistic rendezvous scenario inspired by the Apollo Transposition and Docking maneuver. In less than 15 s of cumulative solver time, the algorithm finds a fuel-minimizing trajectory that obeys the following discrete logic constraints: thruster minimum impulse-bit, range-triggered approach cone, and range- triggered plume impingement. The optimized trajectory uses significantly less fuel than reported NASA design targets.},

  abstract     = {As the concentration of large space debris increases, how rendezvous maneuvers involving these typically non-cooperative, freely tumbling bodies are planned and executed is evolving. The rendezvous must be carefully planned, employing up-to-date in situ data to identify the inertial and motion parameters of the target body, and executed in a manner that accounts for the remaining uncertainty in these parameters. This paper presents an extension of the Tumbling Rendezvous via Autonomous Characterization and Execution (TRACE) pipeline used in the ROAM/TumbleDock Astrobee experiment campaign, which sequences the target state estimation, motion planning, controller design, and maneuver execution tasks while additionally providing logical loop-back avenues to previous tasks, increasing the chances of a successful maneuver. The pipeline’s performance is analyzed in simulation, utilizing target state estimates generated in a previous activity on a dedicated on-ground test bed; online motion planning, based on nonlinear programming and warm-started using a trajectory library generated offline with a novel graphics-processing-unit-based method; and tube-based model predictive control to robustly track the planned trajectory. Tube-based model predictive control is an actively evolving subject, distributed over multiple publications and various research interests. The necessary theory and considerations for practical implementation of the method are consolidated; its use, features, and limitations in the proposed task are demonstrated.},

In this novel concept, a single-gimbal variable-speed control moment gyro is used as the sole control actuation system, allowing actuation in two orthogonal directions and two-dimensional control over the projectile’s flight path without any moving aerodynamic surfaces. A complete nonlinear model of the eight-degree-of-freedom rotational and translational flight mechanics is developed, as well as an accurate aerodynamic model for short-range trajectories. Linear models are derived for control design, and controllers are synthesized along with a steering logic to achieve control of the projectile’s roll and sideslip angles. Successful tracking of both angles is demonstrated, and a large course deviation is achieved, showing significant maneuverability and proving the viability of the concept.},

In this paper, the finite Fourier series approach is extended to account for the necessary conditions for optimality during the Fourier coefficient design. The proposed method uses the approximate trajectories to analytically estimate the costates at these discrete points by employing a finite difference technique on the adjoint differential equations. Lagrange multipliers associated with any terminal state constraints are determined using an auxiliary function. Residual errors in the stationarity condition are reduced through the objective function, with the Legendre–Clebsch condition enforced as a nonlinear inequality constraint; applying these two conditions finds suboptimal solutions without an excessive loss of computational efficiency. Test cases use steering angle and thrust acceleration magnitude controls and span Earth-escape spirals, geostationary spacecraft rendezvous, and phasing maneuvers. The presented results demonstrate the proposed method’s ability to achieve trajectories closer to the optimal solution.},

However, especially in the case of large formation sizes, each spacecraft may not be able to track or communicate with all other spacecraft. Further, for formations deployed in deep space, the unavailability of the Global Navigation Satellite System makes inertial state estimation challenging. We propose the Distributed Absolute and Relative Estimation (DARE) algorithm for autonomous inertial estimation of spacecraft formations. The algorithm enables each spacecraft to maintain an accurate inertial estimate of the entire formation even in the presence of observability and communication constraints. Each spacecraft utilizes measurements of feature points (landmarks) for inertial localization and measurements of neighboring spacecraft for relative localization. The algorithm is distributed and scalable to any number of spacecraft in the formation. A modified version of the algorithm called the Sparse Distributed Absolute and Relative Estimation (SDARE) algorithm is also derived. This algorithm is computationally more efficient at the expense of estimation accuracy, making it suitable for implementation on nanosatellites where resources are limited. Numerical simulation results demonstrating the effectiveness and comparing the performance of both algorithms are provided.},

The two spacecraft are assumed to be initially placed within the same closed orbit with arbitrary phase angle separation. The target spacecraft is assumed to always remain in the same initial orbit. The chaser vehicle, however, uses a judiciously designed maneuver sequence comprising constant-acceleration radial thrust phases interspersed with coast phases. Importantly, the proposed maneuver design is analytically characterized by one or two (depending on whether the parking orbit is circular or elliptical, respectively) nonlinear algebraic equations that determine the time intervals for the different phases. The set of initial conditions from which rendezvous is feasible is also characterized. Additionally, orbit rotation (that is, changing the orbit argument of periapsis in plane) is also demonstrated for the elliptical parking orbit case. Finally, the remarkable emergence of the golden and silver ratios, as well as their connections to Kepler’s triangle, is demonstrated for a specific sequence of thrust and coast arcs.},

For attitude control of a single body the proposed control law improves the closed-loop response for initial principal rotation angles near 180° while producing a globally continuous control torque. For the problem of multibody attitude synchronization, an alternative feedback reshaping strategy is proposed, which destabilizes nonconsensus equilibria and produces attitude synchronization with almost global stability and globally continuous control. Finally, a previously proposed bipartite consensus algorithm based on the concept of a structurally balanced graph with antagonistic interactions represented by negative edge weights is applied for the first time to rigid-body attitude consensus control with feedback reshaping in which the consensus attitudes and angular velocities are divided into two distinct groups. Simulations serve as illustrative examples of each of these problems and confirm the advantages of the proposed strategies. For multibody synchronization the focus is on ring graph topologies for which locally stable nonconsensus equilibria arise when using an existing attitude consensus control protocol in the literature.},

As an augmentation, the SRFNN-based dynamic FEP is employed to prevent damaged aircraft from breaking through the safe flight envelope bounds, which are updated adaptively with the help of the safety-critical information obtained by the SRFNN. Additionally, the performance of the fault-tolerant flight controller can be improved after the proposed dynamic FEP is integrated into the aircraft control system.

  abstract     = {Aircraft braking maneuvers are safety-critical on-ground motions that exhibit complex dynamics and significant dependence on system operating conditions. The fundamental interface between the aircraft and the ground is the landing gear. Among the landing gear components, the shock absorbers may be subject to gas leakage during their lifetime, which is an anomaly that could compromise the lateral stability properties of the aircraft on the operating regimes found during braking maneuvers. In this paper, an explicit link is established between main landing gear shock absorber leakage and aircraft lateral stability. To investigate lateral stability, a high-fidelity multibody nonlinear aircraft simulator is developed in a MATLAB/Simulink framework and validated against experimental data. To generate insight into the problem and to quantify shock absorber leakage impact on aircraft lateral stability, two simple but descriptive analytical models are also developed, each one on a different operating mode of the system. The analysis of the models reveals that shock absorber leakage can have a significant effect on aircraft lateral stability, especially at high velocities and highly damped nose wheel steering conditions. The models developed in this work may be used by aircraft control system designers to come up with more effective lateral stability controllers in the event of main landing gear shock absorber leakage.},

  abstract     = {This research develops and analyzes an approach to solve the continuous monitoring problem. The analysis focuses on the string stability of a system of airspeed heterogeneous nonlinear aircraft that are controlled to overfly an endpoint at specified time intervals. The system is modeled as a cascaded set of subsystems where the position of each subsystem, an individual aircraft, is based off the estimated overfly time of the preceding vehicle. The model also includes the effects of steady-state wind and turbulence. The system is made to be string stable by nondimensionalizing a portion of the dynamics, selecting variable command limits, and solving for exponentially stable controller gains. The simulation results confirm the stability guarantees of the theoretical analysis and show that a randomized group of 20 airspeed heterogeneous aircraft experiencing realistic wind and turbulence results in an estimated arrival time error that converges toward a relatively small steady-state range.},

The objective is to propose and compare different new frequency-based identification methods operating on frequency response associated to the inputs and outputs of interest. The first methods considered are the Loewner interpolation method and a subspace algorithm. Subsequently, the paper introduces the possibility to apply stability constraints and to impose a certain number of poles estimated beforehand by the method in order to make the identified models closer to the true aeroelastic physics. To achieve this goal, new dedicated techniques are developed and subsequently validated on data generated by random state-space models of various orders, and on aeroelastic data obtained from structural and aerodynamic aircraft models.},

Hence, control considerations are not used to inform the overall design of the airframe. This paper presents a control-aware controller-agnostic design optimization framework that integrates nonlinear controllability constraints, which are informed by the solutions to optimal control problems, into the multidisciplinary design process. To implement the optimization, procedures to evaluate the sensitivity of the controllability constraint to variations in the design variables are defined. A supersonic aircraft case study illustrates the methodology and the steps involved in the process. The proposed approach enables the integration of control-related constraints into gradient-based design optimization.},

However, due to the limited computational hardware on board such aircraft and the uncertain, stochastic nature of real-world environments, there is a need for efficient and robust strategies that exhibit generalized behavior. In addressing these objectives, recent efforts have explored the use of artificial intelligence training algorithms and neural networks for the design of autonomous control schemes that exploit such wind phenomena. This study incorporates the Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies algorithm with domain randomization to train robust neurocontrollers that can control an aircraft along sustained traveling dynamic soaring trajectories in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances. This work presents the developed strategy for integrating robustness in neural network control systems, provides a method for quantifying and comparing robustness, and introduces an approach for identifying the network characteristics that contribute to the evolved robust behavior.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem regarding the influence of random dispersions related to the environment and system on a flight-path angle guidance algorithm using lift modulation for aerogravity-assist maneuvers on hyperbolic trajectories. To compensate for the effects of dispersions and uncertainties, an original radius tracking guidance model is presented, with a formulation for both the temporal domain and the true anomaly domain. This algorithm allows a vehicle to successfully track a suboptimal trajectory planned before a mission. A case study involving a maneuver on a hyperbolic trajectory to Venus performed by a waverider, which is a spacecraft characterized by a high lift-to-drag ratio, is presented. An uncertainty and sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the impacts of dispersions in the inputs on the main parameters and the performance characterizing the mission. The analysis provides an extensive range of cases that identify the density and thickness of the atmosphere as the most influential dispersed inputs. Adequately tuning the radius tracking guidance parameters enables the efficient attenuation and compensation of the perturbative effects of the uncertainties for obtaining trajectories that are close to the nominal trajectories, estimated before the mission in the absence of dispersions, in terms of the angular deflection and velocity magnitude variation. The presented model can be easily implemented for onboard guidance purposes.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory design and stationkeeping of solar sails about a celestial body can be formulated as control problems with positivity constraints. Specifically, when reemitted radiation is neglected and the sail is modeled as a flat surface, which are reasonable assumptions for control purposes, the force generated by the solar radiation pressure is contained in a pointed convex cone of revolution with the axis in the sun–satellite direction. Therefore, classical approaches to infer controllability based on the Lie algebra rank condition do not apply to these problems. This study offers a novel condition to decide on controllability of control systems with positivity constraints. This condition is effective because it can be verified by solving an auxiliary convex optimization problem for which reliable numerical methods are available. A crucial ingredient of this approach is the theory of positive trigonometric polynomials. The practical interest of this condition is the assessment of a minimum requirement on the optical properties of the sail, which may be of use for mission design purposes.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the motion of a lander in a fully coupled spin–orbit binary system. The full dynamical equations are established, including the states of the lander and the two small celestial bodies. The binary companions are represented by tetrahedral meshes when propagating their states; therefore, their irregular shapes are preserved. The mutual gravitational interactions between the two bodies and the attraction of the lander in this binary system are evaluated by the finite element method. The contact motion between the lander in arbitrary shapes/inertia and the asteroid surface is processed by the polygonal contact model. The resulting framework is applied to the binary asteroid system, 66391 Moshup. The deployment simulations of four typical initial positions near the secondary body suggest the lander release should avoid polar regions. The dynamical effect of the primary body on the lander is also investigated. The numerical results show that the accumulative effect of the weak tidal force from the primary body is nonnegligible. In addition, four different internal structures of the secondary body are constructed by operating the tetrahedron mesh. The touchdown positions and settling time of the landing trajectories on these four models are summarized and compared. The results indicate that variations of the internal structure have a nonnegligible effect on the local gravitational field around the secondary body, and therefore affect the locomotion of the lander.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a novel impulsive trajectory optimization algorithm for near-fuel-optimal rendezvous under perturbations is presented. The algorithm, called algorithm for impulsive rendezvous trajectory optimization under perturbations (AIRTOP), is designed such that the accuracy of rendezvous constraints is improved as much as possible while retaining the first-order optimality, under high-fidelity dynamics models that encompass various orbital perturbations (e.g., nonspherical gravity, air drag, luni-solar gravity, and solar radiation pressure). To eliminate rendezvous constraint errors, AIRTOP solves the linearized impulsive rendezvous problem recursively using the nonsingular dual-primal optimization algorithm. To improve the computational efficiency, AIRTOP applies the approximate analytical gradient of the constraint error norm during its error elimination process. We present three numerical simulations near circular and elliptical orbits. The simulation results show that i) AIRTOP can successfully solve impulsive rendezvous problems under realistic orbital perturbations with minimal user intervention, and ii) it can generate more fuel-efficient solutions in similar or shorter computation time than two other methods, namely, the differential corrector of the General Mission Analysis Tool and the global optimization approach, which can also take complex perturbations into account.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the time- and propellant-optimal low-thrust rephasing problems in circular orbit are studied to depict their solution spaces in an atlas. The rephasing problem is known as the same-orbit rendezvous from different angular positions. It is generally solved by some optimization methods, but its whole solution space is rarely investigated due to many key parameters. To reduce the number of parameters, a set of linearized equations of motion is developed based on the Sundman transformation, and two reduced shooting functions are formulated using the minimum principle and symmetry properties. Only one key parameter is identified for the time-optimal problem, while two key parameters are obtained for the propellant-optimal one. Numerical investigation of the relationships between these parameters and shooting variables reveals that they can be depicted by some curve (or contour) maps and approximated by piecewise functions (or linear interpolations). For the relatively short- or long-term rephasing cases, some analytical time- and propellant-optimal solutions are proposed and consistent with the numerical solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed solutions can provide good initial guesses to solve the low-thrust rephasing problems with nonlinear dynamics. Moreover, the approximations of the performance indexes can be used in the preliminary mission design.},

The proposed formulation accounts for dynamics of the gimbal motors and the rotor motor for finding the required motor torque to actuate the satellite along with the DGVSCMG for achieving high-precision attitude control. The satellite attitude control is accomplished using a proposed cascaded adaptive fixed-time sliding mode control to ensure bounded finite-time convergence. A sliding manifold is also designed to ensure convergence of gimbals angular rates to the desired values. Actuator saturation, system uncertainties such as intrinsic disturbance torques due to the gimbals and rotor bearing friction, extrinsic disturbances due to the environmental factors, and uncertainty in inertia of the satellite bus are accounted for designing the controller. Lyapunov stability analysis is carried out to prove bounded finite-time stability of the proposed system. Simulation results are presented to substantiate the claim made assuming the rigid satellite to be equipped with only one DGVSCMG.},

For Clohessy–Wiltshire relative orbital dynamics, computational MSS exponential rates of error convergence (in the mean-square-error sense) are shown to improve by one order of magnitude (for sample mean and covariance) over Monte Carlo; when reproducing the instantaneous probability of collision, MSS has a comparable mean-square-error convergence rate performance to Monte Carlo.},

It is shown that, for first-order actuator dynamics, INDI approximates the corresponding NDI control law arbitrarily well under the condition of sufficiently fast actuators. If the actuator bandwidth is low compared to changes in the states, the derived NDI control law has the following advantages compared to INDI: 1) compensation of state derivative terms, 2) well-defined error dynamics, and 3) exact tracking of a reference model, independent of error controller gains in nominal conditions. The comparison of the INDI control law with the well-established control design method NDI adds to the understanding of incremental control. It is additionally shown how to quantify the deficiency of the INDI control law with respect to the exact NDI law for actuators with finite bandwidth. The results are confirmed through simulation results of the roll motion of a fixed-wing aircraft.},

Incorporating a thrust pointing constraint is as essential as pursuing propellant optimality for modern powered descent guidance, particularly when a lander uses terrain relative navigation sensors. However, the theoretical knowledge of optimal solutions is limited. One of the paper’s contributions is a method for finding the optimal solution under an upward-pointing constraint with an active–inactive–active switching structure. Usually, there is a maximum–minimum–maximum structure for the optimal thrust magnitude. Another contribution is compact propellant-optimal powered descent guidance under a thrust pointing constraint. The guidance may find the solution by establishing analytical models to evaluate switching points from the switching functions and predict the final-state errors. Numerical simulations provide the solutions of lunar pinpoint-landing scenarios, in addition to demonstrating the excellent propellant optimality, smooth convergence, and fast execution.},

Various novel suboptimal algorithms are proposed that can guarantee a feasible solution. These algorithms are benchmarked by optimal values obtained via a global continuation method, and their computational performance is analyzed in a statistical setting.},

The recently introduced generalized equinoctial orbital elements set is employed as a means to reduce nonlinear effects stemming from and higher-order gravity field harmonics. The uncertainty propagation performance of the proposed set of elements in different Earth orbit scenarios, including low-thrust orbit raising, is evaluated using a Cramér–von Mises test on the Mahalanobis distance of the uncertainty distribution. A considerable improvement compared to all sets of elements proposed so far is obtained.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a semianalytical measure of nonlinearity (MoN) based on tensor eigenpairs. Approximating nonlinear dynamics via local linearization is a common practice that is used to enable analytical methods in dynamics, control, navigation, and uncertainty propagation. However, these linear approximations are only applicable near the linearization point, and the size and characteristics of the linear region are dependent on the system’s underlying degree of nonlinearity. This paper presents a novel MoN that is based on the eigenpairs of tensors that are derived from the higher-order terms in a Taylor series expansion, e.g., the local dynamics tensors and state transition tensors. Unlike existing MoN, the tensor eigenpair measure of nonlinearity (TEMoN) is semianalytical and its computation does not require empirical sampling or numerical optimization. TEMoN can be used to quantify nonlinearity, identify directions of strong nonlinearity, predict the size of a linear region, and justify the truncation order of a Taylor series expansion by distinguishing higher-order contributions to nonlinearity. The TEMoN method is demonstrated for equilibrium points in the circular restricted three-body problem, near-rectilinear halo orbits, and nonlinear parameter transformations.},

  abstract     = {The Mars 2020 Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) system successfully delivered the Perseverance rover to Jezero Crater, the most hazardous landing site ever attempted on Mars. To mitigate the risk of landing hazards, which included cliffs, inescapable dune fields, and rocks, a novel terrain relative navigation system was developed and integrated with the heritage Mars Science Laboratory EDL system. First the hazards were identified using orbital imagery and stored on-board the spacecraft as a hazard map. Then, during parachute descent, the Lander Vision System (LVS) estimated map relative position by fusing landmarks matched between descent imagery and a map of the landing site with inertial measurement unit data. Finally, the position estimate and hazard map were then used by the powered descent system to identify and then fly to the safest and reachable landing target. Postflight analysis indicated that all required systems worked much better than predicted. In particular, the fully autonomous LVS generated a position estimate in 10 s that was in error by only a few meters relative to a 40 m requirement. This paper describes the LVS design, how it was tested before launch, and the LVS performance during EDL.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a varying-gain proportional navigation guidance (PNG) law that can serve as the baseline for precise control of impact time. First, a varying-gain PNG law is developed by an inverse design strategy from the explicit time-to-go estimation of the conventional PNG law, which leads to high control efficiency and accurate time-to-go prediction. Next, to show its potential significance, the varying-gain PNG law is augmented with a biased feedback command to obtain an impact time control guidance (ITCG) law. As a step forward in more practical applications considering missile speed variation induced by thrust, drag, and gravity, another ITCG law is derived from an efficient time-to-go prediction method by taking the exact trajectory-to-go as the independent variable. Further, the varying-gain PNG law and the planar ITCG laws are extended to the three-dimensional guidance scenario by steering the missile to fly on an engagement plane. Compared with similar existing results, the proposed ITCG laws based on the varying-gain PNG law do not involve any linearized approximations in the derivation, and thus possess higher impact precision, wider feasible region, and less energy consumption. Finally, several numerical simulations are performed to support the analytical findings.},

The DSP consists of two parts: i) the aft part, which has a high spin rate for providing gyroscopic and aerodynamic stability, and ii) the forward part, which contains a course correction fuze that houses two pairs of movable canards to ensure precise interception. The guidance and control algorithms operate in a two-loop structure where the outer guidance loop generates required pitch and yaw rate commands, whereas the inner loop tracks these commands by generating canard deflections. The rolling motion of the forward part is controlled using a coaxial motor. The multibody dynamic model of DSP has seven degrees of freedom and is highly coupled and nonlinear. For the guidance, a finite horizon optimal control problem is formulated as an output regulation problem with output vector taken as pitch and yaw components of zero effort miss vector. A coupled pitch–yaw autopilot for pitch and yaw rate command tracking and a roll autopilot for roll stabilization of the forward part are designed based on super twisting algorithm. The efficacy of the control design is shown through numerical simulations.},

With ongoing development of biomimetic unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the potential for supermaneuverability through biomimetic mechanisms becomes apparent. So far, this potential has not been well studied: biomimetic UAVs have not yet been shown to be capable of any forms of classical supermaneuverability, as are available to thrust-vectored aircraft. Here we show this capability, by demonstrating how biomimetic morphing-wing UAVs can perform sophisticated slow-timescale nose-pointing-and-shooting (NPAS). Nonlinear flight-dynamics analysis is used to characterize the extent and stability of the multidimensional space of aircraft trim states that arises from biomimetic morphing. Navigating this trim space provides an effective model-based guidance strategy for generating open-loop NPAS maneuvers in simulation. Our results demonstrate the capability of biomimetic aircraft for air combat-relevant supermaneuverability, and provide strategies for the exploration, characterization, and guidance of further forms of classical and nonclassical supermaneuverability in such aircraft.},

For multirotor systems with immobile propellers, this structure is able to provide commands of pseudo inputs without redundancy. These commands will then be allocated through control allocation matrix possessing necessary elements. By using noncascaded velocity controller and considering actuator dynamics, the bandwidth of whole controller is broadened and a chance of estimating control effectiveness together with bandwidths of actuators appears. The null space excitation method is developed in this paper for assisting in parameter estimation, which will inject excitation signals in null space of control allocation matrix and therefore will not influence allocation results. This method is able to enlarge data information evaluated by Fisher information matrix. Hence, estimating parameters with these excitation signals is faster and more accurate than estimations in common methods. Designed null-space-excitation-based adaptive controller is validated on a complex high-fidelity hexacopter model and shows satisfactory performance in terms of control and parameter estimation.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the construction of a collision assessment method exploiting an alternative to probability theory for the representation and quantification of uncertainty of the states for two anthropogenic space objects (ASOs). Propagated uncertainty in the position and velocity of an ASO depends on, for example, seemingly random measurement errors, systematic errors in the selection of and assumptions in the dynamics and measurement models, and their combined influence on an orbit determination solution. Using outer probability measures allows for a holistic treatment of random and systematic uncertainty, and to establish if the available information on the ASOs’ states is sufficient to gauge the risk collision against an operational threshold through an upper and a lower bound on the probability of collision. The proposed method is illustrated in a context with similar hypotheses as Coppola’s direct method: the upper probability, i.e., credibility, of a collision is derived and compared to Coppola’s original probability of collision. It is shown that exploiting the credibility of collision is sufficient to derive a counterpart to Coppola’s risk assessment that does not suffer from the probability dilution effect when the available information on the ASOs is scarce. The resulting approach is conservative (favors false alarms over missed detections) and potential alternatives are discussed.},

Numerical simulations detail the performance and sensitivity of the position estimates. An extended Kalman filter fuses the relative position estimates with spacecraft dynamics for more accurate relative position and velocity estimates. An Enceladus sample collection mission serves as a case study where the proposed method seems viable. With filtering, simulation of an Enceladus sample-collection mission achieves maximum bounds of 7.19 km and for relative position and velocity estimates, respectively, during its Enceladus encounter.

  abstract     = {Natural transitions between bounded motions near mean-motion resonances occur throughout our solar system and are valuable in trajectory design. Such phenomena have been examined for natural transitions between periodic orbits near resonances within multi-body systems. However, families of quasi-periodic trajectories, tracing the surface of invariant 2-tori, significantly expand the solution space of bounded motions near resonances. Yet, identifying natural transitions between spatial 2-tori has previously been cumbersome due to the high dimensionality of the associated solution space. This paper approaches the challenge in constructing these natural transfers by using a combination of Poincaré mapping, a well-known technique from dynamical systems theory, and manifold learning, a technique for dimension reduction. The presented approach involves projecting a higher-dimensional dataset of intersections recorded from the hyperbolic invariant manifolds of two 2-tori onto a lower-dimensional embedding, enabling rapid identification of initial guesses for natural transfers. These initial guesses are then corrected and input to a continuation scheme to recover families of geometrically similar transfers connecting families of invariant 2-tori. This approach is demonstrated by constructing families of natural transitions between tori near distinct resonances in the Earth–Moon circular restricted three-body problem.},

  abstract     = {Higher-order methods such as state transition tensors (STTs) have shown promise for a variety of applications in astrodynamics, but can be limited in their use due to their potentially large computational and storage requirements. In this paper we present a method for approximating STTs by aligning the STTs with particularly unstable directions. This strategy allows us to isolate the most important terms in the higher-order STTs and ignore any less important terms. This method, which we call directional state transition tensors (DSTTs), is applied to several examples in two- and three-body dynamic systems, and it is shown to perform well for both nonlinear state and state uncertainty propagation. The method produces similar results to the full STTs, but requires significantly fewer elements to be stored, which can result in up to improvements in speed for nonlinear uncertainty propagation computations. DSTTs are promising for expanding the use of STTs to situations with highly nonlinear dynamics but limited computational resources, such as on-board a spacecraft.},

  abstract     = {A double-gimbal variable-speed control moment gyro (DGVSCMG) is considered for attitude control of a rigid satellite for track-to-track maneuver. Satellite attitude tracking control involves precision and time limit. In addition, satellite attitude control also faces rotation kinematic singularity, rotation unwinding, and control singularity associated with DGVSCMG. The rotation singularity and unwinding problems are solved using the body and shadow sets of the modified Rodrigues parameters. A nonlinear unwinding and kinematic singularity-free fast finite-time sliding mode tracking attitude control is proposed and designed for the satellite attitude control using a single unit of DGVSCMG. The issue of control singularity is addressed using constrained optimization to avoid gimbal lock. It is proved through five new propositions that the system states errors converge first to the sliding surface and then to the origin in fast finite-time with unwinding-free dynamics showing global stability of the system for the track-to-track maneuver. As a special case, it is shown that the proposed control is also applicable to rest-to-rest maneuver. Simulation results are presented and compared with a finite-time sliding control showing superiority of the proposed fast finite-time control in terms of time of convergence and unwinding and singularity-free angular motion.},

Classical approaches for this problem typically use a centralized planner leading to a single point of failure and often preventing real-time replanning as conditions change. This paper introduces a new approach for distributed, autonomous assignment planning executed by the weapons where each weapon is responsible for optimizing over distinct subsets of the decision variables. A continuous, convex relaxation of the associated cost function and constraints is introduced, and a distributed primal-dual optimization algorithm is developed that will be shown to have guaranteed bounds on its convergence rate, even with asynchronous computations and communications. This approach has several advantages in practice due to its robustness to asynchrony and resilience to time-varying scenarios, and these advantages are exhibited in experiments with simulated and physical commercial off-the-shelf ground robots as weapon surrogates that are shown to successfully compute their assignments under intermittent communications and unexpected attrition (loss) of weapons.},

An algorithm from proximal policy optimization is used to train a policy that generates stationkeeping maneuvers while transfer learning is used to reduce the computational time required for training.

This paper proposes a novel incremental control allocation method that directly minimizes the total power required for an over-actuated, propeller-driven transition aircraft. The minimum power cost function is derived in a convex form and leads to a closed-form algebraic solution for an additional command increment in the null space of the local control effectiveness matrix. The complete control allocation procedure consists of a two-step approach that is direction-preserving in the presence of actuator saturations and nonlinear due to the incremental formulation. The proposed control allocation is particularly advantageous in the case of a transition aircraft, where the tradeoff between using aerodynamic lift and vertical thrust can be solved naturally by including incremental attitude commands as virtual inputs in the minimum power control allocation. The resulting control allocation scheme allows to both maximize control authority and find minimum power trim solutions. Flight tests are performed on an over-actuated transition aircraft, showcasing the minimum power trim and control allocation without the use of flight mode switching or blending functions throughout all flight regimes.},

Such navigation often requires the matching of observed objects (e.g., landmarks, beacons, stars) in an image to a catalog (or map) of known objects. In many cases, this matching problem is made easier through the use of invariants. However, if the objects are modeled as three-dimensional points in general position, it has long been known that there are no invariants for a camera that is also in general position. This work discusses how invariants are introduced when the camera’s motion is constrained to a line, and proves that this is the only camera path along which invariants are possible. Algorithms are presented for computing both the invariants and the location for a camera undergoing rectilinear motion. The applicability of these ideas is discussed within the context of trains, aircraft, and spacecraft.},

It is shown that an assignment of time-varying output error covariance is possible in the presence of model error by utilizing a time-varying linear quadratic regulator controller with a class of output and control weighting sequences. This paper develops a systematic algorithm to calculate the sequence of such time-varying output weights that are further shown to be the Lagrange multipliers associated with the covariance constraints. A short horizon attitude control problem with stringent covariance constraints and a more nonlinear example concerning a low-thrust interplanetary maneuver are solved to demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach.

  abstract     = {Light curves, or the time-history of photometric brightness, have previously been demonstrated to allow for estimation of a space object’s attitude, shape, and surface parameters. However, these methods are subject to many limitations, including the need for accurate initial estimates to initialize filters, and the inability to regularly estimate attitude and surface parameters simultaneously due to information dilution, or the increase in uncertainty of each state when more states are simultaneously estimated. Monochromatic, unpolarized light curves can also only allow for surface reflectance parameter determination, and not determination of the materials themselves. This work develops a polarized bidirectional reflectance distribution function, and demonstrates that polarized measurements increase the uniqueness of light-curve attitude solutions to allow larger tolerance to initial error while also providing surface material estimation. Polarization of reflected light can also be measured more accurately than the intensity of reflected light through the atmosphere, thereby increasing the attitude observability from the light curves. Observability of attitude and surface materials is assessed. An unscented multiple-model adaptive estimation filter is implemented to estimate attitude, angular rate, surface material, surface roughness, and size of the space object.},

Careful construction of the square-root information matrix, in contrast to the full information or covariance matrix, provides easy and exact mean and covariance recovery throughout operation. Compared to an equivalent extended Kalman filter implementation, which provides identical results, the proposed filter does not require explicit marginalization of past landmark states to maintain constant-time complexity. Whereas measurements to opportunistic visual features only provide relative state information, resulting in drift over time unless a priori mapped landmarks are identified and tracked, the tight coupling of the inertial measurement unit provides some inertial state information. The results are presented in a terrain-relative navigation simulation for both a purely orbital case (with no active propulsion) and a landing case with a constant thrust.},

The paper starts by reviewing and improving a recent indirect method relying on analytical equations and pointing out certain numerical perils of the approach. By taking a fully numerical approach, the developments in this paper take relatively simple and concise software to implement, producing a fully automated algorithm capable of rapidly and reliably generating the complete optimal powered descent trajectory subject to imposed constraints, including on the thrust pointing direction, without the need for any empirical assumptions or hard-to-make user-supplied guesses. Furthermore, a “solution degradation” phenomenon not recognized before is brought to attention in the closed-loop solution of the propellant-optimal powered descent problem with a fully constrained final state that can pose a potential safety risk. This risk is mitigated in the proposed guidance approach, where guidance in the later half of the powered descent tracks an onboard generated optimal reference trajectory with a globally convergent tracking guidance law.},

To determine the root cause of the pendulum motion and provide improved design to mitigate the risk, there is an urgent need for stability analysis of the parachute system. In this work, a novel data-driven approach is presented for the stability analysis of the parachute, which could not only determine the stability of system at the glide point but also extract the dynamic characteristics like frequency and amplitude when the system runs into the large amplitude coning or pitching motion. The data-driven method is shown to have a good agreement with the small-disturbance stability analysis of the classic five-degree-of-freedom parachute system. The dominant Koopman modes used to yield a finite linear representation of the nonlinear pendulum dynamics are extracted; these Koopman modes are shown to be the intrinsic components of the parachute system after a large amount of simulation data is analyzed. At last, a two-main multibody parachute system is included to demonstrate the ability of the data-driven method in stability and modal analysis of complex parachute system.},

The need for trading short-term rewarding actions against actions that pay off in the long term makes for a hard-to-solve problem. Policies resulting from reinforcement learning offer the potential to handle long-term correlations between actions taken and rewards received. The paper presents a reinforcement learning setup, which results in a control strategy for the autonomous soaring sample application of GPS Triangle racing. First, we frame the problem in terms of a Markov decision process. In particular, we present a straightforward model for the three-degrees-of-freedom system dynamics of a glider aircraft that does not make any simplifying assumptions regarding the wind field or the relative aircraft velocity. The competition task is decomposed into subtasks, then. Stochastic gradient ascent solves the associated hierarchical reinforcement learning problem without the designer employing any further, potentially deficient heuristics. We present an implementation of the overall policy alongside an updraft estimator on embedded hardware aboard an unpiloted glider aircraft. Flight-test results validate the successful transfer of the hierarchical control policy trained in simulation to real-world autonomous cross-country soaring.},

  abstract     = {Modeling uncertainties and oscillatory dynamics are control challenges for flapping vehicles. Flapping-wing aerial vehicles are nonlinear time-varying oscillatory systems with flexible multibody dynamics. As such, accurate modeling of these complex systems considering unsteady aerodynamics is a formidable task. Though adaptive controllers can work well with uncertain approximate models, inherent oscillation of flapping systems can degrade their control performance and create undesired control actuations. This paper addresses improvements of neural adaptive dynamic inversion controller toward efficient performance for flapping flight via effective utility of actuator capacity. In this respect, first an assumptive model of a bird-mimetic flapping-wing is considered for simulation and analysis. It is shown that the usage of oscillatory feedback data produces additional error in trajectory tracking and unnecessary oscillatory control actuations. Subsequently, the control loop is modified by adding an adaptive notch filter for real-time estimation, tracking, and removal of dominant oscillatory modes from the feedback data and consequently from the controller output. As a result, the required control effort is effectively reduced and the controller performance is significantly improved. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme in presence of noise, variation of system frequency, disturbances, as well as delay in the control loop.},

However, few studies have applied two single-gimbal control moment gyroscopes (SGCMGs) to the three-axis attitude control problem. In this study, under the assumption that the total initial angular momentum is zero, a steering control law for the three-axis attitude maneuvers of a spacecraft with an array of two-skewed SGCMGs is designed using the backstepping technique without setting a constraint on the range of gimbal angles. The spacecraft attitude is expressed in terms of the parameters, which are suitable for the underactuated attitude control problem. The control gains are appropriately chosen to guarantee controller stability. The proposed steering control law is validated through numerical simulations. The results show that the proposed steering control law can achieve a shorter settling time than that obtained from a control law with a constraint on the range of gimbal angles.},

Such an extension enables the reachable domain to model the medium-term evolution of a debris cloud and to facilitate the orbit maneuver planning by exploiting the effect. First, the reachable domain under perturbation is defined as the collection of osculating orbits. To solve the boundary surface of the reachable domain, the three-dimensional reachable domain is reduced to a two-dimensional problem by discretization onto cross-sectional meridian planes of the central body. In this manner, the two-dimensional cross-sectional reachable domain can be expressed as a family of two-variable parameterized curves. Then, the reachable domain boundary is formulated by using envelope theory. A rigorous algorithm is proposed to solve the reachable domain boundary. The computational efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm are also analyzed. The results show that the computational time of a reachable domain is at the level of seconds on a personal desktop. The accuracy can be guaranteed as long as the perturbation assumption is valid. Finally, the dynamical evolution of the reachable domain from a toroid to a band, driven by the perturbation, is successfully modeled.},

The torque envelope of a CMG array under gimbal rate constraints is a zonotope, whose geometrical characteristics can be used to systematically increase the torque capacity around an arbitrarily given axis. For a four-CMG roof array, which consists of two coplanar CMG pairs, the torque capacity is a function of the allocation of angular momentum between the pairs. Based on the latter, a gimbal angle steering law is developed that maximizes the CMG array’s torque capacity around a preferred axis defined by the current slew maneuver. A main feature of the proposed steering law is that this maximization does not require offline computations for any given preferred axis. In addition, an angular-momentum-based attitude tracking control law is formulated. As verified in numerical simulations, the developed steering and attitude control algorithms are able to follow a typical agile reference profile with adequate time domain performance while satisfying actuator constraints.},

  abstract     = {Images are an important source of information for spacecraft navigation and for three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of observed space objects. Both of these applications take the form of a triangulation problem when the camera has a known attitude and the measurements extracted from the image are line-of-sight (LOS) directions. This work provides a comprehensive review of the history and theoretical foundations of triangulation. A variety of classical triangulation algorithms are reviewed, including a number of suboptimal linear methods (many LOS measurements) and the optimal method of Hartley and Sturm (only two LOS measurements). It is shown that the optimal many-measurement case may be solved without iteration as a linear system using the new linear optimal sine triangulation (LOST) method. Both LOST and the polynomial method of Hartley and Sturm provide the same result in the case of only two measurements. The various triangulation algorithms are assessed with a few numerical examples, including planetary terrain relative navigation, angles-only optical navigation at Uranus, 3-D reconstruction of Notre-Dame de Paris, and angles-only relative navigation.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous spacecraft must be robust toward uncertainty and disturbances in the system while achieving required levels of performance. As an example, robotic servicing spacecraft must intercept target objects with potentially unknown dynamic properties during active debris removal efforts. This work presents tube-based model predictive control (MPC) with uncertainty identification as a strategy to enhance performance while maintaining robustness in autonomous maneuvers. The proposed algorithm, which is an extension of the standard tube-based MPC framework, measures and predicts the exogenous input to the system (i.e., the uncertainty) online. This in turn enables the robust tube to be shrunk and grown appropriately as the trajectory progresses in both predicted time and actual time. The algorithm is demonstrated in a simulated intercept maneuver with a tumbling target whose inertia tensor is uncertain. Results indicate two improvements over the standard tube-based algorithm: first, better performance is obtained when the initial exogenous input bounds are overconservative, and, second, there is greater flexibility in encouraging robustness when the exogenous input bounds are overly optimistic since the robust tube is updated online. As such, tube-based MPC with uncertainty identification represents an incremental step in enhancing the flexibility of autonomous spacecraft in addressing uncertain scenarios and environments.},
