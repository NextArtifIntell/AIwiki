  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel origami pattern that enables the construction of polyhedral shapes from a planar sheet. The proposed polyhedral origami exhibits rigid foldability, which means that it can be folded without deforming its facets. The folding motion to a polyhedral shape can possess a single degree of freedom under the symmetric condition. A range of shapes, including pyramidal and prismatic shapes, can be created, depending on the design variables; and they can be folded into compact shapes for storage. Considering geometry, we derive mathematical conditions for the pattern design and investigate the folding process through kinematic analysis. Additionally, we conduct a parametric study of the effective volume and radius of its operational state. The proposed origami design will serve as a basic framework for developing foldable three-dimensional structures. It can have potential applications such as foldable space shields or deployable shelters made of thick materials for protection against space radiation.},

In this regard, this paper extends our earlier work on this topic that was based on the Euler–Bernoulli theory. A single-cantilever-beam specimen of finite length is considered as having a debonded section, where the debonded top face and the substrate are not connected, and a bonded section, where an elastic foundation is used to connect the top face and the substrate. The interaction between the top face and the substrate in the bonded section is modeled using both normal and rotational (or shear) spring distributions. A -integral approach is used to derive a closed-form expression for the energy release rate. Subsequently, a mode partitioning approach based on the transverse and axial displacements at the beginning of the elastic foundation is implemented. This solution can be used for both isotropic and orthotropic faces and core. The results are compared with the corresponding ones from a finite element analysis and they are in very good agreement.},

To be specific, a modified generalized- time integration scheme combined with a geometric nonlinear isogeometric Kirchhoff–Love shell element is used to simulate the complex buckling and postbuckling behaviors of thin-shell structures. The developed method can damp properly high-frequency contents while maintaining second-order accuracy in the dynamic buckling analysis. For the integration of arbitrary-shaped trimmed elements, a geometrically exact blending function method is developed to improve the efficiency of the dynamic shell buckling analysis. To deal with multipatch geometries, a penalty-based weak coupling approach is developed, where coupled patches with nonconforming trimmed interfaces or even with prescribed angles, such as stiffeners, can be analyzed. We demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and flexibility of the proposed framework with several numerical examples. In particular, the influences of “free” and “partially free” control points, penalty factor, trimming, as well as different modeling strategies on the dynamic solutions of shell structures are investigated.},

Recent studies show that this problem can be efficiently solved using the mixed integer program (MIP) by reformulating lamination parameters as functions of decision variables that represent fiber orientation and thickness choices. These formulations are limited to analyzing laminates having plies of the same thickness and material. This paper extends the previously employed lamination parameter reformulation to enable laminate designs with plies of different thicknesses and materials, thereby leading to MIP with cubic constraints. The linearization techniques are employed to convert cubic constraints of buckling load factors in terms of binary variables into sets of linear constraints that are efficiently solved with optimization algorithms for MIPs. It is shown that the use of distinct ply thicknesses in the optimization further reduces the mass of single-material laminates made with carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer when compared with previous studies using the same material. Additionally, the combination of plies made of glass-fiber-reinforced polymer and carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer with distinct thicknesses is shown to reduce the weight penalty when optimized for cost minimization in comparison to plies with uniform thickness.},

The performance of the five helicoidal layups was compared with the commonly used cross-ply and quasi-isotropic lamination schemes. Maximum stress, maximum strain, Tsai–Hill, Tsai-Wu, and Hoffman failure theories were employed in the framework of the recently proposed finite-element-based higher-order zigzag theory to determine the first-ply failure load. It was observed that the maximum strain theory predicted the lowest value of the first-ply failure load, whereas Tsai–Wu predicted the highest one. For some cases, Tsai–Hill and Tsai–Wu theories were not able to predict the first-ply failure load. For plates having free edges, the bio-inspired plates exhibited the first-ply failure load compared to the conventional layup sequences.},

  abstract     = {The aerodynamic performance and mechanisms of the compound layout of flapping-rotary-wing (FRW) vehicles have been studied extensively in the literature, but open-loop stability has rarely been involved. To bridge this gap, a hovering stability analysis of a 30 g FRW prototype has been conducted. Averaged-model assumptions and small-disturbance linearization method were used to formulate the model, in which the stability derivatives were calculated using numerical simulation. The modal characteristics and physical causes were studied with the techniques of eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis and compared with those of a helicopter. The results show that the FRW has two unstable modes: an unstable oscillatory mode and a slow divergence mode. The former mode features a horizontally circling trace of the center of gravity, coupled with a periodic oscillation of pitch and roll angles, which is dominated by a coupling roll (or pitch) moment produced by a forward (or sideward) speed perturbance. The latter mode features a decreased (or increased) wing rotation speed accompanied by an increasing downward (or upward) motion speed of the body owing to a strong dependence between the aerodynamics and the passive rotation of the wing. Longitudinal–lateral coupling and rotational–vertical coupling mark the distinction in modal characteristics between the FRW and the helicopter. The model and results of this study may offer a reference for the stability analysis and control design for FRW vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Novel electric propulsion technology has given rise to thinking about urban air mobility in a new way with its expected high degree of operational flexibility. The designs of electric vertical takeoff and landing configurations are determined by their mission profile, which we found to be oversimplified at many points in the current scientific literature. There is a gap of understanding in how mission profiles impact travel time and energy demand. In this paper, we review various mission designs, formulate a five-segment flight profile (including vertical ascent, climb, cruise, descent, and vertical approach), and apply it on a fleet level of up to 200,000 urban air mobility trips. The demand data originate from the Upper Bavaria region study, OBUAM. In a sensitivity study, we vary the cruise altitude, the height of the vertical flight segments, and the climb and descent angles for two vehicle configurations: a fixed-wing tilt-rotor concept, and a multicopter concept. The main findings for the fixed-wing concept are that the height of the vertical flight segments and the cruise altitude should be as low as possible, and small climb angles (below 7 deg) should be avoided. The multicopter concept, however, is penalized by fast forward flight while being comparatively insensitive to both the cruise altitude and height of the vertical flight segments. Furthermore, we found a tradeoff between time- and energy-optimal flights with the a energy-optimized climb/descent angle at around 10 deg.},

  abstract     = {The iterative-order-reduction (IOR) substructuring method is an efficient model order reduction (MOR) technique for estimating eigenvalues and eigenvectors in large-scale structural systems. However, it can be computationally expensive when applied to models with highly refined meshes and a substantial number of substructures because it retains all the interface degrees of freedom (DOF), which increase the size of the reduced structural matrices. Moreover, the reduced structural matrices may suffer from ill-conditioning after a certain number of iterations, potentially yielding inaccurate results. This paper presents a modified IOR substructuring method that integrates interface boundary reduction to reduce the size of the original IOR substructuring model by decreasing the number of interface DOF. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through a comprehensive numerical comparison with the original IOR substructuring and other widely used MOR techniques, including the Craig–Bampton, enhanced Craig–Bampton, and iterated improved reduced system with a substructuring scheme. The results show that the proposed method achieves comparable accuracy while significantly reducing the computational time and memory usage.},

  abstract     = {A lattice Boltzmann approach utilizing hybrid lattices for accurate simulation of high-speed transonic (TS) flows is presented in this study. Single-layer lattice models, such as D3Q19, are computationally efficient with low numerical dissipation, but are limited to simulate weakly compressible flows within subsonic Mach regime. Multilayer lattice models, such as D3Q33, are capable of simulating thermal and high-speed compressible flows in TS Mach regime, but suffer from a higher numerical dissipation and higher computational cost. To take full advantages of these two types of lattices, a simulation domain is divided into two regions, high-subsonic (HS) flow regions to be solved by single-layer lattices and TS flow regions to be solved by multilayer lattices. The interface connecting the HS and TS flow regions are represented by double-sided surfels to realize smooth flow transition and ensure satisfaction of fundamental conservation laws. The hybrid lattice Boltzmann approach is stable and robust, and it allows multiple HS/TS flow regions with arbitrary shapes. Extensive validation studies demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of obtaining accurate aerodynamic prediction of flows with a wide range of Mach numbers, and preserving the low numerical dissipation advantage of single-layer lattices in aeroacoustic computations.},

For a ramp analysis following CSB (involving the velocity field), a set of diffusion coefficients for that violates the CSB constraint, however, yields an unrealistic velocity profile at the interface between the turbulent and nonturbulent regions due to the excessively small turbulent diffusion. We therefore propose improved diffusion coefficients by considering both the CSB constraint and requirements in wall turbulence, and calculate a range of two-dimensional aeronautical flows with to clarify if the one-dimensional analyses support the predictions in realistic flows, fully coupled with the velocity field. Indeed, the corrected diffusion coefficients provide reasonable predictions for both the channel and TBL but also TBLs involving turbulent separation when becomes large.

  abstract     = {This work concentrates on analyzing and modeling the unsteady surface pressure autospectra beneath zero-pressure gradient, turbulent boundary-layer flowfields with variably rough flow surfaces. These surface conditions are qualitatively described as being for small, dense, rigid, spatially homogeneous roughness topologies, along with corresponding quantitative parameters. Turbulent boundary-layer velocity and unsteady surface pressure data from a new wind tunnel test with multiple surface conditions are analyzed in conjunction with the compiled results from five, distinct, additional references. These compiled results are utilized to develop and propose a new empirical model for the unsteady surface pressure autospectra for a range of variably rough surfaces. This new modeling framework is approached as an extension of the Goody model, which pertains to smooth-wall flows. The variable character of the newly proposed model is controlled by parameters based on viscous scaling of the effective roughness height and friction velocity such that the surface pressure model inputs are based on readily available mean properties of the turbulent boundary-layer flowfield. For the data utilized in this analysis the approximate values of viscous scaled effective roughness height range between approximately 100 and 2000. Finally, this newly proposed model is used to compare to the unsteady surface pressure data of two additional and separate experimental references for rough-wall flows, yielding further positive comparisons as well as isolated examples of the sensitivity of analysis and modeling to the determined friction velocity for a flow configuration.},

  abstract     = {It is aspirational to construct a nonlinear reduced-order model (ROM) with the ability to predict computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solutions accurately and efficiently. One major challenge is that the nonlinearity cannot be captured adequately by interpolation algorithm in low-dimensional space. To preserve the nonlinearity of CFD solutions for transonic flows, a new ROM is presented by integrating manifold learning into a constrained optimization, whereby a neighborhood preserving mapping is constructed by locally linear embedding (LLE) algorithm. Reconstruction errors are minimized in LLE by solving a least square problem subject to weight constraints. A loss function is proposed in the constrained optimization to preserve the geometric properties between high-dimensional space and low-dimensional manifolds. The proposed ROM is validated to predict nonlinear transonic flows over RAE 2822 airfoil and undeflected NASA Common Research Model with aspect ratio 9, in which nonlinearities are induced by shock waves. All results confirm that the ROM replicates CFD solutions accurately at fraction of the cost of CFD calculation or the full-order modeling.},

  abstract     = {The predictive accuracy of the Navier–Stokes equations is known to degrade at the limits of the continuum assumption, thereby necessitating expensive and approximate solutions to the Boltzmann equation. While tractable in one spatial dimension, their high dimensionality increases the computational challenge of multidimensional, multiphysical Boltzmann calculations. It is therefore desirable to augment the Navier–Stokes equations for accuracy under these conditions. We present an application of a deep learning method to extend the validity of the Navier–Stokes equations to transition-continuum flows. The technique encodes the missing physics via a neural network, which is trained to reduce the error between the Navier–Stokes and Boltzmann solutions. While standard DL methods can be considered ad hoc due to the absence of underlying physical laws, at least in the sense that the systems are not governed by known partial differential equations, the DL framework leverages the a priori known Boltzmann physics while ensuring that the trained model is consistent with the Navier–Stokes equations. The online training procedure solves adjoint equations, constructed using algorithmic differentiation, which efficiently provide the gradient of the loss function with respect to the learnable parameters. The model is trained and applied to predict stationary, one-dimensional shock thickness in low-pressure argon.},

These geometries may be used as disturbance generators for the study of unsteady airfoils and wings operating in highly vortical flowfields. It has been shown that cylinders undergoing forced rotational oscillations at their natural shedding frequency can produce wakes with minimal deviation in cycle-to-cycle vortex strength and position. Adding a splitter plate allows these deviations to be reduced even further. We present cases for oscillating cylinders having splitter-plate lengths up to at a Reynolds number of 7600. Frequencies are maintained at the natural shedding frequency, and a rotational amplitude of 45 deg is used. Numerical simulations are performed using a two-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) code. Results are presented in the form of vorticity contours and cycle-averaged velocity profiles, as well as the dominant frequencies of cylinder lift force and downstream velocity angles. The results show that splitter-plate lengths shorter than adversely affect the ability to generate a coherent vortex wake due to shear layer roll-up near the trailing edge of the plate. Splitter plates longer than produced a reverse von Kármán wake with consistent cycle-to-cycle vortex shedding.},

Two slant angles ( and ) were explored over two Mach numbers ( and ) and two Reynolds numbers ( and ) using oil flow visualization and pressure-sensitive paint to identify surface flow phenomena, while the spanwise shadowgraph enabled the observation of mean wake phenomena. The rounded-edge afterbody surface measurements displayed a centerline-separated vortex state with flow features and regions of suction qualitatively similar to those of the baseline sharp-edge case, with some notable differences. For example, a separation bubble at the slant leading edge is nearly twice the size of the baseline sharp-edge model. This is accompanied by the presence of a “source point,” indicated by a region of high pressure where the flow reattaches, and a tighter counter-rotating vortex pair in comparison to the baseline. The rounded-edge prevented the previously seen compressible transition to a fully separated wake state within the Mach number range studied while showing an increase in separation bubble size with increasing Mach number. Also noteworthy was the existence of a new vortex state for the model, where the flow remains attached at the model centerline. This is in contrast to the previously observed flow topology of the centerline-separated vortex state in the sharp-edge model, which formed a separation bubble at the model centerline. The transition between the new centerline-attached vortex state and the traditional centerline-separated vortex state was shown to be dependent on both Mach number and Reynolds number, revealing the importance of boundary-layer development on the rounded afterbody flowfield. Overall, these observations indicate that the rounded afterbody produces flowfields with distinct features that vary from the previously described sharp-edge afterbody wake field under certain conditions.},

High Performance Computing Modernization Program CREATE™-AV Helios is employed for the CFD simulations, while acoustic predictions are performed by PSU-WOPWOP. The simulations apply overset structured grids, the Spalart–Allmaras detached eddy simulation turbulence model, and adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) on the off-body mesh. The investigation covers four rotor overlap scenarios and five collective pitch angles, all maintaining a consistent rotational speed. Results indicate that as rotor overlap distance increases, a minor improvement in the figure of merit is noticed. Nevertheless, a substantial reduction in blade loading within the overlap region becomes apparent. The blade–vortex interaction (BVI) intensifies between both rotors as the overlap region broadens. The 25\% overlap configuration is shown to yield the highest overall sound pressure level (OASPL) among all configurations due to the more pronounced BVIs at the entrance and exit of the overlap area. It is observed that the OASPL exceeds 62 dBA at an altitude of 500 ft (152.4 m) for all overlap cases, exceeding the suggested UAM aircraft noise guideline. Additionally, noise generated by all overlap scenarios is compared against various background noise levels. Results suggest that the noise produced by the side-by-side rotor configuration is not fully masked by any of the different background noise levels at an altitude of 500 ft (152.4 m).},

Furthermore, the influence of the Reynolds and Mach number effects is examined based on the mean separation point along the cylinder surface, which is extracted from complementary schlieren visualization measurements, and the literature. The wake width for the supersonic inflow case is found to be an order of magnitude smaller physically than the subsonic case with an identical cylinder diameter. Additionally, the swirl strength criterion is used to identify the eddies present within the wake, and the eddy size and convection velocity are characterized based on the spatiotemporal correlations. The result suggests that the mean wake features for the subsonic and supersonic cases are very different. Moreover, the interaction of eddies generated at the cylinder’s top and bottom shear layers leads to the large-scale features present in the wake, and the differing paths followed by the eddies between the subsonic and supersonic cases are responsible for the variation in the observed wake width.},

Measurements at such scale require the use of strongly scattering helium-filled soap bubbles as flow tracers, which are introduced in both the jet and the freestream flow.

The mean velocity field reveals the jet inner structure as well as its interaction with the freestream, the ground board, the nacelle, the fuselage, and the horizontal and vertical tails. The experiments allow detection of exhaust reingestion as well as the aerodynamic interference with control surfaces at the tail segments in a single measurement volume. The results are in good agreement with conventional temperature rake measurements while adding details of the flow topology and of the large-scale unsteady flow fluctuations.

The present work is a numerical study of transonic buffet flow using a full-annulus model of a transonic fan—the NASA rotor 67. Firstly, results obtained with steady simulations are validated with experimental and numerical data available, and shock structures from these simulations are found to exhibit distinct features as seen in experiments. Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations are then carried out at two operating points—near design mass flow rate and toward stall—on the fan characteristic to capture transonic shock buffet. The unsteady simulations are able to capture necessary attributes of transonic buffet flow. Further, wave propagation in an unsteady flow solution featuring transonic buffet is investigated to understand the mechanism driving shock buffet in axial turbomachines. Upstream- and downstream-propagating pressure perturbation waves are observed on the blade suction surface within a buffet cycle, while only an upstream-propagating wave is seen on the blade pressure surface. The driving mechanism of transonic buffet in this turbomachine is elucidated through a feedback loop of the upstream- and downstream-propagating waves—qualitatively and quantitatively. Besides the streamwise pressure waves, circumferential pressure waves propagating at part speed of the rotor in the spinning direction and radially outward moving pressure waves of similar speeds on the blade suction and pressure surfaces are also detected as distinct features of buffet flow for this turbomachine.},

Furthermore, edgewise aerodynamics terms are added to the lift and moment equations to include their effects on flutter speeds. The newly obtained equations were implemented in the OWENS (Offshore Wind ENergy Simulation) toolkit, which is an FEM (Finite Element Method)-based toolkit for aeroelastic analysis of VAWTs. The effect of modifying each of these assumptions has been studied for the flutter RPM prediction of three primary modes of flutter of VAWTs: propeller, butterfly, and tower modes. For the land-based case, the most change was observed for the flutter RPM of the propeller mode, with a maximum increase of 2.62\% for the two-bladed UTD 5 MW VAWT case. For the floating offshore case, the primary flutter modes (tower and platform pitch) were not significantly affected.},

A two-dimensional model of a wing section with two degrees of freedom was used for the investigation. The flowfield was modeled by solving the unsteady Reynolds-averaged compressible Navier–Stokes equations using the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model, and the equations of motion were solved to determine the structural dynamics. The present model successfully captured the behavior of the double transonic dip on the flutter boundary of the supercritical airfoil, which contrasts with the well-known behavior of the single transonic dip exhibited by conventional symmetric airfoils. Although the mechanism of the first dip at a lower Mach number corresponded to that of the well-known conventional transonic dip, the second dip at a higher Mach number was uniquely observed for the supercritical airfoil. The analysis established that, for the supercritical airfoil, the motion of the shock wave over the upper surface was significantly affected by the behavior of the boundary layer around the highly cambered aft region of the lower surface during flutter. The behavior of the boundary layer involving the separation and reattachment over the lower surface caused the unusual shock wave motion over the upper surface under the Mach number condition at the bottom of the second dip. This motion exerted negative damping forces on the motion of the airfoil, thereby becoming the primary contributor to generating the second dip experienced by the supercritical airfoil.},

Detonation propagation in a three-dimensional periodic channel is simulated in this work using Eulerian–Lagrangian reactive simulations. To model the nonhomogeneity of combustion, discrete injectors for gaseous hydrogen fuel are used; and the liquid spray is injected along with the air from a continuous plenum. The results show that when the hydrogen injection rate is reduced to a certain condition, the detonation wave is unable to sustain; but the injection of the kerosene spray helps it sustain, and the system transitions from a pure gaseous detonation to a hydrogen-driven kerosene-sustained detonation. The effect of the droplet injection diameter and the fuel mass-flow rate are also studied. Hydrogen promotes the vaporization and the burning of kerosene droplets. Kerosene vaporization is a relatively slow process, and the vapor burns as either a weak detonation or through the postshock region, which in turn provides sufficient energy for detonation propagation. Therefore, the contributions of both fuels are interlinked and responsible for sustaining the continuous propagation of the detonation wave.},

  abstract     = {Efficient and controlled mixing of fuel with fast-moving air is a challenging physical problem relevant to hypersonic systems. Although mixing happens at the molecular level through diffusion, the macroscopic phenomenon such as entrainment and vorticity dynamics resulting from the shear layer instabilities of the mixing fluids play a significant role in the overall efficiency of the process. With a focus on improving mixing at extreme flow conditions, this paper presents a fundamental study of a novel, high-speed, pulsed coflow system integrated with ultrahigh-frequency actuators (11–20 kHz). This injection system consists of a supersonic actuation air jet at the inner core that provides large mean and fluctuating velocity profiles in the shear layers of a fluid stream injected surrounding the core through an annular nozzle, with pulsing occurring at a designated frequency. The high-frequency streamwise vortices and shockwaves tailored to the mean flow significantly enhanced supersonic flow mixing between the fluids compared to a steady coaxial configuration operating at the same input pressure. Experiments also indicate a strong connection between the frequency and unsteady amplitude of the actuation jet to the supersonic flow mixing phenomenon. This paper reports the design details of the injector assembly and flow mixing characteristics captured using phase-locked microschlieren and planar laser-induced fluorescence techniques.},

  abstract     = {Wind-tunnel experiments were conducted to measure the unsteady surface pressure field on and around a hemisphere-on-cylinder turret of varying protrusion in subsonic flow. These measurements were obtained using fast-response pressure-sensitive paint coupled with pressure transducers. The surface pressure field data resulting from Mach 0.5 flow over a partially submerged hemisphere, a hemisphere, and a hemisphere on a cylinder were analyzed using proper orthogonal decomposition modal analysis, as well as a variant of this approach referred to as joint proper orthogonal decomposition. The results showed that decreased turret protrusion into the freestream flow reduced the prevalence of antisymmetric surface pressure field fluctuations caused by antisymmetrical vortex shedding. The frequency associated with this fluctuation was found to be around . When a partial hemispherical turret geometry was used, it was shown that the antisymmetric mode was greatly suppressed; and the wake was dominated by a symmetric mode with a broadband spectral peak at a higher frequency of . This suggests that there is a “mode switching” as the protrusion is changed from the hemisphere to the partial hemisphere configuration. An optical flow approach was used to find the convective velocity field in the wake, from which topological flow features could be identified. The size of the wake separation region was found to grow smaller with the decreased protrusion while keeping a similar shape.},

SBLI surface flowfield properties of crossing shocks induced by symmetric Double-Fins (DFs) at fin angles of 8° and 10° at Mach 2 are experimentally investigated; a 10° Single-Fin (SF) is also explored as a comparison. Surface visualization is used to capture distinct flowfield structures such as separation and upstream influence. Steady and unsteady Pressure-Sensitive Paints (PSPs) are used to obtain global surface pressure fields. Characteristics of DF-SBLI surface topology are discussed by comparing the corresponding SF-SBLI. The effect of fin angle on DF-SBLI is characterized, and unsteady dynamics of the pressure field are examined. Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD) is performed on unsteady PSP, and traveling surface pressure waves and their frequency-dependent behavior are discussed. Dispersion relation of surface pressure waves is revealed by performing two-dimensional space–time Fourier transform on unsteady PSP, and the results are compared with the phase velocity distributions obtained from SPOD. Accompanying group velocity behavior is examined for distinct SBLI regions wherein wave propagation is found dependent on its frequency. Steady surface pressures along the centerline are compared with previous experimental data. Fin-tip spacing is found to be an essential parameter for scaling of upstream influence length.},

  abstract     = {The numerical simulation of a scramjet is often based on the thermal equilibrium model, but the flow inside the inlet and isolator is likely to be in thermal nonequilibrium due to shock-based compression. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of thermal nonequilibrium on the mass flow rate captured by the scramjet inlet. Numerical simulations based on the thermochemical nonequilibrium model (thermal nonequilibrium) and the chemical nonequilibrium model (thermal equilibrium) were adopted to study the mass flow rate of the HyShot II scramjet with the incoming flow Mach numbers ranging from 6.0 to 8.0. The results show that the maximum difference of the mass flow rate between thermal nonequilibrium and equilibrium reaches 10.7\% at with . The primary cause of the mass flow rate difference is the oblique shock wave angle difference between nonequilibrium and equilibrium. The relative magnitudes of oblique shock wave angles and flow parameter ratios across the wave under equilibrium and nonequilibrium are theoretically discussed in an intuitive way. A simplified model for the HyShot II is established to predict the mass flow rate difference between thermal nonequilibrium and equilibrium. The result shows that the expression of captured mass flow rate has a significant amplification effect on the slight difference of wave angles between thermal nonequilibrium and equilibrium, which means that the effect of thermal nonequilibrium cannot be ignored for scramjet in some cases.},

We use Fire II flight test data to verify the accuracy of the gas radiation model and update the prediction values of the cumulative radiation intensity in the wavelength range of 2.2–4.1 eV by previous methods. The results show that the radiation signal is most significant at the stagnation line and gradually decreases with the deviation of the line of sight from the stagnation line. The cumulative radiation intensity of the various trajectory points exhibits a profile that increases and then decreases during reentry; it rises to its peak at 50 km. The emission spectrum of gas radiation is mainly distributed in the ultraviolet and near-infrared bands. The transition processes of atoms N and O contribute more than 90\% of the total radiation intensity, and the contribution of the first negative series in the molecular spectrum is relatively considerable compared to other molecular components.},

This paper studies the spatial distribution of power deposition under different magnetic field configurations. The results show that the magnetic field configuration can change the spatial distribution of energy deposition. A focused magnetic field configuration can couple more energy on the antenna downstream and reduce energy loss during plasma transport, which leads to improved propellant utilization efficiency and enhanced thruster performance. Then this paper studies the energy coupling efficiency and energy distribution characteristics for ionization and acceleration under different W modes, including W1 and W2. The results show that, in the W1 mode, the energy is mainly focused on ion acceleration, resulting in higher ion beam energy. In contrast, the W2 mode is focused on propellant ionization, resulting in greater efficiency of propellant utilization. The W2 mode demonstrates a higher energy coupling efficiency and has superior thruster performance compared to the W1 mode, with a thrust increase of about 1.6 times. The paper proposes several suggestions to improve the thrust-to-weight ratio and specific impulse of a helicon plasma thruster, which provides theoretical support for engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {Integrated thermal protection systems of reusable launch vehicles (RLVs) can have a corrugated core sandwich structure and experience location-dependent thickness-wise temperature gradient. The sandwich structure can be optimized depending on the location on RLV using finite element method simulations of RLV components. However, such analysis can be computationally challenging due to the disparate length scales between the RLV components and features of the sandwich structure. Two different equivalent plate models based on first-order shear and normal deformation theory, and first-order shear and second-order normal deformation theory (FSSNDT) have been utilized in this work to address this drawback. A direct homogenization technique involving unit cell and cantilever beam analysis has been developed to calibrate the equivalent plate properties for different thickness-wise temperature variations. The accuracy of the plate models has been evaluated by comparing their responses with a full-scale model for different thickness-wise temperature gradients and a uniform pressure. The comparisons clearly indicate that the FSSNDT-based plate model calibrated via direct homogenization captures both the displacements and strains in the in-plane and transverse directions accurately, and can be used to perform RLV component analysis efficiently to obtain location-specific optimal design of corrugated core sandwich structures.},

  abstract     = {Release mechanisms are crucial devices for the success of space missions. In LISA, the first gravitational waves observatory in space, the grabbing positioning and release mechanism (GPRM) is responsible for setting all the test masses (TMs) in the free-fall condition necessary for starting science observations. This mechanism is considered a key equipment for the success of the entire space mission. The GPRM was initially tested in LISA Pathfinder (LPF), a space mission flown between 2015 and 2017, and an anomaly was encountered in the TM velocity after the release, which also resulted in some failures. One of the suspected reasons of this behavior is that the trajectory of the release mechanism deviates from the nominally rectilinear one. We find that this anomaly is due to the presence of high and asymmetric friction between moving parts. In this paper, we characterize experimentally the deviation from the linear trajectory, using LPF qualification models of the mechanism available on ground, and we identify the mechanical features that determine the friction-driven spurious lateral motion via a numerical finite element model. The results are one of the basis to improve the design of the GPRM for LISA. Some risk-reduction strategies and design guidelines are also presented and discussed.},

This paper reviews hair-like flow microsensors developed since 2013, focusing on developments in design, construction, and application. Hair-like flow sensors can be found in artificial cochleae, submersible navigation, terrestrial robots, and, rarely but increasingly, on aircraft. In this survey, we categorize hair-like flow sensors into three types (long whisker-like hairs, ultrasensitive microscale hairs, and short trichoid-like hairs), and primarily cover sensors that may be suitable for use on aircraft. The recent progress in flow-based flight control using distributed sensing is also discussed, along with the optimization of sensor placement and the potential for flight-by-feel in sixth-generation military and civilian aircraft designs. This survey aims to provide a consolidated account of the history and state-of-the-art of artificial hair-cell flow sensors, motivate consideration of flight-by-feel as a viable flight control paradigm, and define avenues for future research. As engineering and biological science continue to converge, we hope that researchers in both fields find this survey an inspirational and useful resource.},

Enter Quantum Information Science (QIS) (QIS), a field founded on the physical laws of quantum mechanics that introduce extraordinary different and powerful paradigms for generating, manipulating, measuring, securing, and processing information. While many quantum effects are generally well understood and form the basis of widely exploited current technology, QIS is still a richly underexplored research area. This overview provides a basic research perspective on the foundational resources that empower QIS, the main challenges in exploiting QIS for practical applications, and the need for input from researchers outside quantum physics, such as those from the aerospace community, to stimulate new ideas and advance progress in QIS. This paper introduces key QIS concepts and continues with discussions on each of the following subareas: sensing, computation and algorithms, networks, and information security. The paper concludes with an outlook of the field as it relates to aerospace.},

  abstract     = {Analytical solutions for elastoplastic buckling of plates play a crucial role in providing benchmark results and facilitating fast structural analyses for preliminary designs. However, the analytical solutions for elastoplastic buckling of plates remain incomplete due to the inherent mathematical difficulties associated with higher-order partial differential equations and material nonlinearity. Consequently, the existing analytical solutions for rectangular plates are only applicable to those with Lévy‐type boundary conditions. To address the limitation, this study extends a novel symplectic superposition method to obtain new analytical elastoplastic buckling solutions of non-Lévy‐type rectangular plates, where both the incremental theory (IT) and deformation theory (DT) are adopted. Comprehensive benchmark elastoplastic buckling loads are presented and validated by the modified differential quadrature method. The plastic buckling paradox is explicitly observed, which highlights a significant disparity between the IT and DT in predicting buckling loads for relatively thick plates. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the DT provides an optimal load ratio for buckling resistance, while no such finding is observed with the IT. The stability criterion curves are plotted using the elastic theory and plastic theories (IT and DT) to further reveal the importance of incorporating the effect of plasticity as well as to provide a useful guideline for the relevant analyses and designs.},

First, the substructure modal synthesis is introduced to construct the structural finite element model of the joined-wing UAV according to the connection relations between adjacent wing segments. Second, the doublet-lattice method is introduced to obtain the aerodynamic characteristics of each airfoil in subsonic flow, taking into account the interactions between each airfoil. After that, a parametrized aeroelastic model with variable inclination angles is established, and the p-k method is used for flutter calculations. The results show that the joined-wing UAV has wide ranges of flutter velocities and flutter frequencies, which show a nonlinear growth trend with the increase of the tail inclination angle owing to the flutter mode transitions. In addition, the forward sweep angles of the joined wing and the rigidity of the tail links both have significant impacts on the flutter characteristics of the joined-wing UAV.},

The hydrofoils undergo sinusoidal pitching about their leading edges with a fixed Strouhal number of and a Reynolds number of 10,000. The streamwise spacing, spanwise spacing, and phase offset between the hydrofoils are varied. Force measurements are employed to investigate changes in thrust, lift, spanwise force, power consumption, and propulsive efficiency. A method to mitigate confounding factors from connecting rod drag is employed using streamlined fairings. Near and far streamwise spacing regions are identified with a transition occurring near 0.875 chord lengths downstream. Decreasing streamwise spacing in the far region causes a rise in the maximum power consumption of the follower hydrofoil. Decreasing streamwise spacing in the near region results in an opposite trend, with a sharp drop in maximum average power consumption by the follower. An empirical model for power consumption of the follower is developed. Increased spanwise spacing is found to weaken the interaction between the hydrofoils, driving them toward their isolated performance. This phenomenon is related to the spanwise contraction of the wake shed by the leader and is a function of the overlap of the wake region impacting the follower.},

Five lessons learned are presented herein to provide insight to those conducting large-scale tests to help them avoid known pitfalls that may result in an unsuccessful test.

The mechanism of this experimental phenomenon is unclear. The first purpose of this work is to further confirm that the NMB of the thermal modal characteristics of a titanium plate with free boundary conditions occurs, and it is not affected by uncertain factors in the temperature field. The second purpose of this work is to use a thermally coupled dynamic shell model of the titanium plate with geometrical imperfection to explain the NMB of the titanium plate with free boundary conditions. By considering the significant effect of the geometrical imperfection of the plate on its thermal modal characteristics, the third purpose of this work is to propose a new method for thermal modal design by precreating the geometrical imperfection of the plate.

The laminated composite and sandwich plates are assumed to be made up of double- and cross-helicoidal lamination schemes. The first-ply failure load is determined using the recently proposed higher-order zigzag theory. Five different failure criteria (namely, maximum stress, maximum strain, Tsai–Hill, Tsai–Wu, and Hoffman’s theory) are used to predict the first-ply failure load. The performance of the helicoidal plate is compared with the cross-ply and quasi-isotropic lamination schemes. The influences of the end conditions, the ratio of the thickness of the core to the face layers, and the thickness-to-side ratio on the first-ply failure load are carried out. It has been observed that for helicoidal plates, a higher value of the first-ply failure load is observed as compared to quasi-isotropic and cross-ply laminates, especially for plates having free edges. The maximum strain theory should not be used for predicting the failure load for helicoidal laminated plates because it undermines the strength of the plate.},

  abstract     = {The contradiction between the spatial demand of a large-scale membrane structure and the existing membrane processing method encourages the development of membrane splicing technology. However, there has been very limited research on the tensile mechanical properties of the seamed membrane. A detailed experimental investigation of the tensile behavior of polyimide membranes with various seam situations is presented in this paper, including pure membranes and seamed membranes with wide or narrow bond regions. The tensile phenomena, elastic behaviors, fracture performances, and wrinkle configurations of the membrane specimens with different length-to-width aspect ratios are analyzed based on the uniaxial tensile tests and noncontact digital image correlation measuring technology. Furthermore, the analytical models are developed to predict the bond stress distribution and the required minimal seam width. The test results indicated that a seam with a width of 12.5 mm could not provide sufficient bonding force, whereas a seam with a minimum width of 17.6 mm could establish effective seamed membranes. Additionally, the elastic modulus of the seamed region increased 53.5\% more than that of the pure membrane using the seam details. The out-of-plane deformation and the number of wrinkles of the seamed membrane specimens are all much greater than those of the corresponding pure membrane specimens for all length-to-width aspect ratios. Moreover, the count of wrinkles can explain the phenomena that the fracture strengths of membranes in group 2 are higher than those in group 1, and there is a slight increase in the fracture strengths of membranes in group 1 with the rise of specimen widths. This principle in this work can be regarded as the basis of the design and application of seams in larger-scale membrane structures.},

In this study, the truncated conical shell with a flexoelectric actuator was discussed, and the precision flexoelectric actuation and control effectiveness were evaluated. A flexoelectric patch covered with an electrode layer was attached to the external surface of an elastic truncated conical shell, and a line electrode was longitudinally attached to the external surface of the patch. When a control voltage was applied to the line electrode and the electrode layer, an inhomogeneous electric field was generated; consequently, the stresses were induced in the flexoelectric patch due to the converse flexoelectric effect, thus regulating the vibration of the conical shell. The dynamic model of the truncated conical shell with a flexoelectric actuator was established. Then, the actuation effects of the flexoelectric actuator on the conical shell were investigated in terms of the microscopic behaviors, that is, flexoelectric-induced stresses, membrane control forces, bending control moments, and modal forces. Furthermore, the influences of several design parameters (that is, the line-electrode radius, conical shell thickness, flexoelectric patch thickness, and conical shell half-apex angle) on the flexoelectric actuation behaviors were also investigated.},

Using the coupled fluid–structure analysis, this study is aimed to provide physical insight and correlations for the aeroelastic behavior of flexible wings in the parameter space of the angle of attack and the aeroelastic number. The phase diagrams of the aerodynamic performance are established to obtain the envelope curves of the optimal performance and determine the transition line of the drag variation. The effects of the angle of attack and the aeroelastic number on the aeroelastic behaviors are systematically examined. The time-averaged membrane deformation is positively correlated with a nondimensional number, the so-called Weber number. A new scaling relation is proposed based on the dynamic equilibrium between the aerodynamic force fluctuation and the combined inertia–elastic fluctuation. The unsteady aerodynamic force can be adjusted by manipulating the membrane vibration, the mass ratio, the Strouhal number, and the aeroelastic number. The numerical investigations provide design guidelines and have the potential to enhance the maneuverability and flight agility of micro air vehicles with flexible wing structures.},

Real-time measurements of the membrane shape, including both mean camber and the frequency content of vibration, provide significant information on the surrounding flowfield. In this work, one method of integrated camber sensing is demonstrated, and the relationships to aerodynamic load and flowfield are shown. Camber is estimated via the capacitance of a dielectric elastomer membrane wing. The relationship between capacitance and camber is defined geometrically. The mean aerodynamic load is shown to be well-captured by applying a simple aeroelastic analysis to the measured camber. Finally, time-resolved membrane kinematics and flowfield measurements are used to illustrate the ties between the dynamic membrane vibration, as measured by capacitance, and the behavior of the shear layer above the wing.

This paper investigates the influence of these conditions on the aerodynamic characteristics and dynamic motion characteristics of both symmetric cross parachutes with eight equal suspension lines, and asymmetric cross parachutes with two (of eight) shortened suspension lines. The research reveals that the canopy of a no-swinging cross parachute exhibits a spinning motion around its axis. The free-to-swing parachute undergoes a conical swing motion around the suspension-line confluence point. The frequency of spin and conical swing increases in proportion to . The magnitude and direction of the lift force varies periodically owing to the conical swing of the free-to-swing parachute. Conversely, the no-swinging parachute, at a fixed angle of attack, maintains a comparatively stable lift force. The free-to-swing asymmetric cross parachute produces a stronger lift force because of the larger swing angle compared to the symmetric parachute. The resultant asymmetry in the aerodynamic shape caused by the shortening of suspension lines has minimal effect on aerodynamic characteristics.},

The piston theory is “local” in space and time because it assumes the pressure at a spatial point and time only depends on the panel deformation at the same point and time. The full potential flow model includes the effect of the past history of the panel deformation and the spatial distribution of the panel deformation on the pressure at any instant in time and at any point in space. Aeroelastic analysis is made to trace the flutter onset critical condition based on the limit cycle oscillation amplitudes, and the results are compared with the more traditional implementation using piston theory. Conclusions are made based on the use and application of this more complete aerodynamic theory, particularly for near-transonic and hypersonic flow regimes.

  abstract     = {Vortex tube separator (VTS) arrays are used to filter foreign particles from turboshaft engine intakes. Arrays may consist of hundreds of separators that share a common surrounding plenum, potentially allowing for significant interactions between the devices. However, most VTS studies have been limited to individual separators acting alone. The current study first involves an experimental investigation of the fluid flow emerging from the outlets of a VTS array installed in a wind tunnel. Particle image velocimetry is used to measure the flowfield at planes , and downstream of the outlets, where is the inlet tube diameter of a separator. The results indicate that the emerging vortices quickly merge into a single vortex with high circumferential velocity concentrated near the edges of the duct, and that a central recirculation zone (CRZ) develops. This is in contrast to the flow from a single VTS, which does not have a clear CRZ. Comparisons to similar combustion swirler flows lead to the hypothesis that VTS arrays may uniquely generate fast-developing CRZs that produce strong axial flow gradients near or even within some VTS outlets. Such gradients will alter the filtration performance of affected VTSs, which is highly sensitive to flow rates. To explain the onset of recirculation that is exclusive to the array configuration, the framework of a momentum integral model has been developed and is presented here. Additionally, computer-aided design files of the experimental geometry along with inlet/outlet boundary conditions are being made available for any future computational validation studies of this complex flowfield.},

  abstract     = {Ice crystal icing has been identified as a threat to aviation safety, with hundred engine power loss events having been experienced since the 1990s. This has led to new type certification requirements for the industry to demonstrate safe operation in these environmental conditions. The sticking and erosion behaviors of ice crystals are critical factors in ice crystal icing. However, many existing sticking–erosion models are developed based on ice crystals using the mean particle diameter for experimental tests that have a broad distribution of size. This leads to biasing when a different distribution with the same mean particle diameter is considered. This paper develops a new sticking–erosion model that accounts for the particle size distribution seen in experimental data typical of glaciated icing conditions. The results of model are compared to experimental accretion data over a range of melt ratio, Mach number, test article geometry, and particle size distribution. The predicted accretion profiles agree reasonably with experiments. The mean difference of the ice tip thickness between predictions and experiments is approximately 2.8 mm, compared to the mean ice tip thickness of 12.0 mm. The plateau effect of melt ratio on accretion is adequately predicted. More severe accretion of the small- to medium-sized ice crystals is observed. The predicted net accretion efficiency of large particles is small and is shown to be negative due to the effect of erosion. This concurs with the experimental observation that the presence of large ice particles is critical to reducing the ice accretion rate.},

However, existing prediction models are often based on idealized assumptions and expressed as the functions of the jet-to-film momentum ratio corrected by different coefficients, which result in the weak generalization abilities of these models. In the present study, a prediction model for the spray angle of the liquid–liquid pintle injector was established and verified. The initial interactions between the radial jet column and the axial jet film were considered, and the deflected trajectory of the transverse jet column was derived theoretically; then, the spray angle of the pintle injector was thus obtained. Specially designed experiments were carried out, and the spray angles were extracted by using high-speed photography. The comparisons between the experimental and the predicted results clearly exhibit the limitations of the traditional models that are based on the momentum ratio only, and they prove the accuracy of our new model.},

We utilize the active subspace method to embed the original parameter space in a low-dimensional subspace. The active subspace is detected by analyzing the spectrum of the empirical second-moment matrix of the gradients of the response function. By mapping the training data onto their respective subspace, the objective function and the constraint functions are efficiently approximated with low-dimensional GE-kriging models. In each cycle of the BO procedure, a new point is found by maximizing the constrained expected improvement function within a low-dimensional polytope, and it is mapped back to the original space for model evaluation. In this way, the computational costs are significantly reduced when compared with standard GE-kriging. We illustrate and assess the proposed approach with numerical experiments ranging from academic benchmark problems to aerodynamic engineering applications. The experimental results show that the proposed method is promising for optimizing high-dimensional expensive objective functions, especially for problems that exhibit a clear low-dimensional active subspace.},

  abstract     = {Mars has a lower atmospheric density than Earth, and the speed of sound is lower due to its atmospheric composition and lower surface temperature. Consequently, Martian rotor blades operate in a low-Reynolds-number compressible regime that is atypical for terrestrial helicopters. Nonconventional airfoils with sharp edges and flat surfaces have shown improved performance under such conditions, and second-order-accurate Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) and unsteady RANS (URANS) solvers have been combined with genetic algorithms to optimize them. However, flow over such airfoils is characterized by unsteady roll-up of coherent vortices that subsequently break down/transition. Accordingly, RANS/URANS solvers have limited predictive capability, especially at higher angles of attack where the aforementioned physics are more acute. To overcome this limitation, we undertake optimization using high-order direct numerical simulations (DNSs). Specifically, a triangular airfoil is optimized using DNSs. Multi-objective optimization is performed to maximize lift and minimize drag, yielding a Pareto front. Various quantities, including lift spectra and pressure distributions, are analyzed for airfoils on the Pareto front to elucidate flow physics that yield optimal performance. The optimized airfoils that form the Pareto front achieve up to a 48\% increase in lift or a 28\% reduction in drag compared to a reference triangular airfoil studied in the Mars Wind Tunnel at Tohoku University. The work constitutes the first use of DNSs for aerodynamic shape optimization.},

This means that the learning process has to be used and the probabilistic learning on manifolds algorithm is chosen. Although the aeroacoustic simulation is conducted on a large aeroacoustic computational model, some approximations are introduced, generating model errors that are taken into account by a probability model in the constructed training dataset. This probability model is calibrated using dimensionless experiments available from the open literature. Despite the fact that only a small amount of data is available, a novel statistical metamodel is successfully developed for which the predictions are consistent. This statistical framework allows for exhibiting a confidence region of the parameterized aeroacoustic liner impedance, which gives an information about the level of uncertainties as a function of the frequency and the control parameters.},

  abstract     = {Estimation of inflow conditions, such as wind speed and angle of attack, is vital for assessing aerodynamic performance of a lifting profile. This task is particularly challenging in the field due to the inherent stochasticity of the inflow variables. In practice, the field installation of a measurement system exacerbates the measurement uncertainty. Here, we present a hybrid model to infer the inflow conditions on a wind turbine blade along with a process to quantify the involved uncertainty. The model combines potential flow theory and conformal mapping with pressure measurements from a novel monitoring system, which eliminates the need for external reference pressure measurements. Stagnation point location and wind speed are formulated as outputs of an optimization problem, in which pressure differences along the surface of an airfoil are connected to the potential flow solution through the Bernoulli equation. The proposed scheme is experimentally validated. The hybrid model offers a practical and robust solution for inflow condition estimation, suitable for field deployment on wind turbine or aircraft. The uncertainty quantification process provides valuable insights for improving monitoring system design and quantifying the accuracy of the predictive scheme before actual field installation.},

  abstract     = {Acoustics are considered in a straight cylindrical lined duct with an axial mean flow that is uniform apart from a boundary layer near the wall. Within the boundary layer, which may or may not be thin, the flow profile is quadratic and satisfies no-slip at the wall. Time-harmonic modal solutions to the linearized Euler equations are found by solving the Pridmore-Brown equation using Frobenius series. The Briggs–Bers criterion is used to ascertain the spatial stability of the modes, without considering absolute instabilities. The modes usually identified as hydrodynamic instabilities are found to interact with the critical layer branch cut, also known as the continuous spectrum. By varying the boundary-layer thickness, flow speed, frequency, and wall impedance, it is found that these spatial instabilities can be stabilized behind the critical layer branch cut. In particular, spatial instabilities are only found for a boundary layer thinner than a critical boundary-layer thickness . The behaviors observed for the uniform-quadratic sheared flow considered here are further compared to a uniform-linear sheared flow, and a uniform slipping flow under the Ingard–Myers boundary condition, where this process of stabilization is not observed. It is therefore argued that modeling a sufficiently smooth mean flow boundary layer is necessary to predict the correct stability of flow over a lined wall.},

  abstract     = {For certain Reynolds numbers, airfoils are subject to sporadic high-amplitude fluctuations in the aerodynamic forces. These extreme excursions may be seen as prototypical of the kind of unsteady and intermittent dynamics relevant to the flow around airfoils and wings in a variety of real-world applications. Here we investigate the instability mechanisms at the heart of these extreme events, and how they may be harnessed for efficient data-driven forecasting. Through a wavelet and spectral analysis of the pressure and vorticity, we find that the extreme events arise due to the instability of a specific frequency component distinct from the vortex shedding mode. During these events, this extreme event frequency draws energy from the energetically dominant vortex shedding flow and undergoes an abrupt transfer of energy from small to large scales. We propose a preprocessing algorithm to extract this extreme event frequency from the surface pressure data, which in conjunction with an extreme event-tailored loss function, allows us to avoid the commonly used long short-term memory architecture in favor of a simple feed-forward network—a significant reduction in cost over the previous state-of-the-art. Our model requires only three pressure sensors, and it is robust to their location—showing promise for the use of our model in dynamically varying applications. Finally, we show that relying solely on the statistics of the pressure and drag data for optimal sensor placement fails to improve model prediction over uniform or random sensor placement.},

This paper presents a sensor-selection framework for the intended application of data-driven, flowfield estimation. This framework combines data-driven modeling, steady-state Kalman filter design, and sparse, sequential sensor selection. This paper also uses the sensor selection framework to design sensor arrays that can perform well for a collection of operating conditions. Flow estimation results on numerical data show that the proposed framework produces arrays that are highly effective at flowfield estimation for the flow behind and an airfoil at a high angle of attack using embedded pressure sensors. Analysis of the flowfields reveals that paths of impinging stagnation points along the airfoil’s surface during a shedding period of the flow are highly informative locations for placement of pressure sensors.},

We show that the data-enabled recalibration offers improvements while preserving the model’s existing good behavior. In particular, our recalibration improves the model’s behavior in separated flows while preserving its existing good behaviors in flat-plate boundary-layer flows and channel flows.

This study explores the use of alternating current dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators for controlling dynamic stall on a VAWT. The flow control process is resolved using a two-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations simulation with a Reynolds stress turbulence model adopted. The macro-effect of the plasma discharge on mean flow is modeled by an empirical body force model. The detailed flow actuation procedure is simulated. Numerical results show that the flow control process is dominated by the spanwise vortices, which result from the interaction between the plasma discharge and separated flow. The spanwise vortices not only prevent the development of a leading-edge separation bubble into a dynamic stall vortex, but also suppress the flow separation at the trailing edge. The application of plasma forcing has been found to greatly enhance the aerodynamic performance of the turbine in terms of the moment coefficient and averaged power coefficient of the turbine blades. Furthermore, we examine how the positioning of the plasma actuators and the freestream wind velocity affect flow control. The optimal actuation location is determined, and the plasma actuators are seen to be able to substantially enhance the net power output of the blades at all freestream speeds.},

  abstract     = {This study examines low-temperature chemistry (LTC) enhancement by nanosecond dielectric barrier discharge (ns-DBD) plasma on a dimethyl ether (DME)/oxygen (Ar) premixture for deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) in a microchannel. It is found that non-equilibrium plasma generates active species and kinetically accelerates LTC of DME and DDT. In situ laser diagnostics and computational modeling examine the influence of the ns-DBDs on the LTC of DME and DDT using formaldehyde laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and high-speed imaging. Firstly, high-speed imaging in combination with LIF is used to trace the presence of LTC throughout the flame front propagation and DDT. Then, competition between plasma-enhanced LTC of ignition and reduced heat release rate of combustion due to plasma-assisted partial fuel oxidation is studied with LIF. Observations of plasma-enhanced LTC effects on DDT are interpreted with the aid of detailed kinetic simulations. The results show that an appropriate number of ns-DBDs enhances LTC of DME and increases formation and low-temperature ignition, accelerating DDT. Moreover, it is found that, with many ns-DBDs, concentration decreases, indicating that excessive discharges may accelerate fuel oxidation in the premixture, reducing heat release and weakening shock–ignition coupling, inhibiting DDT.},

  abstract     = {Oblique detonation engines have promising applications in hypersonic propulsion due to their compact combustor and high thermal efficiency. However, it is still challenging to achieve stabilized oblique detonation wave in a broad range of flight conditions. This work aims to study the evolution of oblique detonation wave structure in an unsteady inflow with sinusoidal velocity disturbance and to propose a control method to maintain a stable oblique detonation wave in an unsteady inflow. Simulations are conducted for oblique detonation waves in a stoichiometric hydrogen/air mixture, and the detailed chemistry is considered. Results demonstrate that for low-frequency inflow disturbances the autoignition point on the wedge exhibits a smooth trajectory. In contrast, high-frequency inflow disturbances give rise to a new reaction front that subsequently triggers a detonation wave within the induction region, resulting in an abnormal path for the autoignition point. A proportional controller is effectively used to maintain the autoignition point at the desired position, thus stabilizing the oblique detonation wave in unsteady inflow conditions. By implementing the proportional controller, the oblique detonation wave retains relative stability. Moreover, the proportional controller exhibits robust performance in nonideal inflows affected by other types of disturbances, including temperature and attack angle perturbations.},

  abstract     = {In several experimental investigations of hypersonic boundary-layer transition, higher harmonics of the linearly unstable second mode waves as well as low-frequency waves, which are not related to first mode waves, have been observed. It has been conjectured that the higher harmonics are nonlinearly generated by a self-interaction mechanism of the linearly amplified second mode waves. Several hypotheses regarding the origin of the low-frequency waves and their role in the transition process have been put forth. However, a clear understanding of the origin and role of these low-frequency disturbances in the transition process is difficult to attain from experiments and thus still not completely achieved. The nonlinear generation of higher harmonics and low-frequency disturbances is relevant because in high-speed boundary layers, second modes can reach very large amplitudes, which can lead to a considerable stretching of the transitional regime where these nonlinearly generated waves can then reach significant amplitudes and participate in the transition process. To shed light on this unresolved issue, numerical investigations were carried out for a flared cone at Mach 6. These calculations have shown that nonlinear interactions of sufficiently large-amplitude second mode waves can generate low-frequency disturbances. This was confirmed by a theoretical nonlinear interaction model.},

The predominantly hydrodynamic fluctuations inside the boundary layer are nearly unaffected by the freestream forcing of the impinging acoustic radiation from the opposite wall. Within the nozzle-core region, the disturbance environment is found to be spatially uniform and solely acoustic in character. Comparisons with tunnel noise measurements are made using the numerical data. For the first time, comparisons of fluctuations in the same physical quantity (the streamwise mass flux) have been published, as opposed to earlier comparisons involving static-pressure fluctuations based on the simulations and pitot-pressure fluctuations recorded in the wind tunnel. The NASA 20 in. Mach 6 wind tunnel observations corroborate the predicted trend of decreased root-mean-square variations in pressure and mass flux as the Reynolds number rises. Additional details of the acoustic radiation field are quantified and should be useful toward a digital synthesis of the tunnel disturbance environment that would enable realistic simulations of the natural transition process.},

The main challenges of the aerothermal prediction lie in the slow converging speed and the strict requirements of the computational grid. In this paper, a convolutional-neural-network-based hybrid-features deep-learning strategy is constructed to efficiently predict aerodynamic heating, which is named the convolutional neural network/hybrid-feature method. The hybrid features of this strategy consist of the normal distribution of physical quantities from the wall and the flow parameters at the extreme temperature point. The strategy, which extends through the multilayer perceptron regression layer method, constructs the relationship between the hybrid features and the wall heat flux to obtain a high-precision model trained by the flowfield data without gradient convergence. It is demonstrated that the model has a better inflow generalization ability to predict wall heat flux with different inflow conditions and angles of attack by zero-angle-of-attack training data, which has great potential in aircraft thermal protection system design and shape optimization.},

  abstract     = {The paper presents an investigation of fluid–thermal–structural interaction (FTSI) on a complex geometry in hypersonic flows. The objective is to assess high-fidelity numerical tools for FTSI by validating two numerical frameworks against wind-tunnel data. We choose a cone–slice–ramp geometry with a wedge angle of 30 deg subjected to a laminar inflow at Mach 8. First, the time-averaged and the time-resolved laminar flow solutions are validated and highlight the mean flow features and their unsteady characteristics, including low-frequency bubble breathing and shear-layer flapping at a higher frequency. The numerical analysis reveals the presence of upstream and downstream legs of streamwise vortices. Next, FTSI analysis is performed at a tractable computational cost by decomposing the numerical frameworks into a quasi-steady FTSI (QS-FTSI) analysis and a transient fluid–structure interaction (FSI) analysis based on the disparity of the characteristic timescales. The QS-FTSI results highlight the shear-layer reattachment as the dominant source heating the structure, with nonuniform spanwise variations due to the streamwise vortices. The temperature increase drives the decrease in the structural modal frequencies. The FSI analysis was performed for an unheated, undeformed structure and a nominal heated and deformed structure. The average error in the predicted FSI frequency of the unheated panel is 2.65\% in comparison to the experimental data; however, this value increases to 7.42\% for the heated panel. The frequency peaks are associated with the structural mode shapes via dynamic mode decomposition analysis and show a close resemblance to natural modes, indicating weak FSI coupling. The FTSI study concludes that for a cone–slice–ramp configuration under the present inflow conditions, the interaction mostly occurs in a one-way coupled manner, where the flowfield drives the thermal and structural response of the panel.},

The interactions between these multiscale structures are shown to be well captured with the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, which is a particle-kinetic approach. This computational technique was used because even though the freestream conditions were continuumlike, sufficiently strong gradients in the shock and jet expansion were observed to cause continuum breakdown. The time-accurate DSMC approach has been shown in previous work to capture the multiscale structures and unsteadiness in the shock structure that occurs in such flows, as was also observed in this work. These sources of unsteadiness in the shock system are shown to locally affect surface parameters, such as heat transfer and skin friction, as well as predict a low–frequency unsteadiness consistent with earlier values in the literature.},

Several ROMs currently exist to accurately model a bladed disk with under-platform dampers. To better predict the complex nonlinear response of a system with under-platform dampers, this work demonstrates how two linear models can determine bounds for the nonlinear response. The two cases explored are where the under-platform damper is completely stuck and also where the damper slides without friction. This work utilizes the component mode mistuning method to model small mistuning and a parametric ROM method to capture changes in properties due to rotational speed effects. Previously, these ROM methodologies have modeled freestanding bladed disk systems. To evaluate the ROM in predicting the bounds, blade tip amplitudes from the models are compared with high-speed rotating experiments conducted in a large, evacuated vacuum tank. The experimental data were collected during testing using strain gauges and laser blade tip timing probes. The blade amplitudes of the tip timing data, strain gauge data, and computational simulations are compared to determine the effectiveness of the simplified linear analysis in bounding the nonlinear response of the physical system.},

To address lifespan issues, costly redesign operations are thus unavoidable. These operations face many roadblocks, especially when they are triggered by nonlinear phenomena for which there exists no design guidelines. For aircraft engine blades, the handling of nonlinear structural interactions is a major challenge. This works proposes a proof of concept for the redesign of compressor blades undergoing structural contact interactions at the blade-tip/casing interface. The redesign process involves the modeling of an existing input blade, followed by a shape update based on an iterative optimization algorithm. A two-way modeling method is proposed to parameterize the input blade and generate a computer-aided design model from blade parameters describing several conical blade sections. The fidelity of the parameterized blade with respect to the input blade is assessed for the NASA blades rotor 37 and rotor 67. A high fidelity is observed with respect to geometric and dynamic characteristics. The modeling method is fully compatible with an iterative redesign process: it is applied to the redesign of rotor 37 to increase its robustness to contact interactions.},

For this issue, a novel method is proposed by combining a two-phase subset simulation with an adaptive kriging model (TP-SS-AK). The innovations of the TP-SS-AK include three aspects. First, it creatively transforms the safety lifetime under a small R-FP constraint into that under a large conditional R-FP constraint by subset simulation, which can greatly improve efficiency because the large conditional R-FP constraint only needs a small candidate sample pool for searching the safety lifetime. Second, by deducing the misclassification probability of the time-dependent structure state in the first phase, the first new learning strategy is established to train the kriging model of the time-dependent performance function and further determine a reasonable lifetime search interval efficiently. Third, by deriving the misclassification probability of the first failure instant, the second new learning strategy is constructed to efficiently update the kriging model in the second phase and further search the safety lifetime. Because the proposed TP-SS-AK combines the advantages of the two-phase subset simulation and two new learning strategies, it is superior to the existing methods in efficiency, and its superiority is verified by the examples.},

  abstract     = {A computational model has been developed to analyze composite pi joints subjected to pulloff and side-bend loading. A discrete damage modeling approach is used to capture the interactions between intralaminar damage (matrix cracking) and interlaminar damage (delamination). Cohesive element interlayers and matrix-crack elements are governed by the same mixed-mode traction–separation formulation, resulting in a unified damage framework. The finite element model was calibrated using experimental data from pristine and defective joints. In the calibration process, in situ cohesive material properties were backcalculated from pulloff tests such that the accurate prediction of structural response and the damage evolution of pi joints were possible. Computational predictions for both pulloff and side-bend loading are shown to agree well with experimental results for joints subjected to pulloff and side-bend loading.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing enables the deposition of material in the near-net shape at any desired location on the base plate or shell to improve the structural performance by tailoring the buckling and/or vibration mode shapes. In this study, a stiffened plate with arbitrarily shaped stiffeners is modeled using a nonconformal mesh-based finite element model. Six degrees of freedom are considered for each node of the plate and the stiffener finite element models to enable the couplings between the plate’s and stiffeners’ in-plane and out-of-plane motions. Displacement compatibility is enforced at the interface between the plate and the stiffeners where several skin–stringer connection approaches, including inverse isoparametric mapping algorithm (IIMA), radial basis function, and thin-plate spline function, are used. Various complex models available in the literature are employed for evaluating the skin–stringer connection approaches. Research studies show that the IIMA-based nonconformal mesh modeling can generate a sparse displacement approximation matrix, which makes it an efficient approach for nonconformal mesh-based modeling. For the stiffened plate with higher stiffeners, the present results agree well with those obtained from the Abaqus/CAE conventional conformal mesh and mesh tie constraint-based nonconformal mesh modeling results, but yield better results than the Abaqus/CAE wrapping mesh approach.},

  abstract     = {Vibration levels that onboard equipment must be able to withstand throughout their lives for correct operation are mainly determined experimentally because predicting the dynamic behavior of a complete aircraft requires computational means and methods that are currently difficult to implement. We present a data-driven methodology that leverages flight-test accelerometer data to produce a predictive model. This model, based on an ensemble of artificial neural networks, performs a multioutput multivariate regression to estimate vibration spectra from a set of aircraft general parameters without having to characterize excitation sources. The model is compared with baseline models over two protocols, which are 1) standard training and testing as well as 2) extrapolation to high dynamic pressures, in order to assess physical consistency. Although the first protocol shows that all models can produce results accurate enough for this context, the second protocol shows that only the ensemble model is able to correctly extrapolate the energy. Using the Shapley additive explanations method, also known as SHAP, we show that these results can be explained by the ability of our model to identify the dynamic pressure as the core feature used in the extrapolation protocol. The proposed model can be used in multiple applications, such as anomaly detection and vibration flight envelope opening.},

  abstract     = {Often, lossless jet-noise data obtained by various researchers in different facilities do not match after accounting for jet operating conditions, measurement distance, and nozzle dimensions using accepted jet-noise scaling laws. There have been a number of explanations for these differences, but the most contentious of these is attributing rig-noise contamination to be the cause of the differences. This reasoning calls all the measurements that have been acquired in the facility into question. Knowing if jet noise is contaminated by rig noise in a given facility is crucial to obtaining high-quality jet-noise data, and a simple method is needed to determine if rig noise is indeed present in a given set of measurements. One such method is the so-called doubling-diameter method that was first published by the second author. Validation of this method is the focus of the present study. This validation was conducted using cylindrical obstructions upstream of the nozzle exit. Not only it is shown that this method can accurately detect rig-noise contamination, but in a case study, the Georgia Tech Research Institute Anechoic Jet Facility is shown to be free of rig-noise contamination.},

The focus is on the effect of wall cavities carved in the fuel grain using additive manufacturing. An improved understanding of how the wall geometry contributes to the establishment of acoustic modes is sought. A novel combustion mechanism was developed using a counterflow burner to study the combustion and regression of solid model fuel polymethyl methacrylate. The diffusion flame between the fuel and oxidizer was studied numerically using a solid-fuel decomposition and melt layer model to simulate convection and pyrolysis of the material. This model was validated using new experimental data as well as previously published works. The foam layer parameters are critical to the success of the validation, showing that the increased residence time of the gas in the bubbles facilitates the fuel breakdown. Fourth-order computational simulations of ramjet combustion without regressing fuel walls using a novel discontinuous Galerkin approach are performed with a fully conjugate solution for the thermal wave in the solid. Turbulent transport strongly affects the heat feedback to the walls, and low-frequency vortical modes (e.g., with a vortical wavemaker) associated with a recirculation region at the injector upstream wall are linked to an increase in chamber pressure and fuel mass flux.},

Computational simulations were used to support the model development, provide important information such as load distributions along the high-lift elements, and aid in the design of noise reduction devices. Aerodynamic and far-field acoustic measurements were obtained on baseline and acoustically treated model configurations using an ensemble of time-averaged and unsteady surface pressure sensors paired with a traversing 97-microphone phased array viewing the pressure side of the airframe. A deconvolution method incorporating corrections for shear layer acoustic wave decorrelation was employed to determine the locations and strengths of relevant noise sources along the span of the slat and in the vicinity of the flap edges and landing gear. The main goal of the test campaign was to use the surface pressure and array data to evaluate the effectiveness of various slat noise reduction concepts. It was found that slat-gap fillers produced significant broadband noise reduction with minimal aerodynamic performance penalties for all Mach numbers and airfoil angles of attack that were investigated. The test campaign clearly demonstrated the noise reduction benefits that can be obtained by applying appropriate treatments to leading-edge slats on commercial transport-class aircraft.},

As development of both military and commercial supersonic aircraft continues to grow, it is essential to combat increasing noise pollution. Axisymmetric jets are highly prevalent where their aeroacoustic characteristics have been well-documented; in contrast, relatively few studies have examined non-axisymmetric jets. In the present study, aeroacoustics of supersonic jets produced by a diamond-shaped Mach 2 nozzle are explored across a large operational envelope under different pressure ratios ranging from highly overexpanded to moderately underexpanded. Measurements of the far-field acoustics in an anechoic environment were used to characterize the acoustic flowfield and contrast the distribution of energy in the spectral domain between the characteristic major and minor axes of the nozzle. Overall, the diamond jet exhibits a highly directional acoustic field with a distinct local minimum for sideline noise. Furthermore, screech behavior was only observed in a narrow, overexpanded flow regime; this is in contrast to the documented behavior of axisymmetric and rectangular jets. Over the conditions examined there is no indication of distinct staging. Additionally, there exists a nozzle pressure ratio threshold beyond which peak noise switches axes.},

In this work, we propose a technique for highly accelerated prediction of aeroacoustic response using a data-driven model reduction approach based on the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA). Specifically, we create and compare ERA reduced-order models (ROMs) based on the training data generated by solving the linearized and nonlinear Euler equations, and we use them to predict the aeroacoustic response of an airfoil in a purely predictive setting subject to different types of gust loading. Activating each input channel separately in the full-order model (FOM) to generate the Markov sequence for training makes it computationally challenging to use the ERA in aeroacoustics applications. We address this bottleneck by first proposing a multifidelity gappy POD method to reduce the computation cost on the FOM and ROM levels by querying the high-resolution FOM only for the input channels identified by gappy POD. Second, we use tangential interpolation at the ROM level to reduce the size of the Hankel matrix. The proposed methods enable application of the ERA for accurate online acoustic response prediction, and they reduce the offline computation cost of ROMs.},

Advances in hyper-reduction have enabled the scalable computation of PROMs for general nonlinear dynamical systems. Further, the recent model-form-preserving least squares with variable transformation method has proven capable of generating stable PROMs for extremely stiff multiphysics problems. In this work, we formulate a PROM framework combining these methodologies and demonstrate that robust, accurate, and cost-effective PROMs can be realized for complex nonreacting and reacting compressible flows. Along with an open-source toolchain for hyper-reduction sample mesh generation from extremely large data sets, this represents an end-to-end effort to assess the applicability of PROMs to large-scale, multiphysics problems of engineering interest. We examine practical considerations for implementing hyper-reduction methods and their effect on memory consumption, load balancing, and interprocessor communications. These considerations produce accurate PROMs that are three to four orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than the full-order model in recreating transonic flow over a cavity and reacting flow in a rocket combustor. Guidelines for data preparation, sample mesh construction, and online PROM solution which promote robust simulations are also provided.},

Measurements are conducted for a cavity with a length-to-depth ratio of 4.5 at Mach numbers of 2, 3, 4, and 5. Dynamic pressures are measured within the cavity and on the store surfaces. An increase in Mach number results in a decrease in overall sound pressure levels at all measurement locations within the cavity. Pressure spectra indicate that increasing the Mach number decreases both the peak and broadband amplitudes of the cavity pressure fluctuations. At Mach 5, the amplitude of the cavity modes is significantly reduced in the upstream half of the cavity, and the modes are either indistinguishable from broadband levels or absent in the downstream half. The addition of stores reduces cavity acoustics, with two stores offering greater reduction than a single store. The effect of Mach number and the presence of stores on the aeroacoustic feedback loop in a cavity align with literature. Additionally, the pressure fluctuations on the windward store surface scale with Mach number in a similar trend as the cavity acoustics.},

Moreover, based on the time-averaged pressure coefficients obtained at three heights on each of the models, it was seen that the symmetry of flow varied with Reynolds number. A modified peak–valley method was proposed to identify the intermittent events of separation-bubble formation. By this method, pronounced variations in the real-time signals due to intermittent formation of the separation bubble were identified, which were referred as to the characteristic events. Interesting findings included that the average normalized timescales of the characteristic events fell within 0.1 and 0.6, whereas the average normalized timescales obtained from the real-time traces of the lift coefficient were mostly around 0.08.

GSA is first performed at wind tunnel Reynolds number conditions, and a buffet-cell mode localized in the wing outboard region is found to be responsible for the onset. When the side-of-body (SOB) separation becomes larger at higher angles of attack, two additional modes are detected: a high-frequency mode localized in the SOB region and a low-frequency long-wavelength buffet-cell mode that may represent the link with the shock-oscillation instability found in two-dimensional airfoils. The existence of the buffet-cell mode is confirmed at flight Reynolds numbers. However, due to the presence of large SOB separation at the onset angle of attack, this mode is distributed along the whole wing and an SOB separation mode also appears. As well as characterizing buffet on industry-relevant geometries and flow conditions, this study proves that the proposed GSA framework is feasible for large 3D numerical grids and can represent a useful tool for buffet onset prediction during design and certification phases of commercial aircraft.},

  abstract     = {Effective and reliable slipstream numerical simulation methods are important for propeller-driven aircraft design. This paper presents a high-precision and efficient momentum source method (HPE-MSM) based on a novel actuator disk load prediction model established by the frozen rotor method and blade element momentum theory. The simulation results of two benchmark test cases of an isolated propeller and a typical turboprop airliner show that the accuracy of the HPE-MSM proposed in this paper is close to the time-averaged unsteady results of the sliding mesh method (SMM), with a maximum error of 5\% in aircraft lift and drag coefficients compared with experimental values. Meanwhile, the calculation efficiency of the HPE-MSM is comparable to quasi-steady methods, with only about 3.4\% of the computation resources of the SMM in the whole aircraft simulation. This novel approach achieves high-precision and efficient simulation of the slipstream, which has the potential to improve the design level of propeller-driven aircraft.},

The experiments were carried out at the Florida A&amp;M University and Florida State University low-speed wind tunnel over a range of forebody deflection (, and ) and flow conditions. The results show that a positive forebody deflection increases the normal-force coefficient, whereas a negative forebody deflection decreases the normal-force coefficient at high angles of incidence. Pitching moment characteristics showed that all forebody deflections tested produce a pitching moment despite minimal normal force at low angles of incidence. Lateral aerodynamic characteristics showed that the side-force onset angle does not solely depend on the semi-apex angle of the forebody (as predicted for axisymmetric slender bodies), and the role of the forebody-to-aftbody transition geometry in initiating vortex asymmetry is equally important. The particle image velocimetry results show that a positive forebody deflection increases the size, strength, and circulation of the vortices developing on the body, leading to an increase in aerodynamic forces and moments. The flowfield development for a negative forebody deflection is dominated by secondary shear-layer vortices originating from the forebody to aftbody junction.},

Quantifying the effect that these velocity fluctuations may have on the propulsion of a flapping and oscillating airfoil is of great relevance to properly modeling the self-propelled performance of these animals or robotic vehicles. This is the objective of the present work, where the force and moment that an oscillating stream exerts on a two-dimensional pitching and heaving airfoil are obtained analytically using the vortical impulse theory in the linear potential flow limit. The thrust force of the flapping airfoil in a pulsating stream in this limit is obtained here for the first time. The lift force and moment derived here contain new terms in relation to the pioneering work by Greenberg (1947), which are shown quantitatively unimportant. The theoretical results obtained here are compared with existing computational data for flapping foils immersed in a stream with velocity oscillating sinusoidally about a mean value.},

Force-based experiments, smoke flow visualization, surface flow visualization, and phase-locked particle image velocimetry (PIV) indicate the presence of three distinct performance zones as a function of the advance ratio and ground distance, where the ground effect changes drastically. The power required at constant thrust shows an increasing trend after a threshold advance ratio for each and then decreases steeply upon a further increase in the advance ratio. Phase-locked PIV revealed the presence of a fountain vortex and a ground vortex at distinct for each distance that correlates with an increase in power and a decrease in thrust, respectively. At advance ratios below the onset of the fountain vortex lies the optimal ground effect zone. An increase in the advance ratio beyond this threshold will result in power increments due to the formation of the fountain vortex. A further increase in the advance ratio initiates the onset of the ground vortex where the ground effect is significantly reduced. The onset of the fountain vortex and the ground vortex occurs at comparatively lower advance ratios for propellers at a positive incidence angle. A normalization method is developed for ground effect forward flight that collapses the in-ground-effect performance for various normalized heights, advance ratios, and incidence angles.},

The vortex tube at the larger span underwent significant distortion, which contrasted with the vortex observed at the lower span. The vortical structure eventually interacted with the trailing-edge vortex, which was not observed at . Examination of the unsteady loads detailed a larger lift slope, mean values, peak values, and earlier stall as the aspect ratio increased.

  abstract     = {The exergy concept originates from the field of static thermodynamics and expresses the maximum theoretically recoverable mechanical work from a system while it evolves toward its dead thermodynamic state. It accounts for both mechanical and thermal mechanisms, and it allows to separate reversible and irreversible losses in the system’s transformations. The physical insight provided by this concept motivated the development of an exergy-based performance evaluation method in the field of aerodynamics. The resulting formulation has the advantage of being independent of the feasibility of a drag/thrust breakdown (ambiguous for highly integrated engine concepts) and includes thermal effects in the performance metrics. It, however, relies on an adapted definition of exergy, in particular involving a dead state in motion. This adapted definition is not trivial and raises theoretical concerns due to fundamental thermodynamic properties of exergy not being always satisfied. This paper aims at proposing a corrected version of this definition that ensures that the fundamental properties of exergy are respected. First, the exergy concept is presented alongside the concerns raised by its original adaptation, which, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, has been used in all exergy-based flowfield analyses in the field of applied aerodynamics. Then, an unsteady exergy balance is derived in the geocentric reference frame (in which there are no ambiguities in the definition of exergy) and then transformed to a reference frame in translation. The corrected adaptation of the exergy definition for aerodynamics applications is extracted from this transformation and the impact on the exergy balance is analyzed.},

  abstract     = {An internal unsteady compressible flowfield of a pulsed jet actuator (PJA) is simulated by unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) and large-eddy simulation (LES) frameworks. The PJA’s feedback loops are short enough to have non-negligible jet switching time compared to the oscillation period. The results show that within a range of inlet pressure (which is the only control parameter) where the jet goes from subsonic to supersonic regime, the oscillation frequencies and the exit velocity waveform predicted by LES are in better agreement with the measured data than those predicted by URANS. Although URANS is able to capture the flowfield inside the feedback loops, it fails to predict the exit jet dynamics, unlike LES. This indicates the importance of a proper resolution of turbulence in the interaction region where jet switching occurs. Using LES data, it is found that the total jet switching time remains constant as the inlet pressure changes. It is also found that only the part of the jet switching period that ends at the first moment when the jet attaches to the opposite wall is involved in the oscillation period. Therefore, a new lumped model is proposed to estimate the oscillation frequency, which also explains the trend observed for the low inlet pressure values.},

Vortex stretching appears near both the and centerline planes, which is weakened by the increasing aspect ratio. Vortex ring pinch-off on both centerline planes can be identified by the magnitude of the vorticity flux delivered into the vortex ring. The dimensionless time for pinch-off (the formation numbers) for the square jet is at about 2.0 on both diagonal plane and midplane. For the rectangular jets, the formation number is reduced from 2.3 to 1.5 on the major axis plane by increasing aspect ratio, while it approaches 1.7 on the minor axis plane, which is independent of the aspect ratio. Our results suggest that the vortex deformation accelerates the pinch-off process on both the major and minor axis planes. In particular, the appearance of secondary vortices on the major plane and the arc-shaped vortices on the minor plane signals the onset of pinch-off.},

Therefore, this study aims to investigate using more electromechanically efficient piezoceramics, such as single-crystal, lead magnesium niobate–lead titanate (PMN-PT). In addition, two different orifice-diaphragm configurations of synthetic jet actuators, opposite and adjacent, are tested. It is identified that PMN-PT piezoceramic promotes three times higher transverse diaphragm displacement and two times more peak jet velocity compared to the PZT-5A piezoelectric actuator for the same input diaphragm voltage. A peak exit jet velocity of was obtained at 40 V of peak supply voltage, which can be classified as a low voltage supply compared to other studies in the literature that obtained similar exit jet velocity. Also, a power conversion efficiency of 72\% was achieved, corresponding to the Helmholtz resonance frequency.

The expansion ratio of the converging nozzle is maintained at 0.96, 1.19, and 1.59, and the CD nozzle is operated at a fixed nozzle pressure ratio of 3. The temperature ratio of the jet from the CD nozzle is varied from 1.0, 1.3, and 1.7. For a fixed momentum of the jet pair, an increase in jet temperature intensified the nearfield noise and unsteadiness on the impingement surface. At short impingement heights, resonance in the heated jet was the primary source of unsteadiness. At a fixed impingement height, an increase in jet temperature led to a systematic increase in tonal frequency, while jet instability mode shapes were retained. Furthermore, the mean flowfield of sonic jet and fountain regions remain unaffected, and an increase in supersonic jet velocity is observed. This is also accompanied by an increase in unsteadiness in the fountain upwash.},

This singularity incurs various numerical difficulties because the derivatives are indeterminate at the sonic condition and the solution cannot march in the streamwise direction, requiring special numerical treatment. To overcome this issue, two solution processes are augmented in the ODE system: coordinate transform, and solution extrapolation from the equivalent subsonic system. An additional variable is defined to convert the spatial coordinate into a dependent variable that characterizes the transonic flow only by the solution curve passing through the critical point. After the transformation, solution variables are extrapolated from the subsonic solutions obtained with a predicted critical (sonic) condition via a forward iterative shooting method such that the flow properties are smoothly varying both upstream and downstream of the critical point. As a result, there is a good agreement in the predicted critical point with the theoretical location. Moreover, the new method successfully yields the transonic solution without any abrupt or discontinuous changes in flow properties including species fractions, which is almost impossible with existing methods.},

The numerical dataset, from a previous work, is obtained from direct numerical simulations of confined spherical flames in isotropic turbulence over a range of Reynolds numbers. We begin the derivation of the model with an equation for the burning rate for the domain under consideration, and using a thin flame assumption and a two-fluid approach, we find the normalized turbulent burning rate to be controlled by the increase in flame surface area due to turbulent wrinkling, and correction factor that is observed to be consistently less than unity. A Reynolds scaling hypothesis for the flame turbulent wrinkling from a previous work using the same numerical dataset is used to model the term controlling the increase in flame surface area. The correction factor is hypothesized to reflect flame stretch effects, and hence this factor is modeled using Markstein theory applied to global averaged quantities. The ordinary differential equations are rewritten to reflect easily observable quantities such as the chamber pressure and mean flame radius, and then expressed in dimensionless form to assess dependence on various dimensionless parameters. The model predictions are found to be in good agreement with the numerical data within expected variances. Additionally, Markstein theory is found to be sufficient in describing the effects of flame stretch in the turbulent premixed flames under consideration.},

  abstract     = {Accurately solving the anisotropic interface problem is one of the difficulties in aerospace plasma applications. Based on cubic Cartesian meshes, this paper develops a trilinear nonhomogeneous immersed finite element (IFE) method for solving the complex anisotropic 3D elliptic interface model with nonhomogeneous flux jump. Compared with the existing 3D linear IFE spaces based on tetrahedron meshes, the newly designed trilinear IFE space for the target model simplifies the mesh generation, significantly reduces the number of mesh elements and interface elements, provides much more convenient and efficient ways for finding the intersections between interfaces and mesh edges, and decreases the errors. These advantages lead to much higher efficiency when solving complex anisotropic interface problems in practice. In addition, the proposed method can be easily incorporated into other typical methods based on Cartesian meshes, such as the particle-in-cell method for plasma simulation. Numerical experiments are provided to verify the optimal accuracy, high efficiency, and reliability of the proposed method for solving complex interface problems, as well as its applicability to practical plasma thruster problems.},

  abstract     = {Hall thrusters with an internal cathode are widely used due to their ability to enhance efficiency, minimize plume divergence, and eliminate plume asymmetry. In addition, the long-lifetime technology of Hall thrusters typically relocates the intense magnetic-field region outside the channel, known as an “aft-loaded magnetic field,” to mitigate erosion of the discharge channel caused by high-energy ions. However, this exacerbates plume divergence and diminishes overall performance. Therefore, this research focuses on optimizing a Hall thruster with an aft-loaded magnetic field and internal cathode. Given that electrons emitted by the internal cathode initially diffuse onto the magnetic separatrix and subsequently couple with the ion beam in the plume, this study experimentally investigates the impact of the magnetic separatrix shape on the discharge characteristics and plume behavior of the Hall thruster. The experimental findings indicate that expanding the envelope of the magnetic separatrix contributes to improved plume focusing and enhanced performance. Thus, the results of this study highlight the significance of the magnetic field outside the channel as a crucial design factor for long-lifetime Hall thrusters.},

  abstract     = {The restart ability of inlets is significant to the robustness of hypersonic airbreathing vehicles. Classic starting theories based on the one-dimensional and inviscid flow assumption cannot predict the restart boundary accurately. To overcome the classic theories, the restart characteristics of two-dimensional contraction ducts in viscous flow are numerically studied. The restart boundaries for different configurations and flow conditions are determined, and the restart similarity laws are discovered. With the proposed dimensionless quantities (the dimensionless cowl length and the effective throat-entrance area ratio), the influences of multiple factors on restart are described simultaneously in a concise self-similar formulation. The restart characteristics can be described with any two variables in cowl angle, dimensionless cowl length, and effective area ratio. The restarts of two-dimensional inlets are classified into three types of the short-cowl, transitional, and long-cowl restarts according to the features of restart boundary lines and the flow structure. The three restart types are dominated by the competition between the cowl shock system and cowl tail expansion waves, the cowl shock system alone, and the complementation between the cowl shock system and throat choke, respectively. The wall pressure criteria for restart are correlated with the dimensionless cowl length and the characteristic separation scale at the restart critical state. It is observed that Kantrowitz limit is not generalizable for restart boundaries.},

Under the comprehensive consideration of accuracy and computational efficiency, the applicability of four numerical algorithms, including finite element method (FEM), arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), and SPH–FEM, in the penetration simulation is evaluated. Finally, SPH–FEM is the optimal algorithm for the numerical simulation of the penetrator penetrating lunar soil. The convergence of the penetration model is tested. Finally, an accurate numerical model of the penetrator penetrating lunar soil is obtained. Then, the effects of incident velocity, incident angle, and angle of attack on penetration performance are studied, respectively, which provide reference for the design and process control of the penetrator project.},

The proposed scheme employs in-flight out-of-plane strain measurements at each of the multicopter booms to detect, identify, and quantify rotor faults while distinguishing them from the aircraft response to random gusts. Its robust performance is demonstrated with application to a 2-foot-diam hexacopter flying under varying forward velocity and gross weight configurations, as well as atmospheric disturbances and uncertainty. The rotor fault diagnosis takes place in two steps. First, a simple perceptron classifies the aircraft’s health condition. If a rotor fault is detected it is simultaneously identified and the fault magnitude estimation step initiates. Here, linear regression models are used to predict the respective rotor degradation values with their 95\% confidence intervals. The generalization capability of the method is established with several test data under unmodeled operating conditions (not used in the training phase). The proposed framework can accurately diagnose even minor rotor faults of 8\% degradation while distinguishing them from aggressive gusts of up to magnitude. The maximum fault detection time is less than 0.3 s. The health state classification and the rotor fault magnitude quantification accuracy are over 99\%.},

The effort aimed to develop, evaluate, and enhance methods to predict damage initiation, progression, and failure of postbuckled composite hat-stiffened panels using the commercially available software Abaqus. Three methods were considered: the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT), the cohesive zone model (CZM), and enhanced Schapery theory (EST). The VCCT and CZM successfully predicted multiple delaminations. EST works with the CZM to capture delamination and facilitate interactions between interlaminar and intralaminar failures. When comparing the damage morphology against the experimental data produced through the NASA Advanced Composites Project, the present models captured the delamination, matrix, and fiber damage patterns. The VCCT and EST predictions were within 2\% of the experimental peak load.},

A genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem in which the objective function is mimicked using a surrogate model. Both unconstrained and manufactured-constrained problems are solved. The surrogates are built with outcomes from numerical models generated by means of the Carrera unified formulation, which enables to obtain straightforwardly different degrees of accuracy by selecting the order of the structural theory employed. The results show both the validity and flexibility of the proposed design approach. It is shown that, although the optimal design fiber angle orientations are consistently similar, discrepancies in the prediction of the buckling load or fundamental frequency can be found between high-fidelity layerwise and low-to-refined equivalent-single-layer models, of which classical laminated plate or first-shear deformation theories are degenerate examples.},

Hence, it is important to be able to detect and quantify the delamination crack growth behavior due to fatigue loading and explore methods to heal the delamination in situ, without the need for mechanical fasteners. To this end, double cantilever beam specimens of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer composite containing thermoplastic healants were manufactured, and mode I fatigue delamination experiments were carried out for the virgin and healed cases for oven healing, and in situ macro fiber composite healing cases. The primary purpose of using thermoplastic healants (polycaprolactone and shape memory polymer) was to heal the cracks formed during fatigue loading and regain the load-carrying capacity of the composite structure. The in situ healing was carried out by activating the macro fiber composite actuators attached to the double cantilever beam specimen after 5000 cycles of loading to generate heat. After in situ healing, significant reduction in crack growth compared to the virgin cycle was observed, and healing was repetitive. We envision that these findings will be immensely helpful in extending the service life of composites and may also result in significant repair cost savings.},

Based on the Karhunen–Loève orthogonal decomposition reduced theories, the reduced-order model of the complete double-rotor systems is obtained.

The general expression of oil film force and effective reduced-order model are given. The numerical comparison shows that the degree of freedom was reduced to , and the computational running time was shortened to of the full-order model by analyzing the amplitudes and bifurcations at the front and back supports of the casing. It has the highest recognition accuracy and the shorter automatic recognition time of EfficientNetV2 than other network models.

  abstract     = {Recent years have seen a renewed interest in rotary-wing aircraft, due to the emergence of urban air mobility. In the conceptual design of such aircraft, fast estimation of rotor performance is important. A challenge is that rotor performance models require a detailed description of the blade geometry, which is not always available at this stage. We have developed a new, robust method for rapidly computing optimal rotor designs, which is derived from blade element momentum theory. In this paper, we derive the rotor design method and prove its convergence for all reasonable model inputs. We verify the design method by comparing the optimal rotor designs it computes to those found by a nonlinear programming algorithm. Thousands of numerical experiments yield relative errors of less than 13 and 5\% in terms of the chord and twist profiles, respectively, and less than 0.3\% in terms of efficiency, thrust, torque, and power coefficients. In addition, the design method computes optimal designs 170 times faster compared to the nonlinear programming algorithm. Based on these findings, we expect this new rotor design method to be useful in the conceptual design of rotary-wing aircraft.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory planning for a multihelicopter transportation system requires optimizing numerous variables while considering obstacle avoidance, formation shape change, multibody dynamics and other feasibility constraints, making it challenging to achieve real-time effectiveness and convergence. To overcome this issue, a real-time trajectory planning method based on differential flatness and a minimum control effort (MINCO) trajectory expression is proposed. This method enables the implicit consideration of dynamic constraints and formation shape change requirements, and it handles obstacle avoidance and feasibility constraints linearly, reducing the complexity of planning. Specifically, the flatness characteristics and related assumptions of the system are given in detail by considering two cases where the load is modeled as a mass point or a rigid body. The obstacle avoidance trajectory planning problem is transformed into an unconstrained optimization problem based on MINCO and its spatial–temporal deformation. This optimization aims to minimize the trajectory energy and total time consumption while considering cost functions related to load obstacle avoidance, load state feasibility, helicopter obstacle avoidance, swarm avoidance between helicopters, cable obstacle avoidance, and cable force feasibility constraints. Finally, simulations are conducted in both cases where the load is modeled as a mass point and a rigid body to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. Overall, the proposed method has the potential to solve the problem of trajectory planning with obstacle avoidance in a multihelicopter transportation system in real time with improved efficiency and effectiveness.},

The WaveNet, which was originally a neural network architecture for audio processing, has been modified and first introduced to the analysis of mechanical signals to capture long-term dependencies in mechanical systems and generate high-quality signals. A novel nonlinear system identification method has been proposed using a modified WaveNet-based approach that constructs a relationship between the vibration response and the nonlinear elements in the inverse model without the need for a definite structural model. This approach uses dilated convolution for feature extraction and a multilayer perceptron for feature transition, with the addition of average pooling along the time dimension for adaptive processing of varying length data, which are more computationally efficient and widely applicable. The 13-layer modified WaveNet models have been designed and applied to the problem. Comparisons with other baseline models were made to demonstrate the method’s superiority in terms of accuracy, effectiveness, and robustness. Additionally, the method has been applied to predict composite models of friction and elastic curves, demonstrating its ability to handle diverse and complex problems.},

The morphing variables are the phase shift and frequency of the edge deformation. All cases take into account the power required to morph the foils. The independently morphing LE/TE edge cases show regions of phase angle and frequency that yield improved efficiency over the rigid baseline of up to 16.8\% for the NACA 0015 foil and 22.6\% in the flat-plate case. The combined LE and TE cases further increase the efficiency, up to 29.7\% for the NACA 0015 foil and 36.2\% in the flat-plate case. Three physical mechanisms are identified that lead to efficiency increases in the various cases through the interaction between the morphing foil and shed vortex structure. These are the change in projected area during the plunging stroke, the variation of leading-edge vortex shedding timing during the cycle, and the proximity of the shed vortex structure to the foil during the pitching portion of the stroke.},

The objective of the experiments was to document both the level of drag reduction and the net power savings achievable over this Mach number range. The arrays were designed to produce a spanwise array of opposed wall jets confined to the turbulent boundary-layer buffer region. These served to intervene in the autonomous near-wall mechanism that produces buffer-layer streamwise vorticity and is largely responsible for high levels of friction drag. It was demonstrated that the actuator array produces unprecedented levels of friction drag reduction with significant net power savings. Perhaps most interesting was the observation that the actuator authority has to be reduced for increased Mach numbers in order to keep the wall jets confined to the turbulent boundary-layer buffer region. This gave rise to a net power savings that scaled as . Unlike many previous experiments with plasma actuators, these results show that this form of flow control would not be authority limited in actual flight applications.},

  abstract     = {During the development of an aircraft, a multitude of aerodynamic data are required for different flight conditions throughout the flight envelope. Nowadays, a large portion of these data are routinely acquired by computational fluid dynamics simulations. However, due to modeling and convergence issues especially for extreme flight conditions, numerical data cannot be reliably generated for the entire flight envelope yet. Hence, numerical data are complemented by data from wind tunnel experiments and flight testing. However, the data from these different sources will always show some discrepancies to deal with. Data fusion methods aim at combining the individual strengths and weaknesses of data from different sources in order to provide a consistent data set for the entire parameter domain. In this work we propose an extension to the well-established Gappy proper orthogonal decomposition technique by reformulating the least-squares problem as a regression task. A Bayesian perspective is imposed to account for uncertainties during the data fusion process. This involves a kernelized regression formulation that also addresses the problem of linearity imposed by the dimensionality reduction method and therefore adds more flexibility to the approach. The performance and robustness of the approach is demonstrated investigating an industrially relevant, large-scale aircraft test case fusing high-quality experimental and numerical data. Compared to the established Gappy POD approach, the new method shows a significantly improved agreement with the observed wind tunnel data for the investigated test case. In addition, the new approach enables to provide credible bounds for the fused result, which serve as an indicator for the associated uncertainty.},

In the proposed method, the number of measurement points is augmented by sequentially rotating a circular microphone array that is circumferentially mounted in the wall of the compressor duct. This technique employs only one reference microphone to enhance the robustness of the cross-spectral matrix completion for nonsynchronous measurements. The fast iterative shrinkage threshold algorithm is adopted to iteratively complete the cross-spectral matrix of all measurement points for acoustic modal identification. The in-duct acoustic modal coefficients of the broadband noise are then determined using the least-squares method with the sound pressure vector recovered from the completed cross-spectral matrix. The accuracy of the cross-spectral matrix and the identified acoustic modals is verified through numerical simulations. The proposed method is validated by experimental results from an axial flow compressor. The results show that it can effectively suppress the modal aliasing problem and identify the azimuthal modes of compressor broadband noise.},

The wave equation is applied to an isothermal two-dimensional mixing layer computed by direct numerical simulation. In contrast to a direct numerical simulation, providing the acoustic fluctuations directly, the simulations based on Lighthill’s wave equation and the AWE-PO rely on a hybrid workflow to predict the generated sound field. Special attention is put on the interpretation of the right-hand side of both wave equations. Comparing the terms on the right-hand side in Lighthill’s theory and AWE-PO suggests a source amplitude for AWE-PO that is 90\% smaller. This reduction is attributed to the filtering property of the material derivative. Finally, the results of the acoustic far-field pressure are compared. It is shown that the radiated sound field’s directivity, propagation, and convection effects are well captured for both wave equations. The computations using Lighthill’s equation and AWE-PO are found to provide acoustic intensities within 1.8 dB from the reference direct numerical simulation. This error is comparable with the errors reported for Lighthill’s equation in previous studies.},

The effects of the membrane optical properties, the thickness, and the size on the solarelastic flutter instability are investigated. The solar radiation pressure is divided into a part depending on the sail deformation and a part independent of sail deformation to investigate their respective influences. The results show that the former terms result in membrane flutter and the latter term results in membrane static deflection. A comparison is conducted between the wave model and the corpuscular model on the flutter boundaries and membrane responses. The membrane reflectivity is coupled with membrane stiffness by the membrane thickness in the wave model, but it is uncoupled in the corpuscular model. Therefore, the wave model has an advantage over the corpuscular model when evaluating the thickness effect of membrane reflectivity.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven parametric reduced-order models (ROMs) in state-space form are valuable tools for rapid aeroelastic (AE) analysis and aerostructure control synthesis. However, the issue of state inconsistence (significant variations in model parameters over tradespaces) makes ROMs noninterpolatable, and therefore unable to accommodate use over broad flight parameter space. This paper presents a holistic framework that combines a system identification technique with state-consistence enforcement (SCE) and a genetic algorithm (GA) for the automated development of interpolatable AE ROMs across broad flight regimes. The SCE technique introduces a regularization term to the AutoRegressive model with eXogenous inputs (ARX) to specifically penalize model parameter variation between flight conditions. The GA autonomously guides the ROM development process toward optimal SCE-ARX hyperparameter selection that balances between model parameter variations and ROM accuracy. The GA-guided SCE-ARX approach is applied to build a parametric AE-ROM database at selected flight conditions, which, because of its state consistence, can be interpolated to create ROMs at any interstitial conditions, where training data or ROMs are not initially available, hence rapidly establishing the full coverage of the entire parameter space. The ROMs generated by the proposed method are compared with those by ARX, SCE, and GA-guided ARX in prediction accuracy. The individual and combined effects of SCE and GA on model parameter variation and ROM interpolatability are thoroughly investigated. The present method demonstrates the most accurate and robust performance for parametric ROM construction across the broad flight envelope.},

In this study, the principal component analysis (PCA) has been performed on compressible flow simulations around an airfoil to map the high-dimensional CFD data to a lower-dimensional PCA subspace. A machine learning classifier based on the extracted principal components has been developed to detect the simulations that miss the separation bubble behind the airfoil. The evaluative measures indicate that the model is able to detect most of the simulations where the separation region is poorly resolved. Moreover, a single mode responsible for the missing flow separation was uncovered that could be the subject of future studies. The results demonstrate that a machine learning model based on the principal components of the dataset is a promising tool for detecting possible missing flow features in CFD.},

The idea of the hybrid scheme is straightforward as it uses a simple shock-capturing function with parameter to detect regions where pressure oscillations such as shock waves are significant. In these regions, a less diffusive version of the scheme is activated with a new weighting function with parameter . This new weighting function is designed to control the stability and accuracy of the hybrid scheme via the ratio of the square of the speed of sound of two adjacent cells. A linear perturbation analysis of an odd–even decoupling problem is used to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid scheme in damping perturbations. Several numerical examples are given to demonstrate that the new scheme can obtain accurate solutions and that it is simple and efficient and requires comparable computational time with the original scheme.},

  abstract     = {This study provides a validation of a recently developed uncertainty quantification methodology for suction velocities with the example of a novel laminar flow control design referred to as a tailored skin single duct (TSSD) panel. The TSSD panel is located on the leading edge of a vertical fin model of an Airbus A320 that is designed to maintain and extend laminar flow over the fin by means of boundary-layer suction. The suction velocities are highly dependent on the local porosity, which is only partly known in practice; therefore, the associated uncertainties need to be quantified. This is achieved by combining experimental and numerical data. The experimental data are based on the wind-tunnel experiments on a full-scale Airbus A320 vertical fin equipped with the TSSD system performed in the large low-speed facility of the German–Dutch Wind Tunnels. The measurements also feature highly accurate mass flow measurements of the integral mass flow through the TSSD system that serve as a validation reference for the uncertainty analysis. Uncertainties are provided for the predicted and the measured total mass flows to validate the proposed method, and a good agreement is obtained. A sensitivity study reveals the most influential contributions to the variance of the computed suction velocities. Depending on the difference between plenum and outer pressure, either uncertainties in the pressure distribution or uncertainties in the porosity parameters dominate the variance of the suction velocity.},

  abstract     = {Transitional and turbulent boundary layer (BL) flows possess dramatically larger wall-shear stresses and surface heat fluxes than their laminar counterparts. Locally, this can be explained by appealing to the presence of spatiotemporally coherent velocity and temperature regions that enhance the momentum and thermal transport across the BL. However, these coherent structures are seldom present alone, but usually influenced by other physical phenomena, such as the streamwise growth of BLs or freestream pressure gradients. A moment of enthalpy integral equation is introduced to quantify how turbulence and other flow phenomena enhance surface heat flux. Results from a direct numerical simulation of a transitional and turbulent BL are used to demonstrate the proposed analysis method and to form a quantitative assessment of the BL physics. The integral analysis demonstrated in this paper for canonical turbulent flows provides an interpretable analysis tool for unlocking key BL physics, including future extensions to compressible BLs, freestream pressure gradients, and the evaluation of flow control schemes.},

  abstract     = {Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) models, which are known for their efficiency and robustness, are widely used in engineering applications. However, RANS models do not provide satisfactory predictive accuracy in many engineering-relevant flows with separation. Aiming at the difficulties of turbulence modeling for separated flows at high Reynolds number, this paper constructs turbulence models using data assimilation technique and deep neural network (DNN). Due to the uncertainty of traditional turbulence models, the parameters of Spalart–Allmaras (SA) turbulence model are optimized with experimental data to provide high-fidelity flowfields. Then DNN model maps the mean flow variables to eddy viscosity and replaces the SA model to be embedded within a RANS solver by iterative mode. Different from many existing studies, this DNN model does not depend on traditional turbulence models during the simulation process. This approach is applied to turbulent attached and separated flows and can significantly improve the accuracy for new flow conditions and airfoil shapes. Results show that the mean relative error of lift coefficient above the stall decreases by over 57\% for all the airfoils.},

Based on the simplification of linear stability theory (Drela and Giles, AIAA J, 1987), the amplification factor transport (AFT) equation for Tollmien–Schlichting waves using local variables was first proposed in 2013 (Coder and Maughmer, AIAA J, 2014). However, in transonic high-Reynolds-number flows, the AFT model seriously overestimates the value of . To fix this problem, we have conducted many linear stability analyses to rebuild the formulations of AFT model. Compressibility effect, which has a significant impact on the prediction of value, has been considered in the improved version. Coupled with the model for crossflow instabilities (Xu et al., CJA, 2020), the improved AFT model is established for transonic boundary layers. Several classic test cases are successfully employed to validate present AFT model, including a flat plate, an airfoil, an infinite swept wing, a sickled-shape wing, a 6:1 inclined prolate spheroid, the NASA Common Research Model, and ARA Transonic Swept Wing. Our prediction results show that both Tollmien–Schlichting instabilities and stationary crossflow instabilities can be captured and predicted well by the improved model in subsonic and transonic boundary layers.},

It suffers from an unstable nose-up pitch departure resulting from flow separation augmented by the LE crank. A small-scale, modular wind tunnel model was built that allowed for changes in the crank angle by increasing the outboard wing sweep. Eliminating the crank entirely increased the and changed the sign of pitch departure, thus exposing the significance of the LE crank. The model was equipped with sweeping jet actuators that could be individually enabled by valves located at the actuator inlets, allowing one to explore the role of active flow control (AFC) in expanding the model’s longitudinal stability margins and controlling its yaw while being cognizant of the coupling between changes in the model’s planform and their effect on AFC. Test results indicated that selective actuation depending on the model’s attitude modified the flow and dramatically increased the trimmed , while further suggesting that the actuation should dynamically change with incidence to improve AFC efficacy.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the advantageous performance of air-jet vortex generators (AJVGs) in controlling shock-induced flow separation, we aim at understanding the effects of relevant injection parameters on the physical mechanisms involved, as well as on the control effectiveness. We performed implicit large-eddy simulations to examine the influence of injection pressure on a spanwise-inclined jet in supersonic crossflow at Mach 2.5 and with momentum-thickness Reynolds number 7000. Four injection pressures were considered. The jet and jet/crossflow interactions strengthen with injection pressure, which is reflected in an enhanced obliqueness and asymmetry of the flow topology, strengthening the induced major counter-rotating vortex pair (CVP). This strengthening of the major CVP stagnates at a certain threshold, above which the flow blockage and momentum influx caused by the jets become so strong that they counter the positive influence on the CVP. Subsequently, we installed these jets in an AJVG control setup for a 24 deg compression-ramp interaction with separation to analyze the control effectiveness and interplay of the injection pressure and jet spacing. The strongest effects on control effectiveness are not related to the injection pressure itself, but to interactions between the jet-induced shocks and vortical structures. Therefore, there is a strong link between jet spacing and injection pressure regarding the control effectiveness. Based on these observations, we provide recommendations for designing efficient AJVG control setups.},

While this discontinuity affects any 2-D solution because of the incidence angle, it needs a specific treatment under supersonic inflow conditions so that both the started and the unstarted rotor regimes (i.e., with either still supersonic or subsonic flow into the blade passage) can be properly described by the analytical blading model. The new flux splitter includes Levine’s theory for evaluation of the unique incidence at started regime, and generalizes it to the unstarted for evaluation of detached shock loss. A discontinuous Riemann solution through the leading edge determines whether the blade geometry and backpressure admit started operation; if they do not, the splitter automatically switches to the unstarted regime. The started mode, however, can be disabled when its computed mass flow exceeds the unstarted choke limit and does not make the rotor start. Capture of operation type as well as prediction of choke mass flow, shock loss, and impact on rotor performance are stressed through comparison to experimental and 3-D numerical results for the NASA Rotor 67 and Stage 37 test cases.},

The results show that a triple-flame structure is formed in this combustor and the peak heat release is located exactly at the triple-point position. The peak heat release rates in the five selected representative cases studied in this paper are all over . The stability limit is wide, and the lean stability limit is always lower than 0.2. The decreased mixing length and decreased velocity difference between the fuel and oxidant streams delay the mixing process and then bring about a stratified distribution of species. This is crucial for the generation of a triple-flame structure and the corresponding high species concentration in the vicinity of the reaction zone under lean conditions. The Damköhler numbers on the lines across the triple points were calculated with values above 1.0 in each of the cases, indicating that the species’ transport time is longer than the chemical reaction time. Therefore, the transport flux of species determines the final combustion strength. The synergistic coupling of the flowfield and species field gives rise to a large transport flux of the key species in the vicinity of the reaction zone. The results show that the corresponding fuel transport flux is large, with values all over . This is the principal reason for the high combustion intensity in this combustor. The different transport fluxes of the critical species are responsible for the different chemical reaction strengths on the triple point in each of the different cases.},

Results show that compared to the side perforated liner with the restriction of radial size, the impedances over the injector mounting surface provide more acoustic energy dissipation to suppress the azimuthal combustion instabilities. Two patterns of impedance distribution, uniform and radial nonuniform, over the injector mounting surface are then investigated through the parametric variations and associated acoustic energy analysis. A stable combustion system can be realized in combination with homogeny or difference between the spatial impedance distributions and associated optimum perforated parameters, such as perforation ratio, Mach number of the mean bias flow, and aperture radius. It allows mitigating possible design limitations with the appropriate parameter combinations. The present investigation thereby offers an alternative model and methodology for suppression of azimuthal combustion instabilities in gas turbines.},

The study is performed using UArizona’s CFDWARP code solving the Favre-averaged Navier–Stokes equations closed by the revised Wilcox model with dilatational dissipation and rapid compression corrections. The results obtained are representative of hydrogen fuel injected after the second shock of a three-shock scramjet inlet at a flight Mach number of 7.5 and an altitude of 34 km. Injecting fuel in the inlet leads to particularly high values of the cross-stream velocities that reduce the size of the recirculation bubbles. This is attributed to be due to i) large cross-stream shearing created by the bow shock above the ramp injectors, to ii) the large density difference between the fuel and the air leading to baroclinicity, and to iii) the greater acceleration of the light fuel by the pressure gradients. As opposed to previous methods that achieved partial reduction of the separation region, fuel injection can lead to a complete elimination of the recirculation bubbles in scramjet inlets. To eliminate recirculations, only half of the fuel needs to be injected in the inlet with the rest injected in the combustor as usual.},

Using appropriate flow and geometric symmetries, heat maps are generated over the regions of the decelerator, which are critical for its thermal design. The effect of fore-end bluntness in terms of peak heat fluxes and integrated heat loads is investigated. The results indicate a possibility of flying at a small angle of attack to reduce the integrated heat loads while simultaneously generating some lift. Tests up to an angle of attack of 20 deg show that even though the peak heating rises strongly, the overall integrated heat loads on the surface of the decelerator remain manageable.

Comparison with available experimental data shows that RANS is capable of predicting the main features of hypersonic oblique shock-wave/turbulent-boundary-layer interaction, namely, typical size and distribution of the wall properties. A large number of flow cases, especially at high Reynolds number, were computed to examine the scaling of the heat transfer over a wide range of wall temperatures. As expected, the interaction zone of hypersonic CSBLI is reduced as the wall is cooled. A simple power of heat transfer originally introduced by Back and Cuffel (“Changes in Heat Transfer from Turbulent Boundary Layers Interacting with Shock Waves and Expansion Waves,” AIAA Journal, Vol. 8, No. 10, 1970, pp. 1871–1873) for planar shock-induced interactions is here considered to account for hypersonic CSBLIs, which is found to successfully collapse the data to the distributions obtained for supersonic/hypersonic, cold/hot interactions. The value range of the power exponent is within 0.75–0.95.},

  abstract     = {A pitot probe is commonly used for the disturbance quantification of a hypersonic freestream, but the pitot results cannot reflect the actual disturbance amplitudes due to the turbulence/shock-wave interactions as well as the disturbance resonances. In this work, we characterize the disturbance resonance in the postshock zone of a blunt body using both experimental and theoretical approaches. A one-dimensional interference model with four traveling sound waves is proposed to simulate the resonance phenomenon due to the reflection between the detached shock and the wall of the pitot probe. Subsequently, the total pressure fluctuation on the surface and the density fluctuation in the space along the centerline are investigated using a pressure sensor and a noninvasive focused laser differential interferometer. Both the experimental results and theoretical analysis show the resonance mechanism on the surface is dominated by the interference between the initial diverging sound wave and the shock-reflected sound wave. In contrast, the stationary wave formed by the initial diverging sound wave and the body-reflected wave plays a leading role in the space. Finally, an equation is proposed to approximate the destructive resonant frequency in the space.},

  abstract     = {It is crucial to consider the fluid–thermal–structural interaction (FTSI) in designing the scramjet inlet for sustained hypersonic flight. To understand the aerothermal and aeroelastic responses of the planar hypersonic inlets under different flight Mach numbers and aspect ratios, a three-dimensional FTSI framework was developed and validated. After that, the FTSI characteristics under different flight Mach numbers and aspect ratios were investigated. The result reveals that the most obvious horizontal displacement happens at the cowl lip leading edge, whereas the maximum vertical displacement takes place at the compression-ramp leading edge. The FTSI improves the capture area and generates an additional compression angle due to the different thermal expansions between the windward and leeward panels. The thermal expansion in the spanwise direction causes the cowl lip to hump into an arc, and the maximum height happens at the midplane. The effects of FTSI on the inlet flowfield, the mass flow rate, and the total pressure ratio under different flight Mach numbers and aspect ratios were obtained. Overall, the FTSI can improve the contraction ratio, the actual mass flow rate, and the pressure ratio while causing the total pressure ratio to decrease by up to 14.64\%.},

However, ACSR, by taking the vibration responses at target measurement points as the active control objective, is a local vibration control method for the fuselage. In this paper, an active global vibration control (AGVC) method for the fuselage by taking the vibratory loads transmitting to the fuselage through gearbox struts as the active control objective is proposed. By installing piezoelectric stack actuators on a gearbox strut, the active strut is formed and its electromechanical coupling equation of motion is derived. The AGVC model, algorithm, convergence, and system for a dynamically similar frame structure of a helicopter fuselage are presented. The simulation results indicate that AGVC can suppress the global vibration of the fuselage under the excitation of the rotor vibratory loads more effectively with faster convergence speed than ACSR. The vibration at the target measurement points in ACSR can be effectively reduced, but the control effect at other positions is not satisfied, and even the vibration at some positions is larger than that in control off.},

  abstract     = {Integrally bladed disks, also known as blisks, are important components in the operation of gas turbines. To study the dynamics of these structures, several computational techniques approximate blisks as tuned systems, where all blades have the same characteristics. In reality, manufactured blades have small variations from their intended design, thus creating so-called mistuned systems. Previous work has shown that such small variations can cause high response amplifications that can result in blisk structural failure. Therefore, it is essential to identify mistuning to ensure the safe operation of these systems. Several methods utilize cantilever blade frequencies in their procedure to model mistuning and calculate blisk vibration response. A previously developed mistuning identification method uses mass detuning to isolate the cantilever blade frequencies and a set of influence coefficients to quantify the blade-to-blade couplings. However, the mistuning is calculated with respect to an arbitrary mistuning value that later needs to be identified through a trial-and-error procedure that can affect the accuracy of the final mistuning values. This paper focuses on updating the method to eliminate this additive error that cannot precisely be determined. Furthermore, the updated procedure is applied to an as-manufactured blisk using experimental ping test results. An additional analysis is performed on the effect of adding multiple sets of influence coefficients to capture the blade-to-blade couplings more accurately.},

  abstract     = {Since the introduction of variable-stiffness composites, the design philosophy for high-performance lightweight composite structures has broadened greatly. Indeed, variable-stiffness composites have been shown to increase buckling performance and dynamic stability, as well as to modify the dynamic response by tailoring stiffness distributions. Thus, efficient linear analysis tools play a significant role in the early design of variable-stiffness structures, allowing designers to identify many viable solutions when considering preloaded dynamically excited aerospace components. To address this need, a Ritz-based method for eigenfrequency and dynamic instability analysis of hygrothermal and mechanically prestressed variable-stiffness laminated doubly curved payload fairing structures is presented. Flexibility in modeling and design is achieved using Sanders–Koiter-based shell kinematics that allow general orthogonal surfaces to be modeled without further assumptions on the shallowness or on the thinness of the structure. The efficiency of the proposed Ritz method is enabled by using Legendre orthogonal polynomials as displacement trial functions. By comparing the present approach with finite element solutions for variable-curvature, variable-angle tow fairing shell geometries, excellent accuracy is shown, accompanied by an order-of-magnitude reduction in variables by the present method. Original solutions are presented comparing the dynamic behavior of prestressed constant and variable-stiffness composite shell structures, showcasing the viability of the variable-stiffness concept to significantly increase the structural performance of critical doubly curved variable-curvature components such as launch vehicle payload fairings.},

In addition, hat-stiffened panels provide the stability that the airframe skin needs. However, they can be subject to delamination in the postbuckling regime. Progressive damage analysis methods can help predict interlaminar and intralaminar failure events. Many aircraft structures are subject to cyclic loading in the postbuckling regime. Hence, fatigue life prediction becomes essential for design and sustainment purposes. Under the NASA Advanced Composites Project, composite panels stiffened with single- and multiple-hat stringers were subject to a cyclic loading sequence from a prebuckling state to a postbuckling state. This work uses the Abaqus virtual crack closure technique with enhanced capabilities through an empirical method to integrate fatigue effects (different from the ) into the Paris law. This was accomplished via a user-defined subroutine to simulate the fatigue response of these panels. This novel method captured the fatigue life predictions within 5\% of the test results.},

Here, we propose an experience-free and systematic methodology for exploring a parametrized system for microstructures of cellular mechanical metamaterials using a multiobjective genetic algorithm (GA). Globally, by considering the importance of the initial population selection for a population-based heuristic optimization method, we study the impact of the populations initialized by the different sampling methods on the optimal solutions. Locally, we develop our method by using a micro-GA with a new searching strategy, which requires the standard genetic algorithm to be conditionally run for a sufficient number of times with a small population size during the global searching process. We have applied our method to explore optimal solutions for applications mapped on two different parameter spaces of the cellular mechanical metamaterials with periodic and nonperiodic RVEs effectively and accurately.},

Its macroscopic properties are obtained through an exact 3D finite element model based on Computed Tomography (CT) images of the composite material, in which the fiber orientations are determined through the machine learning. Numerical prediction of the structure failure is then conducted based on 3D-Hashin failure criterion and bilinear cohesive model, which is in good agreement with experiments. Both results show that crack initiation occurs in the defect dense area, and the structure failure is mainly caused by fiber fracture. Based on the validated approach, we further discuss the mechanical properties of the structure without defects, and found that 2\% initial defects in the model can lead to a 12\% reduction of the bearing capacity.

Geometric nonlinearities can arise due to the accompanying large rotations and in-plane deflections that manifest in the form of stiffening effects in the nonlinear static response. To account for these nonlinearities, reduced-order modeling techniques in combination with nonlinear finite element formulations have been previously proposed. However, these methods often have a limited range of validity due to linear eigenmode-based formulations with assumptions of small rotations. In this paper, a large deflection analysis framework based on the Koiter–Newton model reduction technique is presented. It is demonstrated that the reduced model in its basic form is ineffective for large deflection analysis. To resolve this, an incremental updating procedure is used for the reduced-order model that incorporates the necessary nonlinear effects. The model updating enables the computation of nonlinear response for a large range of deflections.},

By using a fluid dynamics model based on the axisymmetric Navier–Stokes equations, we numerically demonstrate that this design is able to generate thrust for self-propelled swimming. The sources of the thrust have been identified. Specifically, the physical mechanisms that assist with the swimming performance are 1) the momentum flux through the front and back openings; and 2) the normal stress at the front and back openings, most notably the suction force at the front opening due to negative pressure there. Moreover, a parametric study has been conducted to investigate the effect of geometric and kinematic parameters upon the performance of the system.},

  abstract     = {Aircraft designs involving aerodynamic interactions between rotors and other aerodynamic surfaces are becoming increasingly popular. Studying these interactions is key to developing good models for design and aspects of the system such as control. This paper seeks to understand the effect of obstructing the upstream of a propeller at varying distances, also called the ceiling effect, by examining in depth the canonical case of a theoretically infinite obstruction and its interaction with a propeller or actuator disk. Experimental studies of force and pressure are compared to results from computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and good agreement is shown. The CFD results are then compared against the Morillo flowfield model, and a correction is found to match the results. The data indicate that some propellers experienced a nearly twofold increase in thrust. However, a matching force on the surface develops, and the net force drops to nearly zero. The force interaction between the two nearly disappears once the separation exceeds half a propeller diameter. These results are independent of propeller size and pitch. The implemented theoretical model also has low computational cost, and it could be used to improve low-order models such as panel methods or provide a foundation for future rotor–body interaction modeling.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a stability model that can make a rapid prediction of the rotating stall inception in turbomachinery and provide the spatial distribution of the corresponding instability mode. In addition, this model can take the three-dimensional geometry of blades and complex flow details in the compressor into consideration, and the solution of the development process of small perturbations can be converted to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem. We propose a solution method by converting the nonlinear eigenvalue problem into a generalized one; then, it can be solved by the Arnoldi algorithm. The proposed method can shorten the elapsed time from hundreds of hours to a few minutes, as compared with the methods adopted in previous works, substantially reducing the computational cost. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of eigenvectors can be obtained to investigate the characteristics of the perturbation mode, which can be applied as a foundation to set the inlet/outlet boundary conditions and select the eigenvalue representing the rotating stall inception. In the cases of a transonic isolated rotor and a subsonic one-stage compressor, the results are in accordance with those measured in experiments, verifying the accuracy and effectiveness of the stability model. Therefore, the model can be applied to evaluate the flow stability in the design stage of compressors with low computational cost.},

For , the upstream sound radiation is broadband, whereas for , tones emerge in the near-nozzle spectra, highlighting the establishment of feedback loops. The tone frequencies are consistent with those for aeroacoustic feedback loops between the nozzle and the plate, and exhibit a staging behavior with the Mach number, staying inside or close to the ranges of the upstream-traveling free-stream guided jet waves predicted by a vortex-sheet model. The azimuthal and radial structures of the pressure fields at the tone frequencies agree with those of these waves closing the loops. The selection of the dominant tone and the staging behavior are discussed by evaluating the power gains of the shear-layer instability waves between the nozzle and the plate using linear stability. In most cases, the dominant tones emerge at the possible tone frequencies with the highest gain. For , the gain of the instability waves at the frequency of the guided jet waves most likely to close feedback mechanisms is lower than the gain peak values, possibly contributing to the absence of resonance.},

The model is validated against coolant concentration data experimentally obtained at Mach 7 over a flat plate at a zero pressure gradient. It successfully predicts the mixing at the wall downstream within 17\% of the experimental data. It is shown that this mixing mechanism at the wall in laminar flows is fully described by the process of diffusion. The coolant coverage at a given downstream location is promoted when the streamwise velocity decreases, the blowing ratio increases, or the diffusion coefficient drops. Finally, a mass budget calculation is performed for a transpiration-cooled hypersonic vehicle employing the analytical model. The model predicts a mass requirement of 3.6 times less coolant when helium is used as the coolant gas as opposed to nitrogen for the chosen trajectory. However, helium requires twice the storage volume as compared to nitrogen.},

The approach adopts a tensor-basis neural network for the Reynolds-stress representation, with modified inputs to consider fluid compressibility. The normalization of input features is also investigated to avoid feature collapsing in the presence of shock waves. Moreover, the turbulent heat flux is accordingly estimated with the neural-network-based turbulence model based on the gradient diffusion hypothesis. The ensemble Kalman method is used to train the neural network with the experimental data in velocity and wall pressure due to its derivative-free nature. The proposed framework is tested in two canonical configurations, that is, two-dimensional transonic flows over the RAE2822 airfoils and three-dimensional transonic flows over the ONERA M6 wings. Numerical results demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in learning accurate turbulence models for external transonic flows.},

This paper studies the effect of the mode multigrid on the stability and convergence of iterative algorithms. By further analyzing the mechanism for accelerating the convergence of mode multigrid, a new adaptive mode multigrid (AMMG) is proposed, and an adaptive selection criterion is formulated for the parameters of dynamic modal decomposition, which can accurately identify and filter out the unstable modes in the flowfield, thus efficiently obtaining the accurate steady solution. In the cases of laminar flow past circular cylinder and turbulent flow past airfoil, the AMMG significantly improves the stability of the iterative algorithm; in the case of transonic flow past airfoil, the AMMG solves the problem of shock wave shaking during the iteration, and the convergence is significantly improved. In summary, the AMMG method significantly enhances the stability and convergence of the iterative algorithm, and can be used as an effective convergence-preserving computation strategy.},

In the present study, the closure modeling is based on a linearized algebraic turbulence model. The method is assessed for the flow over a NACA0012 airfoil at a fixed angle of attack, with the Reynolds number as the variable parameter. The results show that, provided an accurate linearized closure model, the method predicts the correct sensitivity of the skin friction coefficient and the mean velocity field at the cost of a linearized RANS, which provides an important proof-of-concept for this approach. The linearized algebraic turbulence model with standard model coefficients produces a reasonably accurate sensitivity, but the results also suggest that accuracy could be gained from recalibrating the model coefficients for this new use of the model.},

FFVHC-ACE enables high-fidelity LES of high-Reynolds-number flows around complex geometries by adopting three key numerical methods: hierarchical Cartesian grids, wall modeling in LES, and the kinetic-energy and entropy preserving (KEEP) scheme. The hierarchical Cartesian grids allow fully automated grid generation for complex geometries in FFVHC-ACE, and high-fidelity LES of high-Reynolds-number flows around complex geometries is realized by the wall modeling and the KEEP scheme on the non-body-fitted hierarchical Cartesian grids. We apply FFVHC-ACE to wall-modeled LES around high-lift aircraft configurations at wind-tunnel-scale Reynolds number and real-flight Reynolds number , demonstrating the capability of FFVHC-ACE for fully automated grid generation and high-fidelity simulations around complex aircraft configurations. The computed flowfield and aerodynamic forces at the wind-tunnel-scale Reynolds number agree well with the experimental data provided in the past AIAA High Lift Prediction Workshop (Rumsey et al., Journal of Aircraft, Vol. 56, No. 2, 2019, pp. 621–644).

By generalizing damping-based flutter constraints, the formulation yields mathematical properties oriented toward gradient-based optimization. The approach is demonstrated by optimizing a typical section with a subcritical bifurcation using a gradient-based algorithm and finite-difference derivatives. The postflutter response constraint suppresses self-sustained oscillations below a given flow speed while minimizing the mass penalty, which avoids a conservative solution. This constraint can help design highly efficient aeroelastic systems with feasible postflutter dynamics.

A comprehensive database of high-speed focusing schlieren sequences provides access to the temporal and spectral behavior of the oscillatory shock motion within a broad parameter space, covering Mach numbers 0.68–0.80 and angles of attack 3.3–6.5 deg. From these data, multiple temporal and spectral properties characterizing the distinctness of the shock oscillation are extracted. Combining these indicators enables us to clearly distinguish fully established buffet from pre-buffet, buffet onset, and buffet offset. This criterion helps to interpret the diverse findings in the relevant literature cases. Particle-image velocimetry measurements provide detailed insight into the turbulence structure and behavior throughout a fully established buffet cycle at a Mach number of 0.72 and an angle of attack of 5 deg. Instantaneous and phase-averaged velocity maps indicate massive flow separation for shock positions close to the upstream limit. Velocity profiles illustrate the large intermittent velocity deficit persisting until the trailing edge and corroborate most pronounced separation when induced by an upstream-traveling shock wave. Representative phases of the buffet cycle visualize and quantify the severe modification of the flow topology modulated by the shock and lay the groundwork to improve the understanding of mechanisms governing shock buffet.},

However, the further development of gradient-based laminar flow wing optimization schemes is hindered by a lack of efficient and accurate derivative computation methods for LST-based eigenvalue problems with a large number of design variables. To address this deficiency and to compute the derivatives in the LST-based solution solver, we apply the adjoint method and analytical reverse algorithm differentiation (RAD), which scale well with the number of inputs. The core of this paper is the computation of the standard eigenvalue and eigenvector derivatives for the LST problem, which involves a complex matrix. We develop an adjoint method to compute these derivatives, and we couple this method with RAD to reduce computational costs. In addition, we incorporate the LST-based partial derivatives into the laminar–turbulent transition prediction framework for the computation of total derivatives. We verify our proposed method with reference to finite difference (FD) results for an infinite swept wing. Both the intermediate derivatives from the transition module and total derivatives agree with the FD reference results to at least three digits, demonstrating the accuracy of our proposed approach. The fully adjoint and the coupled adjoint–RAD methods both have considerable advantages in terms of computational efficiency compared with iterative RAD and FD methods. The LST-based transition method and the proposed method for efficient and accurate derivative computations have prospects for wide application to laminar flow optimization in aerodynamic design.},

The condensed products are divided according to the combustion stage into initial condensed products on the burning surface and final condensed products in the gas stream. The differences in combustion behaviors and size distributions between initial and final condensed products are analyzed in detail. Then, the influence of aluminum content and initial aluminum particle size on the size distribution of the condensed products is studied. It is found that both the initial and final condensed products increase with increasing aluminum content and initial aluminum particle size. A modified Jackson model is presented to estimate the particle size of the propellants’ condensed products.

  abstract     = {Starting from the data measured in several static firings of two laboratory-scale hybrid rocket engines of different sizes burning gaseous oxygen with either a liquefying fuel or a pyrolyzing polymer, a mechanism for the combustion instability observed only with liquefying fuel is suggested. With the latter type of fuels, regression rate is increased for the formation of an unstable liquid layer on the grain surface, for which liquid fuel structures are entrained into the gas stream and burn, upon vaporization and mixing, far from the surface. Based on this circumstance, the hypothesis of a time delay to burn, with the resulting effect of triggering longitudinal acoustic modes of the system, is formulated. A simplified analytical acoustic model of a series of interconnected ducts with different cross sections and gas properties is preliminarily addressed, which allowed demonstrating the acoustic nature of the main pressure oscillation peaks measured in three firing tests along with the influence of the oxygen-feeding line on the system acoustics. Finally, by leveraging an existing acoustic model of the hybrid rocket combustion chamber including the effects of cross-sectional discontinuities and distributed fuel mass addition and combustion, the linear stability of the system is analyzed, whose results are apt to reproduce the experimental findings.},

  abstract     = {Shock tube flows can be used to investigate nonequilibrium thermochemistry and radiative processes found in hypersonic flows. The flow in a shock tube contains many flow nonuniformities, in particular boundary-layer effects. For the purpose of studying the properties of the test slug, the flow behind the shock is usually considered analogous to the stagnation line flow over a blunt body. In reality, radial and longitudinal velocity distributions in the two flows are different, and so a coordinate transformation is needed to match time-of-flight profiles. This work develops a method to approximately transform the postshock distance for normal and blunt body shocks to a shock tube flow using a Mirels analysis. The effects of shock tube diameter and shock speed variation are highlighted along with the importance of postshock temperature and density rises. This is then applied to blunt body simulations of NASA EAST data for air and Titan tests. This showed that minimal difference is encountered for fast reacting flows. However, large differences can be seen in the slower reacting Titan tests, which to date have been misinterpreted when compared to blunt body simulations.},

In this paper, the active subspace (AS) method is exploited to quantitatively reveal the intrinsic connections between the flow and flame stabilization with various fuel injection and cavity geometric parameters. A flame stabilization metric connecting the flame stabilization mode with nonreacting flows is proposed for the AS analysis and multiobjective optimizations. The results show that there exist one-dimensional active subspaces for key performance metrics, for example, the total pressure loss , residence time , and . The fuel injection pressure, cavity length-to-depth ratio, and cavity depth are three leading factors that govern the total pressure loss while the cavity residence time is dominated by the cavity depth. The proposed reasonably maps the flame stabilization mode with nonreacting flows. Using the response lines obtained by the AS, the tradeoff between and is quantitatively formulated with a clear visualization of candidate sets in the input space, demonstrating the advantages of the AS method for the combustor designs involving multiple objectives.},

  abstract     = {High-speed flows are often associated with shock–boundary-layer interaction (SBLI), which causes excessive vehicle surface heating and total pressure loss. Therefore, precise computational prediction of shock interactions becomes essential. Commonly used simulation techniques, including numerical schemes and turbulence models, give erroneous results at shock discontinuities. Local modifications are applied at shocks based on their location and strength. Most shock sensors in the literature predict shock location but do not give shock properties. We propose a shock function to locate shocks and estimate their strength in terms of density ratio by solving a transport equation, along with the governing equations of fluid flow. The sensitivity of the shock function to the transport equation’s parameters and grid resolution are explored. The shock function is used to define a shock sensor that can identify thin and sharp shocks. The shock function and shock sensor are then applied to an oblique shock impinging on a turbulent boundary layer. We use the shock unsteadiness modified model, which uses the estimated shock strength to predict the turbulence levels at shocks accurately. We study the effect of nonadiabatic wall temperature on the SBLI region, and the results are compared with available Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data.},

This type of transition is relevant to several aerospace systems with rotating components, e.g., aeroengine nose cones. Because a variety of options exist for the nose-cone shapes, it is important to know how their shape affects the boundary-layer transition phenomena. This study investigates the effect of varying cone angle on the boundary-layer instability on rotating cones facing axial inflow. It is found that increasing cone angle has a stabilizing effect on the boundary layer over rotating cones in axial inflow. The parameter space of Reynolds number and local rotational speed ratio is experimentally explored to find the spiral vortex growth on rotating cones of half angle , 45°, and 50°. The previously addressed cases of and 30° are also revisited. Increasing half-cone angle is found to have a stabilizing effect on the boundary layer on the rotating cones with ; i.e., the spiral vortex growth is delayed to higher and . This effect diminishes when the half-cone angle increases from to 50°. The spiral vortex angle decreases with increasing rotational speed ratio for all the investigated cones, irrespective of the half-cone angle. However, the instability on the broader cones is found to induce shorter azimuthal wavelengths.},

  abstract     = {Aspects of transition mechanisms on a 14° sharp-nosed ogive cylinder at Mach 6 are elucidated by considering linear and nonlinear disturbance evolution of freestream stochastic and wave packet forcing at different locations downstream of the ogive-cylinder junction. The spectral response of the stochastic forcing displays favorable agreement with experimental observations from Air Force Research Laboratory on which the configuration is based. Intermittent wave packets are generated from small-amplitude continuous freestream pressure forcing. Linear wave packet evolution reveals that Mack modes are the dominant primary instabilities, followed by relatively weaker first-mode waves. The nonlinear wavepacket displays a three-legged wall pressure perturbation signature, which is traced to spanwise curvature effects, and fundamental resonance is the dominant secondary instability mechanism. At higher amplitudes of excitation, weak signatures of subharmonic and oblique resonance phenomena are identified. Downstream placement of the small-amplitude disturbance diminishes amplification of first-mode waves; however, with high-amplitude forcing, the location of actuation does not significantly vary the disturbance evolution signature or the secondary instability mechanisms.},

These datasets have yet to be modeled accurately. A previous paper suggested that this could partly be due to mis-specified inlet conditions. The authors of this paper solved a Bayesian inverse problem to infer the inlet conditions of the LENS-XX test section and found that in one case they lay outside the uncertainty bounds specified in the experimental dataset. However, the inference was performed using approximate surrogate models. In this paper, the experimental datasets are revisited and inversions for the tunnel test-section inlet conditions are performed with a Navier–Stokes simulator. The inversion is deterministic and can provide uncertainty bounds on the inlet conditions under a Gaussian assumption. It was found that deterministic inversion yields inlet conditions that do not agree with what was stated in the experiments. An a posteriori method is also presented to check the validity of the Gaussian assumption for the posterior distribution. This paper contributes to ongoing work on the assessment of datasets from challenging experiments conducted in extreme environments, where the experimental apparatus is pushed to the margins of its design and performance envelopes.},

This sensor measured velocities and temperatures across three distinct conditions and six shots in the Hypervelocity Expansion Tube at the California Institute of Technology. Velocity and temperature were sampled at intervals, and temperature measurements were validated with a supplementary laser absorption-based sensor targeting carbon dioxide transitions near . Measured velocities across the three conditions ranged from 3.3 to 4.4 km/s, and measured temperatures ranged from 900 to 1600 K. The combined measurements were used to infer the freestream specific total enthalpy, which ranged from 7 to 10 MJ/kg.

This phase is characterized by hypersonic flows encompassing multiscale phenomena that require advanced modeling capabilities. However, because high-fidelity simulations are often computationally prohibitive, simplified models are needed in multidisciplinary analyses requiring fast predictions. This work proposes data-driven surrogate models to predict the flow and mixture properties along the stagnation streamline of hypersonic flows past spherical objects. Surrogate models are designed to predict the velocity, pressure, temperature, density, and air composition as functions of the object’s radius, velocity, reentry altitude, and surface temperature. These models are trained with data produced by numerical simulation of the quasi-one-dimensional Navier–Stokes formulation and a selected Earth atmospheric model. Physics-constrained parametric functions are constructed for each flow variable of interest, and artificial neural networks are used to map the model parameters to the model’s inputs. Surrogate models were also developed to predict surface quantities of interest for the case of nonreacting or ablative carbon-based surfaces, providing alternatives to semiempirical correlations. A validation study is presented for all the developed models, and their predictive capabilities are showcased along selected reentry trajectories of space debris from low Earth orbits.},

The formulation of the optimal trajectory control problem is presented in the context of an indirect method where a functional objective associated with the terminal vehicle speed is to be minimized. Uncertain input parameters in the optimal trajectory control model, including aerodynamic parameters and initial and terminal conditions, are modeled as aleatory random variables, while the statistical parameters of these aleatory distributions are themselves random variables. The parametric and model uncertainties are simultaneously propagated through an extended polynomial chaos expansion (EPCE) formalism. Several metrics are described to evaluate response statistics and presented as insightful tools for robust decision making. Specifically, the response probability density function (PDF) reflecting influence of both epistemic and aleatory uncertainties is obtained. By sampling over the random variables representing model error, an ensemble of response PDFs is generated and the associated failure probability is estimated as a random variable with its own polynomial chaos expansion. Besides, the sensitivity index functions of response PDF with respect to the statistical parameters are evaluated. Coupling parametric and model uncertainties within the EPCE framework leads to a robust and efficient paradigm for multilevel uncertainty propagation and PDF characterization in general optimal control problems.},

Sub-microradian to microradian pointing accuracies are required against dynamic targets. In addition, “absolute” pointing and accurate inertial angular rate measurement are required to support mission requirements. This paper addresses these unique directed-energy weapon (DEW) precision-pointing requirements and their associated implementation alternatives in the context of strapdown and stable platform inertial reference technologies. The contributions of this paper consider the broader issues of DEW requirement drivers, integration of the stabilization system with the rest of the optical system, and design tradeoffs between stable platform and strapdown stabilization mechanizations. Both types of mechanisms are mounted to the gimbal of an imaging system using gryo sensors (gyros) and accelerometers to maintain a desired orientation in inertial space independent of the craft motion. Although both can include an optical reference that propagates through the optical path for optical alignment and jitter control, only in the stable platform is the optical reference stabilized. When combined on the same platform with a stabilized inertial measurement system and closed-loop stabilization with the optical reference, the mechanism becomes a stabilized inertial reference unit, which provides a stabilized optical reference to the electro-optical/laser pointing and jitter control systems.},

In the present study, the design space referred to as feasible regions is derived explicitly based on novel formulations for the lamination parameters of DD laminates. This enables the boundaries of the design space to be obtained analytically, providing mathematical support for DD families. The obtained result shows that their design space is larger than that of conventional quadaxial laminates in terms of industrial practices. A homogenization criterion is implemented into the design space, based on which a tailored DD laminate is proposed, expanding design possibilities and enabling homogenization to be achieved using only 16 plies/4 repeats. The work proposed offers significant benefits through practical solutions to making design, manufacturing, and testing simpler and more competitive.},

According to the geometric features of the studied structure, an irregular plate with/without the dropoff ply is decomposed into a variety of intact triangular and quadrilateral laminated elements. These elements are then mapped to two-dimensional regular square plates for deriving the unified formulations of the element energy integral. Simultaneously, the boundary restrictions at the external edge of the plate and fully rigid connections between the substructures are emulated through in-plane translational springs. The in-plane variables of intact plate elements are characterized by Chebyshev element expansions. Thus, the in-plane modal and harmonic response solutions are extracted by performing the general Rayleigh–Ritz procedures. Some in-plane vibration tests and finite element simulations concerning cracked plates with built-in holes are further executed. The applicability and accuracy of the proposed dynamic model are validated by comparison with the experimental data and those computed by finite element models (FEM). Also, some parametric cases are presented to investigate the influence of structural parameters, laminated configurations, and the dropoff ply effect on the in-plane dynamic characteristics of complex-shaped plates, which may provide useful benchmarks for structural design and damage detection of engineering structures.},

  abstract     = {Bistable unsymmetrical laminates have received significant attention in morphing applications due to their ability to attain multiple shapes when subjected to thermal loads. Morphing structures in general are subjected to dynamic operating conditions. Also, the highly nonlinear snap-through transition between stable configurations possesses rich dynamic characteristics. Therefore, understanding the dynamic characteristics of bistable laminates is essential for designing morphing structures constituting bistable elements. Thus, the present study aims to explore the dynamics of bistable unsymmetrical laminates by evaluating their natural vibration characteristics associated with small-amplitude dynamic excitation around the static equilibrium configurations. A refined semi-analytical framework is proposed to analyze the natural vibration characteristics of the bistable laminate, where the potential energy is expressed only in terms of the unknown coefficients of the assumed out-of-plane displacement function. The in-plane components are separately evaluated using the in-plane equilibrium equations and compatibility conditions. In the dynamic analysis, perturbations are imposed on the static equilibrium configurations to capture the modal characteristics. A full geometrically nonlinear finite element (FE) model of the bistable laminate has been created in a commercially available FE package to compare semi-analytical solutions. To validate the proposed frameworks, an experimental strategy to capture the natural frequencies of a bistable laminate is presented in this paper. Unsymmetric laminates mounted at its center have been used for the experimental testing, where the vibrations are measured using miniature integrated electronics piezoelectric accelerometer sensors attached at the corners. The semi-analytical and FE results are validated against the experimental observations for the selected unsymmetrical cross-ply laminates. The proposed frameworks are further extended to a family of unsymmetrical variable-stiffness (VS) laminates generated using curvilinear fiber alignments. The selected VS family can generate bistable shapes without any twisting curvature similar to that of an unsymmetrical cross-ply laminate, where the designer can expand the design space with a plethora of multiple configurations. A parametric study is performed by tailoring the VS parameters to investigate the influence of curvilinear fiber alignments on the natural vibration characteristics of bistable VS laminates.},

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are used to predict the unsteady loading on the rotor blades and to visualize the flow through the rotors. Semi-analytical models are also presented for predicting the portion of this unsteady loading due to the interaction of each blade with the bound potential field of the adjacent rotor. A comparison of the unsteady loading predicted using the CFD simulations and the semi-analytical models shows that, for the cases considered, the semi-analytical models accurately predict the unsteady loading on the top rotor and that the bound potential field interaction source is a significant contributor to the total unsteady loading on the bottom rotor. A frequency-domain acoustic analogy method is also presented, which is used to calculate the interaction tones produced by the unsteady loading on the rotor blades at various observer locations. Predictions of the sound pressure levels of the prominent interaction tones at different observer locations are presented and compared with experimental measurements showing generally good agreement. The effect of rotor spacing on the amplitude of the interaction tones is also explored, and it is shown that the methods predict a decrease in sound pressure level produced by increasing the rotor spacing and that these predictions are in reasonable agreement with experimental measurements.},

The evaluation was performed in a fully anechoic chamber, where thrust and torque were measured concurrently with the acoustic signature using an array of 15 microphones. Acoustic measurements were made for both baseline and actuated cases at a fixed collective pitch angle under conditions of constant thrust. Actuation produced broadband and tonal noise reductions of up to 8 and 3 dB, respectively, while simultaneously increasing the rotor figure of merit by 25\%. Broadband noise reductions were due to control of the otherwise separated boundary layer, resulting in smaller and weaker turbulent eddies in the wake and the tip-vortex and, therefore, smaller turbulent surface pressure fluctuations. Noise reduction directivity associated with the blade passing frequency of up to 3 dB was consistent with rotational noise theory. At most of the observer angles, both the plasma pulsation and ionization frequencies were not visible in the spectra above the motor self-noise signature. Peaks in the second harmonic were observed at specific observer angles and were assumed to be due to the geometric mounting of the actuator and amplification of the pulsations in the laminar separation bubble.},

In this paper a semi-analytical Green’s function for the transmission of sound through Kevlar walls and shear layers was developed in order to provide accurate acoustic measurements at high flow speeds. The semi-analytical Green’s function was evaluated experimentally with a monopole sound source. It was possible to find the correct source location when the Green’s function was used to formulate the steering vectors for the beamforming technique. The corrected steering vectors provided a much better source level estimation than if a free-field Green’s function was used to formulated the steering vectors, but there was a systematic overcorrection at low frequencies and an undercorrection at high frequencies. The analytical transmission loss was very sensitive to the convection velocity of the vorticity shed at the membrane apertures, which in turn depended on the aerodynamic loading of the Kevlar walls. It is likely that further fine-tuning of the formula of the convection velocity will reduce the systematic error. The experimental setup to validate the Green’s function could be improved if aerodynamic loading was applied to the walls.},

  abstract     = {Acoustic liners are an effective way to dampen aircraft noise. Conventional single-degree-of-freedom liners consist of a perforated facesheet backed with a honeycomb structure and a rigid end plate. Their damping excels near their resonance frequency, which is antiproportional to the cavity depth (-resonator) or the cavity volume (Helmholtz resonator). However, this is a challenge for low-frequency noise with long wavelengths due to the limited installation space. We therefore propose a resonator in which the back cavity is divided into two cavities by a flexible plate. The aim is to combine the damping mechanisms of the Helmholtz resonator with the material damping of the flexible plate. With carefully chosen parameters, this flexible plate resonates well below the Helmholtz frequency. We derived an analytic model based on waveguide theory to predict the impedance of the resonator concept. The Helmholtz equation was solved to (numerically) determine the scattering coefficients of a channel section in which one wall is lined with the predicted resonator impedance. The predicted dissipation agreed well with experimental data from measurements at the aeroacoustic wind tunnel DUCT-R.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we conduct a numerical investigation of aerodynamics and aeroacoustics of propeller blades with vibrations, which could occur in practical unmanned aerial vehicles as the blades are often made of lightweight materials. The simulations resolve the sound generation from the unsteady turbulent flows using an acoustic-wave preserved artificial compressibility method. Then, the sound projection to the far-field observers is made using an integral solution of the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings equation. The study shows that periodic blade vibrations with small amplitudes can lead to aerodynamic thrust fluctuations. The blade vibration also affects the generation of tip vortices and the near-blade flow structures due to the periodic change of the effective angle of attack. Consequently, significant tonal noise at the harmonics of rotational frequency is produced, and the noise can propagate to both upstream and downstream directions of the rotor disc plane. A noise source analysis is performed to identify the contribution of different noise components. Results show that the extra tonal noise is mainly caused by the Doppler effect due to the blade axial motion and the influence of the thrust fluctuations. Moreover, the study also suggests that the high-frequency broadband noise seems to be insensitive to the blade vibration.},

  abstract     = {Lightweight high-aspect-ratio wings make aircraft more energy efficient thanks to their lower induced drag. Because such wings exhibit large deflections, design optimization based on linear flutter analysis of the wing undeformed shape is inadequate. To address this issue, we develop a framework for integrating a geometrically nonlinear flutter constraint, which considers in-flight deflections, into a high-fidelity gradient-based structural optimization. The wing mass and stress constraints are evaluated on a linear built-up (detailed) finite element model to capture realistic structural features. The geometrically nonlinear flutter constraint is based on a condensed low-order beam representation of the built-up finite element model, which captures the impact of in-flight deflections with tractable computational effort for optimization. The flutter constraint is differentiated with respect to the detailed structural model sizing variables using the adjoint method to enable large-scale optimizations. The framework is demonstrated by minimizing the mass of a wingbox model subject to the geometrically nonlinear flutter constraint along with stress and adjacency constraints. The geometrically nonlinear flutter constraint adds a penalty of up to 60\% of the baseline mass due to the impact of in-flight deflections on the flutter onset speed and its mechanism. In contrast, a linear flutter constraint evaluated on the undeformed wing adds a mass penalty of only 10\%. This methodology can help design energy-efficient aircraft with high-aspect-ratio wings, which require geometrically nonlinear flutter analyses early in the design cycle.},

To gain insight into the mechanism of LSF, we conduct wind tunnel tests for to investigate the LSF response of a freely rotating NACA0015 airfoil with various structural natural frequencies and positions of the elastic axis. The experimental results show that the dominant mode of flow around the NACA0015 airfoil abruptly changes at , resulting in a change in the trend of LSF response. Then, an aeroelastic model is constructed to explain how the instability of LSF arises. This model can accurately predict the LSF frequency of airfoils with various structural natural frequencies. Moreover, based on the aeroelastic model, we perform linear stability analysis on the aeroelastic system and propose the instability criterion for LSF as . This instability criterion is identical to that for rotational galloping of square cylinder, indicating that LSF and rotational galloping of square cylinder are essentially the same aeroelastic phenomenon that appears in different aerodynamic profiles. This finding identifies the underlying cause for the remarkable similarities between the two phenomena.},

  abstract     = {An experimental study was conducted to examine the dynamic ice accretion process upon the impingement of microsized, airborne ice particles/crystals onto a heated test surface pertinent to aeroengine icing phenomena. The experimental study was conducted in a specially designed ice crystal icing test facility to generate and inject microsized ice particles into a frozen-cold airflow. The microsized ice particles were forced to impinge onto a heated test plate with controllable surface temperatures. Upon impingement of the ice particles onto the heated test surface, the dynamic ice accretion process was found to take place over the heated surface in three distinct stages: 1) an ice-melting stage at the beginning, followed by 2) an ice/water mixture formation stage, and then 3) a water refreezing stage, causing the formation of a solid ice layer accreted on the heated test surface eventually. After impinging onto the test plate, while small ice particles with spheric shapes were found to be more ready to bounce off from the test surface, large, nonspheric-shaped ice particles experienced a catastrophic fragmentation process and break up into smaller pieces with noticeable impingement residues remaining on the test surface. The formation of a liquid water film layer on the test surface due to the melting of the impinged ice particles was found to be very beneficial to make more impinged ice particles stay sticking on the test surface, resulting in a rapid growth of the water/ice layer accreted on the heated test surface. A comprehensive theoretical analysis was also performed to examine the unsteady heat transfer characteristics during the dynamic ice accretion process. The theoretic predictions of the collection efficiency of the impinged ice particles on the heated test surface and the temperature variations of the water layer at the initial ice-melting stage were found to agree well with the experimental measurement results.},

  abstract     = {The new generation of air vehicle is confronted with a more intricate environment and challenging missions, which puts forward higher requirements for the flight control system. In this study, the aerodynamic identification and control law design based on machine learning for a missile configuration is investigated through numerical simulations. The missile pitch and elevator deflection are realized via the combination of a rigid dynamic grid method and an overlapping grid technology, while the computational fluid dynamics/rigid body dynamics (CFD/RBD) strong coupling method is implemented to simulate the unsteady flows associated with the motion of the missile. Firstly, the aerodynamic data of the missile are gathered through forced pitching motion involving elevator deflection, and an aerodynamic model is constructed using a deep neural network to identify the aerodynamic moment with only a small number of unsteady aerodynamic data. Then, the accuracy and fidelity of the model are checked with the open-loop control law. Afterward, a missile pitch control law is generated through deep reinforcement learning based on the aerodynamic model, which enables the realization of a robust and exact angle-of-attack control process. Finally, the control law is transferred to a numerical environment and numerical virtual flight based on CFD is conducted, which demonstrates that stable control can be maintained even in continuous maneuvering. This study verifies the possibility of applying a deep neural network to air vehicle aerodynamic identification and deep reinforcement learning to a complicated flight control law design with excellent generalization ability. Machine learning is expected to play a significant role in the design and research for the novel generation of air vehicle.},

  abstract     = {An inherent aerodynamic limitation of high-advance-ratio high-speed helicopters is reverse flow on the retreating blades, which can be a source of several unsteady effects, like vortex formation, that reduce rotor performance. The current study is the first detailed comparison of a rotor with a conventional, sharp trailing-edge NACA 0012 airfoil section with one equipped with a blunt-edge elliptical airfoil section. The aim was to detect and quantify vortex formation in reverse flow using planar particle image velocimetry on a subscale, low-Reynolds-number rotor rig in a water tank. The investigated blade azimuth angles ranged from 240 to 300 deg for advance ratios between 0.40 and 1.00 at pitch angles from 13 to 25 deg. Four main vortex structures were detected. At the aerodynamic leading edge, a strong interference of the tip vortex with the reverse-flow dynamic stall vortex was identified when blade flapping was restricted. Dynamic stall vortices advect closer to the blade surface for the blunt elliptical airfoil, thus reducing the wake area in reverse flow. Blade pitch kinematics govern the reverse-flow entrance-vortex strength and coherency. A coherent vortex street or wake sheet forms at the aerodynamic trailing edge of either airfoil. Overall, the vortex structures that form on the ellipse are more coherent than those on the NACA 0012. The current study highlights the significance of airfoil geometry, specifically the trailing-edge curvature, of an airfoil on the resulting vortex structures in reverse flow, strongly affecting the rotor performance at high advance ratios.},

Phase-locked particle image velocimetry measurements are performed at the rotor phase angles between 0 and 72° with 6° increments. The meandering characteristics are presented along the first and the second principal axes of the meandering motion, which are found using the principal component analysis method. For all blades, the results show that the vortex position scattering along the principal axes can be defined with a Gaussian distribution. The scatterings about the second principal axes have a better agreement with the Gaussian distribution, with a fit up to the 95th percentile of the data, than the first axes for all configurations. Streamwise variations of the standard deviation of the meandering motion along the principal axes and the meandering angle, which is the angle between the slipstream and the first principal axis, are analyzed, and a simple empirical meandering model as a function of wake age is proposed. The meandering angle decreases with the vortex age, so the first principal axis becomes more aligned with the slipstream direction from close to being perpendicular at the early wake ages.},

  abstract     = {The control mechanism of a nanosecond dielectric barrier discharge (NS-DBD) actuator for suppressing laminar separation on airfoils was investigated using two-dimensional scale-adaptive simulations. To model the control effect of the NS-DBD actuator, a surface heating approach based on the analytical solution for transient one-dimensional heat conduction has been used. The focus of the investigation lies in the study of vortex formation and evolution induced by the actuator. A NACA 0015 profile was simulated at 14° with 250,000 chord-based Reynolds number. Regarding energy deposition, a low-energy case and a high-energy case were simulated. Several actuation parameters were varied, including the electrode position and surface temperature. In addition, the influence of constant and temperature-dependent modeling of the kinematic viscosity was investigated. The results for the time-averaged pressure coefficients show excellent agreement with measurement results. High grid resolution in the boundary layer allowed a detailed investigation of the vortex formation process. The main finding is that vortices are generated by baroclinic torque and vortex dilatation and not by a Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. Initially, tiny vortices form at the beginning of the separation region. Subsequently, these vortices are carried downstream and grow in size, thus preventing full separation due to momentum transfer from the external flow.},

The vortex interaction will depend on the wing planform, leading-edge sweeps, leading-edge shapes, angle of attack, angle of sideslip, and the Reynolds number. In this study, experiments were performed on a range of planform configurations to determine the influence of multisweep wing configurations on the vortex interactions and breakdown thereof. Force/moment measurements were conducted to understand globally the effect of the planform configuration, whereas particle tracking surface oil flow and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry were employed to detect interactions locally in the flowfield. Results were validated against corresponding numerical simulations and past experiments. Comprehensive results indicated a strong correlation between the chord ratios of the initial sweep on the suppression of vortex breakdown. Specifically, two cases with varying chord ratios were identified that exhibited unique vortex breakdown progression (gradual and rapid). Flowfield measurements elucidated key flow features responsible for the differing breakdown progression.},

  abstract     = {Pneumatic probes such as five-hole probes (5HP) can conveniently measure three-dimensional flow angles, plus total and static pressure. In most applications, transducers are connected using pneumatic tubes, allowing the probe head to be highly miniaturized and robust. However, such “steady” probes are often used in unsteady flows, where they measure a pneumatically averaged flowfield that can differ from the time mean. To better understand these pneumatic averaging effects, an analytical framework is constructed using a quasi-steady model. Total and static pressure coefficients have a symmetric response to both positive and negative incidence. When incidence fluctuates, there is therefore a bias in the pneumatic average. These errors are evident in a shedding wake experiment, where a 5HP overestimates total pressure loss by up to 44\% compared to a Kiel probe. These effects can be predicted by coupling an unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes calculation with the quasi-steady model. By predicting pneumatic averaging errors, the quasi-steady model can be used to obtain like-for-like validation of calculations against experimental data. Measurement data can also be corrected, provided that flow angle fluctuations can be measured or estimated. This approach can be readily used to postcorrect the large body of historical data likely to have been corrupted by pneumatic-averaging errors.},

The internal conical flow C (ICFC) flowfield shows superiority over other parent flowfields in terms of performance and length. A drawback to the ICFC flowfield is the existence of the expansion zone, which creates a second reflected shock and decreases the flow uniformity. Hence, this paper proposes a new basic flowfield called the internal conical flow M (ICFM) to overcome the shortcoming of the ICFC flowfield. For the proposed basic flowfield, a new methodology has been devised for connecting the M-flow and truncated Busemann flowfields. This methodology merges the singular line of the M-flow with the truncated ray of Busemann flowfield in order to reduce the flow inclination angle difference effectively. The concept of the basic flowfield is reviewed, and the new ICFM basic flowfield is calculated using the Taylor–Maccoll equations. Complete details of the new merging procedure and calculation of the ICFM flowfield are presented. The characteristics of the new basic flowfield with design conditions of Mach 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0 are examined at different outflow conditions. A comparison with the ICFC flowfield indicates that the new ICFM basic flowfield demonstrates better inviscid performance and a shorter length. Besides, the expansion region is significantly reduced, and the second reflected shock wave is eradicated.},

Dominant flow frequencies, identified from the lift spectra obtained from a load cell mounted to the foils, highlight the presence of bluff-body shedding [ of , where is the frequency, the airfoil chord, and the freestream velocity] for all cases and prominent low frequencies [ of ] for cases in transient stall (TS). A data-driven modeling framework via the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) reveals that the low frequencies are associated to flow separation and reattachment driven by underlying expansion and contraction normal to the suction surface. Further, the ability to predict the low-order features from (pseudo) pressure probes at the leading, midchord, and trailing edges for both TS and deep stall (DS) cases is quantified using linear stochastic estimation (LSE). The framework pinpoints the centroid of the region of reverse flow with error on the order of 5 and 20\% for DS and TS regimes, respectively. Notably, it is found that LSE coefficients governing the low-order POD correlations do not strongly depend on the airfoil geometry. This is demonstrated by the comparative performance of training the LSE using the probes of the NACA 0012 cases to predict the NACA 65-410 velocity fields and vice versa. This work demonstrates the insight afforded by the POD on the low-order features of turbulent stalled airfoils as well as the similarity of such features across geometries toward predicting flow features for potentially any airfoil geometry without the need to retrain an LSE library.},

The database contains time-resolved data for six distinct datasets: a large eddy simulation of a turbulent jet, direct numerical simulations of a zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer, particle-image-velocimetry measurements for the same boundary layer at several Reynolds numbers, direct numerical simulations of laminar stationary and pitching flat-plate airfoils, particle-image-velocimetry and force measurements of an airfoil encountering a gust, and a large eddy simulation of the separated, turbulent flow over an airfoil. These six cases span several key flow categories: laminar and turbulent, statistically stationary and transient, tonal and broadband spectral content, canonical and application-oriented, wall-bounded and free-shear flow, and simulation and experimental measurements. For each dataset, we describe the flow setup and computational/experimental methods, catalog the data available in the database, and provide examples of how these data can be used for reduced-complexity modeling.

  abstract     = {Off-design constraints are essential in practical aerodynamic shape optimization. Physics-based data-driven modeling has shown to be a feasible way to formulate generalizable off-design constraints. However, two issues hinder the adoption of this approach: inadequate physical mechanism studies and the requirement of massive training data. To address these issues, we propose a feature-oriented data-driven model to learn fundamental physical mechanisms from high-dimensional data. This is achieved by finding low-dimensional latent space relevant to the investigated off-design performance. Then, we customize the constraint model based on the learned physical mechanisms, improving generalizability without relying on prior knowledge. We also propose a Bayesian-optimization-based sampling method to adjust the training data distribution, prioritizing samples with good aerodynamic performance. This uneven sampling strategy improves data efficiency by ensuring accuracy when approaching optimal aerodynamic shapes. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is shown in a low-Reynolds-number airfoil design optimization case and a transonic airfoil design optimization case. We obtain generalizable data-driven off-design aerodynamic models with no prior physical studies, and we reduce the training data volume by 95\% compared with a conventional data-driven approach. This work lays the technical foundation for sample-efficient and generalizable data-driven modeling of off-design aerodynamic constraints.},

  abstract     = {The low-boom inverse design method is of great interest for the preliminary design of supersonic transport (SST), owing to its good capability of reducing sonic boom at low computational cost. However, the main challenge is how to prescribe an attainable target. This paper proposes an inverse design method using a new target-generation strategy to address this challenge. Unlike existing methods such as the Jones–Seebass–George–Darden method and the mixed-fidelity inverse design method [the Li–Shields–Geiselhart (LSG) method], the proposed method directly parameterizes the near-field overpressure distribution of a reference configuration and minimizes the ground perceived level in decibels (PLdB) predicted by solving the augmented Burgers equation to obtain an optimal target distribution, subject to cruise lift and volume constraints. The proposed method is demonstrated by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Wing Body case, which shows that it mitigates sonic boom under lift constraint and achieves a reduction of 2.07 PLdB more than the LSG method. The proposed method is applied to the low-boom design of a large SST configuration called NPU-T7104, which is close in size to the Tupolev Tu-144; results show that aerodynamic performance is maintained while shock wave coalescence is effectively prevented, and ground-boom intensity is dramatically reduced.},

  abstract     = {Flow separations occur in the tip region when the fan is operating at the approach condition. To reduce computational cost without degrading accuracy, the hierarchical modeling approach has been developed to predict such fan flow. This allows both flow and geometry to be treated with various fidelity levels in different zones. To be specific, this is achieved by zonalizing large-eddy simulation (LES) in the fan tip region and modeling downstream stators with low-order blade body forces. This approach provides an accurate and economical prediction of separated fan flows in the stage environment. The predicted fan wake profiles show a reasonably good agreement with the hot-wire measurements considering passage-to-passage variations. Finally, the simulation data are used to assess the isotropic turbulence hypothesis that is made on fan wake in low-order acoustics models.},

We conduct the experiments on self-pulsating spray by forcing the gas jet over a range of forcing frequencies and amplitudes. Various image processing techniques, including proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), have been employed to characterize the spray response. Our spatial mapping of dominant frequencies from time-resolved spray width reveals that although both natural and forcing frequencies prevail in the primary breakup region, a modulation frequency (corresponding to the double of the beat frequency) outcompetes the others. The spatial influence of the forcing is also evaluated by measuring liquid mass fluctuations and drop size statistics at various downstream locations. The experiments were extended to investigate the role of various geometrical parameters, such as swirl number, recess, and length of the gas line on the spray response. The influence of the forcing was observed to prevail even in the liquid mass shedding zone with the appearance of all dominant frequencies. This may have important consequences on the thermoacoustic stability of the combustor. In any case, far downstream of the nozzle, the influence of acoustic forcing is not significant to alter the droplet statistics.},

  abstract     = {A multichannel gliding arc (MCGA) plasma is used to control the jet-wake stabilized combustion in a Mach 2.92 cavity-based and ethylene-fueled scramjet combustor. Optical diagnostic methods (including high-speed photography, schlieren, and planar laser-induced fluorescence with acetone tracer) combined with plasma kinetic simulations and Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulations were employed to investigate the combustion behaviors. The results show that the flame is mainly located near the cavity leading edge and operated at the jet-wake stabilized mode. When the MCGA plasma is added at the upstream wall of the cavity leading edge, the vigorous region of the flame spreads upstream 6.5 times longer than the original one without the plasma. Once the plasma is turned off, the flame returns back to the cavity leading edge. The species (Nitrogen in the excited state) and hydrogen atoms produced by the plasma are favorable for igniting the flame near the plasma, and the average penetration depth of the fuel above the plasma is increased by about 10\%. Intense combustion near the plasma occurs with higher pressure, establishing the recirculation zone with the boundary-layer separation. The combined effects of the reactive species produced, the elevated temperature, and the modified flowfield induced by the plasma contribute to the MCGA-controlled behaviors of jet-wake stabilized combustion.},

  abstract     = {In a rocket-based combined cycle combustor operating at scramjet mode, the size of the cavity recirculation flow might be reduced when the cavity is subjected to an expansion fan, which is detrimental to ignition. To address this challenge, a method based on a nitrogen jet array is proposed and evaluated in a combustor with a Mach 2.92 inflow. Nitrogen is supplied through injectors in the cavity. In the case without nitrogen injection, the cavity recirculation flow is so small that the spark plug cannot ignite the combustor. In stark contrast, the interaction between the supersonic inflow and the nitrogen jets on the cavity ramp significantly elevates the pressure in the cavity, and it enlarges the cavity recirculation flow. During the ignition process, the enlarged cavity recirculation flow is essential to holding the weak self-sustained flame. The heat, hot products, and radicals generated by the weak self-sustained flame elevate the pressure in the cavity and further enlarge the cavity recirculation flow, which paves the way for a successful ignition. Once a successful ignition is achieved, turning off the nitrogen jet array does not lead to flame extinction. Compared to the mass flow rate of the inflow, the nitrogen consumption for ignition enhancement is minor.},

  abstract     = {With the increasingly stringent emission, next-generation propulsion systems with chemical reaction combustion involved need to operate with carbon-free fuels, such as ammonia or hydrogen. During the past few decades, intensive research has been conducted on ammonia combustion, which is growingly regarded as a potential alternative fuel to be applied in gas turbines for power generation and aviation propulsion systems to reduce the footprint and increase carbon-free fuel flexibility. Two major technical challenges with applying such fuel in practical engines are poor ignition and flame propagation behaviors. The present work provides a technical review by presenting state-of-the-art advances in ammonia combustion science and technology by clarifying the fundamental combustion properties and the corresponding enhancement strategies. Experimental techniques applied to measuring the ignition delay time are first introduced and overviewed, along with passive and active means to accelerate them. Then, the laminar burning velocities of ammonia-based dual-fuel combustion at varying operating conditions and their temperature and pressure dependences are described. This is followed by the spin-off applications of ammonia-fueled detonation engines. Finally, we show the prospects and challenges of ammonia combustion and suggest critical topics in aerospace and power generation applications that could benefit from further investigations.},

The original three-dimensional equations are rearranged into a set of coupled one-dimensional equations by projecting the acoustic field over transverse basis functions. To maintain the computational efficiency of the original multimodal method (applicable without flow), only the leading-order effects of the mean flow are modeled using a multiple-scales approach. A matching procedure is also given to deal with liner discontinuities in such a duct. Two different transverse bases are used: one is based on Fourier–Bessel functions to evaluate the effect of modal scattering and the other is based on Fourier–Chebyshev polynomials to improve the method efficiency. The formulation is evaluated against analytical models based on the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin technique and against finite-element solutions. It is shown to give consistent results for minor computational cost for modes propagating in ducts with or without acoustic liners. This method can be easily adapted to take into account more complex flows and geometries.},

It leverages recent advances from the field of nonlinear homogenization of fiber composites to model the response of the matrix under the three-dimensional loading observed during buckling. The model then calculates the strain energy of the system as a function of several parameters, such as the position of the neutral axis or the microbuckling wavelength, whose values are obtained through energy minimization. The moment–curvature relationship predicted by the model agrees with experimental results, particularly in the postbuckling regime. The predictions also capture the buckling wavelength, as well as the fact that microbuckling extends into the tension side for thin laminates, an experimental observation that contradicts kinematic assumptions in previous modeling efforts. A parametric study considering possible variations in the composite laminate shows strong trends for parameters, such as thickness and volume fraction.},

A powerful and peculiar aspect of this approach consists in the possibility of handling any complex geometry with reduced modeling effort and few degrees of freedom to be handled. The so-obtained formulation is of particular interest for the early design studies of plate- and shell-like structures, especially when topological features are of concern. Specifically, the possibility of studying configurations of arbitrary shape with reduced effort is of crucial importance for exploiting the potential offered by composites with nonstraight fibers. Exemplary results are presented for structures with different geometries and shapes. The comparison against results from the literature and finite element calculations reveals the potential of the approach as a valuable mean for assisting the design of innovative variable-stiffness configurations.},

However, the fatigue crack growth and its prognosis are affected by various uncertainties, which makes the current inspection strategy with fixed intervals challenging in managing the aircraft with diverse damage states in a fleet. In this study, an intelligent crack inspection strategy is proposed based on a digital twin, in which a reduced-order fracture mechanics simulation methodology, a validated fatigue crack growth model, and the historical crack length inspection results are integrated into a dynamic Bayesian network. The proposed strategy uses two connected probabilistic processes, which conduct the diagnosis/prognosis and calculate the inspection intervals, respectively, to adaptively set the inspection intervals according to the updating of the digital twin model. The proposed inspection strategy is demonstrated by the various crack growth histories of a helicopter component and benchmarked against several baselines. The results show that the probability of failure can be kept below the threshold, even though the initial crack size and the crack growth parameters are underestimated in the prior distribution. Further applications on more realistic aircraft structures will be carried out in the future.},

  abstract     = {Accurately determining system order plays a vital role in system identification directly related to the accuracy of identification results, especially for nonlinear system identification. Due to the need for human subjective judgment, the traditional sequence determination method easily causes uncertainty in the results; and the phenomenon of the virtual mode or omission occurs. An automatic nonlinear subspace identification method is proposed to address the aforementioned problems. When the eigenvalue decomposition of the constructed Hankel matrix is performed, the calculation range of the modal order of the system is estimated. The similarity coefficient and distance function are introduced to cluster the identified modal results, the poles of the false modes are removed to obtain the cluster stabilization diagram, and the best order of the system is received. Then, the modal parameters and nonlinear coefficients are obtained. Simulation examples are carried out to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. An experimental study is carried out on a multilayer building with nonlinear characteristics. Compared with the traditional stabilization graph, the accuracy of the automatic order determination proposed in this paper is proven.},

In this paper, a new four-degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) wind tunnel virtual flight test device is established. Compared with the 3-DOF wind tunnel virtual flight test with rotation around the center of mass, the model adds vertical motion, enabling it to simulate free flight more realistically. In this paper, the nonlinear flight dynamics model of 4-DOF wind tunnel virtual flight test is established, the differences in dynamics characteristics between it and free flight are analyzed, and the identification model of aerodynamic derivatives based on 4-DOF wind tunnel virtual flight test is derived. To ensure the safety of the test, the longitudinal altitude control law as well as the sideslip and roll angle control laws in the lateral direction are designed. Finally, a set of aerodynamic parameter identification methods based on a 4-DOF wind tunnel virtual flight test is formed. The output error method is used to identify the aerodynamic derivatives of the test model, and the accuracy of the identification results is higher than that of the 3-DOF wind tunnel virtual flight test.},

  abstract     = {A trajectory planning algorithm based on the traditional A* formulation is designed to determine the minimum-energy path from a start to a final location taking into account the prevailing wind conditions. To obtain average wind conditions in an urban environment, full-scale Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations are first performed using OpenFoam® for various inlet wind directions on a computational model representing complex buildings on the campus of the Technical University of Berlin. The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes of the full database are then calculated in an offline stage with the wind direction as a parameter. Next, the online reconstruction of the complete urban wind field is performed by Gappy POD using simulated pointwise measurements obtained by sparse sensors. Finally, the trajectory planning algorithm is applied to the reconstructed wind field and validated by comparison with the trajectory computed on the full-order computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The main conclusion is that the error made by calculating the energy requirements for a specific trajectory based on an inexpensive reduced-order model of the wind field instead of an expensive full-order CFD database is only a few percent in all investigated cases. Therefore, a reliable and trustworthy trajectory can be calculated from the inexpensive reduced-order model obtained with only a few velocity sensors. Furthermore, it is shown that the energy consumption along a trajectory could be reduced by up to 20\% by taking the prevailing wind field into consideration instead of considering the shortest path.},

  abstract     = {Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) is an enabling technology that has transformed engineering experimentation and helped researchers expand modeling capabilities. However, breakthroughs are necessary to expand the range of hybrid simulation methods and, thus, enable experiments with loading conditions representing multiple hazards. This paper discusses the development of a new thermomechanical RTHS framework and a systematic approach to determining RTHS control requirements. First, the framework is established using a representative finite element model of a layered structural system subjected to thermal loading. A complete two-layer system model serves as the reference system, and it is then partitioned into a numerical layer and an experimental layer that share interface conditions. Next, a thermal actuator is introduced to impose dynamic thermal loading on the experimental subsystem, serving as a transfer system. Finally, control and performance metrics are defined to evaluate the realization of interface boundary conditions and map this to the RTHS execution. Through an illustrative example considering the influence of temperature on a lunar habitat, we demonstrate how to establish controller requirements for RTHS and demonstrate that this approach can be used to conduct RTHS on structures with thermomechanical loading.},

Therefore, the influences of pressure, mass flow rate, wall heat flux, and heating rate on the energy conversion were investigated, and an empirical prediction model was developed. The numerical results revealed that the influence of pressure on heat sink mainly focuses on the low and medium conversion. The chemical heat sink decreases with the increase of the mass flow rate and the heating rate, while the chemical heat sink increases with the increase in the wall heat flux. In addition, based on the analysis of the numerical data, an energy conversion correlation is developed by the Buckingham PI theorem, and most of the data calculated by this correlation can satisfy the deviation bandwidth of .},

An experiment was performed with a generic over/under combined-cycle engine inlet mode to investigate the characteristics of the inlet mode transition in the off-design state. The transition Mach number was set to Mach 3.5 by design, while it was 2.9 during the experiment. Oscillatory flow is obtained during both down- and up-rotation processes of the splitter. Results show that the size and location of the separation bubble vary with the splitter position. The dominant frequency of the flowfield oscillation is always below 200 Hz. Combining the analysis of schlieren and dynamic pressure data, it is found that the main factor affecting the flowfield oscillation features is the self-excited oscillation of the shock train, while the acoustic resonance frequency is also reflected near the unstart point. Comparison of the pressure curves of the two processes shows that the hysteresis interval accounts for 17.8\% of the entire rotation time of the splitter and that the hysteresis stems from the presence of the separation bubble on the splitter during the up-rotation of the splitter. The analysis of the unstart and restart points shows that they deviate from the isentropic and Kantrowitz limits, respectively. The new unstart and restart boundaries should consider the combined effect of the separation bubble at the duct entrance, the internal wave system, and the throat Mach number.},

Three fuel-injection distances and the corresponding combined fuel injection schemes were tested and compared with the global equivalence ratio unchanged. The results indicate that the combustions of longer and medium distances (35 and 21 mm, respectively) present stronger oscillations, which are mainly attributed to the strengthened oscillations of the mainstream flame (MF). It is also found that combined fueling schemes can help weaken the oscillations. The predominant frequencies of the combustion oscillations in different fueling schemes are all distributed at approximately 400 Hz, which are proven to be induced by the MF. The low-frequency range (0–50 Hz) is more dominant for the shorter injection distance (7 mm) than in the other cases, which is because the flames are strongly influenced by low-frequency disturbances with fluctuations in the fueling injection and inflow. The analysis reveals that these disturbances act primarily on the cavity flame.},

This type of instability is commonly explained by the two-way coupling between the dynamics of the combustion chamber and the injection system. Recent experimental studies of the BKD combustor, however, suggest that the LOX injector could be self-excited and driving the acoustic mode of the combustion chamber. To assess the feasibility of this mechanism, here, we study both experimentally and theoretically the acoustic stability of the LOX injector isolated from the combustion chamber. The experimental study was performed in a water facility mimicking the conditions of a single LOX injector. The water injector was then modeled using an acoustic network analysis, where the transfer matrix of the LOX injector inlet orifice was computed numerically using a linear approach. The analysis successfully predicts the experimental peak in unsteady pressure, revealing that the LOX injector can be self-excited. The instability was found to be driven by the whistling of the orifice at the inlet of the injector coupled with the second longitudinal acoustic mode of the LOX post tube.},

Using a propagation model adapted from the Lighthill acoustic analogy, it was found that the acoustic efficiency of the “varicose” mode is significantly higher than the “flapping” and “wagging” modes for both free- and installed jets. Increasing the aspect ratio of the elliptical jet produces a slight reduction in sound for the mode, a significant decrease in the mode, and a significant increase for the mode. A similar trend was observed for the installed case. An exponential relationship between the jet–plate distance and scattered sound was found for elliptical jets, as observed for circular jets. Other geometric parameters such as the orientation angle of the ellipse were also analyzed.},

This optimal artificial neural network was then validated over training/test data and exhibited prediction accuracy over 91\% for data previously unseen by the model. A sensitivity analysis was conducted, which showed that input features that directly modify the thrust coefficient had a dominant effect over blade-wake interaction noise. The optimal prediction model along with aerodynamic simulations were used to further study the effect of varying input features on blade-wake interaction noise, and three types of blade-wake interaction noise were identified.},

The effects of convection, shear stress, gravity, surface tension, and contact angle on the runback film flow are examined. The results show that shear stress from the air and capillary force due to the contact angle at the contact line are the two dominant influences on transportation, with the former acting as the driving force, while the capillary force at the contact line holds back the film and can cause a drastic increase in thickness at the contact line. With increased contact angle, the coverage of the film retracts, but film thickness upstream is not affected. A model for the film velocity containing the effects of shear stress and contact angle was proposed based on the analysis, which can be simplified to Newton’s shear law when the incoming velocity is large or the contact angle is small.},

The multibody-dynamics and aerodynamic solvers are combined by an implicit coupling approach, and the quasi-Newtonian method is adopted to solve the system of nonlinear differential equations of motion. For validation, numerical results were compared with measurement data from a robotic wing and a living insect. A parametric analysis was conducted to study the effects of several kinematic parameters on the deformation and aerodynamic performance of the wing in hover. In most cases, using a flexible wing is far more efficient in terms of force production in comparison with its rigid counterpart. In general, wing deformation may cause considerable differences between the wing-tip and wing-base kinematic parameters.

  abstract     = {Direct numerical simulations were performed to investigate the behavior of laminar separation bubbles subject to vertical gusts in an airfoil flow. Oscillating boundary-layer flows containing gusts—including unsteady pressure gradients—were prescribed via boundary conditions as well as forcing terms on a domain located in the upper rear section of a natural laminar flow airfoil. For this hybrid approach, unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations of the entire flowfield were carried out in conjunction with the so-called disturbance velocity approach, providing transient boundary conditions for the direct numerical simulation. A steady-state reference case with a Reynolds number of is compared and validated with results from wind tunnel experiments. Results of simulations at four different gust frequencies at the same amplitude , each with and without additional disturbances to the boundary layer introducing oblique resonance, are presented and discussed in this paper. The time-dependent behavior of convective instability modes is evaluated by using the continuous wavelet transform and linear stability theory with an unsteady extension. Furthermore, the contribution of the absolute instability—which appears to be larger in the case of oscillating flow compared to the steady-state case—is discussed. Lock-in effects are identified at high gust frequencies.},

In addition to pressure and force measurements, tuft visualizations and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry measurements were used to investigate AFC effects. With a total momentum coefficient of 1.5\%, the control authority (lateral force) of the VTP was increased by a maximum of 34\% when actuators were distributed along the rudder span. Additionally, flow control at dedicated positions on the rudder was investigated by using individual actuator segments. It was found that AFC is particularly effective at the position of the maximum load in the spanwise direction. The measurements also confirmed that local application of AFC actuators may simulate the effect of a boundary-layer fence. Finally, a comparison with existing results obtained with sweeping jet actuators shows that these two specific AFC implementations are most effective in different ranges of the momentum and the power coefficients.},

Simultaneous measurements of velocity fields and wall-pressure fluctuations were performed using a high-resolution time-resolved particle image velocimetry operating at 2 kHz and an array of flush-mounted microphones sampled at 10 kHz. The results provided a detailed description of the shear layer transition and the coherent structures development on the airfoil. The roll-up process, pairing process, spatial-temporal growth of the vortical structure, and vortex break-up were clarified through a long-period analysis. Spectral analysis demonstrated that vortical structures at the fundamental frequency were spatially and temporally localized and that their subharmonics were significantly enhanced. Frequency–wavenumber spectra revealed that the energy was dominantly concentrated along the convective ridge. With increasing incidence angle, the energy level of the inclined ridge increased, with a lower extension in the frequency domain and a higher dispersion in the wavenumber domain. The conditional averaging and quadrant analysis results demonstrated that strong events in the near-wall region were dominated by the sweep motion and ejection motion, which enhanced the interaction between the inner and outer layers. This also indicated the existence of a strong relationship between the wall-pressure peaks and turbulence production mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {When designing aircraft, avoiding dynamic aeroelastic instabilities such as flutter is a key requirement. One way to meet this requirement is to use a multidisciplinary design optimization subject to a flutter constraint. Flutter-constrained design optimizations have used geometrically linear detailed models, which do not accurately predict flutter for very flexible aircraft, or geometrically nonlinear low-order models, which do not accurately trade off cruise range and structural mass. This paper presents a framework for integrating a geometrically nonlinear, subsonic flutter constraint that captures the large in-flight deflections of very flexible aircraft into high-fidelity gradient-based aerostructural optimization. The cruise range and stress constraints are computed accurately with detailed aerostructural analyses, which use a built-up finite element model coupled to Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics. The detailed model is condensed to a low-order aeroelastic model to compute the geometrically nonlinear flutter constraint and its adjoint derivatives with computational cost and robustness suitable for optimization. The framework is demonstrated by maximizing the cruise range of a subsonic high-aspect-ratio wing with respect to panel thicknesses, sweep, and span. The impact of the geometrically nonlinear flutter constraint highly depends on the in-flight deformation level. At low deflection levels, sweeping the wing backward is the most effective flutter prevention method, and the flutter constraint has little impact on the achievable cruise range. At high deflection levels, shortening the wing span is necessary to suppress flutter, reducing the achievable cruise range by up to 5.9\%. This work is a step toward making multidisciplinary design optimization a practical tool for designing the energy-efficient, very flexible aircraft of the future, which require geometrically nonlinear flutter analyses early in the design cycle to prevent flutter.},

  abstract     = {Transonic buffet is an aerodynamic phenomenon of self-sustained shock oscillations. The aeroelastic problem caused by it is very complex, including two different dynamic modes: forced vibration and frequency lock-in. The vibration of the structure has a negative influence on the fatigue life of the aircraft. Especially in the region of frequency lock-in, the limit cycle oscillations occur due to the instability of the structural mode. Researchers have accurately predicted the region of frequency lock-in in transonic buffet and have clarified its mechanism by using a linear aerodynamic model. However, the nonlinear aeroelastic modeling and prediction of the transonic buffet remain to be solved. The long short-term memory (LSTM) deep neural network is suitable for predicting the time-delayed effects of unsteady aerodynamics. And it has achieved remarkable results in sequential data modeling. In the present work, a nonlinear model is developed for the aeroelastic system with NACA0012 airfoil in transonic buffeting flow and validated with the coupled computational fluid dynamics/computational structural dynamics (CFD/CSD) simulation. First, the data set and the loss function are specially designed. Then, the reduced-order model (ROM) based on the LSTM of the flow is built by using unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computations data in a post-buffet state. By coupling the ROM and the single degree-of-freedom equation for the pitching angle, the nonlinear aeroelastic model is finally produced. The results show that the phenomenon of frequency lock-in and the self-sustained buffeting aerodynamics are precisely reconstructed. And the model has a strong generalization ability and can reproduce complex vibrations caused by competition between different modes. In short, the model can replace the CFD/CSD method in the current case with high efficiency and accuracy. The method can be used for modeling and prediction of other various complex aeroelastic systems.},

The first mechanism is closely tied to the periodic variations of the shock-induced separation height, whereas the second mechanism is related to the pressure dynamics around the shock wave.

It presents unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations of the fixed BSCW, the BSCW undergoing prescribed pitch motion, and the BSCW suspended on springs in one and two degrees of freedom. The study’s objectives are to 1) establish the BSCW buffet properties and 2) investigate the aeroelastic and prescribed-motion responses of the wing at buffet conditions. The results indicate that the BSCW buffet is predominantly two-dimensional in terms of its characteristics, although it is greatly affected by the tip flow. The response to prescribed pitch motion and the aeroelastic response of the spring-suspended wing display similar phenomena, where the response in the buffet frequency is suppressed once the oscillation amplitude exceeds some threshold, and the structural and aerodynamic responses are solely at the structural frequency. At the studied conditions, the BSCW undergoes stall flutter, dominated by pitch oscillations, compared to a bending-torsion coalescence flutter at lower angles of attack. We conclude that the shock buffet does not drive the BSCW flutter instability. However, both the buffet and stall flutter develop at similar flow conditions of detached boundary layer behind a strong shock at transonic Mach numbers and moderate angles of attack.},

The sublimation method for a large-scale cold supersonic wind tunnel was developed to acquire a transition pattern. The stationary crossflow wave identification technology is based on image processing, a vertical and horizontal decomposition method is established, and the quantitative characteristic information (such as the vortex axis spacing and direction) can be identified from high-resolution sublimation images. The experimental results show that the transition position caused by crossflow instability is closed to the leading edge for supersonic wings with large sweep angles at high Reynolds numbers, and the transition position moves upstream with the increase of the unit Reynolds number. The identified vortex axis spacing and direction are basically consistent with the linear stability theory. The stationary disturbance wave information at different Reynolds numbers is compared and analyzed. It is found that the unit Reynolds number plays an important role in the selection and amplification of the unstable stationary modes with different wavelengths in the transition process.},

  abstract     = {Shock waves will form by turning supersonic or locally supersonic flow and result in an increase in the freestream density downstream of the shock. This increase leads to optical distortions that limit the effectiveness of aircraft-mounted laser systems. In this paper, analytic expressions are developed to describe these optical distortions in terms of the optical-path difference (OPD). Pupil-plane disturbances imposed by the shock are studied for two cases: when the shock is parallel to the propagation direction and when the shock is on an angle relative to the propagation direction. Upon propagation from the pupil plane, the analysis shows that shock-induced phase discontinuities can sometimes cause the irradiance pattern in the image plane to bifurcate. Despite a large amount of tilt in the pupil plane, the bifurcated irradiance pattern does not map to a proportional shift in the image plane. The implications that these findings have on Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWFS) data are also explored. The results show that least-squares reconstruction from the SHWFS data yield accurate estimates of the change in OPD across the shock when the magnitude of the phase difference caused by the shock is between 0 and approximately . However, when , the results show that least-squares reconstruction begins to severely underestimate the change in OPD across the shock. Such results will inform future efforts looking to develop aircraft-mounted laser systems.},

The geometric relationship between leading-edge cones and the shock surface is a particular case of the Apollonius problem in mathematics. Six conditions of leading-edge cones have been discussed, and mathematical expressions of the shock surface are presented.

The damaged panel structure has been constructed mathematically using a circular meshing approach of the FE technique to include the crack. Similarly, the sublaminate approach has being used to introduce delamination of the layered structure on a mutual center. The structural distorted geometry and the deformations were modeled through the full geometrical nonlinear strain-displacement (Green–Lagrange) relations in association with higher-order polynomial functions. The modal responses of the damaged structure were obtained through an iterative method in association with the nonlinear FE technique. The predicted response accuracies were established with two-step verifications: that is, the numerical solution stability (elemental sensitivity) and the degree of deviation with published data. The maximum deviation between the developed numerical model and the reference result (first-order shear deformation theory) was 8.3\%. The model’s competence and responses were compared with experimental data, with and without damages. Finally, new examples have been solved for different structural geometry-dependent parameters (shell configurations, delamination shapes, crack positions/lengths, end boundaries, etcetera) affecting final modal values. A detailed in-depth understanding of the damage and curvature (unequal/equal curvature) effects on modal responses will be discussed.},

The main focus of this work is to study the effects of both transverse normal stress and the fifth-order expansion of thickness coordinates on the hygrothermomechanical responses of doubly curved laminated shallow shells. The governing equations of the theory are derived based on the principle of virtual work and solved by using Navier’s method. The theory ensures traction-free boundary conditions using constitutive relations and does not require a shear correction factor. Interlaminar transverse shear stresses are recovered using the three-dimensional equilibrium equations of the theory of elasticity to ascertain the stress continuity at the layer interface. Three-dimensional elasticity solutions are taken as a basis for comparing the present results in thermal problems, whereas this study contributes some useful results to the hygrothermomechanical analysis of doubly curved laminated composite shallow shells.},

  abstract     = {Thin-walled cylindrical shells are key load-carrying components for aerospace structures. Axial compression is the most common load for cylindrical shells; however, critical buckling loads obtained experimentally are significantly lower than the theoretical values, owing to the presence of initial geometric imperfections (GIs). Previous studies often determined only the knockdown factor through the statistics of experimental data; it is an approximate lower limit of the load-carrying capacity and cannot accurately predict the buckling mode in real time. In this paper, an image-driven framework for the intelligent prediction of buckling load and mode based on measured GIs is proposed. First, through measured samples and the random field method, the GI data pool is obtained. Subsequently, two convolutional neural network (CNN) models are trained to predict the buckling load and mode for cylindrical shells, respectively. The active learning strategy is adopted to discern beneficial sample sets and enhance the prediction accuracy and training speed of the CNN models. A numerical example demonstrates that the proposed framework can effectively predict the buckling behavior of cylindrical shells with GIs. Furthermore, using the proposed prediction framework, it was observed that a common feature of unfavorable GIs is a large fluctuation in magnitude along the axial direction.},

An analytical kinematic equation is established for tensegrities under member length actuation. The expressions of the elongations of active members are derived for the specified motion with elastic and rigid-body deformations, respectively. The mathematical models of the repulsive fields induced by obstacles and the attractive fields generated by target points are given to define the artificial potential field. For any configuration on the kinematic path, the nodes in the repulsive fields and the guide nodes in the attractive fields are forced to move in the steepest descent directions of their potential energies. The motion directions of nodes are then adjusted for the compliance of structural geometry. A numerical strategy is proposed to trace the kinematic path of a tensegrity step by step in the artificial potential field. The path plannings are performed on an illustrative slender tensegrity consisting of stacked modules by considering the motions with elastic and rigid-body deformations, respectively; and the validity of the proposed method is verified by investigating the obstacle avoidance, the compliance of structural geometry, the slack prevention of cables, and the structural stability for the obtained kinematic paths.},

  abstract     = {Solid rocket motors (SRMs) are prone to bore cracking due to material degradation mechanisms and temperature changes that occur during storage and service life, and therefore early damage detection is of crucial importance. Structural health monitoring (SHM) strategies aim at measuring the load redistribution caused by a crack through embedded strain sensors. By acknowledging the existence of uncertainties, both in the material and measurement systems, this work employs a Neyman–Pearson detector that treats the crack identification problem as a binary statistical pattern recognition one. A typical SRM geometry, at its healthy state and with a bore crack of variable size, is considered in a probabilistic computational setting. A surrogate model is trained with synthetic data generated from a physics-based finite element model and then used for uncertainty propagation. Detection is first treated as a deterministic signal within noise, and next as an uncertain signal described by a probabilistic distribution. The system’s architecture is assessed through a procedure for arriving at the optimal number and location for sensor placement in conjunction with the SHM’s detection performance. The latter is described by receiver operating characteristic curves.},

The control surface is simplified as a spanwise finite ramp placed on a longitudinal slice of a cone. The front surface of the ramp contains a thin panel designed to respond to the unsteady fluid loading arising from the shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions. Experiments were conducted at Mach 5 and Mach 8 with ramps of different angles. High-speed schlieren captured the unsteady flow dynamics and accelerometers behind the thin panel measured its structural response. Panel vibrations were dominated by natural modes that were excited by the broadband aerodynamic fluctuations arising in the flowfield. However, increased structural response was observed in two distinct flow regimes: 1) attached or small separation interactions, where the transitional regime induced the strongest panel fluctuations. This was in agreement with the observation of increased convective undulations or bulges in the separation shock generated by the passage of turbulent spots, and 2) large separated interactions, where shear layer flapping in the laminar regime produced strong panel response at the flapping frequency. In addition, panel heating during the experiment caused a downward shift in its natural mode frequencies.},

Recent work has shown that the displacement of a Kevlar wall can be measured accurately via an optical method to obtain the loading on an airfoil in a steady flow, but the feasibility of using this method on time-varying flows has yet to be explored. Based on thin airfoil theory, a model of an airfoil undergoing a sudden change in angle of attack is considered, and the pressure along the wall was found using potential flow theory. The process of relating the pressure field to the wall displacement is presented, and it is shown how the wall response can be found. The membrane response is then used to obtain estimates of the angle-of-attack time history of the airfoil through an inversion process. It was found that the response of the Kevlar wall is dominated by the effects of the circulation around the airfoil and not its wake, and so the unsteady airfoil lift is measured with the proposed method, without the need for a force balance with a fast response time. The limitations and the applications of the proposed measurement method are discussed.},

  abstract     = {A multirotor electric vertical takeoff and landing (EVTOL) aircraft is specialized for intracity point-to-point urban air mobility services due to its advantages of efficient hover performance, high gust resistance, and relatively low noise. Because of its multiple rotors, rotor–rotor interference inevitably affects flight performance, mainly depending on inter-rotor distance and rotor rotation directions. It is assumed that there exists an optimal rotation direction for a given lot of multiple rotors. In this study, the aim is to investigate rotor–rotor interference for various rotation directions and the resulting flight performance. We propose a concept of rotor rotation direction that achieves the desirable flight performance in forward flight. The concept is called front-retreating/rear-advancing (FRRA), in which the retreating side of the front rotor and the advancing side of the rear rotor are aligned in a straight line. To this end, a multidisciplinary flight simulation framework was developed to predict the flight performance of a general multirotor EVTOL aircraft. It was found that the FRRA concept minimizes thrust loss due to rotor–rotor interference in high-speed forward flight. For a generic mission profile, the rotation direction set by the FRRA concept reduces the battery energy consumption by 7\% in comparison to the rotation direction of unfavorable rotor–rotor interference in operation.},

The main scope of this work is to provide a noise source model that can be coupled with relatively low computational cost methods for aeroacoustic scattering. To this end, this paper presents for the first time a multiobjective optimization of the zeroth-mode wave-packet in the jet near field. The importance of calibrating the model with near-field pressure data stems from the fact that in new aircraft, the engine nacelles are typically positioned at a few diameters from the wing or fuselage. In this work, the near field of a high subsonic jet at a Mach number of 0.9 is represented as a cylindrical surface radiating the pressure disturbances of a wave-packet source, which is optimized using large-eddy simulation data from three lines at different radial distances. The optimized model has been tested at Strouhal numbers between 0.25 and one, and the optimized solutions have been chosen using a Pareto-ranking criterion considering the wave-packet prediction over an extra line. A good agreement is achieved between the reference data and model predictions for multiple near-field radial distances.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new air cycle system by replacing the turbine assembly with vortex tubes and a parameter-matching method independent of the architecture of the air cycle system. Only, in terms of refrigerating and dehumidification, the performance of the newly proposed vortex system is worse than that of a conventional air cycle system under the same bleed air parameters. However, for aircraft practical applications, the overall performance of air cycle systems requires additional considerations such as the heating capacity, weight of the system, and extra aviation fuel used to transport that weight. Therefore, this paper conducts an integrated performance comparison between the new system and a conventional system based on the overall fuel mass penalty criterion. The results show that whether the new system has a smaller total takeoff mass depends on the bleed air parameters, flight duration, and flight speed. For specific bleed air parameters, there is a specific curve where the new system and the turbine system have the same total takeoff mass. The performance of the new system is better than that of the turbine system only when the values of flight Mach number and flight duration are at the lower left of the curve.},

  abstract     = {The overset grid method for simulation of unsteady flow with moving bodies faces several issues, including low assembly efficiency for a large number of bodies, difficult parallel implementation, and the requirement of manual intervention. To address these issues, in this paper, we develop an efficient, automatic, and robust parallel dynamic overset-unstructured-grid assembly method. It is achieved by parallelizing its two main steps: hole cutting, and identification of interpolation stencils. The hole cutting is simply implemented in parallel by identifying the active zone of each grid with a criterion of the global minimum wall distance. The global minimum wall distance is efficiently calculated on each process with the oriented-bounding-box-based -dimensional (-D) trees of the wall surface grids. For identification of the interpolation stencil, we use the results of the first step, optimally define the interpolation boundary nodes, and determine their candidate donor partitions in each process. This efficiently minimizes the number of query nodes and their donor cell candidates. The donor cell search is efficiently performed in parallel in each candidate donor partition by using the oriented-bounding-box-based -D tree of the field volume grid. Several cases are adopted to test the efficiency and capability of the proposed parallel dynamic overset-unstructured-grid assembly approach.},

  abstract     = {In aerodynamic shape optimization, traditional static geometry control methods can produce suboptimal performance by introducing performance tradeoffs at various stages of optimization, enforcing arbitrary constraints on open-ended optimization, and necessitating foreknowledge of problem behavior to design an effective control scheme. These shortcomings can be mitigated through dynamic geometry control, which partly automates the geometry control design process by refining the geometry control topology throughout optimization. Such refinement can occur in a predetermined fashion (as in progressive control) or more automatically using sensitivity information to guide refinement (as in adaptive control). Both progressive control and adaptive control are implemented in the context of axial and free-form deformation geometry control, and novel contributions are made to the adaptive algorithm, including the treatment of active constraints and several novel “potential indicators” to rank candidate refinements. Application to a wide suite of aerodynamic shape optimization problems demonstrates that dynamic geometry control is effective, producing lower final drag than well-designed static schemes while reducing required iterations to convergence by 50\% or more, and simultaneously reducing labor requirements on the user. These benefits are demonstrated across a wide variety of problems, representative of detailed and exploratory problems often encountered in both academia and industry.},

  abstract     = {The accuracy of machine-learned turbulence models often diminishes when applied to flow cases outside the training data set. In an effort to improve the predictive accuracy of data-driven models for an expanded set of cases, an extension of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-driven training framework consisting of three key steps is proposed. Firstly, a list of candidate flow-related parameters is selected to supplement Pope’s general tensor basis hypothesis. Secondly, modeling an additional production term may benefit the overall predictions in certain situations. Finally, the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) evaluations of candidate models are performed on several different flows simultaneously during the model training iterations. Five free-shear and five wall-bounded flow cases are chosen to train or test data-driven turbulence models. It is shown that the machine-learned models from the present multicase CFD-driven framework can significantly improve the predictive accuracy for the test cases where the baseline RANS results showed significant error from the ground truth. Meanwhile, for cases in which the baseline produced good results, the new models do not perform worse. Further analysis shows that the new models can adapt to opposite trends of turbulent diffusion required for the different cases with a common correction. Moreover, the trained models can be simplified and still achieve similar improvement as the whole expressions.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a framework based on either iterative simulation or iterative experimentation for constructing an optimal, open-loop maneuver to regulate the aerodynamic force on a wing in the presence of a known flow disturbance. The authors refer to the method as iterative maneuver optimization and apply it in this paper to regulate lift on a pitching wing during a transverse gust encounter. A candidate maneuver is created by performing an optimal control calculation on a surrogate model of the wing–gust interaction. Execution of the proposed maneuver in a high-fidelity simulation or experiment provides an error signal based on the difference between the force predicted by the surrogate model and the measured force. The error signal provides an update to the reference signal used by the surrogate model for tracking. A new candidate maneuver is calculated such that the surrogate model tracks the reference force signal, and the process repeats until the maneuver adequately regulates the force. The framework for iterative maneuver optimization is tested on a discrete vortex model as well as in experiments in a water towing tank. Experimental results show that the proposed framework generates a maneuver that reduces the magnitude of lift overshoot by 92\% for a trapezoidal gust with peak velocity equal to approximately 0.7 times the freestream flow speed.},

The reduced-order model (ROM) predicts the aerodynamic response of a rigid airfoil to a gust under a wide range of angles of attack, gust lengths, and gust intensities. We study two algorithms for sampling training simulations, equally spaced and Latin hypercube methods. Both methods result in a ROM with an accurate prediction of aerodynamic forces and moments, given sufficient training points, particularly along the gust length axis. We use this ROM in coupling with the structural dynamics equations to study the aeroelastic response of a one-degree-of-freedom elastic airfoil. The aeroelastic gust response predictions are accurate for moderately large pitch angle deformation, using only the ROM created from computational fluid dynamics simulation of the rigid airfoil.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a variational theory of lift that, unlike Kutta’s theory, is derived from first principles in mechanics: Hertz’s principle of least curvature. In this theory, the unique value of circulation is determined by minimizing the Appellian of the flowfield. Interestingly, it recovers the Kutta condition in the special case of an airfoil with a sharp trailing edge. In this paper, we apply such a theory to the classical problem of the flow over a flat plate. The resulting ideal flow does not match Kutta’s solution in this case; it results in a nonlifting solution for any uncambered, fore-aft symmetric shape, confirming experimental findings in superfluids. This result provides necessary conditions for lift generation in an ideal fluid. For a real fluid over a flat plate with a sharp leading edge, viscosity plays an important role, leading to a flow separation at the leading edge, even at small angles of attack. This separation bubble creates asymmetry in the outer inviscid flowfield (outside the bubble), which enables lift. This problem is discussed in the light of the developed variational theory of lift and some historical details about the development of Kutta’s theory.},

  abstract     = {Two configurations typical of fixed-wing aircraft are simulated with the actuator line method (ALM): a wing with winglets, and a T tail. The ALM is extensively used in rotor simulations to model the blades by body forces, which are calculated from airfoil data and the relative flow velocity. This method has not been used to simulate airplane aerodynamics, despite its advantage of allowing coarser grids. This may be credited to the failure of the uncorrected ALM to accurately predict forces near the tip of the wings, even for simple configurations. The recently proposed vortex-based smearing correction shows improved results, suggesting those limitations are part of the past. For the nonplanar configurations studied in this work, differences between the ALM with the original smearing correction and a nonlinear lifting line (LL) method are observed near the intersection of surfaces because the circulation generated in the numerical simulation differs from the calculated corrected circulation. A vorticity magnitude correction is proposed, which improves the agreement between the ALM and the LL method. This second-order correction resolves the ambiguity in the velocity used to define the lift force. The good results indicate that the improved ALM can be used for airplane aerodynamics, with an accuracy similar to the LL method.},

In our previous work (Kumar et al., Journal of Turbulence, Vol. 22, No. 11, 2021, pp. 735–760), we found stationary spanwise inhomogeneities in the form of alternating regions of fast- and slow-moving fluid, which were termed “flow channels.” In the present study we investigate further this phenomenon. We observe the formation of hairpin vortices downstream of the roughness elements, which eventually merge; this causes the formation of wider channels that remain coherent and affect the trailing-edge separation. With increasing angle of attack, the intensity of flow channeling can increase or decrease depending on the topology of the leading-edge roughness. Its effect on the trailing-edge separation remains, however, significant. The mean-separation line is highly distorted, and the separation length can vary by up to 30\% of the chord length along the span.},

This explained the discrepancy between theoretical predictions, based on effective Gol’dberg numbers, that shocks should not form, and observations of steepened Mach waves close to laboratory-scale jets. The present work continues studying this phenomenon by exploring coalescence processes that occur when neighboring waveforms intersect, forming larger-amplitude waveforms with increased cumulative nonlinear distortion. A numerical model based on the Khokhlov–Zabolotskaya–Kuznetsov (KZK) equation is developed to show that coalescence-induced steepening is sensitive to the intersection angle between adjacent waveforms, waveform duration, and cylindrical spreading effects. High frame-rate schlieren images of sound waves propagating from the post-potential core region of a laboratory-scale Mach 3 jet are then captured along an angle following the ridge of most intense noise to study the development and evolution of coalescence. A shock detection algorithm isolates shock-like events, which are tracked using a translating coordinate system and decomposed using proper orthogonal decomposition. Reduced-order reconstructions of both schlieren images and the KZK model identify common patterns that characterize the shock coalescence process.},

  abstract     = {Several high-resolution scale-resolving simulations are carried out to examine the effect of riblets on the mean and turbulent statistics of a zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer. The Reynolds number is chosen such that the riblets are exposed to both the transitional and turbulent regimes of the boundary layer. This is in contrast to the turbulent channel flow or fully turbulent boundary layers studied in the literature. The boundary layer is subjected to freestream turbulence and roughness tripping. The transition process and the extent of the turbulent regime on the riblets are altered by tripping the boundary layer with an isolated hemispherical roughness element. The influence of the riblets on the transition onset and the viscous drag reduction is demonstrated through time-averaged, phase-averaged, and instantaneous flow quantities. The effect of the V-shaped riblets with both sharp and curved tips (and valleys) is also explored. With riblets, the viscous drag in the turbulent regime is reduced by 4–6\% when compared to a smooth surface, and the efficacy of sharp V-shaped riblets is shown to be marginally higher than for the curved riblets. In the transitional flow regime, the coherent structures over riblets are predominantly spanwise oriented. In particular, a separated shear layer forms over the riblet leading edge as the flow encounters an abrupt surface transition from the smooth surface onto the riblets. A leading-edge ramp is shown to effectively minimize the additional spurt in the turbulent kinetic energy and the associated losses incurred due to this abrupt surface change.},

Closed-loop control is employed to vary the oscillation frequency at a fixed flow rate and track a sinusoidal reference target without phase error, using measurements from a pitot probe in the device. The controller is demonstrated to be effective at rejecting disturbances, which is illustrated with both time and frequency domain data. The controller’s ability to track step changes to the reference signal phase is tested, and the closed-loop bandwidth is shown to be around 20\% of the oscillation frequency, in close agreement with the theoretical prediction.},

  abstract     = {Surface dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators, which have a few advantages and are involved in continuous and burst modes, have attracted worldwide attention for aircraft flow control in the last two decades. It is believed that understanding the flowfield generated by surface dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators has a great effect on promoting the control effects of plasma actuators. Nevertheless, the details of the flowfield close to the wall remain unclear. Motivated by this requirement, the flowfield created by a single asymmetrical plasma actuator is investigated in still air by using the two-dimensional time-resolved particle image velocimetry device. Interestingly, a pulsed velocity created by the plasma actuator with the continuous mode near the dielectric surface is first observed, which might cause the impact effect by creating large-size disturbances, and benefits flow control. It is speculated that the formation of the pulsed velocity is related to the coupling effect between the entrainment of the starting vortex and the induced body force at the initiation stage closely. In addition, the present results reveal the underlying mechanism that the control effect of the burst pattern has significantly outperformed that of the continuous one.},

For pure sinusoidal signals of finite width, the frequency was found to have no effect on the computed FLDI response below the photodetector threshold. The signal wavelength, however, has a direct correlation with FLDI amplitude; peak amplitude was achieved with a wavelength of double the FLDI beam separation when measured at the focal points. The ability of the FLDI to suppress signals away from the foci of the beams was observed. Simulated narrow-nozzle jet results using a large-eddy simulation were compared to an experimental test with good agreement. The jet simulation was then used to study the effects of varying the beam separation and profile diameter on the FLDI sensitivity falloff, with smaller beam spacing and larger profiles away from the foci corresponding to shorter optical-axis sensitivity lengths.},

  abstract     = {Compressible wall-modeled large-eddy simulations of Mach 8 turbulent boundary-layer flows over a flat plate were carried out for the conditions of the hypersonic wind tunnel at Sandia National Laboratories. The simulations provide new insight into the effect of wall cooling on the aero-optical path distortions for hypersonic turbulent boundary-layer flows. Four different wall-to-recovery temperature ratios, 0.3, 0.48, 0.71, and 0.89, are considered. Despite the much lower grid resolution, the mean velocity, temperature, and resolved Reynolds stress profiles from the simulation for a temperature ratio of 0.48 are in good agreement with those from a reference direct numerical simulation. The normalized root-mean-square optical path difference obtained from the present simulations is compared with that from reference direct numerical simulations, Sandia experiments, as well as predictions obtained with a semi-analytical model by Notre Dame University. The present analysis focuses on the effect of wall cooling on the wall-normal density correlations, on key underlying assumptions of the aforementioned model such as the strong Reynolds analogy, and on the elevation angle effect on the optical path difference. Wall cooling is found to increase the velocity fluctuations and decrease the density fluctuations, resulting in an overall reduction of the normalized optical path distortion. Compared to the simulations, the basic strong Reynolds analogy overpredicts the temperature fluctuations for cooled walls. Also different from the strong Reynolds analogy, the velocity and temperature fluctuations are not perfectly anticorrelated. Finally, as the wall temperature is raised, the density correlation length, away from the wall but inside the boundary layer, increases significantly for beam paths tilted in the downstream direction.},

But could it be that quantum information technology breaks this circle? At first sight, it looks as if it just lifts the competition between cryptographers and cryptanalysts to the next level. Indeed, quantum computers will render most of today’s public key cryptosystems insecure. Nonetheless, there are good reasons to believe that cryptographers will ultimately prevail over cryptanalysts. Quantum cryptography allows us to build communication schemes whose secrecy relies only on the laws of physics and some minimum assumptions about the cryptographic hardware—leaving basically no room for an attack. While we are not yet there, this paper provides an overview of the principles and state-of-the-art of quantum cryptography, as well as an assessment of current challenges and prospects for overcoming them.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computing uses the physical principles of very small systems to develop computing platforms which can solve problems that are intractable on conventional supercomputers. There are challenges not only in building the required hardware but also in identifying the most promising application areas and developing the corresponding quantum algorithms. The availability of intermediate-scale noisy quantum computers is now propelling the developments of novel algorithms, with applications across a variety of domains, including in aeroscience. Variational quantum algorithms are particularly promising because they are comparatively noise tolerant and aim to achieve a quantum advantage with only a few hundred qubits. Furthermore, they are applicable to a wide range of optimization problems arising throughout the natural sciences and industry. To demonstrate the possibilities for the aeroscience community, we give a perspective on how variational quantum algorithms can be used in computational fluid dynamics. We discuss how classical problems are translated into quantum algorithms and their logarithmic scaling with problem size. For an explicit example, we apply this method to Burgers’s equation in one spatial dimension. We argue that a quantum advantage over classical computing methods could be achieved by the end of this decade if quantum hardware progresses as currently envisaged and emphasize the importance of joining up development of quantum algorithms with application-specific expertise to achieve a real-world impact.},

  abstract     = {Variable-angle tow (VAT) manufacturing methods significantly increase the design space for elastic tailoring of composite structures by smoothly changing fiber angle and ply thickness across a component. Rapid tow shearing (RTS) is a VAT manufacturing technique that uses in-plane shearing (rather than in-plane bending) to steer tows of dry or pre-impregnated fibers. RTS offers a number of benefits over conventional bending-driven steering processes, including tessellation of adjacent tow courses; no overlaps or gaps between tows; and no fiber wrinkling or bridging. Further to this, RTS offers an additional design variable: fiber orientation to tow thickness coupling due to the volumetric relation between tow shearing and the tow’s thickness and width. Previous computational work has shown that through a judicious choice of curvilinear fiber trajectories along a cylinder’s length and across its circumference, the imperfection sensitivity of cylindrical shells under axial compression can be reduced and load-carrying capacity increased. The present work aims to verify these predictions by manufacturing and testing two cylinders: an RTS cylinder and a straight-fiber, quasi-isotropic cylinder as a benchmark. The tow-steered manufacturing process, imperfection measurements, instrumentation, and buckling tests of both cylinders are discussed herein. The experimental tests results are compared against high-fidelity geometrically nonlinear finite element models that include measured geometric and loading imperfections before and during the tests. Finally, a discussion is provided on the outstanding challenges in designing and manufacturing RTS cylinders for primary aerostructures.},

In this work, a parametric reduced-order model (PROM) of a bladed disk is briefly presented that allows for the quick and efficient modeling of rotational speed effects and mistuning effects in bladed disks. This computational model is tuned to match experimental data. The tuned PROM is then investigated through a parametric study. Three internal parameters investigated are i) forcing magnitude, ii) mistuning value magnitude, and iii) damping magnitude, and four external parameters are iv) forcing location, v) forcing radius, vi) probe placement error, and vii) arrival time error. These parameters are common in the structural analysis of turbomachines. Each internal parameter is increased and decreased by 10, 20, and 50\%, while external parameters are changed by varying amounts due to geometric and practical limitations. The model is time integrated to simulate the conditions present in the experimental test rig. The maximum blade amplitudes are then compared to the baseline case and analyzed. The damping, followed by the forcing, is shown to cause the greatest impact on the final system response. This indicates a greater need to accurately measure the damping compared to other parameters.},

  abstract     = {Conventional bending-dominated lattices exhibit less specific stiffness compared to stretching-dominated lattices while showing high specific energy absorption capacity. This paper aims to improve the specific stiffness of bending-dominated lattices by introducing elementary-level programmed curvature through a multilevel hierarchical framework. The influence of curvature in the elementary beams is investigated here on the effective in-plane and out-of-plane elastic properties of lattice materials. The beamlike cell walls with out-of-plane curvature are modeled based on three-dimensional degenerated shell finite elements. Subsequently, the beam deflections are integrated with unit cell level mechanics in an efficient semi-analytical framework to obtain the lattice-level effective elastic moduli. The numerical results reveal that the effective in-plane elastic moduli of lattices with curved isotropic cell walls can be significantly improved without altering the lattice-level relative density, while the effective out-of-plane elastic properties reduce due to the introduction of curvature. To address this issue, we further propose laminated composite cell walls with out-of-plane curvature based on the three-dimensional degenerated shell elements, which can lead to holistic improvements in the in-plane and out-of-plane effective elastic properties. The proposed curved composite lattice materials would enhance the specific stiffness of bending-dominated lattices to a significant extent, while maintaining their conventional multifunctional advantages.},

  abstract     = {The converse flexoelectric effect can be utilized to actuate and control flexible structures. Assessing the precision flexoelectric actuation and control effectiveness of cylindrical shells is the main objective of this study. The application of voltage to the line electrode on the external surface of a flexoelectric patch, coupled with the bottom surface electrode layer, causes an inhomogeneous electric field to be generated, which consequently induces internal actuation stresses. The stress-induced membrane control force and bending control moment generate modal control effects, which regulate the cylindrical shell vibration. For an elastic cylindrical shell with flexoelectric actuation, the modal forces and microscopic behaviors are studied to evaluate the flexoelectric actuation effects. For the transverse direction, the electric field gradient drops sharply with increasing distance from the line electrode; thus, the induced internal actuation stresses concentrate on the upper surface. Due to the inhomogeneous electric field gradient distributions, the membrane control force and bending control moment concentrate like spikes. To evaluate the actuation effects, modal force distributions of the elastic cylindrical shell with flexoelectric actuation are analyzed with respect to design parameters, such as the flexoelectric patch thickness, line-electrode radius, cylindrical shell thickness, and shell radius.},

  abstract     = {The exergy analysis has already proved to be of interest for aerospace applications, with the possibility to analyze new types of configurations. It is of particular interest when a pertinent thrust/drag breakdown is not possible and when significant thermal exchanges take place in the control volume. In addition, this method allows to link the different contributions of the exergy terms to physical phenomena in the flow, improving the understanding of the sources of losses degrading the performance of the system under study. The applications and results obtained in a fixed frame of reference have thus motivated the improvement and extension of the exergy balance to more complex flows. This paper aims at presenting an extension of the exergy balance to rotating frames of reference for the analysis of rotating components of the propulsion system (e.g. propeller, turbomachine or helicopter rotor blades). The newly developed theoretical development is summarized, and an application to a numerical simulation of a propeller is presented. Results are discussed in terms of both physical interpretation and numerical accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The development of high-fidelity versatile incompressible Navier–Stokes solver that is applicable for both direct numerical simulations (DNSs) and linear global stability investigations is presented and discussed. The solver is based on a vorticity–velocity formulation of the Navier–Stokes equations for orthogonal curvilinear grids. A rigorous and efficient approach is proposed that guarantees the divergence-free condition for the velocity and vorticity fields. The code incorporates advanced numerical algorithms including compact finite differences in combination with a pseudo-spectral method, together with an efficient and high-order-accurate Poisson solver. Linear stability modules based on the linearized Navier–Stokes equations (LNSEs) tailored for primary and secondary instability analyses are developed and incorporated into the code, such that the solver can switch from DNS to LNSE in a consistent manner by turning off the nonlinear terms and vice versa. The linear framework includes all the nonparallel effects with respect to the steady/unsteady baseflow and the form of disturbances, and because it is formulated as an initial value problem, both convective and absolute/global instability mechanisms can be investigated. An additional significant advantage of the linear module is that, for the secondary stability analysis, time-periodic assumption is not required and/or the unsteady baseflow does not have to be computed a priori. In the present paper, results obtained with the new Navier–Stokes solver are compared with benchmark solutions for the flow past a static and oscillating circular cylinder. The new code then was employed for a three-dimensional DNS of the flow for a wing section with a modified NACA 6 series airfoil at a chord Reynolds number of . Furthermore, the capability of the linear stability modules was demonstrated by investigating the primary and secondary (convective and absolute) instability mechanisms for boundary layers and the flow past a circular cylinder.},

The model is validated with experimental LIF spectra computed from captured images of fluorescence from a gas cell filled with a known amount of NO. These data are obtained for several segments of the NO fluorescence spectrum. The selected segments encompass LIF lines with rotational quantum numbers appropriate for low-to-moderate temperature flows. The spectra obtained using the current model are also compared to those obtained from other theoretical models, namely, LIFBASE and LINUS. The current model is based on a previously developed version of a two-level fluorescence model and is developed specifically for applications in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) where rapid on-the-fly evaluations are required due to the potentially large number of grid cells for which LIF is being computed. Good agreement between the experimental and theoretical results provides confidence in current LIF modeling for use with CFD. An example application of the current model in a Mach 6.5 hypersonic mixing flowfield is also presented.},

The source amplitude in the model is calibrated using noise measurements for a freejet, and such a wave-packet source is used to predict noise of the same jet in an installed configuration using a tailored Green’s function. Results from the prediction model are compared to installed-jet experimental data for four different observer positions and a large range of frequencies. Overall, the model predicts both directivities and amplitudes similar to the experimental data, with a hump in the generated noise for lower Strouhal numbers and a clear peak near a Strouhal number of 0.2.

This extended tool, RANE v2, is developed as a part of multidisciplinary acoustic assessment of novel aircraft, in order to produce ground contours around airports and helipads. Version 2 extends the capability of RANE to accommodate predictions of future air vehicles implementing propulsion systems solution with inherent directional properties. The model uses three-dimensional noise emission surfaces around a series of discretized segments that represent the aircraft flightpath. The main inputs are the sources’ sound power level, the distance from the flightpath at which a level is observed, and the source three-dimensional directivity. The directivity function may take analytical or numerical form, allowing for experimental data inputs. This paper demonstrates the use of spherical harmonics as a form of directivity function with a closed-form analytical solution for calculating the noise exposure contours. Results and comparison against the Federal Aviation Administration’s Aviation Environmental Design Tool module for helicopter community noise indicate that exposure contour coordinates can be estimated for high and low noise exposure levels. The incorporation of source directivity allows for the assessment of lateral attenuation, engine installation effects, and transition operations (for vertical to horizontal flight and vice versa) via the assumption of individual source directivities and, therefore, complex noise surfaces. As a consequence of the analytical nature of the model, low computational requirements allow for fast exploration of the design space and parametric studies, with minimal input requirements. The capabilities of RANE v2 are demonstrated by predicting noise footprints for three helicopters, each of different size, performance, and directivity characteristics.},

However, conventional moving morphable components have three problems: lack of continuity between components, difficulty in describing a smooth rollup shape, and difficulty in generating a rigid joint to an optimized topology. In this study, a novel topology optimization framework was developed by introducing theories devised for multibody analysis. First, an adaptive moving morphable component based on absolute nodal coordinate formulation was proposed. Because both the position and gradient are used as design variables, continuity is ensured. Second, a position and gradient connection algorithm leveraging the linear constraint of the absolute nodal coordinate formulation was proposed to describe the smooth rollup shape. Third, a rigid joint was generated by introducing the gradient constraint equation in an optimizer. The developed framework exhibited superior convergence as compared with the conventional one in the benchmark short beam problem. It successfully generated an optimal topology with the intent of a designer (that is, designer-selected topology continuity and rigid joints), which facilitated the assembly and manufacturing of topologically optimized structural members to construct an entire aerospace structure.},

  abstract     = {For fans of a variable-cycle engine, a good aerodynamic performance over a wide range of rotating speeds is essential. However, when supersonic cascades designed for a high upstream Mach number operate under a low upstream Mach number, a starting problem may occur, which significantly decreases the aerodynamic performance of fan blades. As a result, the operating range of the supersonic cascades is severely limited. To solve the starting problem caused by the mismatch between geometry of supersonic cascades and upstream Mach number, a morphing supersonic cascade is developed. Thus, this study mainly focuses on the effect of the static deformation of supersonic cascades driven by smart materials on aerodynamic characteristics under a low upstream Mach number. To investigate this issue, numerous simulations are conducted on an S-type cascade by finite element method and computational fluid dynamics. As demonstrated by flow structure analysis, the morphing cascades are started under certain morphing configurations while the original cascade operates at nonstarted state. The results show that the deformation driven by smart materials alters the shock wave structures under a low upstream Mach number by adjusting key cascade geometric parameters. Specifically, the morphing cascades achieve 80\% reduction of detached shock loss compared with the original cascades.},

Traveling waves have been shown to perform better than standing waves, probably because they can use both mechanisms. However, the relative importance of the two mechanisms is not known. To differentiate between the mechanisms, a range of parameters (frequency, amplitude, and starting location) at stall (15 deg angle of attack) and poststall (20 deg angle of attack) is tested using wall-resolved large-eddy simulations with a sharp-interface curvilinear immersed boundary method at a low Reynolds number of over a NACA0018 airfoil. The results of the simulations demonstrate that the flow is reattached within a range of nondimensional frequencies, actuation amplitudes, and starting locations of oscillation at the stall and poststall angles of attack. Significant lift enhancement and drag reduction are also observed within these ranges. The nondimensional frequency range at which the flow is reattached is found to be similar to the dominant nondimensional frequencies of leading-edge vortex shedding of the unactuated airfoil. These indicate that the indirect transfer of momentum is the dominant mechanism because direct injection of momentum increases with the increase of amplitude and frequency; that is, separation should reduce as they increase. Nevertheless, direct injection of momentum improves the performance relative to pure excitations of standing waves when instabilities are triggered.},

However, the planar extent of the flat fluidic oscillators creates challenges when trying to optimally implement them in a confined geometry. The application of these new curved oscillators is experimentally investigated on the leading edge of an upswept NACA0018 airfoil full-span wing. Global load cell measurements of lift, drag, and pitching moment are presented and analyzed using suction surface static pressure taps, and particle image velocimetry data are presented. The effects of active flow control on lift, drag, and stall at a Reynolds number of 100,000 are documented for a variety of oscillator chordwise locations near the leading edge and compared to traditional vortex-generating jets. While further aft-positioned oscillators produced a larger increase in maximum lift, more forward locations resulted in better poststall performance and delayed flow separation over the wing.},

The transverse gust and the roll angle of the wing create an unsteady roll moment. The trailing edge actuators generate unbalanced lift increments on the two sides of the model to control the roll moment. Spatially distributed pressure sensors measure surface pressure on the suction side of the wing, and the real-time aerodynamic loads are estimated through models that are identified by the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics algorithm. The aerodynamic load estimation is then used as a surrogate to provide the AFC system with a feedback signal to alleviate the unsteady roll moment due to the gust effect. A physical interpretation of the model identification results is made to locate the source of the lift and roll moment fluctuations in gust encounters. Experimental results show that the AFC effect with a momentum coefficient input of 2\% is equivalent to 26° elevon deflection in terms of the roll moment change, and the AFC doubles the control authority relative to elevons. The real-time control results show that the pressure feedback control system reduces the mean roll moment error and suppresses the fluctuations to less than 20\% of the uncontrolled fluctuation level at a high angle of attack.},

To achieve these improvements over RANS, LES-appropriate grids and numerical discretizations are required. It was also found that, when applying HRLES to a RANS best practice grid and numerics, the HRLES method significantly underperformed RANS. For the in-tunnel configuration, HRLES showed good agreement with the loads, surface pressure, and oil-flow photographs obtained in the experiment. HRLES was able to improve upon the RANS simulations, which showed a sharp loss of lift at the two highest angles of attack due to large-scale inboard and outboard separation on the wing, by correctly predicting the corner flow separation and showing remarkably close agreement in the flow topologies with the experiment.},

This leads to a shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction, a separation bubble, and unsteady flow reattachment downstream. Tunnel boundary conditions are characterized, and mean surface pressure, mean skin friction, and both mean and fluctuating velocity fields are measured throughout the interaction region. Uncertainty estimates are provided for all measurements. The degree of flow axisymmetry and evidence of relaminarization are discussed, and a comparison is made to historical data.},

  abstract     = {This investigation examines the flowfield topology beneath the single fin-generated shockwave boundary-layer interaction as a function of shock interaction strength and incoming boundary-layer thickness. A systematic application of oil film interferometry produced an experimental reconstruction of global skin friction maps for various Mach number and fin angle combinations. To determine the effect of boundary-layer thickness, data from the current study were compared against existing experimental data sets with thinner incoming boundary layers. Results for identically matching flow/geometric conditions show a good agreement between trends seen across the conical region of the interaction and exhibit skin friction coefficient peaks in the same position. Cases corresponding to a relatively thicker boundary layer showed higher skin friction coefficient values along the interaction periphery and upstream regions. An angular scaling was applied to align the inviscid shocks of data sets that matched interaction strength, and the results show similar behavior. The peak skin friction coefficient shows a monotonic increase with increasing shock strength. Conversely, the upstream normalized peak skin friction coefficient depends on boundary-layer thickness and shock strength. These findings indicate that boundary-layer effects are limited to the interaction periphery, whereas viscous effects driven by shockwave–boundary-layer interactions dominate the interior region.},

A variety of experiments in their on-design and off-design states were performed in the hypersonic wind tunnel FD-07 of our institute, and computational fluid dynamics were employed to simulate flowfields as a supplement. According to the wind-tunnel tests and flow simulations, the aerodynamic forces and longitudinal stability were obtained and analyzed. The aerodynamic performance of the double-swept waverider did not fall significantly when deviating from the design states. The general trend was that, as Mach number increased, the lift-to-drag ratios dropped slightly. The double-swept waverider featured large longitudinal stability margin in hypersonic states, and the change in Mach number had little effect on longitudinal stability. Compared with the single configuration, the double-swept waverider suffered a decrease in lift-to-drag ratio, but showed a significant improvement in longitudinal stability.},

Comparison with available experimental data shows that RANS is capable of predicting the main features of hypersonic oblique SBLI, namely, typical size and distribution of the wall-surface pressure, and heat transfer. A large number of flow cases, at low and high Reynolds number , were computed to examine the scaling of the heat transfer over a wide range of wall temperatures. As expected, the interaction zone of hypersonic ramp-induced SBLI is reduced as the wall is cooled. A simple power law for heat transfer originally introduced by Back and Cuffel (AIAA Journal, Vol. 8, No. 10, 1970, pp. 1871–1873) is here considered to account for hypersonic ramp-induced SBLI, which is found to successfully collapse the data to the distributions obtained for supersonic, cold/hot interactions.},

To isolate core flow measurements from the shear flow surrounding it, optical flow-cutter arms were designed. Two sets of arms with differing optical path lengths were used to assess freestream spatial uniformity. This study consists of nine total experiments (“shots”) spanning four nominal conditions with reservoir enthalpy 8–21 MJ/kg and flow velocity 3.5–5.5 km/s. Freestream measurements generally imply thermal equilibrium of the rotational and vibrational temperatures except at lower-enthalpy conditions. We compare temperature measurements with predictions from five species air simulations and find reasonable agreement at lower-enthalpy conditions but underprediction of NO concentrations. At higher-enthalpy conditions, we observed transitory agreement in temperature but overprediction of NO concentrations. Measured and simulated velocity generally agree well across all conditions. Carbon monoxide, water, and potassium were also detected in the T5 flow, and their concentrations are reported where relevant.},

  abstract     = {Understanding boundary-layer flashback is critical to the design of safe and efficient gas turbines, especially as the addition of highly reactive hydrogen to these devices becomes a prevailing trend for reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. In this work, the boundary-layer flashback of lean hydrogen–air mixtures is studied using large-eddy simulations based on a generic turbulent swirl burner previously investigated experimentally. Simulations at increasing equivalence ratios are used to identify the flashback limits, showing reasonable qualitative agreement with experimental measurements. Flame dynamics during flashback are compared to previous experimental studies, indicating that important physics are captured in the simulations even if the exact flashback limits are not. In particular, a change in the swirl vane angle is shown to dramatically change the flame dynamics, with flame propagation occurring in the direction of swirl at high angles and against the direction of swirl at low angles, consistent with experimental observations. The near-wall nonreacting mean velocity field is shown to be controlled by a temporally stationary flow instability, which is directly responsible for the counterswirl flame flashback exhibited at low swirl angles. Finally, the interaction of local axial flow velocity and flame propagation speed of the leading flame point is investigated with varying swirl angles both before and after the onset of flashback, elucidating the differences in flame dynamics in all four of these cases. In particular, the importance of local flame extinction on flashback limits is emphasized.},

Here, the detonation propagation in hydrogen/oxygen/nitrogen mixtures with a single inert layer normal to the detonation propagation direction was investigated. Six hydrogen/oxygen/nitrogen mixtures with different amounts of nitrogen dilution and at different initial pressures were considered. The emphasis was placed on assessing the effects of nitrogen dilution and pressure on detonation across an inert layer. It was found that successful detonation reinitiation occurs only when the inert layer thickness is below some critical value. The detonation reinitiation process was analyzed. The interactions of transverse waves, the reactive–inert layer interface, and instabilities jointly induced local autoignition/explosions and detonation reinitiation. Counterintuitively, it was found that a thicker inert layer is required to quench a weaker detonation (with more nitrogen dilution or with lower-energy density at lower pressure). With the increase of nitrogen dilution or the decrease of initial pressure, the induction length and cell size of the detonation became larger, which unexpectedly resulted in the larger critical inert layer thickness.},

  abstract     = {The problem of scaling the near-wall mean velocity profiles of turbulent flows and collapsing them with the law of the wall has been traditionally studied using the conservation of momentum, by employing various levels of assumptions. In the van Driest transformation (“Turbulent Boundary Layer in Compressible Fluids,” Journal of the Aeronautical Sciences, Vol. 18, No. 3, 1951, pp. 145–216), the viscous stress was neglected, whereas in the Trettel and Larsson transformation (“Mean Velocity Scaling for Compressible Wall Turbulence with Heat Transfer,” Physics of Fluids, Vol. 28, No. 2, 2016, Paper 026102), the Reynolds stress was assumed to cancel out. Recent work by Griffin, Fu, and Moin (“Velocity Transformation for Compressible Wall-Bounded Turbulent Flows with and Without Heat Transfer,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 118, No. 34, 2021, Paper e2111144118) used a quasi-equilibrium assumption between turbulence production and dissipation in the log layer and demonstrated success for a wide variety of canonical flows. However, the extent of quasi-equilibrium is not verified, particularly for noncanonical flows. In this work, an alternate transformation is developed using the semilocal gradient of the van Driest transformed velocity, which is principally tied to the dynamics of vorticity transport in the boundary layer. In addition, a modified stress balance is utilized to directly account for and scale the buffer region. The transformation was benchmarked using a similar dataset as in Griffin et al., and comparable performance was obtained. Moreover, at supercritical pressures, the present transformation is found to produce significantly better collapse than existing works.},

The present work develops data-driven models for accurate density estimation of general fluids across all thermodynamic regimes. The model starts with the cubic equation of state, whose alpha function is calibrated in a data-driven manner with statistical correction accounting for inherent correlations among training data samples. The developed models are examined for the representative pure substances in aerospace propulsion systems, including oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbon fuels. Results show that the model with pressure and temperature as input variables provides consistently superior accuracy over wide ranges of temperatures and pressures, especially in the compressed-liquid region, where the Peng–Robinson equation of state significantly underperforms. The corresponding absolute average relative deviation for the studied substances is below 0.65\% at different pressures, compared to 7.16\% by the Peng–Robinson equation of state. The model is also extended to examine the density calculations of the selected binary and ternary mixtures, and the consistent result is obtained. The data-driven approach can be adopted to evaluate other thermodynamic properties of fluids and fluid mixtures and characteristics of vapor–liquid equilibrium, and further incorporated into large-scale multiphysics simulations where nonideal gas behavior occurs in the future.},

This paper shows an example of application of this selection method performing an accurate breakdown of the aerodynamic drag in viscous and wave contributions by a classical far-field method.

  abstract     = {Deep understanding of multiscale nonlinear phenomena, such as shocks, turbulent flow, and separation, is critical for the accurate and efficient treatment of high-speed fluid–structural interactions. To better characterize the principal issues, a numerical investigation is performed of the response of a Mach 2.0 flow to prescribed motion of a cantilever plate. The main features of the flow are separation at the end of the plate and re-attachment on the downstream floor, which are modulated by shear layer instabilities and interactions with the cavity beneath the plate. The influence of structural motions on the fluid dynamics is investigated through forced simple harmonic oscillations of the cantilever in three different dynamic modal states of a plate. The potential impact of flow resolution on energy transfer is assessed by comparing unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) and large-eddy simulation (LES). Spectral and modal analyses are conducted to baseline the multiscale dynamics of the rigid configuration, revealing low-frequency fluid dynamics on the order of typical structural response scales. First examined is the oscillation of the cantilever in the first streamwise bending mode at the same frequency as the baseline low-frequency fluid dynamics. Second, the flow response to two-dimensional structural oscillations is studied by forcing the cantilever in a combination of the first streamwise bending and first spanwise torsional modes. For these, the URANS method compares reasonably well with the LES result for asymptotic time-averaged flow features. However, the associated integrated aeroelastic forces are underpredicted by the URANS by approximately 15\% due to a longer separation length prediction. In the third motion, the potential for energy transfer through the broadband scales in the incoming boundary layer to high-frequency structural modes to the shear layer is examined by forcing the cantilever with a low-amplitude oscillation at a frequency on the order of the shear layer scales. This is observed as a mechanism to enhance the turbulence level of the shear layer scales and alter the time-averaged separation length. However, the mean integrated aeroelastic force is only marginally impacted for the amplitudes considered, with increases of 5\% or less.},

By increasing the Reynolds number, we observe that the structural oscillations, measured using a strain gauge, transition from low-amplitude chaotic oscillations to large-amplitude periodic oscillations associated with limit-cycle oscillations. We characterize the dynamic states of the system by constructing the weighted correlation network from the time series of strain and identifying the network properties that have the potential to be used as precursors for the onset of limit-cycle oscillations. Furthermore, we use Pearson correlation to illustrate the evolution of mutual statistical influence between the structural oscillations and the flowfield. We use this information and the Granger causality to identify the causal dependence between the structural oscillations and velocity fluctuations. By identifying the causal variable during each regime, we illustrate the directional dependence through a cause–effect relationship in this flow–structure interaction as it transitions to limit-cycle oscillations.},

  abstract     = {With the developments in computer-aided engineering, more complex and difficult simulations have become possible, and the demand for fluid/structure interaction (FSI) analysis has been increasing. Various approximation methods have been developed for pressure/load data mapping for FSI analysis. However, for most existing mapping algorithms, the sum of force/moment, which is one of the most important physical properties to be conserved, is not generally conserved. In this paper, we propose a new pressure mapping technique that is intuitive and easy to implement while algorithmically preserving force/moment for interfaces with complex and simple shapes. This technique distributes the pressure of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) boundary mesh as concentrated loads to the nodes of the nearest structural element. The load distribution from each CFD cell is assumed to satisfy a plane equation, and the mapping loads are obtained by solving the equations to determine the coefficients of the plane equation. Furthermore, an algorithm to search for neighboring structural nodes for load mapping has been developed for various situations. To verify the proposed method, a simple plate model, pipe model with internal flow, and full-scale aircraft model were used.

  abstract     = {Nonlinear aeroelastic limit-cycle oscillations (LCOs) have become an area of interest due to both detrimental effects on flying vehicles and use in renewable energy harvesting. Initial studies on the interaction between aeroelastic systems and incoming flow disturbances have shown that disturbances can have significant effects on LCO amplitude, with some cases resulting in spontaneous annihilation of the LCO. This paper explores this interaction through wind-tunnel experiments using a variable-frequency disturbance generator to produce flow disturbances at frequencies near the inherent LCO frequency of an aeroelastic system with pitching and heaving degrees of freedom. The results show that incoming disturbances produced at frequencies approaching the LCO frequency from below produce a cyclic growth-decay in LCO amplitude that resembles interference between multiple sine waves with slightly varying frequencies. An aeroelastic inverse technique is applied to the results to study the transfer of energy between the pitching and heaving degrees of freedom as well as the aerodynamic power moving into and out of the system. Finally, the growth-decay cycles are shown to both excite LCOs in an initially stationary wing and annihilate preexisting LCOs in the same wing by appropriately timing the initiation and termination of disturbance generator motion.},

However, conventional AOMA approaches apply the -means clustering algorithm (with ) to discern possibly physical and certainly mathematical modes. That is not totally appropriate due to the intrinsic tendency of -means to produce similarly sized clusters, as well as its limitation to approximately normally distributed variables. Hence, a novel approach, based on the density-based clustering algorithm Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), is introduced here. Among other technical advantages, this enables to automatically detect and remove outliers. A data-driven strategy for the DBSCAN parameter selection is proposed as well, to make the whole procedure fully automated. This methodology is then validated on a case of aeronautical interest, an Airbus Helicopter H135 bearingless main rotor blade, and compared to more classic strategies for the same case study.},

The motion equations of a dual-rotor system are presented by considering the intershaft bearing force with a local defect of the outer raceway and the maneuver load of a barrel-roll flight. The fourth-order Runge–Kutta method is employed to study the vibration responses of the dual-rotor system, which are reflected by the time history curves, the bearing contact force curves, and the Hilbert envelope spectra. It is shown that the rotor responses display impulse vibrations due to the defective intershaft bearing; and the corresponding Hilbert envelope spectra contain defect characteristic frequencies, multiple defect frequencies, side frequencies, and modulation frequencies. The results reveal the frequency modulation behavior of the impulse vibrations induced by the rotating speed ratio and the amplitude modulation behavior influenced by the maneuver load, the bearing defect span, and the rotating speed. Finally, defective intershaft bearing experiments under maneuvering flight are conducted, confirming the availability of the numerical vibration amplitude modulation and frequency modulation behavior. This analysis provides a theoretical foundation for bearing state detection during flight maneuvers.},

  abstract     = {The inverse finite element method (IFEM) is currently one of the most studied methods in the field of shape sensing, in other words, the reconstruction of the displacement field of a structure from discrete strain measures. The current research is still insufficient in applying IFEM to flexible structures undergoing large deformation that are in increasing demand, especially in terms of computational efficiency. Hence, an element-by-element IFEM approach based on absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) is developed in the paper. Taking the plane beam as the object, a class of gradient-deficient ANCF plane beam element is introduced to provide a concise nonlinear nodal displacement/strain relationship. Similar to IFEM, the inverse ANCF (IANCF) plane beam element is obtained in the form of least-square formulation, which means IANCF describes the deformation reconstruction problem as a nonlinear optimization problem. Because the computational complexity of solving nonlinear optimization problems increases rapidly with the increase of the number of decision variables, an element-by-element solution algorithm that solves each element relatively independently is adopted, and the explicit iterative formula is given by the Newton method. Besides, a curvature continuity constraint is introduced to improve the well-posed-ness of this problem and the smoothness of the reconstructed shape. Through numerical analysis, IANCF exhibits remarkable accuracy in various deformation degrees and its insensitivity to the weight factors inherited from IFEM. In the experiment conducted with surface-mounted distributed optical fiber sensors, the effectiveness of IANCF for practical structures is verified.},

  abstract     = {This research develops a highly effective deep-learning-based surrogate model that can provide the optimum topologies of 2D and 3D structures. In general, structural topology optimization requires plenty of computations because of a large number of finite element analyses to obtain optimal structural layouts by reducing the weight and satisfying the constraints. Therefore, many researchers have developed a deep-learning-based model using the initial static analysis results to predict the optimum designs. However, these studies still considered relatively simple example problems, such as a cantilever plate and MBB beam, even though they required a large number of data to achieve an accurate surrogate model for the simple application. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new framework, which 1) efficiently uses limited data by normalizing it and 2) employs a surrogate model capable of handling more practical cases, such as a 2D panel and 3D stiffened panel subjected to a distributed load, and can be used for local–global structural optimization. In all cases, the developed surrogate models can predict the optimum layouts with structural performance levels equal to those of the structures considered to be ground truths. Also, when the optimal structures were obtained using the proposed method, the total calculation time was reduced by 98\% as compared to conventional topology optimization once the convolutional neural network had been trained.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a decision-tree-based Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) for making optimal choices in the development of reduced-order finite element (FE) models, in our case, shell-solid multifidelity models. FE analysis is widely used to simulate the real-world response of complex engineering structures and requires a high level of expertise for making a priori modeling decisions. Many times, these decisions are quite subjective in nature and lead to significant analyst-to-analyst variability, which in turn leads to considerable differences in engineering solutions. An expert system that recommends optimal modeling choices would notably reduce such variability. Expert systems use a knowledge base, developed by a subject matter expert, which is not always easy for complex structures. This work assesses the potential of interpretable machine learning (decision trees) to create data-driven rules that could be used by a FIS to make modeling choices for a multifidelity T-joint model. Specifically, the FIS takes the structural geometry and desired accuracy as inputs and infers the optimal two-dimensional/three-dimensional topology distribution. Once developed, the FIS is able to provide real-time optimal choices along with interpretability that fosters analysts’ confidence. Potential improvements to the presented framework that can enable its application to complex and nonlinear problems are discussed.},

This paper investigates surrogate modeling options for problems with high-dimensionality in both the input and output spaces. Several methods for reducing the output dimension are investigated, namely, singular value decomposition (SVD), random projection, randomized SVD, and diffusion map; similarly, several methods for input dimension reduction are investigated, namely, variance-based sensitivity analysis and active subspace discovery. The most effective combination of options for input and output dimension reduction is identified in a systematic way, followed by the construction of Gaussian process surrogate models in the low-dimensional space. The prediction error in the original space includes both the reconstruction error and surrogate error; a systematic approach is developed to quantify and compare the relative contributions of the two types of errors. The proposed general, systematic approach of exploring available options is applied to an aircraft fuselage panel. The effectiveness of various dimension reduction techniques with surrogate model construction are investigated in terms of accuracy and computational effort.},

  abstract     = {Low-dimensional and computationally less-expensive reduced-order models (ROMs) have been widely used to capture the dominant behaviors of high-4dimensional systems. An ROM can be obtained, using the well-known proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), by projecting the full-order model to a subspace spanned by modal basis modes that are learned from experimental, simulated, or observational data, i.e., training data. However, the optimal basis can change with the parameter settings. When an ROM, constructed using the POD basis obtained from training data, is applied to new parameter settings, the model often lacks robustness against the change of parameters in design, control, and other real-time operation problems. This paper proposes to use regression trees on Grassmann manifold to learn the mapping between parameters and POD bases that span the low-dimensional subspaces onto which full-order models are projected. Motivated by the observation that a subspace spanned by a POD basis can be viewed as a point in the Grassmann manifold, we propose to grow a tree by repeatedly splitting the tree node to maximize the Riemannian distance between the two subspaces spanned by the predicted POD bases on the left and right daughter nodes. Five numerical examples are presented to comprehensively demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, and compare the proposed tree-based method to the existing interpolation method for POD basis and the use of global POD basis. The results show that the proposed tree-based method is capable of establishing the mapping between parameters and POD bases, and thus adapt ROMs for new parameters.},

To this end, in this study, three kriging models are sequentially constructed to realize the three aims, respectively. To further improve the efficiency of adaptively updating kriging model, adaptive radial-based importance sampling technique is embedded to divide the whole MCS candidate sampling pool (CSP) into several sub-CSPs. Then, the kriging model is updated sequentially in each sub-CSP instead of the whole CSP, and the samples dropped into the optimal hypersphere of the absolute safety domain can be truncated and do not participate in the CSP of updating the kriging model so that the size of whole MCS CSP and the size of CSP in each learning process of updating kriging are reduced simultaneously. As a result, the efficiency of estimating the fuzzy failure probability is enhanced. The results of two examples verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Boundary-layer control (BLC) of turbulent flows aims to compensate for mean frictional losses on a frozen configuration, while active flow control (AFC) seeks to alter the mean flow by exploiting instabilities. Since AFC performance is judged by the energy required to achieve a prescribed goal, it must be introduced into the aircraft design process at the early conceptual stages. For blowing applications, deciding whether to draw from engine bleed or install smaller compressors adjacent to the actuators is an important system-level consideration that requires the separation of the loss in the air supply system from the input that triggers and amplifies the exterior flow instabilities. The current paper exposes the inadequacy of the momentum coefficient that has primarily been used in the past to assess AFC efficacy and recommends two easily measurable fluid power coefficients to replace it. These enable direct comparisons of actuator efficiencies and system efficiencies, creating a link between the physics of flow control and system integration. This link is demonstrated first on a two-dimensional configuration that uses steady blowing, which is later extended to the use of sweeping jet actuators on a modular swept wing of finite aspect ratio.},

The role of the wake structure is particularly important for array deployments of oscillating foils since the unsteady wake highly influences the performance of downstream foils. This work explores 46 oscillating foil kinematics, with the goal of parameterizing the wake based on the input kinematic variables and grouping vortex wakes through image analysis of vorticity fields. A combination of a convolutional neural network with long short-term memory units is developed to classify the wakes into three classes. To fully verify the physical wake differences among foil kinematics, a convolutional autoencoder combined with -means++ clustering is used to reveal four wake patterns via an unsupervised method. Future work can use these patterns to predict the performance of foils placed in the wake and build optimal foil arrangements for tidal energy harvesting.},

The major bottleneck to assess the optimal design is the large number of time-consuming evaluations of high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models, necessary to capture the non-linear phenomena and discontinuities that occur at higher Mach number regimes. To address this limitation, we introduce an original non-myopic multifidelity Bayesian framework aimed at including expensive high-fidelity CFD simulations for the optimization of the aerodynamic design. Our scheme proposes a novel two-step lookahead policy to maximize the improvement of the solution quality considering the rewards of future steps, and combines it with utility functions informed by the fluid dynamic regime and the information extracted from data, to wisely select the aerodynamic model to interrogate. We validate the proposed framework for the case of a constrained drag coefficient optimization problem of a NACA 0012 airfoil, and compare the results to other popular multifidelity and single-fidelity optimization frameworks. The results suggest that our strategy outperforms the other approaches, allowing to significantly reduce the drag coefficient through a principled selection of limited evaluations of the high-fidelity CFD model.},

A modified linear theory for steady flow around a supersonic projectile is used to establish the accuracy of body-of-revolution approximation of a low-boom supersonic aircraft for undertrack sonic-boom analysis using computational fluid dynamics off-body pressure. As a result, designing a low-boom shape of the off-body pressure at three body lengths below the aircraft is equivalent to designing a low-boom shape. A Bezier curve with eight control points is used to define an target for inverse design optimization of of a supersonic aircraft. To make an target matchable by a low-boom supersonic aircraft, the target must have the minimal perceived level of decibels (PLdB) for sonic boom and satisfy two constraints defined by the cruise condition, effective length, and two nondimensional parameters. Numerical results are used to verify that, for different cruise conditions, all optimized targets with PLdB below 70 can be approximately generated by scaling one of them if the targets have the same nondimensional parameters and approximately the same effective length.},

The concept enables impedance control by the induction of, acoustically actuated, periodic bias flow through the facing sheet of the liner. By means of the periodic bias flow, the impedance of the liner is adapted to different grazing flow conditions. The equivalent fluid impedance model for perforated plates is modified to account for the effects of periodic bias and grazing flow. A generally applicable optimization routine, using the impedance of the lined surface as a boundary condition in a numeric calculation, is implemented. Based on the results of the optimization, a zero mass flow liner is manufactured and evaluated experimentally. The damping characteristics are assessed in the form of dissipated energy along the lined surface. Prediction and measurements show reasonable agreement. The zero mass flow liner delivers broadband dissipation of high peak value over a range of grazing flow Mach numbers. Under grazing flow, the effect of periodic bias flow is reduced. For a ratio of grazing to bias flow velocities larger than five, no appreciable effect is found. This poses considerable energy requirements on the actuation source for the application in high-Mach-number flow regimes.},

  abstract     = {An empirical closure model of rectangular twin jets’ screech and coupling has been developed to predict their coupling mode at a given flow condition. It builds on Powell’s original screech closure model (Powell, A., “On the Mechanism of Choked Jet Noise,” Proceedings of the Physical Society, Section B, Vol. 66, No. 12, 1953, pp. 1039–1056) of feedback waves produced by the interactions of large-scale structures (LSSs) with each shock cell. Powell’s work is expanded to include nonuniform shock-cell spacing, overexpanded flow regimes, and twin jet configurations. The feedback wave interference pattern strength at the nozzle exit is postulated to determine the realized coupling mode. The required empirical parameters are the shock-cell streamwise locations and the convective velocity of the LSSs. The model was validated using data from an experimental investigation of rectangular twin jets at overexpanded and underexpanded conditions. The coupling mode is correctly predicted for 11 of the 12 nozzle pressure ratios tested. Two datasets from the literature (Jeun et al., “Aeroacoustics of Twin Rectangular Jets Including Screech: Large-Eddy Simulations with Experimental Validation,” AIAA Journal, Vol. 60, No. 11, 2022, pp. 1–21 and Raman, G., and Taghavi, R., “Coupling of Twin Rectangular Supersonic Jets,” Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Vol. 354, Jan. 1998, pp. 123–146) were also examined, and the model made accurate predictions of the coupling mode for all seven reported cases. The response of the twin jets to flow control at various artificially imposed frequencies and excitation modes strongly supports the model predictions, highlighting their usefulness as a guide for the implementation of active flow control in twin jets.},

To identify key numerical requirements for obtaining physically realistic jet screech in rectangular nozzles, a detailed assessment of mesh resolution and the Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings (FW-H) surface design is performed. Sufficiently fine grids are required in the jet shear layers and jet potential core to obtain accurate shock cell positions and jet spreading. To save computational costs, the FW-H sampling surface can be placed fairly close to the jet turbulence. In the region containing the jet initial shear layers and the supersonic core, the sampling surface can be placed near the 5–10\% contour levels with respect to the maximum turbulent kinetic energy; and in regions further downstream, the sampling surface can be placed near the 20–25\% contour levels. The LES results match closely with experimental measurements in terms of flow velocity and near- and far-field acoustics. The broadband noise spectra calculated by LESs agree very well with the experiment between and . For the stronger screech case, LESs are able to capture the screech tones within 2–5 dB as microphone measurements; whereas for the weaker screech case, the screech tones from LESs are weaker than measured values.},

  abstract     = {A numerical study is conducted to understand the impact of an unsteady freestream on the aerodynamic performance of an oscillating airfoil. The unsteady flow environment is generated by placing a stationary inline circular cylinder array upstream of the oscillating airfoil. The dependence of thrust with variation of Reynolds numbers and Strouhal numbers is investigated, and it is revealed that the unsteady flow environment enhances thrust production of a pitching airfoil. This increased thrust production was related to an effective increase in the Reynolds number experienced by the airfoil. With airfoil–vortex interaction analysis, the increase in average thrust coefficient was shown to be caused by constructive interaction of freestream vortex structures and the oscillating airfoil. Drag-inducing interactions were also observed but were less common than thrust-increasing events, resulting in a higher average thrust. A simple scaling law is expanded to include the effects of unsteadiness, where thrust is found to be linearly dependent on turbulence intensity. It is demonstrated that the thrust generated by the pitching airfoil when operating in highly unsteady flow environments is more accurately represented as a function of Reynolds number, Strouhal number, and turbulence intensity.},

However, for mixed/trailing-edge stall, leading-edge suction tends to persist even when there is significant trailing-edge reversed flow and stall is underway, necessitating further investigation into the effectiveness of these criteria. Using wall-resolved large-eddy simulations and the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes method, we simulate one leading-edge stall and three mixed/trailing-edge stall cases at Reynolds numbers of and . We contrast the progression of flow features such as trailing-edge separation and vortex formation across different stall types and evaluate the stall-onset criteria relative to critical points in the flow. We find that the criteria nearly coincide with the instance of leading-edge suction collapse and are reached in advance of dynamic stall vortex formation and lift stall for all four cases.

Three-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes calculation with a Reynolds stress turbulence model is adopted to resolve the airflow. The impact of the AC-DBD plasma discharge on the airflow is modeled by an empirical body force model. The objective of this work is to characterize the separated flow over the rotating blades, resolve the flow control procedure, reveal the flow control mechanism, and evaluate the control authority. Compared with the experiment, the numerical simulation can provide satisfactory predictions of the baseline flow over the rotor for the qualitative flow pattern and quantitative aerodynamic features. The good agreement between the simulation and experiment lends credibility to the observations made from the numerical result. It is found that in the baseline flow, the flow separation occurs in the vicinity of the blade tips and exhibits strong three-dimensional characteristics under the influence of centrifugal force. The plasma excitation can significantly inhibit the flow separation over the blades at large angles of attack (AOAs). The flow control is seen to be dominated by the spanwise vortices induced by the plasma discharges, for which the strong entrainment effect makes the separated flow fully or partially reattach to the blade surfaces. The resulting forced flow pattern is influenced by the AOA of the blades. At each high AOA under consideration, the controlled flow is a significant improvement over the baseline case, and the aerodynamic characteristics of the rotor blades are appreciably enhanced.},

Performance was assessed using load-cell measurements and surface oil flow visualizations at a Reynolds number of 100,000. More inboard placement of the AFC produced higher values of , but further outboard placement resulted in a higher stall angle. With a momentum coefficient of only 2\%, lift was enhanced up to 15\% and stall was delayed up to 12°, depending on the AFC location. The number of jets used in the row was reduced, resulting in nearly the same performance benefits with half of the momentum coefficient required for the full row of jets. The performance enhancements of this active flow control technique are comparable to a passive boundary-layer fence without the 25\% increase in drag caused by the fence.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a flexible lattice variable sweptback wing (FLVSW) concept based on the flexible main beam and lattice that allows the sweptback angle to be varied by 80 deg. The whole FLVSW concept is an integral structure consisting of rigid and flexible parts. The rigid parts are the wing ribs that maintain the shape of the wing and transfer the aerodynamic loads. The flexible parts are mainly composed of the flexible main beam and the flexible lattice, which meet the requirements of supporting aerodynamic loads and deformation of the wing. The surface of the FLVSW is divided into parallel partitions by the wing ribs, and each partition is closed by superimposed skin strips. A prototype model was designed and manufactured based on the Talon first-person-view (FPV) platform performance parameters and considering the finite element analysis of the FLVSW concept under the effect of the drive mechanism and aerodynamic loads. Through testing the structural response of the manufactured prototype model under the driving and static deadweight loads, it was demonstrated that the structure could be driven smoothly and exhibited no deleterious deformations at various sweep angles. In this way, the feasibility of the FLVSW drive mechanism and the design process was verified.},

This paper presents a novel system identification method and a state-consistence enforcement (SCE) algorithm to generate a state-space aeroelastic (AE)-ROM within a broad flight parameter space. A new regularization term is proposed to modify the traditional autoregressive exogenous formulation and specifically penalize state inconsistence between ROMs at varying flight conditions. The new formulation cast in the form of the generalized Tikhonov regularization problem can be computed very efficiently and produce fundamentally state-consistent ROMs. Rigorous numerical analysis that compares the state-consistent AE-ROM with the full-order model and the ROM without SCE is also conducted. The results convincingly prove that the proposed approach significantly improves the state consistence of ROMs at varying flight conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this research represents the first effort of developing a state-consistent data-driven AE-ROM and enabling aeroelasticity analysis within a broad flight parameter space.},

  abstract     = {Ongoing work in air-vehicle design illustrates the potential of advanced concepts to provide significant improvements in efficiency; but with their incorporation of lightweight flexible structures, such configurations may require active control systems to ensure reliability and safety. However, many contemporary analysis methods are inefficient for aeroelastic analysis and design of such configurations. This paper describes the development of a new approach that automates the geometry setup, mesh generation, and assembly of fluid–structural coupling interfaces to enable efficient aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic analysis of advanced concepts. The core elements for this approach are a cut-cell Cartesian grid-based computational fluid dynamics solver, a nonlinear beam element structural model, a conservative fluid–structural interface treatment, and the formulation and implementation of a new deforming grid capability within the cut-cell Cartesian grid solver. Herein, emphasis is on this latter component with detailed description given of the mesh motion strategy, evaluation of fluxes and structural loads at the surface, and computation of geometrical properties such as cell volume, directed face areas, centroids, and motion-induced fluxes for deforming Cartesian grids required to advance the flow states. Aeroelastic simulations exercising the capability show favorable agreement with data and predictions in the literature for subsonic and supersonic applications.},

  abstract     = {This paper reports experimental results of fluid/structure interactions induced by shock impingement on a clamped-free/clamped-free compliant panel in a Mach 5.8 Ludwieg tube. A shock generator is used to statically impinge a shock on the panel with the aim of producing flow-induced vibrations. In turn, these vibrations create an aeroelastic coupling between the panel and the flowfield, which is dominated by the shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions. The influence of the structural compliance and shock impingement strength is assessed by testing a nominally rigid panel and compliant panels with thickness-to-length ratios of 0.0034 and 0.0068 with a shock generator at flow deflection angles of 0, 2, 3, 8, and 10 deg. One of the primary findings of the present work is that the aeroelastic response of the panel tends to shift from a structurally dominated to a fluid-dominated regime, which is sustained by either the freestream fluctuations or the fluid/structure coupling, depending on the structural compliance and shock impingement strength and location. This work is of fundamental nature, and its main goal is to analyze the interactions between high-speed flow and a thin compliant panel of canonical geometry. However, studies like this are crucial to characterize those complex couplings and provide experimental data that can help enhance the accuracy of aeroelastic modeling tools that feed into the design process of supersonic and hypersonic airframes.},

  abstract     = {Transonic buffet is commonly associated with self-sustained flow unsteadiness involving shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction over airfoils and wings. The phenomenon has been classified as either laminar or turbulent based on the state of the boundary layer immediately upstream of the shock foot, and distinct mechanisms for the two types have been suggested. The turbulent case is known to be associated with a global linear instability. Herein, large-eddy simulations are used for the first time to make direct comparisons of the two types by examining free- and forced-transition conditions. Corresponding simulations based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations for the forced-transition case are also performed for comparison with the scale-resolving approach and for linking the findings with existing literature. Coherent flow features are scrutinized using both data-based spectral proper orthogonal decomposition of the time-marched results and operator-based global linear stability and resolvent analyses within the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes framework. It is demonstrated that the essential dynamic features remain the same for the two buffet types (and for the two levels of the aerodynamic modeling hierarchy), suggesting that both types arise due to the same fundamental mechanism.},

Without a zigzag trip, the airfoil features a prominent laminar separation bubble on the suction side. First, a verification and validation study of the LES method is conducted for the zigzag trip at a roughness-height-based Reynolds number . The boundary-layer velocity profiles and the integral parameters are compared with experimental data acquired using a long-distance -particle image velocimetry setup in a wind tunnel. In the LES, if the zigzag tape is thick enough to trigger transition just behind the tape, the transition to turbulence is generally quicker than what was observed in the experiment. Although the general phenomenology and the development of the turbulent boundary layer after transition are consistent with the experimental data, there remain some differences in the exact length of the transitional region and also in the associated airfoil drag. A zigzag tape with or thicker induces transition quickly behind the trip through a shedding process of the shear layer created by the tape. The boundary layer behind the zigzag tape features prominent three-dimensional vortical structures emanating from the zigzags that persist over long chordwise distances and well into the turbulent boundary layer. Nevertheless, in a spanwise-averaged sense, the integral thicknesses of the newly created turbulent boundary layer are actually quite similar to a two-dimensional boundary-layer theory solution, given that the tape has a suitable thickness. In contrast, an overly thick tape will generate a thicker turbulent boundary layer, where the increased displacement and momentum loss are sustained and also contribute to total drag.},

Two types of machining flaw are modeled for the local deformation of microgrooves, i.e., chamfered and protruded ones. The effect of locally deformed microgrooves on the boundary-layer stability is studied by superposing the second-mode disturbance to the base flow of the boundary layer. The investigated unstable second mode is 400 kHz, and the microgrooves are installed in its synchronous region. The results show that compression and expansion waves are generated on the surface of the deformed microgrooves, and microscale separation bubbles are formed at the rear edge of the deformed microgrooves. With the increase of local deformation height of microgrooves, the suppression effect of the second-mode disturbance gradually increases. As the deformation height reaches 0.09 mm, the amplitude inhibition rate of locally deformed microgrooves on the second-mode disturbance reaches 44.7\%, compared to that of the regular one.},

The PIROM consists of a physics-based analytical component that represents the known physical processes and a data-driven dynamical component that represents the unknown physical processes. The PIROM is applied to the aerothermal load modeling for hypersonic aerothermoelastic (ATE) analysis and is found to accelerate the ATE simulations by two to three orders of magnitude while maintaining an accuracy comparable to high-fidelity solutions based on computational fluid dynamics. Moreover, the PIROM-based solver is benchmarked against the conventional proper-orthogonal decomposition/kriging surrogate model and is found to significantly outperform the accuracy, generalizability, and sampling efficiency of the latter in a wide range of operating conditions and in the presence of complex structural boundary conditions. Finally, the PIROM-based ATE solver is demonstrated by a parametric study on the effects of boundary conditions and rib supports on the ATE response of a compliant and heat-conducting panel structure. The results not only reveal the dramatic snapthrough behavior with respect to spring constraints of boundary conditions but also demonstrate the potential of the PIROM to facilitate the rapid and accurate design and optimization of multidisciplinary systems such as hypersonic structures.},

Flat optical windows installed in conformal test section walls enabled a double-pass arrangement of a collimated laser beam. The distortion of this beam was imaged by a high-speed Shack–Hartmann sensor using variable aperture sizes at a sampling rate of up to 1.75 MHz. Analysis is performed using two processing methods to extract the aero-optic distortion from the data: 1) a stitching method is applied to extract wavefronts without bias from a limited aperture size, and 2) a novel de-aliasing algorithm is proposed to extract convective-only deflection angle spectra and is demonstrated to correctly quantify the physical spectra even for relatively low sampling rates. Measurements of speed and size of large-scale convecting aero-optical structures are also presented. Overall levels of aero-optic distortions were estimated, and the results are compared with an existing theoretical model. It is shown that this model underpredicts the measured distortions regardless of the processing method used. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are presented. Finally, levels of the global streamwise jitter were estimated for different aperture sizes and compared with the results for the subsonic boundary layer. The results represent to-date the highest Mach number for which aero-optic boundary-layer distortion measurements are available.},

Specifically, the roles of added mass and pseudo-turbulent kinetic energy (PTKE) on the cratering process are investigated. The fluid-phase equations conform to the large-eddy simulation formulation, and the solid-phase equations are based on the kinetic theory. Azimuthally-averaged quantities and their root mean square are investigated to elucidate the roles of added mass and PTKE on the ejecta. Additionally, correlations are analyzed to determine the potential locations where the added mass or PTKE might be important. The momentum flux and solid particle kinetic energy flux are examined to understand how entities in the path of these ejecta may be affected, depending on the inclusion of the added-mass and PTKE models. Finally, joint probability density functions are evaluated for pairs of variables to better understand the relationships between them. The results show that neither the added mass nor the PTKE influence the crater shape and morphology, but the jet-to-ambient density and the ambient density influence the crater dynamics; these modeling features also influence the ejecta radial distribution, which is practically independent of the PTKE. Whereas the ejecta distribution is strongly correlated with the added mass, PTKE strongly affects the kinetic energy of the ejecta.},

A strategy of high-precision reconstructions of nonuniform heat flux and temperature field characteristics of a hypersonic vehicle surface by a scanning electron beam is constructed, and a fraction frequency and random scanning mode that can significantly reduce the temperature fluctuation of materials is proposed. The reconstruction effects in this scanning mode are successively investigated in the HIFiRE-5b flight condition and the reentry condition of the capsule of Apollo 6, showing that the reconstruction accuracies of the heat flux and temperature fields are within 2 and 5\%, respectively, and the temperature history is accurately reconstructed with an amplitude of temperature fluctuation below 11 K.

A basis function method for linear as well as geometrically nonlinear structural shape sensing is proposed in this study. Basis functions can be mode shapes, linear static deformation shapes, and/or geometrically nonlinear static deformation shapes. The proposed basis function method is validated using a high-aspect-ratio wing, a swept test plate, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration X-59 aircraft. A large structural deformation of a high-aspect-ratio wing is successfully captured using the proposed basis function method with less than 0.3\% prediction error at the wing-tip section. The basis function method gives excellent deformation prediction, even with stress concentration. Performance of the basis functions is compared using the X-59 stabilator sample case. In most of the sample load cases, static deformations give a better correlation with the target deformation than do mode shapes. Wing shape sensing with sparse strain data are also demonstrated in this study using the X-59 aircraft. Predicted structural deformations match reasonably with the target deformations, even without strain gauges on some structural components. The predicted deformations have a good match with the target deformations.},

  abstract     = {The launch mechanical environment presents a multi-axis random vibration excitation to the launch vehicles and spacecraft payloads. However, ground vibration testing of these systems abides by sequential, single-axis inputs, enveloping flight vibration levels along individual axes. The actual vibration direction depends on the excited mode shapes, and in general it is not precisely aligned with any given reference axis of the article. The response acceleration could be in any direction, with strong local variations expected, depending on both the properties of the structure of interest and the applied loads. In this paper, it is first shown that matching all response acceleration components due to a realistic environment by single-axis testing is, in general, impossible. Subsequently, minimum amplification factors for single axis to match realistic reference environments are quantified, such that both acceleration responses and elemental stresses were covered for the whole spacecraft in at least one of the uniaxial tests. This procedure was repeated for five different realistic spacecraft models. It was found that a consistent amplification factor and, respectively, overtesting, were necessary for the single-axis excitation sequence to properly validate the articles’ survivability against the true mechanical launch loads.},

However, for vehicles that mimic flying creatures through a flapping protocol, the deformation of the beams on the flapping wings is largely ignored. In this study, based on the elastokinetics method, theoretical models, including a simplified analytical solution, are built to determine the deformation and the kinematics of the flapping wing with beam flexibility. After verifying the models by finite element method simulations and experiments, the flapping kinematics of the wing under various wing conditions is resolved in detail. The analytical theory indicates that the system is fully regulated by two independent parameters. The first one describes the damping effect, which is the product of the driving amplitude and the damping ratio, whereas the second one describes the flexibility of the beam, which is the ratio of the driving angular velocity and the circular natural frequency of the beam. This simple analytical theory neatly captures the kinematics of the wing, which will help to evaluate the performance of the flapping wing with beam flexibility.},

The paper presents a detailed study of the similarities and differences between the classical beam and plate theories, which provides new insight into this classical problem. To perform the aeroelastic analysis, the three-dimensional Peters aerodynamic model is coupled with classical plate theory. This combination leads to a new simpler three-dimensional aeroelastic model that can reduce the computational time. The results have been evaluated using both the unpublished and highly cited experimental data. Interestingly, by performing both structural and aeroelastic analyses, a comment can be stated that, even for relatively low aspect ratios of thin rectangular cantilever plates, the model based on the beam theory is closer to the experimental model compared to the plate theory. This finding may be unexpected by many researchers. Also, using a novel approach, it has been shown that the most significant difference between the beam and plate theories results arises from a subtle difference in the displacement field, which has not been given attention so far.},

High-fidelity formulation of Klinkenberg permeability for TPS materials is intractable because unique parameters are needed at each temperature, for various gaseous species, and at every stage of decomposition of resin in the porous material. A supervised learning model based on support vector machine is developed to predict the permeability of TPS materials and is found to be a robust technique to capture the complex relationship between temperature, average pressure, porosity, and permeability of the material. The ability of different gaseous species to permeate through the material is captured through the supervised learning model by constructing an input variable called species identifier, which relates the molecular weight and viscosity of the gaseous species. The model is also extended to capture the permeability of the full composite, which includes both the fibers and the resin. It is demonstrated that the new model captures the nonlinear relationship between permeability and degree of char during the decomposition of the resin in the porous material. The supervised learning model of the physical simulations offers a robust approach for predicting permeability of porous materials in both continuum and noncontinuum flow regimes.},

  abstract     = {Adhesive bonding is widely adopted in aeronautic structures to join composite materials or to repair damaged substrates. However, one of the most common failure modes for this type of joint is debonding under fatigue loading. In the past years, it has been proven that deboning quantification is feasible, given that abundant experimental data are available. In this context, using domain adaptation to assist diagnostic tasks based on labeled data from similar structures or simulations would be thoroughly beneficial. However, most domain adaptation methods are designed for classifications and cannot efficiently address regressions. A fuzzy-set-based joint distribution adaptation for regression method has been developed by the authors, tackling regression problems but being limited to single outputs. The novelty presented in this paper exploits clustering techniques to approach multi-output problems, adopting a modified multikernel maximum mean discrepancy to improve the domain discrepancy metric. The proposed method is applied to cracked lap shear specimens to assist debonding quantification. Several domain adaptations are investigated: from simulations to experiments, and from one specimen to another, proving that the accuracy of damage quantification can be improved significantly in realistic environments. It is envisioned that the proposed approach could be integrated into fleet-level digital twins for nominally identical but heterogeneous systems.},

  abstract     = {Transonic buffet brings challenges to civil aircraft design, including but not limited to the structural fatigue and the handling quality degradation. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the transonic buffet of the supercritical airfoil and propose the buffet suppression strategy. This paper first employs the delayed detached-eddy simulation method to simulate the unsteady buffet process of the OAT15A supercritical airfoil. Then, the temporal–spatial characteristics of the flowfield and the separation region dynamics are analyzed based on the time-domain analysis method and the dynamic mode decomposition method. After that, different two-dimensional bumps are arranged in the shock motion region to suppress the shock oscillation, and the suppression mechanism and suppression strategy are studied. The results show that the process of the developed transonic buffet is significantly influenced by the merging of the front and the rear separation regions. In case the bump obstructs this confluence phenomenon, the developed transonic buffet can be suppressed. Furthermore, it is also found that a two-dimensional bump with superior buffet performance should have the following features: The bump should be placed after the shock-induced boundary-layer separation point to make the shock-induced boundary-layer separation bubble generate on the bump ramp. Also, the height of the bump should be carefully designed to prevent the front and rear separation regions from merging and to make the front separation region disappear quickly. Finally, this strategy is successfully applied to another supercritical airfoil to confirm the universality of the controlling strategy proposed.},

  abstract     = {Analysis and simulation of fluid–thermal–structure coupling play an essential role in hypersonic flight vehicle design. In this study, the spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) method is employed to establish the reduced-order model (ROM) for a hypersonic panel with a thermal protection system. First, the subsystem of the aerothermoelastic (AETI) system is modeled. Specifically, the aerodynamic heating is calculated with Eckert’s reference enthalpy method. The heat transfer is carried out with the finite difference method, and the aeroelastic equation is built by integrating the von Kármán plate theory and the third-order piston theory. Additionally, the two-way coupling between aerothermal and aeroelastic subsystems is used to construct the AETI system. Second, the optimal snapshots with the resultant local SPOD modes (SPOMs) are evaluated in terms of accuracy. Third, the global SPOMs for variable flight parameters are promoted to develop the robustness of the proposed SPOD/ROM. The findings indicate that taking the transient chaotic response as snapshots can produce global SPOMs. SPOD/ROM for the present AETI system improves the efficiency by 10–50 times compared to the classic Galerkin method. Moreover, the global SPOMs to variable Mach number and flight altitude are essentially the natural modes of the AETI panel, and thus are dependent on the temperature of the fluttering panel, which is our new finding in the present study. Overall, the current research will provide methods for accurately and efficiently predicting thermal loads, flutter boundary, and dynamic response for hypersonic flight vehicles.},

Effective real-time control of flexible structures relies on accurate and efficient predictions of both the unsteady aeroelastic forces and airfoil deformation. For rigid wings, classical unsteady aerodynamic models have recently been reformulated in state space for control and extended to include viscous effects. Here, we further extend this modeling framework to include the deformation of a flexible wing in addition to the quasi-steady, added mass, and unsteady viscous forces. We develop low-order linear models based on data from direct numerical simulations of flow past a flexible wing at a low Reynolds number. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these models to track aggressive maneuvers with model predictive control while constraining maximum wing deformation. This system identification approach provides an interpretable, accurate, and low-dimensional representation of an aeroelastic system that can aid in system and controller design for applications where transients play an important role.},

In these devices, ions generated from atmospheric air are accelerated by an electric field across two electrodes at different potentials, resulting in an ionic wind and a thrust force. It has been demonstrated that EAD is a feasible form of aircraft propulsion; however, substantial performance improvements are needed for practical applications. Here, multistaged ducted (MSD) EAD thrusters, which have the potential to provide higher thrust density than previously demonstrated, are proposed and modeled. An MSD thruster contains multiple sets of electrode pairs in series, enclosed in a duct and fitted with an inlet and a nozzle. One-dimensional momentum theory is combined with models for two limiting cases for the pressure generated by each stage: ideal one-dimensional EAD stages and wire-to-airfoil corona-discharge stages. The model evaluates how geometric and electrical parameters affect the performance of MSD thrusters under both sets of assumptions. If pressure losses per stage are kept small, the results show that MSD thrusters can provide order-of-magnitude improvements in thrust density and efficiency as compared to single-stage thrusters, potentially broadening the type of missions that can be performed by EAD thrusters.},

The experimental results showed that the breakdown voltage of Ar was significantly lower than that of in the micro-slit discharge, which indicated that the discharge breakdown channel was more likely to be generated. Thus, the addition of Ar to resulted in a lower breakdown voltage, and the discharge energy could be more distributed for decomposition. Spectral intensity analyses showed that, for mixture discharges, the presence of high-energy Ar excited states was clearly observed. With increasing discharge voltage, an increase in the light intensity of active components such as , O, and CO was observed. Combined with the discharge parameters and spectral characterization, it can be concluded that the metastable species of Ar exist and accumulate during the discharge, which contributes to the conversion of .},

  abstract     = {Orthogonal modes are an effective method for aerodynamic shape optimization due to their excellent design space compactness; however, all existing methods are generated from a database of representative geometry. Moreover, application to high-fidelity design spaces is not possible because high-frequency shape components are insufficiently bounded, leading to nonsmooth and oscillatory geometries. In this work, a new generic methodology for generating orthogonal shape modes is presented based on a purely geometric derivation, eliminating the need for geometric training data. The new method is a further development of the gradient-limiting method developed previously for constraining the design space in a geometrically meaningful way to reduce the effective degrees of freedom and improve optimization convergence rate and final result. Here, the gradient-limiting methodology is reformulated by transforming the constraints directly onto design variables to produce orthogonal shape modes with equivalent constraints for ensuring smooth and valid iterates. The new generic methodology requires no training data, can be applied to arbitrary topologies using different boundary conditions, and naturally includes translational modes as part of the orthogonal basis. When applied to two standard aerodynamic test cases, the new method has superior performance compared to library-derived modes. Importantly, the optimization convergence rate is independent of the number of design variables, and the optimized objective at high design fidelities is greatly improved by avoiding local minima corresponding to spurious geometries. A nonstandard test case is demonstrated, for which traditional library modes are not useable due to nontrivial topology, and it is shown to benefit from the high-fidelity design space and translational mode made possible with the novel methodology.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning surrogates for topology optimization must generalize well to a large variety of boundary conditions and volume fractions to serve as a stand-alone model. However, when analyzing design performance using physics-based analysis, many of the recently published methods suffer from low reliability, with a high percentage of the generated structures performing poorly. Disconnected regions of solid material between boundary conditions lead to unstable designs with significant outliers skewing the performance on test data. In this work, multi-head self-attention generative adversarial networks are introduced as a novel architecture for multiphysics topology optimization. This network contains multi-head attention mechanisms in high-dimensional feature spaces to learn the global dependencies of data (i.e., connectivity between boundary conditions). The model is demonstrated on design of coupled thermoelastic structures and its performance is evaluated with respect to the physics-based objective function used to generate training data. The proposed network achieves over a 36 times reduction in mean objective function error and an eight times reduction in volume fraction error compared to a baseline approach without attention mechanisms.},

Improving accuracy of the simulation of unsteady flows such as transonic buffet is one of the problems. Wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (WMLES) is expected to improve the accuracy. In this study, three quantitative requirements for the matching points, where LES feeds the wall model with flow variables, are proposed to ensure the accuracy of the WMLES with a second-order-accurate upwind scheme that is often used for engineering codes. These requirements are related to 1) matching point height, 2) the number of cells below the matching point, and 3) grid resolution at the matching point. The proposed requirements are assessed on a flat-plate turbulent boundary layer and a shock/turbulent boundary-layer interaction flow. As a result, it is clarified that all of the requirements are necessary to ensure the accuracy in terms of mean velocity, Reynolds stresses, and skin friction.},

Among these Reynolds-number effects, the difference in the development of momentum displacement thickness is focused on and further analyzed based on the integral relation of the boundary layer. This analysis reveals that the different mechanisms of the laminar–turbulent transition between the two Reynolds-number cases cause an initial difference in the momentum displacement thickness. This initial difference is then amplified downstream by the deceleration effects of the mean flow. These results suggest that proper estimation of the laminar and transitional flows near the leading edge is crucial for predicting the trailing-edge stall phenomena and their dependency on the Reynolds number.},

A spatio-temporal analysis of the PIV airwake measurements was conducted by applying the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to individual frequency bands of the airwake. Physical interpretations of the leading POD modes were substantiated by other complementary analyses. In particular, it was discovered that turbulent structures were shed from the funnel and superstructure edges. The flow recirculation region behind the superstructure exhibited a strongly three-dimensional bistable behavior. A pair of vortices near the stern also demonstrated low-frequency bistable dynamics.

It is a sprinkler whose Reynolds number is and nozzle exit diameter is , similar to injectors used for jet noise reduction studies at a reduced scale. A diffuse interface method is used to calculate the dense liquid phase, and the dispersed phase containing droplets is calculated with an Eulerian solver. Transfers between the dense and the dispersed phases are modeled in the coupling procedure, including the atomization and impingement processes. The jet mean radius and initial instability frequency are consistent with the experimental data, while the position of the jet transition varies with the fluctuation levels at the nozzle exit. The droplets are created in the shear layer and accumulate on the jet center when only the atomization process is considered. When also implemented, the impingement phenomenon, however, is shown to absorb the droplets before they reach the center.},

This paper is concerned with finding an optimal set of impedances allowing the greedy creation of a reduced basis that leads to the most accurate surrogate modeling in the least number of calls to the direct solver.

The performance of recently developed dynamic adapting subgrid length scales (, and ) and subgrid LES models ( and S3QR) separately and together is demonstrated.

The simulations are carried out on a set of refining meshes using two different scale-resolving numerical algorithms with basic and higher-accuracy schemes on unstructured meshes.

This study investigates the waveform transition due to ground effects using computational fluid dynamics analysis in a stratified atmosphere. The freestream Mach number at the cutoff altitude of 2 km is set to one. Computations are performed to analyze an N-wave over a horizontal rigid wall at four different altitudes of 2.4, 2.11, 1.8, and 1.5 km. The computational results show that a partly diffracted waveform with a spiked shape occurs when the wall is within the caustic region. When the wall is within the shadow zone, the reflected evanescent waves that propagate upward enhance the pressure fluctuation over a wide range, including the incident evanescent wave. Consequently, the pressure fluctuation within the shadow zone exceeds twice that without the wall. These results show that the ground effects are significant for evaluating focused sonic booms and evanescent waves.},

On this basis, the cold flow and combustion flowfields are analyzed; it is found that the mixing process is mainly dominated by a large-scale flow structure, and the prominent shock waves further enhance the mixing and combustion intensity. The whole combustion process exhibits multiscale characteristics in time and space, and the intermediate’s oxidation process determines the subsequent generation of end products and the primary heat release. The diffusion combustion and the scramjet mode dominate the main reactive zone: most of which satisfies the basic assumption of flamelet. The upstream recirculation zone acts as a hot reactive tank, which is a self-sustaining ignition source to shorten the ignition delay time and maintain flame stability.},

  abstract     = {A generic external-compression inlet model was tested to investigate the effect of duct height on terminal shock/boundary-layer interactions, with special sidewall arrangements to eliminate corner separations. Experimental results showed that the separation length significantly decreased by 41\% as the duct height was reduced from 60 mm to 40 mm . To obtain the influence of the duct height in a wider range of values, Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations were further performed. The scales of the -shock structure and separation region decrease as the duct height decreases. Shrinkage of the scale of the λ-shock structure results from a decrease in separation length. The downstream shift in the separation point and the upstream shift in the reattachment point both contribute to this decrease, but the upstream shift in the reattachment point is a dominant reason. The underlying mechanisms of the variation in the reattachment position as the duct height decreases include two aspects. The first is the stronger pressure gradient in the wall-normal direction immediately behind the shock system, which produces a stronger radial pressure gradient above the bumplike separation bubble, quickly turning the streamlines toward the bottom wall and enclosing the bubble. The second results from the postshock acceleration of the irrotational flow above the separated layer as the duct height decreases.

  abstract     = {The prediction of unstart boundaries of hypersonic inlets is significant to the engine control. To correct the previous conclusions based on the one-dimensional and inviscid flow assumption, the present paper numerically investigates the unstart characteristics of two-dimensional contraction ducts in viscous flow that vary with multiple controlling variables. Based on the newly defined dimensionless cowl length and effective internal contraction ratio, the similarity law of unstart is discovered. The universal empirical equation of unstart boundary for different cowl lengths, cowl lip heights, entrance boundary-layer thicknesses, unit Reynolds numbers, and Mach numbers is proposed, which can simplify the design of two-dimensional hypersonic inlets. With varying the dimensionless cowl length, three different types of short-cowl, transitional, and long-cowl unstarts are identified, owing to the different evolution mechanisms of separation region. The unstart displays a separation region growing under the streamwise pressure difference enhanced by the shock system or flow choke. In addition, the wall pressure criteria for unstart are correlated to the characteristic separation scale at unstart critical state and the dimensionless cowl length, which facilitates the unstart detection or early warning. It is observed that the Kantrowitz limit is close to the unstart boundaries for very short cowl and the isentropic limit is close to the unstart boundaries for very long cowl.},

The experiments were conducted in the High Enthalpy Shock Tunnel Göttingen at the German Aerospace Center on a 1100-mm-long, 7°-half-angle cone and a 602-mm-long flat plate at Mach 7.4. Roughness elements were applied on the nosetip of the cone and near the leading edge of the flat plate. The roughness elements were scanned with a laser profilometer, allowing their specification in terms of a roughness Reynolds number based on the 70th-percentile element height and an exceedance probability distribution. Transition was examined for the cone geometry using streamwise-aligned coaxial thermocouples on the 0° meridian. This assisted sizing the roughness elements required for transition to occur as far upstream as detectable. Breakdown of roughness-induced vortical structures generated by the roughness elements with a similar roughness Reynolds number was then examined using the flat plate geometry with temperature-sensitive paint applied downstream of the roughness elements. It was found that roughness-induced vortices required a finite distance (persistence length) to break down into turbulent structures. The persistence length was successfully reduced by interspersing roughness elements with smaller ones.},

Specifically, megahertz-rate nitric oxide planar laser-induced fluorescence (NO PLIF) imaging is done at 1 MHz to provide a non-path-integrated visualization of second-mode associated structures in the transitioning boundary layer. A recent variation of focused laser differential interferometry (FLDI), namely, linear array FLDI (LA-FLDI), is also applied for multipoint measurements of frequency content in the transitioning boundary layer. From each data set, the frequency of the most unstable second-mode instability is obtained along with the phase velocity of the second-mode waves. Measurements show good agreement relative to each other and also with surface pressure sensors and high-speed schlieren imaging. Furthermore, the 1 MHz NO PLIF imaging demonstrated here shows great potential for visualization of transitional and turbulent boundary layers when path-integrated diagnostics cannot be used.},

To fully characterize the boundary-layer response, a wide frequency range of the first and second instability modes is considered. The results show that the receptivity mechanisms for both instability modes are similar to those for a previously investigated sphere-nosed cone. Furthermore, the variation of the receptivity coefficient with the frequency is obtained. For the second mode, the nose effect on the receptivity coefficient is dependent on the forcing frequency; whereas for the first mode, the receptivity coefficient monotonously decreases with increasing bluntness. An empirical similarity parameter is identified to collapse the receptivity coefficient of the first mode for the cones investigated. Considering that the receptivity coefficient of the first mode is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of the second mode, the traditional method, which ignores receptivity, may underestimate the role of the first mode in causing transition.},

The terminal is provided with a dual stage pointing system, composed of a coarse pointing mechanism used to orient the optical head and a fast-steering mirror for the fine pointing of the received and transmitted lasers. The coarse pointing mechanism is based on the parallel platform configuration and alone can provide rms pointing accuracy when operating in conjunction with a beacon laser sent by a remote terminal and used for feedback. The control algorithm operates the two pointing stages synergically, targeting an overall pointing accuracy of rms while rejecting the disturbances coming from the satellite bus. The pointing system of the LaserCube flight model has been calibrated and experimentally verified in laboratory conditions that replicate real operational scenarios for what concerns the beacon signal attenuation and the disturbances generated by the host satellite. A dedicated setup was used to directly measure the pointing error and asses the system performance.},

Failure performance, weight, and packing efficiency are important factors that should be considered when designing pressure vessels. Often, lightweight pressure vessels maximize their volume for a given available space volume and withstand substantial internal pressure. Bend-free super ellipsoids of revolution, enabled by stiffness tailoring via variable-angle tow placement of composite plies, present an appealing solution that makes them possible candidates for future composite pressure vessels. To date, the bend-free design methodology for super ellipsoids of revolution has only been developed under uniform internal pressure loading. However, in reality, pressure vessels can also be subjected to thermal loads during service. Therefore, this study develops an initial bend-free design methodology for super ellipsoids of revolution that are subjected to both uniform internal pressure and thermal loads.},

In such cases, multifidelity models can be advantageous, as they leverage an abundance of inexpensive low-fidelity data in conjunction with high-fidelity training data to improve the model’s predictive accuracy. This study formulates a multifidelity reduced-order modeling method that uses nonlinear dimension reduction and Procrustes manifold alignment to project and transform data from disparate sources such that they lie in a common latent space. An initial feasibility assessment of the method is performed for emulating the flow over a two-dimensional transonic airfoil and a high-speed blunt body. It is observed that, for problems with high input space dimension and complex features, the predictive accuracy of the multifidelity nonlinear reduced-order models improves substantially over their linear counterparts. However, multifidelity linear models were superior to equivalent nonlinear models for smaller input space dimensions, which may provide a useful intuition for practitioners when constructing reduced-order models for their respective problems.},

The study begins with the analysis of the thermal radiations on an inflated membrane reflector in a geosynchronous orbit, and it gives the database of temperature distribution. Then, the mechanics model of the membrane reflector under thermal loads and distributed electric actuation is established based on the modal expansion of the Fourier–Bessel series to simulate its thermal deformations. Afterward, the group-control optimization based on the clustering algorithm and thermal-analysis data is performed to successively involve the various constraint conditions. With the proposed method, a unified control mode of the distributed actuation is derived to remove the necessity of online computation for almost all the extreme cases of thermal deformations of the reflector in orbit.

Three distinct approaches are developed: application of delay and sum to each block of the divided signals, followed by assembly of the outputs of the blocks; a cross-spectral matrix completion process; and a partial fields decomposition method. The last two approaches result in a unified cross-spectral matrix that facilitates deconvolution of the array output. The methodologies are applied to a synthetic noise source and to a supersonic underexpanded jet that presented the phenomenon of screech. Introduction of a single scanning sensor to a far-field array comprising 13 fixed sensors significantly improves the fidelity of beamforming.

  abstract     = {Global reliability sensitivity (GRS) index under fuzzy uncertainty is defined as the mean of the absolute difference between unconditional failure credibility and conditional failure credibility, which is important to quantify the effect of fuzzy inputs on failure credibility of the structure. The solution of this index requires nested analysis of conditional failure credibility and fuzzy mean, which introduces a large amount of computation. To efficiently estimate the GRS under fuzzy uncertainty, a method combining fuzzy simulation (FS) with fuzzy first-order and second moment (FS–FFOSM) method as well as a fuzzy sequential optimization and reliability assessment (FSORA) method are proposed. Compared with the direct double-loop FS method, in which both the conditional failure credibility and the fuzzy mean are estimated by FS, the proposed FS–FFOSM uses a more efficient FFOSM method to estimate the conditional failure credibility in the inner loop, which improves the computational efficiency of estimating GRS under fuzzy uncertainty. To further improve the computational efficiency, this paper also transforms the estimation of GRS into the solution of the optimization model under the constraint of failure credibility and establishes the FSORA method to solve the optimization model. The FSORA method uses a series of cycles of deterministic optimization and inverse design point analysis corresponding to the required fuzzy reliability index by GRS to reduce the iterations, and then the computational efficiency is further improved. Several examples illustrate the computational efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Blade mistuning in blisks arises primarily from the scatters of blade geometry profiles caused by manufacturing tolerance, in-service wear, blade repairs, etc. There is a recent trend to capture the blade-to-blade geometry variances through precise geometry measurements by a 3D optical scanning system in order to obtain an improved blade geometric mistuning evaluation capability. However, this usually leads to prohibitive computational costs due to the large-scale, high-fidelity industrial blisk finite element models. This paper develops an original model reduction approach, Sector Mode Assembling Reduction Technique (SMART), specifically for the high-fidelity blisk model fully mistuned by blade geometric variances, with either topologically compatible or incompatible blade meshes. The basic idea of SMART is to construct the sector-level reduction mode basis by strategically assembling the truncated cyclic modes independently computed for each “isolated” sector with assumed cyclic symmetry at the sector interfaces. Benefiting from the block structure of the SMART mode basis, the reduced-order models are derived by a series of sector-level projections with a relatively low memory requirement and computational cost. Another hidden benefit is that the SMART approach enables efficient structural modification predictions of the global blisk modes because only the modes of the sectors undergoing blade modification need to be re-evaluated and replaced in the SMART mode basis. The SMART approach is applied into a high-fidelity “as-measured model” of a blended blisk, constructed upon the geometry measurement by the state-of-the-art 3D optical scanning technology.

  abstract     = {Inevitable mistuning in cyclic bladed disk structures would cause vibration amplification phenomena that seriously reduce the reliability of the bladed disk. The ability to accurately and quickly predict the dynamic responses is critical to investigating the dynamic behavior of the mistuned system. However, it is still challenging because the mistuned responses are extremely sensitive to the random mistuning parameters. In this work, a novel mistuned system deep neural network model (MS-DNN) is presented to predict the dynamic responses of mistuned bladed disks through the mistuning parameters for both the lumped parameter model and the large-scale finite element (FE) model, which decouples the vibration equations of the mistuned system and uses a neural network to replace the coupling process. MS-DNN is divided into two levels, namely, the blade and the disk. The blade-level neural networks are used for forward and backward propagation of mistuning parameters in the different blades, and the disk-level neural network is used to replace the physical coupling process in the disk of multiple mistuning parameters from individual blades, with data transmission between the neural networks via blade–disk boundary nodes. The expected physical response of the blade tip is predicted through MS-DNN. All neural networks in MS-DNN show high prediction accuracy on both training sets and unknown test sets. For the FE model of the industrial bladed disk, the effect of the number of boundary nodes selected as the data interface between neural networks on the prediction accuracy is also investigated. The results show that, for unknown test data, the predicted response has an value of 0.998 versus the actual response with an amplification factor error of less than 0.388\%.},

  abstract     = {The acoustic energy balance of a sudden area expansion is known to be altered in the presence of a mean flow. In this work, Ronneberger’s quasi-steady model describing the acoustic response of a sudden area expansion sustaining a subsonic mean flow of arbitrary Mach number is revisited using the acoustic absorption coefficient, shown to be a function of the inlet Mach number , cross-sectional area ratio , and upstream acoustic reflection coefficient . These analytical predictions are tested using a two-step numerical strategy, whereby the mean flow variables are obtained using Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations and the fluctuating variables are computed using in-house linearized Navier–Stokes equations solvers. The agreement between the analytical model and the numerical results is found to be excellent for all geometries, mean flows, and acoustic boundary conditions investigated. The generation of acoustic energy by the flow expansion is observed analytically and numerically for high-Mach-number flows undergoing a slight sudden area increase for given acoustic boundary conditions. Conversely, it is found that substantial acoustic energy damping occurs across sudden area expansions characterized by a wide range of parameters . Moreover, entropy and vorticity fluctuations are found to be generated at the sudden area expansion, but entropy fluctuations are shown to have a negligible impact on the acoustic response of the area expansion at low and intermediate Mach numbers. Finally, the analytical model is found to be reasonably accurate up to Helmholtz numbers , corresponding to the frequency range of many industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {High-order spatial schemes, which effectively treat the dissipative characteristics of computational fluid dynamics solvers, are known to assure the precise prediction of rotorcraft aeroacoustics. However, such schemes may differ in numerical performance, even if they have the same theoretical accuracy. This is because the nonlinear part in a high-order spatial scheme locally reduces the order of accuracy depending on the grid number and flow characteristics. Therefore, it is necessary to compare each scheme in terms of local accuracy and to identify which numerical characteristics are required to retain high-order accuracy. In this study, a local-order-of-accuracy index (LAI) is newly proposed to quantitatively measure the accuracy of a spatial scheme. The LAI represents the local accuracy of each scheme, including the effect of the grid number and local flowfield characteristics. A comparative assessment of five high-order spatial schemes is conducted using the LAI analysis. The resulting LAI analysis indicates two requisites for an aeroacoustic prediction of rotorcraft performance: 1) an advanced shock-sensing mechanism in each scheme, and 2) hybrid central-upwind characteristics. Details of the LAI analysis results are presented, including practical rotorcraft applications.},

By virtue of reduced-order modeling, which is based on the single-point mean flow and turbulence statistics, all of these implementations use a number of empirical dimensionless source parameters for far-field noise spectra predictions. In comparison with the Tam and Auriault model, the Khavaran and GAA model implementations use several dimensionless parameters, which are available from previous literature and assumed to be more or less universal for a class of single-stream jets. These parameters include the fluctuating enthalpy function and the dimensionless amplitudes of autocovariances of turbulent fluctuating stresses and velocities available from the literature. The comparison of the three models is aimed at not only assessing their accuracy for a range of jet conditions, observer angles, and frequencies but also to examine their robustness outside of a reference jet experiment for which their source models were calibrated. For the input to each model, the mean flow, turbulence kinetic energy, and dissipation rate extracted from Large Eddy Simulations and Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solutions are considered.},

In fact, the validation of formulations and models for the flexible flight dynamics is indispensable to ensure that all the important phenomena are correctly captured. With this objective, two high-aspect-ratio flexible aircraft have been flight-tested, and coupled aeroelastic–flight dynamics data have been collected to support model validation. Additional ground vibration and static tests were carried out to fully characterize the structural dynamic properties. Numerical models were built based on a linear structural representation but with geometrically nonlinear aerodynamics. Low Reynolds number effects were included in a simplified way with lookup tables of two-dimensional airfoil data. Wing-tip effects were considered via the vortex- and doublet-lattice methods. Propulsive data were obtained with wind-tunnel tests. This paper describes the numerical models, the two aircraft, and their instrumentation and presents the data collected from the aircraft sensors during flight tests. Numerical and experimental results are compared for angular velocities, accelerations, and strains measured at different points of the aircraft. Despite its limitations and simplifications, the numerical model captures the real aircraft main aeroelastic and flight dynamic behaviors.},

The palliative properties of fluidic spoilers were investigated at Mach numbers of 0.85, 1.20, and 1.80 with blowing coefficients of 0.03 and 0.06. The results are presented for the acoustic spectrum, and further analysis was conducted using the Hilbert–Huang methodology. The fluidic spoilers were able to considerably reduce the overall level of acoustic noise and to reduce and/or suppress the resonant modes typical of cavity flows. The effectiveness of the spoilers was a direct consequence of their effect on the detached shear layer, of which the trajectory and coherence were altered. The Hilbert–Huang spectral analysis provided an enhanced understanding of the complex nature of the aeroacoustic behavior of the cavity. Acoustic modes were identified that, together with the Rossiter–Heller tones, governed the behavior of the spectrum. This demonstrated how the generated tones, appearing inside the cavity, were a result of complex nonlinear interactions between shear-layer acoustic instabilities and centrifugal instabilities originating in the flow recirculating in the internal part of the cavity. This also demonstrated that the fundamental frequencies had frequency and amplitude modulation characteristics that spread the energy in a wide bandwidth.

The competition between the effects of the spanwise length scale of the incident wake and the strength of the leading-edge vortices determined the optimal aspect ratio, which was found to be around four. Increasing the sweep angle decreased the mean lift due to the decreased two-dimensionality of the vortex formation. Airfoils with sharp leading edge produced the strongest leading-edge vortices but further away from the wing surface, resulting in lower maximum lift.

  abstract     = {Micro aerial vehicles flying at low speeds are becoming increasingly popular in military and daily life. Nevertheless, the short cruise time related to the poor aerodynamic efficiency of the wing at low Reynolds numbers is still a key issue. To deal with this, a spanwise plasma actuator array is used to reduce the zero-lift drag of a low-Reynolds-number airfoil, and experimental optimization of the electrical parameters is performed with intelligent algorithms. Results show that for efficient drag reduction, an unsteady unidirectional jet working mode should be preferred by the plasma actuator. In this mode, the drag reduction maps are mostly flat, and the drag reduction magnitude is insensitive to the variation of input voltage amplitude. There exists a threshold particle-observed Strouhal number (0.2) below which the drag reduction effectiveness drops sharply. As a comparison, the map of the power saving ratio shows a steep gradient, and its maximum always resides on the lower bound of duty cycle. With increasing freestream velocity, the mean drag reduction decreases monotonically. A genetic algorithm shows superior performance over surrogate-based optimization by reaching a maximum drag reduction of 40\% and a peak power saving ratio of 0.7. Particle image velocimetry results reveal that there exists a laminar separation bubble on the airfoil. With plasma actuation, the transition location is shifted upstream, and the separation region is eliminated significantly. At low speeds, this pressure drag reduction exceeds the friction drag increase, resulting in a net drag decrease. However, transition-induced drag variation can only explain part of the total drag reduction, and the rest is inferred to be turbulent friction drag reduction.},

  abstract     = {Airfoil dynamic stall in incompressible flow is characterized by two interacting viscous flow phenomena: time-varying trailing-edge separation and the shedding of intermittent leading-edge-vortex structures. In the current work, a physics based low-order method capable of modeling the interactions between the two flow phenomena is developed with the aim of predicting dynamic stall with only a few empirical tuning parameters. Large computational datasets are used to understand the flow physics of unsteady airfoils so as to augment an inviscid, unsteady airfoil theory to model the time-dependent viscous effects. The resulting model requires only three empirical coefficients for a given airfoil and Reynolds number, which could be obtained from a single moderate-pitch-rate unsteady motion for that airfoil/Reynolds number combination. Results from the low-order model are shown to compare excellently with computational and experimental solutions, in terms of both aerodynamic loads and flow-pattern predictions. In addition to formulating a method with limited empirical dependencies, the current research provides valuable insights into the flow physics of unsteady airfoils and their connection to rapidly predictable theoretical parameters.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes a combined experimental and computational effort to characterize the cycle-to-cycle variations previously observed in oscillating airfoil experiments. It is common in the dynamic stall community to assume that the variation in loads between pitch cycles is primarily due to turbulent fluctuations, which in turn justifies the assumption that the loads can be accurately represented using simple phase averages. However this work, which numerically and experimentally models an oscillating modified VR-12 airfoil at two different conditions, shows that various aspects ranging from model setup to inherent fluid dynamics may lead to furcation in the loads that can have first-order impacts on the flow. These clusters of loads are poorly represented by simple phase averaging techniques and require special consideration. This study successfully captures dynamic stall furcation using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and shows good agreement for cluster-averaged quantities when compared with experimental data. Furthermore, this work also presents several lessons learned concerning best practices for the dynamic stall community toward improving future correlations between CFD and experimental data and the quality of future dynamic stall datasets in general.},

  abstract     = {Large-eddy simulations (LES) are employed to investigate the pitch–plunge equivalence of an SD7003 airfoil undergoing constant ramp motions at Reynolds number . The equivalence is constructed based on the geometric effective angle of attack according to the quasi-steady thin-airfoil theory. Two rates of descent (or pitch up) are analyzed for different Mach numbers in order to investigate the effects of compressibility on the evolution of the dynamic stall vortex (DSV). During the onset of the DSV and its transport along the airfoil surface, remarkable similarities are found between pitch and plunge in terms of flow topology, aerodynamic loads, and signatures of wall pressure and friction coefficients. However, these flow similarities cease at high-load conditions as the DSV becomes more susceptible to the peculiarities of the airfoil motion, manifested here by different trailing-edge vortices. Employing a correction for the rotation-induced apparent camber effect present in the pitching case, which results from the quasi-steady thin-airfoil theory, improves the agreement between pitch and plunge. However, it is not sufficient to assimilate their disparate trailing-edge systems. Results also demonstrate that the limit angle at which pitch–plunge equivalence remains valid decreases for higher Mach numbers.},

Flowfield results and aerodynamic forces are obtained by solving the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations accompanied by a low-Reynolds-number modified-shear-stress transport model. Dynamic meshing combining a sliding mesh and Laplacian diffusion is developed to deal with the deformation of the computational grid due to the large-amplitude coupled pitching and morphing motion of the airfoil. The airfoil is subjected to stall-flutter analysis from an energy perspective by calculating the energy extracted by the airfoil from the freestream in an oscillation cycle. The flow control mechanism of the phase-offset trailing-edge morphing is analyzed in terms of the pressure distribution and moment contribution. The results suggest that trailing-edge motion with a phase of reduces the energy extraction by more than 300\% and could be effective for suppressing the stall-flutter limit-cycle oscillation amplitude in specific ranges of amplitude and frequency.},

A comparison between the two-dimensional airfoil buffet and the three-dimensional swept-wing buffet is made at pre-buffet and developed buffet flow conditions to shed further light on the distinct mechanisms that characterize the phenomena. We perform modal analysis using dynamic mode decomposition and compare the dominant modal shapes and time-space evolution of the wing’s full flow field to the airfoil. This allows to characterize their distinct dominant driving mechanisms. While the airfoil buffet involves a strong interaction between the shock wave and the separated boundary layer behind it, we show that the finite-wing buffet exhibits mainly spanwise traveling perturbations that induce only small chordwise shock travel, with only weak interaction between the shock wave and boundary layer. The finite-wing shock excursion distance is significantly smaller than the airfoil’s, while the average chordwise shock wave velocities are shown to be comparable, providing a physical explanation for the swept-wing buffet frequencies that are higher than those of an airfoil.},

For that purpose, an experimental setup was designed, manufactured, and integrated in the Trisonic Wind Tunnel Munich. The design consisted of a rigid, two-dimensional, supercritical airfoil (OAT15A) with optional pitching degree of freedom and variable torsional spring stiffness. High-speed background-oriented schlieren measurements were used to observe the shock with its dynamics, while a high-speed stereo camera setup for correlation-based deformation measurements was implemented to track the dynamics of the structural motion. Pre-buffet and buffet flows were analyzed by a continuous increase of the angle of attack. The detailed observation of the shock position with increasing angle of attack exhibited a clear effect of Mach number and pitch eigenfrequency on the buffet phenomenon. The corresponding onset boundary clearly shifted into the “pre-buffet” regime given specific structural settings. Furthermore, the resulting fluid–structure interaction of shock and coupled pitch–heave motion showed characteristics of structural frequency lock-in for the pitch-to-buffet frequency ratios of 1.2 and the mode veering region for ratios of 1 and 0.9, indicating the transition region from fluid mode flutter to structural mode flutter.},

This paper presents a detailed analysis of the wave characteristics in this simulation to provide a more quantitative understanding of the underlying factors leading to this discrepancy. The results show that weaker counter-rotating shock waves have a significant impact on the behavior of the primary detonation waves. The wave speed of the primary detonation wave is reduced by due to collisions with the counter-rotating waves. The presence of these counter-rotating waves also has a strong influence on the flow conditions upstream of the primary detonation waves, as well as the engine heat release rate. In addition, the flow properties upstream of the detonation wave vary significantly in the radial direction. Finally, the subfilter turbulent viscosity is shown to vary radially and with proximity to detonation waves.},

Results show repeatable detonations for hydrogen–air mixtures in both configurations; however, the detonative range is wider, stronger, and faster in the hollow configuration. Speeds exceeding the Chapman–Jouguet velocity and pressures matching the ideal model were observed. Sustained detonations for ethylene–air mixtures were not attained with the flow-through configuration. Installing a back plate to convert the configuration into a hollow combustor promoted rotating detonations with the ethylene–air mixture at select operating points.

During this process, the Mach number at the combustor entrance varied from 2.0 to 2.8, and a 14 deg wedge was installed at the isolator inlet as an incident shock simulator. A position-adjustable thin strut was used to optimize the ignition efficiency, and flame propagation was captured and reproduced using a visualization window mounted on the combustor side wall. The conclusions drawn from the study could reduce potential hazards for flight experiments. The simulation found that with the addition of the incident shock wave, the asymmetric shock wave system and the discontinuous acceleration regions were formed in the initial flowfield, which caused the relative position between the strut and wedge to have a significant effect on ignition. Experiments showed that when the two were mounted on the same side, the incident shock wave weakened the ignition conditions, preventing the formation of a global flame within the combustor. After changing the wedge installation direction and reducing the inlet Mach number, the effect of the flame characteristics affected by the incident shock wave was easier to capture. The flame kernel appeared at the strut tail, the combustion heat release area became more concentrated, and the flame development was accelerated. The results showed that the incident shock wave kept the flame oscillation frequency around 170 Hz, and the combustor pressure rise performance in the steady state was almost unchanged. Overall, the ignition delay of the combustor is increased, but the engine thrust is hardly affected by comparison with the ideal situation.},

These vortices resemble elongated streaks having alternate spanwise variations of the streamwise velocity. Downstream, the vortices “wobble” through an inviscid secondary instability mechanism and, ultimately, transition to turbulence. We formulate an optimal control algorithm to suppress the growth rate of the streamwise vortex system. Considering a high-Reynolds-number asymptotic framework, we reduce the full compressible Navier–Stokes equations to the nonlinear compressible boundary-region equations. We then implement the method of Lagrange multipliers via an appropriate transformation of the original constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained form to obtain the disturbance equations in the form of the adjoint compressible boundary-region equations (ACBREs) and corresponding optimality conditions. Numerical solutions of the ACBRE approach for high-supersonic and hypersonic flows reveal a significant reduction in the kinetic energy and wall shear stress for all considered configurations. We present contour plots to demonstrate the qualitative effect of increased control iterations. Our results indicate that the primary vortex instabilities gradually flatten in the spanwise direction thanks to the ACBRE algorithm.},

Those factors, except for the shock wave impingement, are heavily affected by the discrete film hole types and coolant Mach numbers.

However, when the leading edge of the sidewall is aligned with the duct entrance, an obvious increase in the bifurcation point height can be observed, and an increase in centerline separation can be inferred from schlieren photographs. The significantly intensified separation is verified directly by surface oil flow visualization. In addition, the focus previously present in the corner region is replaced by a reattachment node located near the junction region of the bottom plate and sidewall leading edge.

Several nonintrusive flow measurement techniques are employed to provide a thorough understanding of the intricate flowfield within these inlets at various operation conditions. The measurements include surface pressure, mean streak-line patterns, off-body velocity fields, and qualitative gas density fields. Together, these datasets provided a unique understanding of the flow evolution and load distribution within the inlet and isolator with and without application of an external backpressure. The facility effects on the inlet operation are also explored. Without appropriate boundary-layer conditioning, the wind-tunnel starting shock could not be swallowed by the inlet; this is termed a “failed start” operation. During the failed start operation the inlet flowfield and surface pressure field, even without external backpressure, exhibited strong similarities with an unstarted inlet. The failed start operation enabled a unique lens to the flowfield in the unstarted inlet throat that could not be otherwise obtained due to optical constraints.},

  abstract     = {High-Altitude Low-Orbit 3D (HALO3D) is a comprehensive multidisciplinary software system being developed by the current authors to simulate flowfields around hypersonic aircraft whose flightpath spans low (continuum) to high (rarefied) altitudes. This paper presents a methodology for coupling HALO3D’s particle-based rarefied flow module, HALO3D–Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (HALO3D-DSMC), with a solution-driven edge-based automatic mesh optimization algorithm, OptiGrid. The paper studies the choice of optimization scalars and constraints for DSMC solvers, an aspect believed to be currently lacking in the literature. Three optimization constraints are used: minimum and maximum edge lengths and a target number of nodes/cells. Mesh optimization is conducted for Bird’s leading-edge case and flows over two- and three-dimensional cylinder geometries for freestream Knudsen numbers ranging from 0.01 to 0.047. An adaptation scalar set combining flow variables such as density, velocity components, modal temperatures, pressure, and Mach number produces an unstructured collisional-sampling mesh that greatly improves the quality of the solution without necessarily increasing mesh size. The solutions represented by the optimal meshes are smooth and free of irregularities, with salient flow features being captured well. In addition, the coupled system can simulate complex geometries and multiscale flow features with arbitrarily generated initial grids.},
