  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the problem of remote state estimation of a Gauss–Markov process, where a sensor can, at each discrete time instant, transmit on one out of M different communication channels. A key difficulty of the situation at hand is that the channel statistics are unknown. We study the case where both learning of the channel reception probabilities and state estimation are carried out simultaneously. Methods for choosing the channels based on techniques for multi-armed bandits are presented, and shown to provide stability. Furthermore, we define the performance notion of estimation regret, and derive bounds on how it scales with time for the considered algorithms.},

Our aim is to determine the minimum number of sensors that, if removed, would render the system unobservable, and to determine the minimum number of state variables that need to be shielded from direct measurement by existing sensors to destroy system observability, both in numerical and structural (or structured) system models. The first problem is closely related to the capability of reconstructing a system&#39;s state uniquely under adversarial sensor attacks, while the second one has potential for the privacy-preserving design of dynamic systems. Both problems are in the opposite direction of the well-studied minimal controllability problems. We prove that all of these problems are NP-hard for both numerical and structural systems, even restricted to some special cases. Nevertheless, for the first problem, under a common practical assumption that the eigenvalue geometric multiplicities of numerical systems or the matching deficiencies of structural systems are bounded by a constant, we present a method to obtain the optimal solutions by traversing a subset of the feasible solutions, leveraging the rank-one update property of rank functions. Our method has polynomial time complexity in the system dimensions and the number of sensors under the addressed condition.},

The paper revisits this idea using tools from output regulation theory to develop a nonlinear enhancement of the notion of least squares moment matching and a unifying model reduction framework both for linear and nonlinear systems. The proposed framework allows for the direct computation of models through optimization, the use of weights to modulate the quality of approximation, and the possibility of enforcing prescribed properties, such as stability and passivity, via additional constraints. Parameterized families of models achieving least squares moment matching are also determined and shown to admit natural geometric and system-theoretic interpretations.

Its well-posedness is studied both in the autonomous and nonautonomous cases to determine when the dynamical equation admits a solution for the next state. Based on this analysis, the extension of the energy-shaping plus damping injection control methodology is discussed. At first, it is supposed that the control action depends on the discrete gradient of an energy function.

  abstract     = {Digital control systems are normally characterized by quantization. It is quite challenging to exploit the celebrated backstepping control design for nonlinear systems subject to mismatched parametric uncertainties, input/output quantization, and unknown sensor failures. A major difficulty is that the output of the concerned system after quantization becomes discontinuous, and thus, nondifferentiable. As a result, the traditional recursive backstepping design method becomes infeasible because differentiation of the virtual control signals in the backstepping design no longer exists, while the control design and stability analysis processes of existing backstepping-based quantized control methods are not applicable to the underlying problem. Furthermore, the concerned problem becomes even more challenging when more general types of quantizers and more general forms of sensor failure are taken into account. In this note, we propose a novel adaptive quantized output feedback control scheme to address those difficulties and challenges. First, a state observer is constructed to generate a continuous estimate of the state and output. Then, the estimated output signal is utilized to design the virtual control signal to ensure the existence of their first-order derivatives. Meanwhile, repeated differentiation of the virtual control signals in the backstepping design is avoided by adopting dynamic filtering techniques. It is shown that all signals in the resulting closed-loop system are uniformly bounded. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified and illustrated via simulation studies.},

Unlike finite-time and fixed-time synchronization, the time for synchronization can be prescribed as needed, which is independent of initial values and parameters, such as coupling matrix. At first, we define a class of regulatory functions whose improper integrals diverge, and it is proved to play a key role in PT stability for dynamical systems. Many special functions established previously for PT stability can be included in this class. Then, we apply this new result on MWDCNs as an application. The synchronization error at the PT is discussed carefully, so PT synchronization can be reached. The network topology can be directed and disconnected, which means that the outer coupling matrices (OCMs) can be asymmetric and not connected. The relationships between nodes are allowed to be cooperative or competitive, so elements in OCMs and inner coupling matrices (ICMs) can be positive or negative. We use the rearranging variables&#39; order technique to combine ICMs and OCMs together to get the sum matrices, which can make a bridge between multiweighted and single-weighted networks. Finally, simulations are presented to illustrate its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the event-triggered asymptotic tracking problem is considered for an uncertain linear system by using the model reference adaptive control approach. Different from the existing results, the control signal and the parameter estimator are event-triggered simultaneously for transmission, which brings difficulties in achieving the objective of both asymptotic stability and Zeno-free behavior. To overcome the difficulties, a novel dynamic event-triggered scheme is proposed, where the adaptive parameters coupled with a time-varying term are designed. With the proposed event-triggered adaptive controller, the achievement of the objective is ensured theoretically. Then by adding a constant to the novel event-triggered condition, a positive lower bound for all interevent intervals can be obtained. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The imitation rule has been considered as a fundamental rule in the field of evolutionary game theory, while the grid is treated as the most basic network and has been widely used in the research of spatial evolutionary games. However, current investigations of evolutionary games on grids mainly use simulations or approximation methods, whereas few strict analyses are carried out on 1-D grids. To the best of the authors&#39; knowledge, this article is the first to prove the convergence of the evolutionary prisoner&#39;s dilemma, the evolutionary snowdrift game, and the evolutionary stag hunt game with the imitation rule on the 2-D grid. Furthermore, this article studies the Minimum Agent Consensus Control (MACC) problem. It is demonstrated that for some evolutionary games on the toroidal grid, at least four fixed cooperation nodes are required to lead all nodes to reach cooperation almost surely.},

Moreover, the choice of the actuation/sensing scheme is discussed and adapted depending on the parameters of the plant in order to avoid the possible loss of controllability/observability property of certain eigenvalues of the underlying operator. This leads in certain cases to a multi-input–multi-output control design procedure. The adopted control strategy is finite dimensional and relies on spectral reduction methods. We derive sufficient conditions ensuring the local exponential stabilization of the plant. These control design constraints are shown to be feasible, provided the order of the controller is selected to be large enough, ensuring that the reported control design procedure is systematic.},

This article focuses on two issues related to the safety and security of discrete event systems, namely critical observability verification and enforcement of labeled Petri nets. First, given a bounded net, we verify its critical observability by using basis markings and solving some integer linear programming problems, thus avoiding the enumeration of the full state space of a net system. Moreover, for a noncritically observable net system, we obtain a feasible stop-free event set from a twin basis reachability graph such that a valid control policy can always be found, if the feasible stop-free event set is nonempty. Finally, according to the feasible stop-free event set, a set of disabled edges is generated, and an online control policy is developed based on the supervisory control theory, which guarantees that the closed-loop system is critically observable and deadlock free.},

In this article, to deal with this challenging problem, several crucial design ideas are proposed in developing the control scheme. First, to generate the continuous substitutes for the states, which are necessary in differentiating the virtual control signals in the backstepping design, we construct a state observer driven by intermittent and faulty output arising from output triggering and sensor faults. Second, to ensure the existence of the first derivative of the virtual control signal, we use the estimated output signal to design the virtual control signals. Third, to avoid the repeated differentiations of virtual control signals in backstepping design, we employ the idea of dynamic filtering technique. It is shown that all signals in the resulting closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded.

By applying multiple proximal splittings and derivative feedback techniques, a new distributed continuous-time multiproximal algorithm is developed, whose dynamics satisfies Lipschitz continuity even if the considered problem is nonsmooth. Compared with previous results that rely on either the differentiability or strong convexity of local objective functions, the proposed algorithm can be applied to more general functions, which are only convex and not necessarily smooth. Moreover, in contrast to some results that require some specific initial conditions, the developed algorithm is free of initialization. The convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is conducted by applying Lyapunov stability theory. It is shown that the states of all the agents achieve consensus at an optimal solution.

When the ${\mathcal {L}}_\infty$ norm and its induced norm are taken into account to characterize such uncertain systems, it has been shown that the necessary and sufficient condition for robust stability of such uncertain sampled-data systems is described through the supremum of the spectral radii of a certain nonnegative matrix defined on the sampling interval $[0,h)$ . However, a direct computation of the supremum for practical uncertain sampled-data systems is quite difficult since it intrinsically involves an infinite number of computations of spectral radii over the continuous-time domain $[0,h)$ . To solve this problem, we introduce a gridding approach, by which an upper bound, as well as a lower bound on the supremum of the spectral radii, is obtained. The upper and lower bounds also lead to a sufficient condition and a necessary condition for the stability of uncertain sampled-data systems, respectively. Furthermore, the gap between the original supremum of the spectral radii and the upper bound (as well as the lower bound) is shown to converge to 0 at the rate no smaller than $(1/M)^{1/n}$ , where $M$ is the gridding parameter and $n$ is the number of perturbation blocks in the structured model uncertainty. To put it another way, both the upper bound used in the sufficient condition and the lower bound taken in the necessary condition tend to the exact supremum of the spectral radii by taking $M$ larger. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the overall arguments.},

However, the time-varying system parameters increase the difficulty of the research on periodic system, such as stabilization and observation. This article aims to consider the observation problem of periodic systems by bridging two fundamental filtering algorithms for periodic systems with a sensor network: consensus-on-measurement-based distributed filtering (CMDF) and centralized Kalman filtering (CKF). First, one mild convergence condition based on uniformly collective observability is established for CMDF, under which the filtering performance of CMDF can be formulated as a symmetric periodic positive semidefinite solution to a discrete-time periodic Lyapunov equation. Then, the closed form of the performance gap between CMDF and CKF is presented in terms of the information fusion steps and the consensus weights of the network. Moreover, it is pointed out that the estimation error covariance of CMDF exponentially converges to the centralized one with the fusion steps tending to infinity. Altogether, these new results establish a concise and specific relationship between distributed and centralized filterings, and formulate the tradeoff between the communication cost and distributed filtering performance on periodic systems. Finally, the theoretical results are verified with numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a decentralized controller for a swarm of agents that generates hypotrochoidal and epitrochoidal curves in a 3-D space. The dynamics of the agents is modeled as a double integrator where the control input, i.e., the acceleration profile, contains two terms that account for the interactions between the agents in terms of position and velocity, respectively. The term related to the interaction between velocities is weighted by a skew-symmetric matrix responsible for coupling the velocities displacements. Such a matrix defines an axis of rotation centered on the centroid of the swarm, around which the swarm organizes itself to generate the desired trajectories, which can be selected by properly setting two free parameters of the model. In particular, the motion of each agent is analyzed by separating its dynamics along the rotation axis from that in the perpendicular plane. It is shown that the agents achieve consensus or periodic motion along the axis of rotation while performing the desired evolutions in the perpendicular plane. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the proposed framework.},

The agents are required to cooperatively track a desired leader&#39;s trajectory while always satisfying their local state and input constraints. Therefore, conflicting objectives may exist for an agent when the desired trajectory violates its local constraints. We propose to solve this problem using a control barrier function (CBF)-based approach. The cooperative tracking objective is encoded by a novel control Lyapunov function-based condition while the state and input constraints are handled by CBF-based constraints. For the relative degree two position constraint, two classes of CBF-based conditions are proposed based on high-order CBFs and a modified CBF design, respectively. It is proven that, with the modified CBF, there always exist feasible control inputs that satisfy all the CBF-based constraints. Then, unified quadratic programming-based controllers are formulated and the performances are analyzed. Simulation examples are provided to verify the obtained results.},

The mode information loss is described by a Bernoulli stochastic process. As a result, the system mode and controller mode form a special case of hidden Markov model. By means of an mode-dependent Lyapunov function, a sufficient condition is presented, which can guarantee that the closed-loop system is exponentially mean square stable with a certain $\mathcal {H}_\infty$ noise attenuation performance under the joint input–state constraint.

As a result, the transition matrix of the closed-loop system approximates such an operator semigroup that its infinitesimal generator exactly is the combination of the closed-loop subsystem matrices with respect to this stationary distribution.

The sufficient condition says that a system can achieve prescribed-time stabilization if its certain variant can be made globally bounded (on infinite-time interval). From the condition, one can know far more varieties of (uncertain nonlinear) systems can achieve prescribed-time control, rather than just special varieties in the related literature. The necessary condition states that a system can achieve prescribed-time stabilization attached global uniform boundedness (GUB) on finite-time interval only if it, by some feedback type, can achieve GUB on infinite-time interval. From the condition, or rather, its converse-negative version, one can see that what kind of systems cannot virtually achieve the prescribed-time stabilization attached GUB for some feedback type. The sufficient condition builds on two crucial transformations, which change prescribed-time convergence on finite-time interval into global boundedness on infinite-time interval. With the aid of the conditions and transformations, we conduct the synthesis of adaptive prescribed-time controllers for general uncertain nonlinear systems typically with unknown control directions. By integrating time-varying factors into Lyapunov functions, an adaptive smooth controller is devised such that the system states converge to zero before an arbitrarily prescribed time, while the controller and its dynamic gains are bounded.},

The various data-driven approaches can be classified as indirect (i.e., based on an identified model) versus direct or as robust (i.e., taking uncertainty into account) versus certainty-equivalence. Here, we show how to bridge these different formulations and propose a novel, direct, and regularized formulation. We start from indirect certainty-equivalence LQR, i.e., least-square identification of state-space matrices followed by a nominal model-based design, formalized as a bilevel program. We show how to transform this problem into a single-level, regularized, and direct data-driven control formulation, where the regularizer accounts for the least-square data fitting criterion. For this novel formulation, we carry out a robustness and performance analysis in presence of noisy data. In a numerical case study, we compare regularizers promoting either robustness or certainty-equivalence, and we demonstrate the remarkable performance when blending both of them.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the distributed moving-horizon estimation problem for linear discrete-time systems over wireless sensor networks. To reduce the communication burden, an event-triggered communication mechanism is proposed to govern the transmission of one-step predictions and measurements in each node. Under such a mechanism, a novel event-triggered distributed moving-horizon estimator is designed to deal with the state estimation problem subject to noise and state constraints. Each node computes its local state estimate by minimizing a cost function, which includes the event-triggered one-step predictions and measurements from the neighbors. It is proved that the developed distributed estimator is stable with the uniformly bounded estimation error in each node, provided by network connectivity, regional observability and small enough triggering parameters. A numerical simulation is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed estimation algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Average consensus is extensively used in distributed networks for computation and control, where all the agents constantly communicate with each other and update their states in order to reach an agreement. Under a general average consensus algorithm, information exchanged through wireless or wired communication networks could lead to the disclosure of sensitive and private information. In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving push-sum approach for directed networks that can protect the privacy of all agents while achieving average consensus simultaneously. Each node decomposes its initial state arbitrarily into two substates, and their average equals to the initial state, guaranteeing that the agent&#39;s state will converge to the accurate average consensus. Only one substate is exchanged by the node with its neighbors over time, and the other one is reserved. That is to say, only the exchanged substate would be visible to an adversary, preventing the initial state information from leakage. Different from the existing state-decomposition approach, which only applies to undirected graphs, our proposed approach is applicable to strongly connected digraphs. In addition, in direct contrast to offset-adding-based privacy-preserving push-sum algorithm, which is vulnerable to an external eavesdropper, our proposed approach can ensure privacy against both an honest-but-curious node and an external eavesdropper. A numerical simulation is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Starting from the passivity-based coordination design, the control goals are achieved via an internal controller for velocity tracking and heading control, and an external controller for formation in the port-Hamiltonian framework. This approach endows the resulting controller with a physical interpretation. To avoid unavailable velocity measurements or unreliable velocity estimations, we derive the distributed control law with only position measurements by introducing a dynamic extension. In addition, we prove that our approach is suitable not only for acyclic graphs but also for a class of nonacyclic graphs, namely, ring graphs.

In this article, a cooperation–competition evolutionary dynamic model is offered to explain the gradual evolution of the interaction relationship between neighboring nodes in signed networks. The core feature of our model is to portray the interaction relationship between neighboring nodes as a nonlinear function of the state difference, i.e., neighboring nodes cooperate with each other only if their state difference is within a limited range (called cooperation range ); otherwise, they antagonize with each other. We investigate the leader–follower dynamics, and present the lower bound of the convergence rate by using the infinity norm of products of substochastic matrices. For the leaderless dynamics, we establish algebraic conditions with respect to the state differences and the cooperation range for realizing consensus and polarization behaviors. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the evolution dynamics.},

Online, the real-time control law is searched as one, as per its region of attraction, in the lookup table when the estimated system state moves inside of the union.

Unexpected behavior is introduced into the transmitted signals by the integration of permutation matrices into the sensor and actuator channels. The permutation disrupts the stealthiness of an attacker and allows the detection of cyberattacks.

As a class of time constraints, PDT has been demonstrated to be more general and flexible than others like dwell-time or average dwell-time. Although time constraints are widely used in applications for safety and stability concerns, MPC of switched systems with time constraints often formulates a mixed-integer nonlinear program that cannot obtain the optimal solution in polynomial time, and thus suffers from the loss of recursive feasibility and stability. To address this problem, we propose several novel techniques: 1) the construction of the terminal sets based on two constraint admissible PDT contractive sets, 2) the introduction of PDT and historical constraints, 3) the use of two nonglobally optimal solutions, and 4) the prolonged prediction horizon. It is the first time that MPC approaches are applied to the co-optimization problem of switched systems under time constraints with guaranteed recursive feasibility and stability.},

We develop an iteratively regularized incremental gradient method where at each iteration, agents communicate over a directed cycle graph to update their solution iterates using their local information about the objective and the mapping. The proposed method is single-timescale in the sense that it does not involve any excessive hard-to-project computation per iteration. We derive nonasymptotic agent-wise convergence rates for the suboptimality of the global objective function and infeasibility of the VI constraints measured by a suitably defined dual gap function.

  abstract     = {This article considers the decentralized linear–quadratic–Gaussian control problem for discrete-time decentralized system controlled by two players. In this scenario, player 1 shares a unit delayed observations and control inputs with the controller of player 2, whereas due to the limiting capacity, the controller of player 1 cannot obtain the observations and control inputs of player 2, which leads to the asymmetric one-step delay information. It should be emphasized that this structure makes the classical separation principle fail. Under the assumption of linear control strategies, we derive the optimal estimators based on asymmetric information. In virtue of the Pontryagin&#39;s maximum principle, the optimal explicit decentralized controllers are obtained by solving the forward and backward stochastic difference equations. It is noted that the control gains are coupled with the estimation gains. Moreover, the estimation gains satisfy the forward Riccati equations and the control gains follow the backward Riccati equations, which cannot be solved simultaneously.

  abstract     = {This article focuses on dissipativity analysis and dissipativity-based sliding mode control (SMC) of discrete-time two-dimensional (2-D) systems described by Roesser model. First, dissipativity is introduced for 2-D systems. Aimed at the characteristics of Roesser model, the horizontal and vertical sliding surface functions are constructed for the addressed 2-D systems, respectively. Then, sufficient conditions are proposed to guarantee the asymptotic stability and the prespecified dissipativity for the resultant reduced-order 2-D sliding mode dynamics. Next, the SMC law is developed such that the system trajectories are driven into the quasi-sliding mode band in a finite region and maintained therein all the time. In order to achieve a better resource utilization, the event-triggered strategy is further incorporated in the design of SMC law. The event-triggered rule is also established to implement the event-triggered SMC scheme for 2-D systems. In the meantime, the corresponding quasi-sliding mode band is obtained. Finally, one verification example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed SMC design method.},

By further deducing the relationship between the obtained decay rate of switched systems and the weight of the switching walk, an optimized stability result is presented and a switching cycle strategy is designed to make the decay rate of switched systems larger. Furthermore, a novel graph-based mode-dependent dwell time method is proposed, which allows subsystems to be activated at any integer multiple of a constant value.

It has been recently established that a linear regulator with minimal order $(2q+1)$ exists under the knowledge of the positive or negative signs of i) $P(0)$ and ii) either $\Re (P(j\omega _{i}))$ or $\Im (P(j\omega _{i}))$ , for any $i=1,\ldots,q$ [ $j$ is the imaginary unit].

A novel shifting function is designed to make the initial tracking error arbitrarily bounded, which significantly relaxes the requirement on the initial tracking error. To achieve the objective that the tracking error does not exceed the constraint after the prespecified finite time, a barrier Lyapunov function and a new reduced-order observer are constructed by using the shifting function and the desired tracking signal. Based on the proposed dynamic gain approach, an event-triggered output feedback tracking controller is designed. It is proved that the developed control scheme guarantees that all the closed-loop signals are bounded and the tracking error constraint is strictly obeyed after a specified finite time. Compared with the celebrated backstepping method, the dynamic gain approach does not involve any virtual control variables, which avoids the complicated iterative procedure. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by an example.},

A probabilistic event-triggered mechanism (PETM) is proposed to relieve the communication burden by exploiting both the pattern variation of triggering thresholds and the time-varying characteristic of transmission delays. To characterize the actual control inputs, a stochastic actuator failure model (SAFM) is established using a random variable of any discrete-time distribution over [0, 1]. First, based on the PETM and SAFM, static output-feedback controllers are devised, which may not switch with the system synchronously. Then, novel sufficient conditions with less conservatism are obtained to achieve the extended dissipative finite-time control performance of the closed-loop system under admissible cyber-attacks and actuator failures. Furthermore, controller gains with nonconvex constraints are calculated with the aid of a newly proposed lemma.

A substantial bottleneck of all reachability algorithms is the necessity to adequately tune specific algorithm parameters, such as the time step size, which requires expert knowledge. In this work, we solve this issue with a fully automated reachability algorithm that tunes all algorithm parameters internally such that the reachable set enclosure respects a user-defined approximation error bound in terms of the Hausdorff distance to the exact reachable set. Moreover, this bound can be used to extract an inner approximation of the reachable set from the outer approximation using the Minkowski difference. Finally, we propose a novel verification algorithm that automatically refines the accuracy of the outer and inner approximations until specifications given by time-varying safe and unsafe sets can be verified or falsified. The numerical evaluation demonstrates that our verification algorithm successfully verifies or falsifies benchmarks from different domains without requiring manual tuning.},

However, it is an unresolved issue to construct scalable safety filters without assuming the availability of the disturbance set. In this article, we address this issue by proposing an efficient approach to implementing safety filters. In particular, we perform offline set membership identification to obtain a linear model that is conformant to a finite set of training data. Based on this conformant model, we compute a set-based safe backup controller with a corresponding safe set. Because a new measurement obtained online might invalidate the model conformance, we update the model, the safe backup controller, and the safe set online to restore formal safety guarantees. We use scalable reachability analysis and convex optimization algorithms to perform these updates as quickly as possible. We demonstrate the usefulness and scalability of our safety filter approach using four numerical examples from the literature.},

In total, two classes of nonlinear dynamic systems are considered, both of which are control affine. The first class of dynamic systems utilizes equilibrium points and a Lyapunov approach, whereas second class of nonlinear systems uses contraction theory. AC-RL controllers are proposed for both classes of systems and shown to lead to online policies that guarantee stability using a high-order tuner and accommodate parameteric uncertainties and magnitude limits on the input. In addition to establishing a stability guarantee with real-time control, the AC-RL controller is also shown to lead to parameter learning with persistent excitation for the first class of systems.

In the proposed two-layer scheme, a coordinator iteratively integrates possibly noisy and sporadic agents&#39; feedback to learn the pseudogradients of the agents and then design personalized incentives for them. On their side, the agents receive those personalized incentives, compute a solution to an extended game, and then return feedback measurements to the coordinator. In the stationary setting, our algorithm returns a Nash equilibrium in case the coordinator is endowed with standard learning policies while it returns a Nash equilibrium up to a constant, yet adjustable, error in the time-varying case. As a motivating application, we consider the ride-hailing service provided by several competing companies with mobility as a service orchestration, necessary to both handle competition among firms and avoid traffic congestion.},

  abstract     = {Empirical studies suggest a deep intertwining between opinion formation and decision-making processes, but these have been treated as separate problems in the study of dynamical models for social networks. In this article, we bridge the gap in the literature by proposing a novel coevolutionary model, in which each individual selects an action from a binary set and has an opinion on which action they prefer. Actions and opinions coevolve on a two-layer network. For homogeneous parameters, undirected networks, and under reasonable assumptions on the asynchronous updating mechanics, we prove that the coevolutionary dynamics is an ordinal potential game, enabling analysis via potential game theory. Specifically, we establish global convergence to the Nash equilibria of the game, proving that actions converge in a finite number of time steps, while opinions converge asymptotically. Next, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of, and convergence to, polarized equilibria, whereby the population splits into two communities, each selecting and supporting one of the actions. Finally, we use simulations to examine the social psychological phenomenon of pluralistic ignorance.},

To tackle this issue, in this article, a novel systematic and unified framework is established consisting of three key stability/attractivity results. First, the uniform global exponential stability for two dual cases of the nominal dynamics is analyzed in a unified way by checking the weak zero-state detectability from the limiting systems. Second, the uniform global exponential attractivity of the perturbed switched systems accommodating both first-order and zero-order time-varying perturbations is studied without resorting to any Lyapunov function for the entire perturbed switched systems. Third, the uniform global $\kappa$ -exponential stability for a class of cascaded switched systems is investigated. These stability/attractivity results together lay the foundation to thoroughly solve two kinds of typical certainty equivalence control problems, and also improve two specific cooperative control designs. Moreover, a relaxed dwell-time condition is considered, which makes the obtained results tolerable in the extreme case of instantaneous link failure and restoration.

  abstract     = {The multiagent rendezvous problem for single- and double-integrator agents in the presence of unknown constant input and communication delays is investigated in this article. Existing works address the rendezvous problem by incorporating negative gain(s) into the distributed consensus protocol and showing that negative gain(s) expands the reachable set beyond the initial configuration of the agents&#39; convex hull. On the contrary, the present control protocol ensures global reachability of a network of agents with a directed communication topology having nonnegative edge weights. This is accomplished with the help of a dynamic distributed control protocol, where the information exchange among agents occurs in the internal controller states. For homogeneous delays, the analytical expression of the rendezvous point confesses the nondependency of the point with delays, which in turn signifies that rendezvous can be achieved with unknown and arbitrarily large but bounded delays. The very structure of the control protocol ensures rendezvous at any desired point, even if the input delays are heterogeneous and unknown. However, heterogeneity in communication delays has an effect on the rendezvous point, and hence, global reachability of agents can be established if these delays are exactly known. For heterogeneous multiagent systems composed of single- and double-integrator agents, tuning of the design parameters gets simplified due to the single-integrator-based internal controller structure for all agents. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the robustness of the protocol against delays.},

The proposed scheme makes use of homothetic tubes along the prediction horizon for a robust treatment of parameteric uncertainty. Stochastic noise is handled by tightening constraints using the concept of probabilistic reachable sets (PRS), which are typically constructed offline by exploiting noise distribution information. In order to address the presence of additional parameteric uncertainty, we introduce a strategy for generating “robustified” PRS based only on the first and second moments of the noise sequence. In the case of quadratic cost functions, and under a further independent identically distributed assumption on the noise distribution, we also provide an average asymptotic performance bound for the l2-norm of the closed-loop state. Finally, the proposed approach is demonstrated in both an illustrative example, and for a building temperature control problem.},

This malfunction consists in some actuators producing uncontrolled and, thus, possibly undesirable inputs with their full actuation range. After such a malfunction, a system is deemed resilient if its target is still reachable despite these undesirable inputs. However, the malfunctioning system might be significantly slower to reach its target compared to its initial capabilities. To quantify this loss of performance, we introduce the notion of quantitative resilience as the maximal ratio over all targets of the minimal reach times for the initial and malfunctioning systems. Since quantitative resilience is then defined as four nested nonlinear optimization problems, we establish an efficient computation method for control systems with multiple integrators and nonsymmetric input sets. Relying on control theory and on two specific geometric results, we reduce the computation of quantitative resilience to a linear optimization problem. We illustrate our method on an octocopter.},

We first discuss an optimal algorithm based on Bellman&#39;s optimality equation that is exponential in the number of target states. Then, we tradeoff optimality for time complexity by presenting a suboptimal algorithm that is polynomial at each time step. We prove that the proposed algorithm generates optimal policies for certain classes of MDPs. Extending our procedure to the multiagent case, we propose a target partitioning algorithm that approximately minimizes the expected time to visit the targets. We prove that our algorithm generates optimal partitions for clustered target scenarios. We present the performance of our algorithms on random MDPs and gridworld environments inspired by ocean dynamics. We show that our algorithms are much faster than the optimal procedure and more optimal than the currently available heuristic.},

Different from most of existing works focusing on designing distributed algorithms, in this article, we analyze the convergence of a well-known distributed projected subgradient algorithm over time-varying general graph sequences, i.e., the weight matrices of the network are only required to be row stochastic instead of doubly stochastic. We first show that there may exist a graph sequence such that the algorithm is not convergent when the network switches freely within finitely many graphs. Then, to guarantee its convergence under any uniformly jointly strongly connected graph sequence, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition on the cost functions, i.e., the intersection of optimal solution sets to all local optimization problems is not empty. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that the algorithm is convergent for any periodically switching graph sequence, but the converged solution minimizes a weighted sum of local cost functions, where the weights depend on the Perron vectors of some product matrices of the underlying switching graphs. Finally, we consider a slightly broader class of quasi-periodically switching graph sequences, and show that the algorithm is convergent for any quasi-periodic graph sequence if and only if the network switches between only two graphs. This work helps us understand impacts of communication networks on the convergence of distributed algorithms, and complements existing results from a different viewpoint.},

On the contrary, the backup trajectory lies in the known space, and is intended to ensure safety and convergence. The cost function for the learning trajectory is divided into a tracking and an offset cost, while the cost function for the backup trajectory is only marginally considered and only penalizes the offset cost. We show that the proposed MPC scheme is not only able to safely explore the unknown constraints but also escape from local minima that may arise from the presence of obstacles. Moreover, we provide formal guarantees for convergence and recursive feasibility of the MPC scheme, as well as closed-loop constraint satisfaction.

We provide sufficient conditions for the closed-loop stability of the candidate policy in terms of the worst-case approximation error with respect to the baseline policy, and we show that these conditions can be checked by solving a mixed-integer quadratic program. In addition, we demonstrate that an outer and inner approximation of the stability region of the candidate policy can be computed by solving an MILP. The proposed framework is sufficiently general to accommodate a broad range of candidate policies including ReLU neural networks (NNs), optimal solution maps of parametric quadratic programs, and model predictive control (MPC) policies. We also present an open-source toolbox in Python based on the proposed framework, which allows for the easy verification of custom NN architectures and MPC formulations. We showcase the flexibility and reliability of our framework in the context of a dc–dc power converter case study and investigate its computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {For nonlinear systems with stochastic uncertainties and input delay, the existing control approaches based on the robust mechanism are generally conservative in most practical scenarios. Within this context, a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) scheme based on uncertainty contraction is proposed here to reduce conservativeness and improve real-time performance. In terms of the Lyapunov–Razumikhin theorem, a robust variational controller (RVC) is deduced as the primary controller for the variational dynamic with input delay. A variational vector field in Wasserstein metric space is constructed to detect the minimum geodesic between the uncertainty distribution and the desired one. Integrating RVC along the minimum geodesic, the modified auxiliary controller is developed for tracking the nominal trajectory with less conservatism. Subsequently, the chance constraints of stochastic states are transformed into the deterministic quantile constraints of nominal states. The sparse multidimensional Taylor network based on Bayesian compressive sensing is designed to parameterize the ambiguity set in Wasserstein metric space for higher computational efficiency. A tractable MPC scheme is then formulated to achieve the reference index with an improved tradeoff between robustness and real-time performance. The stochastic input-to-state stability of the considered system is verified theoretically by the Lyapunov–Krasovskii theorem. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is confirmed by a numerical simulation derived from a practical industrial process.},

  abstract     = {We provide a novel robust stability analysis for moving horizon estimation (MHE) using a Lyapunov function. In addition, we introduce linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to verify the necessary incremental input/output-to-state stability ( $\boldsymbol{\delta }$ -IOSS) detectability condition. We consider an MHE formulation with time-discounted quadratic objective for nonlinear systems admitting an exponential $\boldsymbol{\delta }$ -IOSS Lyapunov function. We show that with a suitable parameterization of the MHE objective, the $\boldsymbol{\delta }$ -IOSS Lyapunov function serves as an $\boldsymbol{M}$ -step Lyapunov function for MHE. Provided that the estimation horizon is chosen large enough, this directly implies exponential stability of MHE. The stability analysis is also applicable to full information estimation, where the restriction to exponential $\boldsymbol{\delta }$ -IOSS can be relaxed. Moreover, we provide simple LMI conditions to systematically derive $\boldsymbol{\delta }$ -IOSS Lyapunov functions, which allows us to easily verify $\boldsymbol{\delta }$ -IOSS for a large class of nonlinear detectable systems. This is useful in the context of MHE in general, since most of the existing nonlinear (robust) stability results for MHE depend on the system being $\boldsymbol{\delta }$ -IOSS (detectable). In combination, we thus provide a framework for designing MHE schemes with guaranteed robust exponential stability. The applicability of the proposed methods is demonstrated with a nonlinear chemical reactor process and a 12-state quadrotor model.},

Necessary and sufficient conditions for the observability of the decomposition elements are given, and based on the obtained conditions, an effective for designing the decomposition matrix is also proposed. Then, a polynomial-time secure state estimation strategy is constructed based on the proposed state decomposition technique.

  abstract     = {Phase-locked loops (PLLs) are nonlinear automatic control circuits widely used in telecommunications, computer architecture, gyroscopes, and other applications. One of the key problems of nonlinear analysis of PLL systems has been stated by Floyd M. Gardner as being “to define exactly any unique lock-in frequency.” The lock-in range concept describes the ability of PLLs to reacquire a locked state without cycle slipping and its calculation requires nonlinear analysis. This work analyzes a second-order type 2 PLL with a sinusoidal phase detector characteristic. Using the qualitative theory of dynamical systems and classical methods of control theory, we provide stability analysis and suggest analytical lower and upper estimates of the lock-in range based on the exact lock-in range formula for a second-order type 2 PLL with a triangular phase detector characteristic. Applying phase plane analysis, an asymptotic formula for the lock-in range, which refines the existing formula is obtained. The analytical formulas are compared with computer simulation and engineering estimates of the lock-in range. The comparison shows that engineering estimates can lead to cycle slipping in the corresponding PLL model and cannot provide a reliable solution for the Gardner problem, whereas the lower estimate presented in this article guarantees frequency reacquisition without cycle slipping for all parameters, which provides a solution to the Gardner problem.},

We then transform this problem to a form that enables distributed control-aware channel access. More specifically, we show that the control objective can be minimized without requiring information exchange between subsystems as long as the channel parameters are known. The objective is attained by adopting a priority-based deterministic channel access method and the stability of the system under the resulting scheme is analyzed. Next, we consider a practical scenario in which the channel parameters are unknown and adopt a learning method based on Bayesian inference, which is compatible with distributed implementation.

  abstract     = {The one-sided two-player zero-sum partially observable stochastic games (OTZ-POSG) have emerged as popular models recently, especially in the cyber-security literature. In this game, the state is hidden for one player but directly observed by the other player for whom we call the informed player. All existing OTZ-POSG models assumed that the observation space is discrete and the action of the informed player is private. However, these assumptions may become invalid in real applications. For example, for the virtual machine migration techniques in moving target defenses, the observed traffic data of a network are in a continuous space and the switching strategy of the defender can be inferred by the attacker. This article, therefore, proposes a continuous-observation OTZ-POSG with public actions and studies the existence of its equilibrium. The main challenge induced by the public action is the potential information leakage—the action of the informed player could reveal state information because his or her policy is state dependent. To solve this issue, we adopt a two-step belief update strategy for players and prove the existence of a Stackelberg equilibrium. We show that the game can be solved iteratively through value iteration. However, calculating the exact value function is impractical as the observation space is continuous. To mitigate the computational complexity issue, we propose a point-based approximation algorithm to approximate the exact value function and meanwhile extend the dynamic partitioning approach to discretize the observation space into finite discrete partitions. We show that the value function of the leader can be approximated by a piece-wise linear and concave function with an error bound. Finally, examples are used in each section to illustrate ideas of the proposed algorithms.},

This article develops such a general framework for distributing the execution of (centralized) iterative algorithms over networks in which the required information or data is partitioned between the nodes in the network. This article furthermore shows that the distributed iterative algorithm, which results from the proposed framework, retains the convergence properties (rate) of the original (centralized) iterative algorithm. In addition, this article applies the proposed general framework to several interesting example applications, obtaining results comparable to the state of the art for each such example, while greatly simplifying and generalizing their convergence analysis. These example applications reveal new results for distributed proximal versions of gradient descent, the heavy ball method, and Newton&#39;s method. For example, these results show that the dependence on the condition number for the convergence rate of this distributed heavy ball method is at least as good as that of centralized gradient descent.},

We propose a partitioning strategy for the set of possible attacks that generates a finite collection of candidate defenses such that, for each member of the partition, there is a defense that stabilizes the system with respect to all static attack signals belonging to it. The defender then implements a mechanism that switches among the candidate defenses based on the evaluation of a Lyapunov-based criterion that determines whether the current defense is stabilizing. We characterize the properties of the switched time-varying system with delay, the latter arising from the interval between the switch-triggering events and their actual implementation. Our analysis provides a tolerance on the implementation delay that prevents the defense signal from constantly switching. In addition, we also identify a condition on the switching frequency that ensures global exponential stability. Simulations of the proposed switched defense mechanism illustrate its performance and advantages over static defenses.},

  abstract     = {In this article, observable stochastic graphs and detetectable stochastic graphs are, respectively, defined with the detailed implementation for the observability and detectability of stochastic discrete-time and discrete-state dynamic systems. More specifically, they are generally two classes of vertex-colored and edge-labeled graphs rendering a walking agent therein to determine his initial and current positions, respectively, in probability one by measuring the color sequence of his traversed vertices. In the part of analysis, we follow the aforementioned two definitions and establish the corresponding polynomial-time verifying algorithms. Notably, the implicit formulas are also established to calculate the observability and detectability probability for any pairwise vertex pair. In the synthesis part, the minimal number of colors dyeing the vertices to make the considered graph stochastically observable and detectable is investigated, respectively. Our results indicate that the minimal coloring problem is NP-hard for observability in the stochastic situations but is solvable in polynomial time for detectability in the deterministic cases. The observability and detectability of stochastic finite-valued systems, assembling with the finite-cardinal state spaces, are validated as a compelling application of these two types of directed graphs, whereas the minimal sensors placement problems subject to observability and detectability problems are accordingly interpreted by the minimum set cover algorithm.},

Observation consistency and local observation consistency were identified as such conditions. To preserve normality, only observation consistency is required. Although observation consistency preserves normality between the levels for normal specifications, for specifications that are not normal, observation consistency is insufficient to guarantee that the supremal normal sublanguage computed on the low level and on the high level coincide. We define modified observation consistency, under which the supremal normal sublanguages of different levels coincide. We show that the verification of (modified) observation consistency is PSpace -hard for finite automata and undecidable for slightly more expressive models than finite automata. Decidability of (modified) observation consistency is an open problem. Hence we further discuss two stronger conditions that are easy to verify. Finally, we illustrate the conditions on an example of a railroad controller and on a case study of a part of an MRI scanner.},

More specifically, we construct transfer functions with a full-rank input process formed from selected components of the given vector process and having a vector process of the remaining components as output. An important question, which we answer in the negative, is whether it is always possible to find such a deterministic relation that is stable. If it is unstable, there must be feedback from output to input ensuring that stationarity is maintained. This leads to connections to robust control. We also show how our results could be used to investigate the structure of dynamic network models and the latent low-rank stochastic process in a dynamic factor model.},

These effective techniques, including the Kharitonov stability theorem, the Routh stability criterion, and the robust stability margin, have led to the following new results: first, the direct link between the convergence rate and the control parameters; second, explicit formulas of the optimal convergence rate and the corresponding optimal control parameters for $M \leq 2$ on a given graph; third, analytic formulas of the optimal worst-case convergence rate and the corresponding optimal control parameters for the memory $M \geq 1$ on a set of uncertain graphs.

The proposed framework enjoys the interconnection matrix and joint dissipativity-type properties of subsystems, described by the notion of stochastic storage certificates . In the first part of the paper, we cast the required conditions for constructing storage certificates as a robust optimization program (ROP). Since the proposed ROP is not tractable due to the unknown model appearing in one of its constraints, we propose a scenario optimization program (SOP) corresponding to the original ROP by collecting finite numbers of data from trajectories of each subsystem. By establishing a probabilistic relation between the optimal value of SOP and that of ROP, we construct a storage certificate for each unknown subsystem based on the number of data and a required level of confidence. We accordingly propose a compositional technique based on dissipativity reasoning to construct stochastic barrier certificates of interconnected systems based on storage certificates of individual subsystems. By leveraging the acquired barrier certificate, we quantify a lower bound on the probability that an interconnected system never reaches a certain unsafe region in finite-time horizons with an a-priori guaranteed confidence. We also propose an auxiliary compositional approach without requiring any compositionality condition but at the cost of providing a potentially conservative safety guarantee. In the second part of the paper, we propose our approaches for deterministic continuous-time systems with unknown dynamics. We verify our results over an unknown room temperature network containing 100 rooms.},

Although many promising results have been achieved, their theoretical analysis is far from complete and there are still many key problems to be solved. One of them is the asymptotic theory, which is about convergence properties of the model estimators as the sample size goes to infinity. The existing related results for regularized system identification are about the almost sure convergence of various hyperparameter estimators. A common problem of those results is that they do not contain information on the factors that affect the convergence properties of those hyperparameter estimators, e.g., the regression matrix. In this article, we tackle problems of this kind for the regularized finite impulse response model estimation with the empirical Bayes (EB) hyperparameter estimator and filtered white noise input. In order to expose and find those factors, we study the convergence in distribution of the EB hyperparameter estimator, and the asymptotic distribution of its corresponding model estimator. For illustration, we run Monte Carlo simulations to show the efficacy of our obtained theoretical results.},

The proposed framework is then extended to tackle the stabilization problem for a system where the state of dynamic uncertainty is not available for feedback and the dynamics is subject to parameter uncertainties. The proposed framework is further extended to solve two classes of event-triggered adaptive control problems where the emulated closed-loop system does not admit an input-to-state stability Lyapunov function. For the first class of systems with linear parameterized uncertainties, even-triggered global adaptive stabilization is achieved without the global Lipschitz condition on nonlinearities as often required in the literature. For the second class of systems with uncertainties whose bound is unknown, the event-triggered adaptive (dynamic) gain controller is designed for the first time.

  abstract     = {High-relative-degree control barrier functions play a prominent role in automotive safety and in robotics. In this article, we launch a generalization of this concept for PDE control, treating a specific, physically relevant model of thermal dynamics where the boundary of the PDE moves due to a liquid–solid phase change—the so-called Stefan model. The familiar quadratic programming (QP) design is employed to ensure safety but with CBFs that are infinite-dimensional (including one control barrier “functional”) and with safe sets that are infinite-dimensional as well. Since, in the presence of actuator dynamics, at the boundary of the Stefan system, this system&#39;s main CBF is of relative degree 2, an additional CBF is constructed, by backstepping design, which ensures the positivity of all the CBFs without any additional restrictions on the initial conditions. It is shown that the “safety filter” designed in this article guarantees safety in the presence of an arbitrary operator input. This is similar to an automotive system in which a safety feedback law overrides—but only when necessary—the possibly unsafe steering, acceleration, or braking by a vigorous but inexperienced driver. Simulations have been performed for a process in metal additive manufacturing, which show that the operator&#39;s heat-and-cool commands to the Stefan model are being obeyed but without the liquid ever freezing.},

For this setting, we propose an algorithm that combines gradient tracking with a network-level variance reduction (in contrast to variance reduction within each node). This enables the nodes to track the average of the gradients of the objective functions. Our theoretical analysis shows that the algorithm converges linearly, when the local objective functions are strongly convex, under mild connectivity conditions on the expected mixing matrices. In particular, our result does not require the mixing matrices to be doubly stochastic. In the experiments, we investigate a broadcast mechanism that transmits information from computing nodes to their neighbors and confirm the linear convergence of our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets.},

  abstract     = {In this article it is established that any jointly controllable, jointly observable, multichannel, discrete or continuous time linear system with a strongly connected neighbor {communication} graph can be exponentially stabilized with any pre-specified convergence rate using a time-invariant distributed linear control. As an illustration of how this finding can be used to deal with certain distributed tracking problems, a solution is given to a distributed set-point control problem for a continuous-time, multichannel linear system in which each and every agent with access to the system is able to independently adjust its scalar-valued, controlled output to any desired set-point value. To better understand the constraints on controller design, the distributed control problem is recast as a classical decentralized control problem. Armed with the tools of decentralized control, including the notion of a “fixed spectrum,” it is possible to show quite surprisingly that if the only information each agent is allowed to share with its neighbors is its measured output, then distributed stabilization in some cases is impossible. Using well-known decentralized control concepts, lower bounds are derived on the dimensions of the shared sub-states of local controllers which, if satisfied, guarantee that there will be no fixed closed-loop system eigenvalues to contend with. The decentralized control perspective also enables one to assert definitively that without imposing a partitioning constraint, the closed-loop spectrum of any jointly controllable, jointly observable multichannel linear system with a strongly connected neighbor graph, can be freely assigned with distributed feedback control, even in the face of finite delays.},

The existing approaches that do provide such guarantees fail to address sensor and navigator privacy in the common application of model-based range-only localization, consequently forfeiting broad applicability. In this work, we define a notion of privacy-preserving linear combination aggregation and use it to derive a modified extended Kalman filter using range measurements such that navigator location, sensors&#39; locations, and sensors&#39; measurements are kept private during navigation. Additionally, a formal cryptographic backing is presented to guarantee our method&#39;s privacy as well as an implementation to evaluate its performance.

We propose two ways of representing consensus steps in PEPs, which allow writing and solving PEPs for decentralized optimization. The first formulation is exact but specific to a given averaging matrix. The second formulation is a relaxation but provides guarantees valid over an entire class of averaging matrices, characterized by their spectral range. This formulation often allows recovering a posteriori the worst possible averaging matrix for the given algorithm. We apply our methodology to three different decentralized methods.

In this article, we propose a design of an aperiodic ETC mechanism for general nonlinear NCSs. In our setup, the communication network could introduce variable transmission delays, while data packets could get lost without acknowledgements. For this, we first introduce auxiliary variables dependent upon the transmission situations to capture the relationship between the number of successive packet dropouts, MIETs, transmission delays, and the number of successful packets being transmitted. Meanwhile, by designing appropriate jump rules of these variables, the changing process of the network-induced errors can be tracked. Then, we present a novel output-based dynamic ETC strategy that can simultaneously guarantee a finite $L_{p}$ -gain and a strictly positive lower bound despite the presence of packet losses and transmission delays. In particular, the mandatory limit of short delays can be avoided, and the transmission delays exceeding the positive MIETs are allowed. Finally, a numerical example is given to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed control approach.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the problem of securing exponentially fast consensus (exponential consensus for short) for identical agents with finite dimensional linear system dynamics over dynamic network topology. Our aim is to find the weakest possible conditions that guarantee exponential consensus using a Lyapunov function consisting of a sum of terms of the same functional form. We first investigate necessary conditions, starting by examining the system parameters. It is found that controllability of the linear agents is necessary for achieving consensus. Then, to work out necessary conditions incorporating the network topology, we construct a set of Laplacian matrix-valued functions. The precompactness of this set of functions is shown to be a significant generalization of existing assumptions on network topology. With the aid of such a precompactness assumption and restricting the Lyapunov function to one consisting of a sum of terms of the same functional form, we prove that a joint $(\delta, T)$ -connectivity condition on the network topology is necessary for exponential consensus. Finally, we investigate how the above two “necessities” work together to guarantee exponential consensus. To partially address this problem, we define a synchronization index to characterize the interplay between agent parameters and network topology. Based on this notion, it is shown that by designing a proper feedback matrix and under the precompactness assumption, exponential consensus can be reached globally and uniformly if the joint $(\delta,T)$ -connectivity and controllability conditions are satisfied, and the synchronization index is not less than one.},

Our first result is that, if the delay functions are affine and the support of the equilibrium is not modified with interventions, the NDP may be formulated in terms of electrical quantities computed on a related resistor network. In particular, we show that the travel time variation corresponding to an intervention on a given link depends on the effective resistance between the endpoints of the link. We suggest an approach to approximate such an effective resistance by performing only local computation and exploit it to design an efficient algorithm to solve the NDP. We discuss the optimality of this procedure in the limit of infinitely large networks and provide a sufficient condition for its optimality. We then provide numerical simulations, showing that our algorithm achieves good performance even if the equilibrium support varies and the delay functions are nonlinear.},

We show that alternative entropy definitions using spanning or separating trajectories bound ours from both sides. On the other hand, we show that other commonly used definitions of entropy, for example, the ones in the work of Liberzon and Mitra (2018), diverge to infinity. Thus, they are potentially not suitable for systems with uncertain inputs. We derive an upper bound on $\varepsilon$ -estimation entropy and estimation bit rates, and evaluate it for two examples. We present a state estimation algorithm that constructs a function that approximates a given trajectory up to an $\varepsilon$ error, given time-sampled and quantized measurements of state and input. We investigate the relation between $\varepsilon$ -estimation entropy and a previous notion for switched nonlinear systems and derive a new upper bound for the latter, showing the generality of our results on systems with uncertain inputs.},

We show that type-K monotonicity, which is weaker than strong monotonicity, is also equivalent to monotonicity for smooth systems evolving in continuous-time but not in discrete-time. K-subtopical systems are proved to converge toward equilibrium points, if any exists, generalizing the result of Angeli and Sontag about the convergence of topical systems&#39; trajectories toward the unique equilibrium point when strong monotonicity is considered. The theory provides a new methodology to study the consensus problem in nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs). Necessary and sufficient conditions on the local interaction rule of the agents ensuring the K-subtopicality of MASs are provided, and the consensus is proven to be achieved asymptotically by the agents under given connectivity assumptions on directed graphs.

First, we divide the output delay into two types through a designed constant and introduce a switching signal to distinguish these two types. Then, we build a distributed compensator for each follower using relevant outputs to reconstitute the leader–following tracking errors. This compensator relies on the output delay and is irrelevant to the nonlinear dynamics of the system. Then, we design a distributed linear controller for each follower with the compensator&#39;s assistance. Subsequently, a new unified Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional is developed to prove that all agents can realize leader–following full-state consensus with the action of the controller.

A key feature here is that the external disturbance is considered to be generated by a Markovian jump exogenous dynamics, in which the disturbance mode may not be synchronized with the system mode. Meanwhile, it is supposed that both system and disturbance modes can just be estimated via a hidden Markov mode detector. To overcome the possible obstacle in handling dual hidden Markov modes, a mapping technique for continuous-time Markov chain is provided first. Then, a novel asynchronous disturbance observer is developed to estimate the external disturbance by utilizing the detected mode. Based upon the estimated disturbance, asynchronous antidisturbance controllers are investigated for matched and mismatched disturbance cases, respectively. By employing a decoupling technique with the idea of completing the square, sufficient conditions are established for guaranteeing the stability in probability of the resultant closed-loop systems. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed asynchronous antidisturbance control approaches under inaccessible system and disturbance modes.},

This approach employs policy iteration, to find an optimal adaptive control solution. It utilizes a moving finite-horizon of model-following error measurements. In addition, the control strategy is designed by using a projection mechanism that employs Lagrange dynamics. It allows for real-time tuning of derived actor–critic structures to find the optimal model-following strategy and sustain optimized adaptation performance. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed framework is emphasized through a comparison with sliding mode and high-order model-free adaptive control approaches.},

  abstract     = {Self-triggered control, a well-documented technique for reducing the communication overhead while ensuring desired system performance, is gaining increasing popularity. However, a majority of existing self-triggered control methods require explicit system models. An end-to-end control paradigm known as data-driven control designs control laws directly from data and offers a competing alternative to the routine system identification-then-control strategy. In this context, the present article puts forth data-driven self-triggered control schemes for unknown linear systems using input–output data collected offline. Specifically, a data-driven model predictive control (MPC) scheme is proposed, which computes a sequence of control inputs while generating a predicted system trajectory. In addition, a data-driven self-triggering mechanism is designed, which determines the next triggering time using the solution of the data-driven MPC and the newly collected measurements. Finally, both feasibility and stability are established for the proposed self-triggered controller, which are validated using a numerical example.},

The second part of the method, which relies on the symbolic decomposition, is numerical and based on a contractor approach. It involves a specific optimal operator for narrowing the sets of feasible solutions.

The CDAL solver enjoys three main properties: 1) it is construction-free , in that it avoids explicitly constructing the quadratic programming problem associated with MPC; 2) is matrix-free , as it avoids multiplications and factorizations of matrices; and 3) is library-free , as it can be simply coded without any library dependency, 90-lines of C-code in our implementation. To favor the convergence speed, CDAL employs a reverse cyclic rule for the CD method, the accelerated Nesterov&#39;s scheme for updating the dual variables, a simple diagonal preconditioner, and an efficient coupling scheme between the CD and AL methods.

  abstract     = {In this article, the effect of a homogeneous parasitic dynamics on the stability of a homogeneous system, when homogeneity degrees are possibly different, is studied via input-to-state stability approach in the framework of singular perturbations. Thus, the possibilities to reduce the order of the interconnected system considering only the reduced-order dynamics and neglecting the parasitic ones are examined. Proposed analysis discovers three kinds of stability in the behavior of such an interconnection by assuming that both, reduced-order and unforced parasitic dynamics, are globally asymptotically stable. In the first case, global asymptotic stability of the interconnection can be concluded, when the homogeneity degrees of both systems coincide and the singular perturbation parameter is small enough. In the second case, only local stability of interconnection can be ensured, when the homogeneity degree of reduced-order dynamics is greater than the homogeneity degrees of the parasitic ones. Helpfully, the proposed approach allows us to estimate the domain of attraction for the system&#39;s trajectories as a function of the singular perturbation parameter. In the third case, only practical stability can be guaranteed, when the homogeneity degree of reduced-order dynamics is smaller than the homogeneity degrees of the parasitic ones. Additionally, the proposed approach provides an estimation of the asymptotic bound of the system&#39;s trajectories in terms of the singular perturbation parameter.},

The model is subject to unknown scaled parameters in both the boundary condition and boundary measurement. An adaptive boundary observer, providing online estimates of the system state and parameters, is designed. Particularly, to realize that the pure boundary state at left side tracks a reference signal, a challenging problem with the estimate of the true value of unknown scaled parameter appearing in measurement (at the left side) is tackled in this article. It is shown that the proposed observer is exponentially convergent, and furthermore, the exponential output regulation and stabilization are achieved.},

This article further studies the same problem over jointly connected switching networks that can be disconnected at every time instant by a single-time-scale distributed design. Since the existing distributed designs critically rely on the connectedness assumption on the networks and thus may not apply to jointly connected switching networks, we manage to modify the local observers and develop a novel approach that makes use of the uniform complete observability property for a discrete-time time-varying system.

These sets are online calculated via zonotopic segments minimization. Two approaches, namely, projection and polytopic conversion, are presented to check the intersection situation. The detection performance is quantified using a stealthy attack set and the corresponding state estimation error set. Further, we consider replay attacks.

For broader practical applications, the variation of system modes is regulated by a switched nonhomogeneous Markov process that corresponded to both lower level nonhomogeneous stochastic jumping and higher level deterministic switching. By resorting to the hidden nonhomogeneous-Markov model, an asynchronous control law that relies on the detected mode information is proposed. In light of the mode-dependent average dwell time strategy and mode-dependent stochastic system theory, the singularly perturbed parameter-independent conditions are attained to ensure the stochastic finite-time boundedness of the resulting systems. With respect to a linear matrix inequality optimization problem, a solution to the maximum singular perturbation parameter is obtained.

This article studies the enforcement of current-state opacity for systems modeled by finite state automata using an extended insertion strategy under constraints on the way symbols can be inserted before and after an actual symbol generated by the system (e.g., constraints on the type, order, and number of inserted symbols). More specifically, we consider inserted language constraints captured by the notion of $(L_{b},L_{a})$ -enforceability, where $L_{b}$ is the set of strings that can be inserted before, and $L_{a}$ is the set of strings that can be inserted after an observed event. If $L_{b}$ and $L_{a}$ are regular languages, a verifier is constructed to derive a necessary and sufficient condition for opacity enforceability, and also to formulate an extended insertion strategy (if viable).},

Moreover, the value of the objective function is revealed to the corresponding agent after the decision is executed per time-step. Thus, each agent can only update the decision variable based on the revealed value and information collected from the neighbors, without the knowledge on the explicit expression of the objective function. To solve this problem, an online gradient-free distributed projected gradient descent algorithm is presented, where each agent locally approximates the gradient based on two point values. With some standard assumptions on the communication graph and the objective functions, we provide the bound for the dynamic regret as a function of the minimizer path length, step-size, and smoothing parameter. Under appropriate selections of the step-size and smoothing parameter, we prove that the dynamic regret is sublinear with respect to the time duration $T$ if the minimizer path length also grows sublinearly.

  abstract     = {Tube-based model predictive control (TMPC) is an outstanding control technique in robust control realms. However, the existing works are generally based on a priori known admissible sets of disturbances, i.e., disturbance constraint sets, the sizes of which are by default small enough such that the region of attraction is nonempty. If the size of the disturbance constraint set specified is too large, or even oversized in some particular direction, TMPC may not be capable of handling it and lose the feasibility of the optimization problem. Otherwise, a small disturbance constraint set may be inadequate to cover all realizations of the actual disturbances. This implies that an improper selection of the disturbance constraint set may lead to the invalidity of TMPC. To address this issue, this technical note proposes an optimization-based algorithm to determine the maximal admissible disturbance constraint set for classical TMPC, which evaluates the robustness of TMPC. The proposed algorithm is also applicable to other TMPC methods for linear systems with a slight modification.},

In particular, when the coefficient matrices of the considered matrix equations are nonnegative, it is shown that the convergence rate of the MIA increases with the tuning parameter increases from 0 to 1. Moreover, the above convergence results derived for the MIA are extended to the SIA.

  abstract     = {Safety is crucial for robotic missions within an uncertain environment. Common safety requirements such as collision avoidance are only state-dependent, which can be restrictive for complex missions. In this article, we address a more general formulation as safe-return constraints, which require the existence of a return policy to drive the system back to a set of safe states with high probability. The robot motion is modeled as a Markov decision process with probabilistic labels, which can be highly nonergodic. The robotic task is specified as linear temporal logic formulas over these labels, such as surveillance and transportation. We first provide theoretical guarantees on the reformulation of such safe-return constraints, and a baseline solution based on computing two complete product automata. Furthermore, to tackle the computational complexity, we propose a hierarchical planning algorithm that combines the feature-based symbolic and temporal abstraction with constrained optimization. It synthesizes simultaneously two dependent motion policies: the outbound policy minimizes the overall cost of satisfying the task with a high probability, while the return policy ensures the safe-return constraints. The problem formulation is versatile regarding the robot model, task specifications, and safety constraints. The proposed hierarchical algorithm is more efficient and can solve much larger problems than the baseline solution, with only a slight loss of optimality. Numerical validations include simulations and hardware experiments of a search-and-rescue mission and a planetary exploration mission over various system sizes.},

  abstract     = {Achieving consensus via nearest neighbor rules is an important prerequisite for multiagent networks to accomplish collective tasks. A common assumption in consensus setup is that each agent interacts with all its neighbors. This article examines whether network functionality and performance can be maintained—and even enhanced—when agents interact only with a subset of their respective (available) neighbors. As shown in this article, the answer to this inquiry is affirmative. In this direction, we show that by exploring the monotonicity property of the Laplacian eigenvectors, a neighbor selection rule with guaranteed performance enhancements can be realized for consensus-type networks. For distributed implementation, a quantitative connection between entries of Laplacian eigenvectors and the “relative rate of change” in the state between neighboring agents is further established; this connection facilitates a distributed algorithm for each agent to identify “favorable” neighbors to interact with. Multiagent networks with and without external influence are examined, as well as extensions to signed networks. This article underscores the utility of Laplacian eigenvectors in the context of distributed neighbor selection, providing novel insights into distributed data-driven control of multiagent systems.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the control problem for safety-critical multiagent systems based on quadratic programming (QP). Each controlled agent is modeled as a cascade connection of an integrator and an uncertain nonlinear actuation system. In particular, the integrator represents the position–velocity relation, and the actuation system describes the dynamic response of the actual velocity to the velocity reference signal. The notion of input-to-output stability is employed to characterize the essential velocity-tracking capability of the actuation system. The standard QP algorithms for collision avoidance may be infeasible due to uncertain actuator dynamics. Even if feasible, the solutions may be non-Lipschitz because of possible violation of the full rank condition of the active constraints. Also, the interaction between the controlled integrator and the uncertain actuator dynamics may lead to significant robustness issues. Based on the current development of nonlinear control theory and numerical optimization methods, this article first contributes a new feasible-set reshaping technique and a refined QP algorithm for feasibility, robustness, and local Lipschitz continuity. Then, we present a nonlinear small-gain analysis to handle the inherent interaction for guaranteed safety of the closed-loop multiagent system. The proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulation and a physical experiment.},

  abstract     = {We consider monotone inclusion problems with expectation-valued operators, a class of problems that subsumes convex stochastic optimization problems with possibly smooth expectation-valued constraints as well as subclasses of stochastic variational inequality and equilibrium problems. A direct application of splitting schemes is complicated by the need to resolve problems with expectation-valued maps at each step, a concern addressed via sampling. Accordingly, we propose an avenue for addressing uncertainty in the mapping: variance-reduced stochastic modified forward-backward splitting scheme . We consider structured settings when the map can be decomposed into an expectation-valued map $A$ and a maximal monotone map $B$ with a tractable resolvent. We show that the proposed schemes are equipped with a.s. convergence guarantees, linear (strongly monotone $A$ ) and $\mathcal {O}(1/k)$ (monotone $A$ ) rates of convergence while achieving optimal oracle complexity bounds. The rate statements in monotone regimes appear to be among the first and leverage the Fitzpatrick gap function for monotone inclusions. Furthermore, the schemes rely on weaker moment requirements on noise and allow for weakening unbiasedness requirements on oracles in strongly monotone regimes. Preliminary numerics on a class of two-stage stochastic variational inequality problems reflect these findings and show that the variance-reduced schemes outperform stochastic approximation schemes and sample-average approximation approaches. The benefits of attaining deterministic rates of convergence become even more salient when resolvent computation is expensive.},

Spin-torque oscillators are nanoelectronic devices that promise efficient microwave generation provided they are synchronized in large arrays. Due to their nonlinear and nonisochronous nature, their synchronization properties are difficult to analyze explicitly. To address this challenge, we employ a recently developed continuation method and transform the network of coupled oscillators (each described by an ordinary differential equation) into a single partial differential equation (PDE). We then analyze the synchronization of this PDE in two cases: when all the oscillators are identical and when there are two different types of oscillators. In the case of identical oscillators, we characterize all possible synchronous solutions and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for stability. For nonidentical oscillators, we derive and solve a differential synchronization condition, which allows us to accurately reconstruct the shape of the equilibrium profiles. All the presented results are derived for the PDE and then validated by numerical simulations of the original network of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).},

The Boolean equation assigned at any particular node is a private equation known to this node only, and the aim of this article is to develop distributed algorithms that allow all the nodes to obtain solutions to the network Boolean equations without exchanging their local Boolean equations. First, we observe that the Boolean equations can be locally lifted to a system of linear algebraic equations under a basis of Boolean vectors, which is distributedly solvable using existing distributed linear equation algorithms as a subroutine. Next, we construct a distributed Boolean equation solver by the nodes solving the lifted linear network equation for a number of randomly selected initial values, and then converting the algebraic solutions into solutions to the original Boolean equations by a novel Boolean vector search algorithm. We prove that for solvable Boolean equations, when the initial values of the nodes for the distributed linear equation solving step are independent identically distributed selected according to a uniform distribution in a high-dimensional cube, such an algorithm returns the exact solution set of the Boolean equations at each node with high probability. We also present an algorithm for distributed verification of the satisfiability of Boolean equations when the solvability is not known beforehand, and prove its correctness. Finally, we show that by utilizing linear equation solvers with differential privacy to replace the in-network computing routines, the distributed Boolean equation algorithms can be made differentially private},

A UCTMC can be, therefore, seen as a specific type of Markov decision process for which the analysis is computationally difficult. To tackle this, we develop a theory of minimization, which generalizes the notion of lumpability for CTMCs. Our first result is a quantitative and logical characterization of minimization. Specifically, we show that the reduced UCTMC model has a macrostate for each block of a partition of the state space, which preserves value functions and logical formulae whenever rewards are equal within each block. The second result is an efficient minimization algorithm for UCTMCs by means of partition refinement. As an application, we show that reductions in a number of CTMC benchmark models are robust with respect to uncertainties in original rates.},

The existence of unknown disturbances results in the trajectories of the players going out of the feasible sets even though the initial values start from inside. To make the ideas clear, we first use an example that exhibits the three features to introduce the problem formulation to be studied. Subsequently, a two-time-scale distributed, projected algorithm is proposed. The simulation results are also shown. To further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through theoretical analysis, such an algorithm is generalized into a two-time-scale hybrid system by using an average dwell-time automaton and a time-ratio monitor to impose restrictions on the frequency and relative activation time of the attacks. To analyze stability of such a hybrid system, the reduced system and the boundary layer system are presented and corresponding Lyapunov functions are constructed. Correspondingly, uniform (uniform global) asymptotic stability is obtained under some mild assumptions. Also, some results are given for systems without attacks.

  abstract     = {In this article, the problem of online distributed optimization subject to a convex set is studied by employing a network of agents, where the objective functions allocated to agents are nonconvex. Each agent only has access to its own objective function information at the previous time, and can only communicate with its immediate neighbors via a time-varying directed graph. To tackle this problem, first, a new online distributed algorithm with gradient information is proposed based on consensus algorithms and projection-free strategies. Of particular interest is that dynamic regrets, whose offline benchmarks are to pursue the stationary points at each time, are employed to measure the performance of the algorithm. Under mild assumptions on the graph and the objective functions, we prove that if the deviation in the objective function sequence is sublinear with the square root of the time horizon, and if the deviation in the gradient sequence is sublinear with the time horizon, then dynamic regrets grow sublinearly. Second, considering the case where the gradient information of the objective functions is not available, we propose a zeroth-order online distributed projection-free algorithm, by which agents make decisions only depending on the random zeroth-order oracle. It turns out that under the same conditions as in the first case, if the smoothing parameters in the random zeroth-order oracles scale inversely with the time horizon, then the expectations of dynamic regrets increase sublinearly. Finally, simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

Prior research has developed Hamilton–Jacobi (HJ) partial differential equations (PDEs) that characterize the optimal cost functions of these two problems. Unfortunately, solving the HJ PDEs by grid-based methods, such as level-set methods, suffers from exponentially growing computational complexity in the system state dimension. In order to alleviate this computational issue, this article proposes a Hopf–Lax formula for each reachability problem&#39;s HJ PDE. The advantage of the Hopf–Lax formulae is that they have more favorable convexity conditions than the corresponding problems. Thus, direct methods may be used to solve Hopf–Lax formulae and thus efficiently compute the optimal solution of the reachability problems under specified conditions. This article provides an example for each reachability problem and demonstrates the performance of the proposed Hopf–Lax method.},

Yet, our systematic understanding of the graph properties for achieving resilient consensus of NASs with time-varying communication graphs remains limited. This study aims to investigate the resilient consensus problem of NASs with misbehaving agents and time-varying communication graphs under certain mean-subsequence-reduced algorithms, with particular attention to formulating and revealing the graph-theoretic properties of the time-varying interaction graphs responsible for resilient consensus. Specifically, to achieve resilient consensus, each agent will first discard some extremely large and small values received from its neighbors and then generate the control input based upon the remaining neighbors&#39; values at every time instant. To characterize the graph-theoretic properties of NASs subject to time-varying communication graphs for realizing resilient consensus in spite of the influence of misbehaving individuals, a new graph-theoretic property of the NASs, namely the joint robustness , is introduced. This new property connects the network robustness of the fixed graph with the property of time-varying interaction graphs jointly containing a directed spanning tree. Several necessary and sufficient criteria for resilient consensus of NASs with first-order and second-order individual dynamics subject to time-varying communication graphs are, respectively, proven and analyzed in the framework of joint robustness. At last, the effectiveness of the analytical findings is validated by performing numerical simulations.},

We focus on the local topology inference problem of MRNs under formation control, where an inference robot with a limited observation range can maneuver among the formation robots. This problem faces new challenges brought by the highly coupled influence of unobservable formation robots, inaccessible formation inputs, and unknown interaction range. The novel idea here is to advocate a range-shrink strategy to perfectly avoid the influence of unobservable robots while filtering the input. To that end, we develop consecutive algorithms to determine a feasible constant robot subset from the changing robot set within the observation range, and estimate the formation input offline and the interaction range online. Then, an ordinary least squares-based local topology estimator is designed with the previously inferred information. Resorting to the concentration measure, we prove the convergence rate and accuracy of the proposed estimator, taking the estimation errors of previous steps into account. Extensions on nonidentical observation slots and more complicated scenarios are also analyzed. Comprehensive simulation tests and method comparisons corroborate the theoretical findings.},

Then, a feedback scheme is proposed, which consists of a quantum system driven by the field in the superposition of coherent states and a classical feedback channel proportional to the observations of a Homodyne detector. Afterward, the quantum filter of the closed loop system is attained using the SLH framework. Finally, the factorization of the closed loop quantum filter is obtained and the control law is calculated such that the proposed factorization satisfies the stabilization condition.

The objective function of this optimization problem is the empirical loss regularized with the norm of RKHS, and the constraint is considered for enforcing the integration of the SSG side-information. The proposed formulation addresses both the discrete-time and continuous-time cases.

Both cost functions and constrained functions of players are time varying, which reflects the changing nature of environments. At each time, each player only has access to its strategy set information, and the information of its current cost function and current constrained function is unknown. Due to feedback delays, the feedback information of corresponding cost functions and constrained functions is not revealed to players immediately after the selection of strategies. It would take a period of time for players to observe their feedback information. To address such an AG problem, a distributed learning algorithm is proposed with the local information from their neighbors and the delayed feedback information from environments, and it is applicable to time-varying weighted digraphs.

  abstract     = {With the view of risks, this article deals with the problems of maximum hands-off control that aims at minimizing the length of nonzero control input. More specifically, we consider stochastic systems and seek sparse control inputs that bring the system state to a ball centered at the origin, such that the expected value of the states that are further than a given threshold from the origin is small, thus minimizing the risk that the system state is outside of the ball. To deal with this problem, we employ the worst-case conditional value-at-risk under the assumption that the first two moments of the disturbance distribution are known. In particular, we consider two kinds of risk-aware maximum hands-off control problems: one enhances the sparsity within a given risk threshold, and the other minimizes the risk subject to a sparsity constraint. We also derive a risk-constrained sparse model predictive control and provide a numerical example that shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach in networked control systems.},

First, based on the available input and output datasets, a data-driven monitor is formulated with the following two objectives: attack detection and attack identification. Then, with the subspace approach, a data-driven attack detection policy is presented, wherein the attack detector is designed directly by the process data. A subspace projection-based attack identification scheme is proposed via designing a bank of projection filters to determine the locations of attacked sensors. Moreover, the sparse recovery technique is adopted to decrease the combinatorial complexity of the subspace projection-based identification method. The attack identification is recast into a block-sparse recovery problem. Finally, the proposed methods are verified by the simulations on a flight vehicle system.},

Each observer can only observe a portion of the system. By transforming the system to a real Jordan canonical form, an observability decomposition is performed based on Popov–Belevitch–Hautus test. Each observer reconstructs observable states from its local measurements. The unobservable states are reconstructed relying on a communication network, by virtue of synchronizing region design in pinning control theory. The required graph connectivity is milder than strongly connected graphs. The proposed design is decentralized in the sense that its computational complexity is decomposed via solving lower-dimensionality algebraic Riccati equations. The computational complexity is thus independent of the total number of agents in the graph, exhibiting a high level of scalability on large networks. Another key feature of the proposed design is that the convergence rate of estimation errors can be tuned to be arbitrarily fast. Numerical simulations demonstrate the design procedure and the corresponding performance.},

In contrast to the existing methods for control by fast oscillations that are all qualitative, we present constructive quantitative results for finding an upper bound on $\varepsilon$ that ensures the exponential stability. Our method consists of two steps: 1) we construct appropriate coordinate transformations that cancel the high gains and lead to a stable averaged system; 2) we apply the time-delay approach to periodic averaging of the system in new coordinates and derive linear matrix inequalities for finding an upper bound on $\varepsilon$ .

  abstract     = {Nowadays, control-dependent stochastic noise is ruled out in adaptive control, whereas such noise can be encountered in financial, aerospace, and biomechanical models. The status is due to the presence of adaptive control in the diffusion term. The diffusion coefficient, heavily dependent on the adaptive signal (with unexpected size), undermines stochastic stability via its quadratic form which cannot be suppressed merely by the control itself in the drift term. This compels us to exploit the positive role of the diffusion term, entailing new sophisticated analysis in the nonlinear and adaptive context. This article aims to enlarge the applicability of adaptive control, and especially, seek adaptive stabilization via dynamic gain in the context of control-dependent stochastic noise. Specifically, basic theorems on stochastic convergence are proposed, particularly revealing the intrinsic relation between the system convergence and the gain evolution by exploiting the underlying positive role of the diffusion term. Then, a distinctive martingale-based analysis pattern for adaptive control is established, recognizing the inapplicability of classical Lyapunov/LaSalle theorems. In this way, for a specific class of uncertain nonlinear systems, global stabilization with almost sure asymptotic/exponential convergence is achieved by incorporating typical dynamic gains in the presence of control-dependent stochastic noise.},

This class of LTI systems importantly includes the well-studied negative imaginary systems without poles at the origin as a subset. Under the assumption that the instantaneous gain of the loop transfer function is zero, it is shown that the aforementioned feedback interconnection is stable if and only if the static (a.k.a. DC) loop gain is less than unity. This condition is identical to the one that guarantees feedback stability of negative imaginary systems, but is applicable to a much wider class of systems beyond negative imaginariness. Our proof is based entirely on the multivariable Nyquist stability criterion—it does not make use of realizations of the transfer functions.

Interestingly, the necessary condition for stability developed by Gomez et al. has been proven to be sufficient. It is presented as a simple positivity test of a matrix issued from the Lyapunov matrix. This article proposes an extension of this result, where the uniform discretization of the state has been replaced by projections on the first Legendre polynomials. Like in Gomez et al., the stability is guaranteed regarding the sign of the eigenvalues of a matrix, whose size is given analytically from convergence arguments. Compared to them, by relying on the supergeometric convergence rate of the Legendre approximation, the required order to ensure stability can be remarkably reduced. Thanks to this significant modification, it is possible to find an outer estimate of the stability regions, which converges to the expected stability regions with respect to the number of projections, as illustrated in the example section.},

The random parameters of the systems are subject to a two-layer stochastic process and the underlying stochastic process is assumed to be subject to a semi-Markov process. Furthermore, a novel switched Lyapunov function is used, which may be monotonically increasing or decreasing at the instant of nonmodal switching.

  abstract     = {Large-scale monitoring and control systems increasingly rely on sensitive data obtained from private agents, e.g., location traces collected from the users of intelligent transportation systems. To encourage the participation of these agents, algorithms that process information in a privacy-preserving way are thus needed. This note revisits the Kalman filtering problem, subject to privacy constraints. We aim to enforce differential privacy, a formal state-of-the-art definition of privacy ensuring that the output of an algorithm is not too sensitive to the data collected from any single participating agent. A two-stage architecture is proposed that aggregates and combines individual signals before adding privacy-preserving noise and postfiltering the result to be published. We show how an optimal static aggregation stage can be computed by solving a semidefinite program and illustrate the significant performance improvement offered by this architecture over input perturbation schemes.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the problem of signal tracking and disturbance rejection for sampled-data control systems, where the pertinent signals can reside beyond the so-called Nyquist frequency. In light of the sampling theorem, it is generally understood that manipulating signals beyond the Nyquist frequency is either impossible or at least very difficult. On the other hand, such control objectives often arise in practice, and control of such signals is much desired. This article examines the basic underlying assumptions in the sampling theorem and pertinent sampled-data control schemes and shows that the limitation above can be removed by assuming a suitable analog signal generator model. Detailed analysis of multirate closed-loop systems, zeros, and poles is given, which gives rise to tracking or rejection conditions. The robustness of the new scheme is fully characterized; it is shown that there is a close relationship between tracking/rejection frequencies and the delay length introduced for allowing better performance. Examples are discussed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method here.},

This article establishes a necessary condition for a system trajectory hitting the impasse surface. The condition is in terms of admittance matrices regarding the power network, generators, and loads, which specifies the pattern of interaction between those system components that can induce voltage collapse. It applies to generic DAE models featuring high-order synchronous generators, static loads, induction motor loads, and lossy power networks. We also identify a class of static load parameters that prevent power systems from hitting the impasse surface; this proves a conjecture made by Hiskens that has been unsolved for decades. Moreover, the obtained results lead to an early indicator of voltage collapse and a novel viewpoint that inductive compensation to the power network has a positive effect on preventing short-term voltage collapse, which are verified via numerical simulations.},

Based on the generalized regular form, a novel nonlinear sliding surface is designed and uniform ultimate stability of the corresponding sliding mode dynamics is analyzed. Then, under the assumption that the uncertainties are bounded by known nonlinear functions of the system states, a sliding mode controller is formulated to ensure that the dynamical system reaches the sliding surface in finite time even in the presence of the system uncertainties and input distribution uncertainties. Further, for the case of system uncertainty with unknown bound in parameterized form, an adaptive sliding mode controller is developed to drive the dynamical system to the sliding surface and maintain a sliding motion thereafter. The developed sliding mode controller is applied to a high incidence research model aircraft model. Simulation results demonstrate that the developed methods are effective.},

The active agents, which participate in the network, have time-varying local cost functions and attempt to find an optimal strategy that minimizes the cumulative local cost functions in a finite-time horizon. Each active agent updates its estimation by a distributed subgradient-based algorithm with information exchange of the estimation with neighboring active agents. The performance of the algorithm is analyzed by a regret, which represents the error of the costs between the estimations of the agents and the optimal strategy. To this end, the recursive relation of the error between the sum of the estimations of the active agents and the optimal strategy is considered. This article shows that the upper bound of the regret is sublinear for an appropriate step-size rule.},

To achieve the synchronization behaviors, a novel estimation and compensation mechanism based on time-varying observers, for the first time, is proposed. The mechanism can reveal the influence of equilibrium points on the synchronization behaviors of a class of heterogeneous systems with nonlinear dynamics and unknown external inputs. Specifically, time-varying observers are utilized to construct the proper estimation and compensation controllers using the limited and dynamic information interaction. By developing a novel mechanism of the dwell time of switching communication topologies, it is proven that the stability conditions of perfect synchronization can be achieved for the closed-loop heterogeneous nonlinear systems with external unknown inputs. The effectiveness of the developed time-varying observers in the synchronization of motion estimation applications is demonstrated by heterogeneous robotic systems.},

Next, we develop a data-driven generalized balanced truncation method that relies on two steps. First, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions such that systems explaining the data have common generalized Gramians. Second, these common generalized Gramians are used to construct matrices that allow to characterize a class of reduced-order models via generalized balanced truncation in terms of a lower-dimensional QMI by applying the data reduction concept. Additionally, we present alternative procedures to compute a priori and a posteriori upper bounds with respect to the true system generating the data.

  abstract     = {This article proposes a distributed design method of controllers with a glocal (global/local) information structure for large-scale network systems. The glocal controller of interest has a hierarchical structure, wherein a global subcontroller coordinates a set of disjoint local subcontrollers. The global subcontroller regulates interarea oscillations among subsystems, while local subcontrollers individually regulate intraarea oscillations of the respective subsystem. The distributed design of the glocal controller is addressed to enhance the scalability of controller synthesis, where the global subcontroller and all local subcontrollers are designed independently of each other. A design problem is formulated for subcontroller sets such that any combination of subcontrollers each of which belongs to its corresponding set guarantees stability of the closed-loop system. The core idea of the proposed method is to represent the original network system as a hierarchical cascaded system composed of reduced-order models representing the interarea and intraarea dynamics, referred to as hierarchical model decomposition. Distributed design is achieved by virtue of the cascade structure. The primary findings of this study are twofold. First, a tractable solution to the distributed design problem and an existence condition of the hierarchical model decomposition are presented. Second, a clustering method appropriate for the proposed framework and a robust extension are provided. Numerical examples of a power grid highlight the practical relevance of the proposed method.},

Angles are defined using the interior angles of triangles within the given framework, which are independent of the choice of coordinate frames and can be conveniently measured using monocular cameras and direction-finding arrays. We show that 3-D angle rigidity is a local property, which is in contrast to the 3-D bearing rigidity as has been proved to be a global property in the literature. We demonstrate that such angle rigid and globally angle rigid frameworks can be constructed through adding repeatedly new points to the original small angle rigid framework with carefully chosen angle constraints. We also investigate how to merge two 3-D angle rigid frameworks by connecting three points of one angle rigid framework simultaneously to the other. When angle constraints are given only in the surface of a framework, angle rigidity of convex polyhedra is studied, in which the cases of triangular face and triangulated face are considered, respectively. The proposed 3-D angle rigidity theory is then utilized to design decentralized formation control strategies using local direction measurements for teams of mobile agents.

We first show that a moderate amount of noise is sufficient to ensure privacy as long as the minimal observability subspace of the considered system is blurred by noise. Based on this, it is shown that blurring more than half of the sensors can provide a desirable level of privacy protection using a node-based privacy-preserving mechanism. By formulating the problem of the minimal amount of noise injected into an optimization framework, we give conditions on the tradeoff between privacy preservation and the amount of the noise. To further reduce the amount of the injected noise, an edge-based privacy-preserving mechanism is devised. It is found that less than half of the sensors blurred by noise still enable us to solve the privacy-preserving problem if more constraints on the communication topology are imposed. Finally, some discussions and comparisons are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed privacy-preserving strategies.},

Estimation of both continuous state and discrete sequence simultaneously based on the same output observations is a challenging task that is inherently nonlinear and often infinite dimensional. This article presents necessary and sufficient conditions when joint estimation is possible without using a probing input. When such conditions are not satisfied, a suitably designed input must be used to achieve the goal of jointly detecting the subsystem and estimating the internal state. This article employs certain structures of randomly switched linear systems to develop algorithms that use finite-dimensional estimators for continuous states and sampled data for detecting the discrete states. The convergence analysis shows that this framework can achieve convergence. Examples and simulation case studies are presented to illustrate the main results of this article. The findings of this article can be used to form a supporting foundation for robust control.},

Methods based on using contracts for system design have successfully tackled this issue for a variety of system classes, but mostly in the context of discrete software systems. Motivated by this, we present assume–guarantee contracts for continuous linear dynamical systems with inputs and outputs. Such contracts serve as system specifications through two aspects. The assumptions specify the dynamic behavior of the environment of the system, which provides inputs for it, whereas, the guarantees specify the desired dynamic behavior of the output of the system when interconnected with a relevant environment. This is formalized by utilizing the behavioral approach to system theory. We define and characterize notions of contract implementation and contract refinement, where the latter is used to compare contracts. We also define and characterize two notions of contract composition that allow one to reason about two types of system interconnections: series and feedback. The properties of refinement and composition allow contracts to be used for modular design and analysis.},

Due to the nonlinear and intrinsically infinite-dimensional nature of the task, solving such optimal control problems is challenging. In this article, an exact finite-dimensional characterization of the optimal solution over the entire horizon is proposed. This is obtained via the (static) minimization of a suitably defined function of (projected) trajectories of the underlying Hamiltonian dynamics on a hypersphere of fixed radius. The result is achieved in the spirit of the so-called shooting methods by introducing, via simultaneous forward/backward propagation, an intermediate shooting point much closer to the origin, regardless of the actual initial state. A modified strategy allows one to determine an arbitrarily accurate approximate solution by means of standard gradient-descent algorithms over compact domains. Finally, to further increase the robustness of the control law, a receding-horizon architecture is envisioned by designing a sequence of shrinking hyperspheres. These aspects are illustrated by means of a benchmark numerical simulation.},

First, an adaptive gradient-based algorithm is constructed in a fully distributed manner with the guaranteed convergence to the NE, where the network communication is required. Second, in order to save communication cost, a novel event-triggered scheme, namely, edge-based adaptive dynamic event-triggered (E-ADET) scheme, is proposed with online-tuned triggering parameter and threshold, and such a scheme is proven to be fully distributed and free of Zeno behavior. Then, a hybrid NE seeking algorithm, which is also fully distributed, is constructed under the E-ADET scheme. By means of the Lipschitz continuity and the strong monotonicity of the pseudogradient mapping, we show the convergence of the proposed algorithms to the NE. Compared with the existing distributed algorithms, our algorithms remove the requirement on global information, thereby exhibiting the merits of both flexibility and scalability.

  abstract     = {In this article, an adaptive nonparametric method is proposed to estimate the unknown scalar-valued function that appears in systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We recast the nonlinear estimation problem in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space into a linear one in an infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) by viewing the unknown function as a functional parameter in the RKHS, for which an RKHS embedded adaptive estimator is developed. The convergence analysis is facilitated by introducing a novel condition of partial persistent excitation (partial PE), which is defined for a subspace $\mathcal {H}_{\Omega }\subseteq \mathcal {H}_{X}$ of the RKHS $\mathcal {H}_{X}$ . Using this condition, we prove that the projection of the functional estimation error onto the PE subspace $\mathcal {H}_{\Omega }$ converges in norm asymptotically to zero. While this is an abstract notion of convergence that depends implicitly on the kernel used to define the RKHS, we derive conditions that ensure the pointwise convergence of the function estimates over the subset $\Omega$ that generates the subspace $\mathcal {H}_{\Omega }$ . In this article, we also introduce a weaker but geometrically intuitive notion of a partial PE condition, one that resembles PE conditions as they have been formulated historically in Euclidean spaces. Sufficient conditions are derived that describe when the two conditions are equivalent. Finally, qualitative properties of the convergence proofs derived in this article are illustrated with numerical simulations.},

This assumption covers a wide range of cases and holds locally around an equilibrium under mild assumptions. The proposed strategy does not require solving the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation, i.e., a nonlinear partial differential equation, which is known to be hard or impossible to solve. Instead, the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation is replaced with an easy-solvable state-dependent Lyapunov matrix equation. We exploit a linear-like factorization of the underlying nonlinear system and a policy-iteration algorithm to yield a linear-like policy-iteration for nonlinear systems. The proposed control strategy solves optimal nonlinear control problems in an asymptotically exact, yet still linear-like manner. We prove optimality of the resulting solution and illustrate the results via four examples.},

In the absence of a magnetometer, tilt estimation is proposed through a two-step observer: a global-exponentially stable pre-estimation given to a manifold-constrained complementary filter. In the presence of a magnetometer, the presented observer allows us to reconstruct the full attitude and tune how much the estimation of the tilt is influenced by the magnetometer, depending on the level of confidence given to the measurements of the magnetometer. All state estimators are proposed with proofs of almost global asymptotic stability and local exponential convergence. Finally, these estimators are compared with state-of-the-art solutions in clean and noisy simulations, allowing recommended solutions to be drawn for each case.},

We consider three definitions of robustness for nonlinear systems and bounded disturbances: robustly asymptotically stable (RAS), robustly asymptotically stable in expectation (RASiE), and RASiE with respect to the stage cost $\ell (\cdot)$ used in these MPC formulations ( $\ell$ -RASiE). Via input-to-state stability (ISS) and stochastic ISS (SISS) Lyapunov functions, we establish that MPC, subject to sufficiently small disturbances, and CMPC ensure all three definitions of robustness without a stochastic objective function. While SMPC is RASiE and $\ell$ -RASiE, SMPC is not neccesarily RAS for nonlinear systems. Through a few simple examples, we illustrate the implications of these results and demonstrate that, depending on the definition of robustness considered, SMPC is not necessarily more robust than nominal MPC even if the disturbance model is exact.},

A new class of zero-determinant (ZD) strategies, which can control a linear relation between the expected payoffs of a single agent and the coplayers, has dramatically changed the viewpoint on iterated games. Here, in this article, we focus on the decision-making behaviors in iterated multiplayer gaming (IMG) systems with the underlying scenarios of two competing ZDs. The results show that, under the asynchronous best-response dynamics, IMG systems starting from any initial state will converge to Nash equilibrium (NE) in finite time. Particularly, the convergence occurs not only in finite time, but can be limited by the number of strategy switches, which is no more than the total amount of agents in the population. Further studies on calculating the NE points reveal that, there is a threshold for the ZD slope, above which agents with higher baseline payoff dominate, while below which agents of lower baseline payoff prevail. The results of system convergence and NE states highlight the fixation of long-run decision-making behaviors in IMG. Finally, an example of the iterated public goods games is provided for the application of the proposed IMG model.},

Unlike existing results, we only require the leading principal minors of agents&#39; control gain matrices (CGMs) to be nonzero and take into account unknown direction actuator faults, which relaxes the restrictions on CGMs and enhances system reliability. The difficulties jointly caused by the unknown CGMs, unknown parameters, and unknown jumps introduced by the actuator faults are successfully overcome by a novel recursive contradiction argument based on some Nussbaum functions and a matrix similarity transformation. Moreover, an event-triggering mechanism is introduced to avoid continuous communication among agents and reduce the communication burden. It is shown that all closed-loop signals are globally uniformly bounded and the containment errors converge to a residual set that can be made arbitrarily small. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

This makes their analysis challenging and the generalization of results from linear interconnected systems theory to those nonlinear interconnected systems very limited. This article deals with the analysis of multiagent nonlinear interconnected positive systems (MANIPS). The main contributions of this work are twofold. Based on Perron–Frobenius theorem, we first study the “admissibility” property for MANIPS and show that it is a fundamental requirement for this category of systems. Then, using admissibility/positivity properties and sequences of functions theory, we propose a suitable Lyapunov function candidate to conduct the analysis of the dynamical behavior of such systems. We show that the stability of MANIPS is reduced to the positiveness property (i.e., negative or positive definiteness) of a new specific matrix-valued function ( $\mathcal {Z}$ ) that we derive in this article. Furthermore, the obtained results generalize the existing theory. The quality of the results achieved is demonstrated through the applications of the developed theory on cells with a multistage maturation process dynamical models.},

To control the distance, it is natural to consider this model with pairwise attractive potentials. Therefore, this note investigates the Cucker–Smale model with nonlinear velocity couplings and attractive potentials. When the attractive potential is any power-law function, it is proved that this model not only exhibits flocking but also achieves consensus regardless of initial conditions. More importantly, by constructing two delicate Lyapunov functions, the precise convergence rates (including polynomial convergence, exponential convergence, finite time consensus, and consensus independent of $N$ ) are derived for different kinds of nonlinear velocity couplings and power-law potentials.},

Both the developed algorithms are capable of ensuring the regulation in prescribed time with a unique converging feature in that the convergence time is independent of any initial conditions and other design parameters that can be preassigned freely by the designer according to the control requirements. The key to achieve the objective in prescribed finite time is the introduction of a descending power time-varying feedback into the controller design.

  abstract     = {This article studies input design of kernel-based regularization methods for linear dynamical systems, which has been formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem with the criterion being a scalar measure of the posterior covariance of the Bayesian estimate, subject to a spherical constraint on the input. The nonconvex nature of such input design problems poses significant challenges in deriving optimality conditions and efficient numerical algorithms. In this work, we first derive a sufficient condition for guaranteeing that a stationary point of the regularized input design problem is a global minimum. Next, we propose a spherical constraint preserving (SCP) algorithm to efficiently reach a stationary point of the design problem. Numerical simulation results show that the SCP algorithm finds the global minimum of the original design problem for all simulated cases and its average computational time is only approximately one tenth of that of the algorithms for previous methods.},

  abstract     = {The regression-based reconstruction of spatial fields by static sensors requires the number of measurements be at least equal to the number of unknown parameters in order to provide a unique solution. Improvements include the use of mobile sensor networks to arrive at higher accuracy estimates. An alternate approach utilizes adaptive techniques to update the parameter estimates online. Such adaptive techniques need persistence of excitation to ensure convergence of the parameter and function estimates. It is shown that the motion of just a single sensor is a necessary condition for persistence of excitation and, subsequently, of function convergence. Having a prescribed sensor guidance is also a sufficient condition for function convergence. First, a Lyapunov-based adaptation and guidance is presented and it is shown that persistence of excitation necessitates the time dependence of the outer product of the regressor vector with itself and which in turn requires the motion of the sensor within the spatial domain. Subsequently, a gradient-based adaptive scheme relaxes the Lyapunov-based sensor guidance to any user-defined guidance as long as the outer product of the associated rank-one regressor vector with itself has a uniformly positive definite integral. The latter adaptation is conducive to the inclusion of platform dynamics resulting in a vehicle control design needed to attain parameter convergence. Extension of the centralized solution to distributed estimation using a network of mobile sensors is also examined. These results are demonstrated with simulations in one and two dimensions.},

In this article, we consider situations where an intended receiver may be present and develop attribute-based edit functions, which not only obfuscate the output for the intruder, but also allow the intended receiver (who is assumed to have access to specific additional information) to recover the original output behavior. In our developed edit mechanism, edit functions modify the output by only performing insertion or replacement operations under a carefully chosen replacement regulation. Moreover, the outside observer that satisfies the intended-receiver attribute (i.e., the identity of the observer is the intended receiver) is able to recover the unedited output sequence using its ability to distinguish inserted/replaced symbols, and its knowledge of the replacement regulation. We provide an algorithmic procedure, based on a backtracking technique, to obtain suitable replacement regulations for the attribute-based edit function and the intended receiver.},

However, there is a distinct lack of emphasis on formal derivation and optimality of distributed state estimation algorithms in the literature. Furthermore, many existing algorithms utilize unweighted average consensus filtering, which has been shown to lead to poor estimation performance in the presence of sensor agents that cannot make measurements due to environmental obstructions or sensor limitations. In this article, a novel distributed minimum mean-squared error estimator is developed by generalizing the Kalman consensus filter to incorporate consensus on a weighted directed graph. By employing weighted consensus, the algorithm is able to achieve a directional flow of information in heterogeneous sensor networks, leading to improved performance in the presence of sensors that have low observability. Unlike several existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm does not rely on approximations or ad hoc parameter tuning and achieves optimal performance in a fully distributed setting. Through numerical simulations, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm has a smaller mean-squared estimation error and is robust in the aforementioned scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Symbolic control is an abstraction-based controller synthesis approach that provides, algorithmically, certifiable-by-construction controllers for cyber-physical systems. Symbolic control approaches usually assume that full-state information is available, which is not suitable for many real-world applications with partially observable states or output information. This article introduces a framework for output-feedback symbolic control. We propose relations between original systems and their symbolic models based on outputs. They enable designing symbolic controllers and refining them to enforce complex requirements on original systems. We provide an example methodology to synthesize and refine output-feedback symbolic controllers.},

Some sufficient criteria based on multiple Lyapunov functions coupled with dwell time condition are derived for ensuring the FTS property. It shows that when the mode governing continuous dynamic is finite-time stable but the discrete dynamic involves destabilizing impulses, the FTS can be guaranteed if the impulses can be effectively restrained by dwell time condition. Conversely, when the mode governing continuous dynamic is not finite-time stable but the discrete dynamic involves stabilizing impulses, the system can be successfully stabilized in FTS sense if the impulses are applied frequently. Moreover, when impulsive switched systems consist of stable and unstable modes, the FTS can also be ensured if there is a tradeoff among the activating time of unstable modes, impulsive dynamics, and initial condition. Finally, two examples are proposed to illustrate the efficiency of theoretical results.},

These benefits, however, come at the expense of an optimization problem that is no longer the typical quadratic programming problem derived from most linear MPC formulations due to the inclusion of a particular class of second-order cone constraints. This article presents a method for efficiently dealing with these constraints in operator splitting methods, leading to a computation time for solving HMPC in line with state-of-the-art solvers for linear MPC. We show how to apply this result to the alternating direction method of the multipliers algorithm, presenting a solver that we compare against other solvers from the literature, including solvers for other linear MPC formulations. The results show that the proposed solver, and by extension the HMPC formulation, is suitable for its implementation in embedded systems.},

We begin with a negative result that no algorithm using only $k$ -wise information can guarantee performance better than $k/n$ . We present two algorithms that utilize only pairwise information about the function and characterize their performance relative to the optimal, which depends on the curvature of the submodular function. Additionally, if the submodular function possess a property called supermodularity of conditioning, then we can provide a method to bound the performance based purely on pairwise information. The proposed algorithms offer significant computational speedups over a traditional greedy strategy. A by-product of our study is the introduction of two new notions of curvature, the $k$ -Marginal Curvature and the $k$ -Cardinality Curvature. Finally, we present experiments highlighting the performance of our proposed algorithms in terms of approximation and time complexity.},

We show that the proposed distributed algorithms with compressed communication have comparable convergence properties as state-of-the-art algorithms with exact communication. Specifically, we show that they can find first-order stationary points with sublinear convergence rate $\mathcal {O}(1/T)$ when each local cost function is smooth, where $T$ is the total number of iterations, and find global optima with linear convergence rate under an additional condition that the global cost function satisfies the Polyak–Łojasiewicz condition.

The derived necessary and sufficient criteria for the strong structural controllability of BNs are checkable in a polynomial amount of time. As an interesting feature, controllability is shown to be equivalent to fixed-time controllability in the network-structure regard. We further explore the minimal strong structural controllability problem of BNs that, reduced from the minimum vertex cover problem of graphs, consequently turns out to be NP-hard. More worthy implications are that our results on the strong structural controllability also serve as the basis to improve several existing approaches to a certain extent. First, the network aggregation subject to the controllability of BNs is provided where the aggregated blocks, except the rooted blocks, are strongly structurally controllable. Second, the pinning controllers are carried out to render an arbitrary BN controllable through node-to-node message exchange in a distributed form while traditional results only check the controllability of BNs with the preassigned controllers. Notably, the time complexity to design such controllers reduces to be only exponential with the maximal in-degree of pinned nodes rather than the node number of networks. As for the stochastic counterpart, upon the equivalence between the asymptotic stability of stochastic BNs and the criteria of strong structural controllability, we also further facilitate the design of distributed controllers to asymptotically stabilize stochastic BNs in probability.},

  abstract     = {Laplacian dynamics on signed digraphs have a richer behavior than those on nonnegative digraphs. In particular, for the so-called “repelling” signed Laplacians, the marginal stability property (needed to achieve consensus) is not guaranteed a priori and, even when it holds, it does not automatically lead to consensus, as these signed Laplacians may lose rank even in strongly connected digraphs. Furthermore, in the time-varying case, instability can occur even when switching in a family of systems each of which corresponds to a marginally stable signed Laplacian with the correct corank. In this article, we present novel conditions for achieving consensus on signed digraphs based on the property of eventual positivity, a Perron–Frobenius (PF) type of property for signed matrices. The conditions we develop cover both time-invariant and time-varying cases. A particularly simple sufficient condition, valid in both cases, is that the Laplacians are normal matrices. Such condition can be relaxed in several ways. For instance, in the time-invariant case it is enough that the Laplacian has this PF property on the right side, but not on the left side (i.e., on the transpose). For the time-varying case, convergence to consensus can be guaranteed by the existence of a common Lyapunov function for all the signed Laplacians. All conditions can be easily extended to bipartite consensus.},

Subsequently, we extend it to the case where manipulator kinematic and system parameters are not exactly known. An extra integrator and an adaptive estimator are introduced for gravitational compensation and stabilization, respectively.

The agents are modeled in strict-feedback form with unknown nonlinear dynamics and external disturbance. Extended state observers (ESOs) are leveraged to estimate agents&#39; total uncertainties along with their states. To mitigate the effects of DoS attacks, a novel dynamic quantization with zooming-in and holding capabilities is proposed. The idea is to zoom-in and hold the variable to be quantized if the system is in the absence and presence of DoS attacks, respectively. The control protocol is given in terms of the outputs of the ESOs and the dynamic-quantization-based encoders and decoders. We show that, for a connected undirected network, the developed control protocol is capable of handling any DoS attacks inducing bounded consecutive packet losses with merely three-level quantization. The application of the zooming-in and holding approach to known linear multiagent systems is also discussed.},

A distributed online agent controller is developed where each agent solves a sequence of receding horizon control problems (RHCPs) in an event-driven manner. A novel objective function is proposed for these RHCPs so as to optimize the effectiveness of this distributed estimation process and its unimodality property is established under some assumptions.

Moreover, the algorithm can be synthesized distributively. The developed algorithm has: first, a $O(1/k) $ rate of convergence, where $k$ is the iteration counter, when individual functions are convex but not-necessarily differentiable, and second, a geometric rate of convergence to any arbitrary small neighborhood of the optimal solution, when the objective functions are smooth and restricted strongly convex at the optimal solution.

The recent moment-based distributionally robust fault detection (DRFD) design secures robustness against inexact distributions but suffers from overpessimism. To address this issue, we develop a new DRFD design scheme by using unimodality, a ubiquitous property of real-life distributions. To evaluate worst-case false alarm rates, a new generalized Gauss bound is first attained, which is less conservative than known Chebyshev bounds that underpin moment-based DRFD. This also yields analytical solutions to DRFD design problems, which are suboptimal but provably less conservative than known ones disregarding unimodality. A tightened Gauss bound is further derived by assuming bounded uncertainty, based on which convex programming approximation of DRFD problems is developed. Results on physical system data elucidate that the proposed DRFD design can reduce conservatism of moment-based ones by using unimodality information, and attaining a better robustness-sensitivity trade-off than prevalent data-centric design with moderate sample sizes.},

In this article, we consider averaging consensus policies over time-varying graphs in presence of unknown but bounded communication delays. It is known that consensus is established (no matter how large the delays are) if the graph is periodically, or uniformly quasi-strongly connected (UQSC). The UQSC condition is often believed to be the weakest sufficient condition under which consensus can be proved. We show that the UQSC condition can actually be substantially relaxed and replaced by a condition that we call aperiodic quasi-strong connectivity, which, in some sense, proves to be very close to the necessary condition (the so-called integral connectivity). Under the assumption of reciprocity of interactions (e.g., for undirected or type-symmetric graphs), a necessary and sufficient condition for consensus in presence of bounded communication delays is established; the relevant results have been previously proved only in the undelayed case.},

Unlike traditional cloud-based control that treats the cloud as a powerful, remote, and sole controller in a networked control system setting, the proposed framework aims at seamlessly integrating the two controllers for enhanced performance. In particular, we formalize the fusion problem for finite-duration tasks with explicit consideration for model mismatches and errors due to request-response communication delays. We analyze stability-type properties of the proposed cloud-assisted MPC framework and establish approaches to robustly handling constraints within this framework in spite of plant-model mismatch and disturbances. A fusion scheme is then developed to enhance control performance while satisfying stability-type conditions, the efficacy of which is demonstrated with multiple simulation examples, including an automotive control example to show its industrial application potentials.},

However, previous work has overlooked the relationship between these two different solution concepts. Here, we investigate the conditions for existence and equivalence of these solution concepts. Our theoretical results prove that the FPE and SSSE exist and coincide for important classes of games, including myopic follower strategy and team games. This, however, does not hold in general, and we provide numerical examples where one of SSSE or FPE does not exist, or when they both exist, they differ. Our computational results compare the solutions obtained by value iteration, policy iteration, and a mathematical programming formulations for this problem.

To achieve the desired LQG cost, we introduce a communication link from the observer (encoder) to the controller (decoder). We investigate the fundamental tradeoff between a desired LQG cost and the required communication (information) resources, measured with the conditional directed information. The optimization domain is all encoding–decoding policies, and our first result is the optimality of memoryless encoders that only transmit Gaussian measurements of the current system state. Additionally, it is shown that even if the controller&#39;s measurements are made available to the encoder it does not reduce the minimal directed information. The main result is a semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation for that optimization problem, which applies to general time-varying linear dynamical systems in the finite-horizon scenario, and to time-invariant systems at infinite horizon. For the latter scenario of time-invariant systems, we show that it is unnecessary to consider time-varying policies as a simple and optimal time-invariant policy can be directly constructed from the SDP solution. Our results extend a seminal work by Tanaka et al. to the scenario where the controller has access to a noisy measurement of the system state. We demonstrate the viability of this extra resource by illustrating that even low-quality measurements may have a significant impact on the required communication resources.},

The objective here is to cooperatively optimize a holistic cost function, which is a sum of all the convex local objective functions, under the mild condition that each agent may only have access to the gradient of its local objective function and the relative local information between itself and its neighbors. To solve such an outstanding optimization problem, a neuro-adaptive optimization protocol is developed based upon parameterizations of the unknown nonlinearities where the neuro-adaptive learning algorithm for estimating the weight matrices therein acts as the key role to compensate for the unknown nonlinearities. Furthermore, the signum function-based feedback law is subtly integrated into the proposed protocol to deal with the effect of the gradient term of the local objective function. Efficient criteria are provided to guide selections of proper control parameters under which the robust optimization problem is successfully resolved in the mean-square sense. Lastly, theoretical results are validated by presenting several illustrative simulation examples.},

The produced estimate is the sublevel set of a function called an empirical inverse Christoffel function: empirical inverse Christoffel functions are known to provide good approximations to the support of probability distributions. In addition to reachability analysis, the same approach can be applied to general problems of estimating the support of a random variable, which has applications in data science toward the detection of novelties and outliers in datasets. In applications where safety is a concern, having a guarantee of accuracy that holds on finite datasets is critical. In this article, we prove such bounds for our algorithms under the probably approximately correct (PAC) framework. In addition to applying classical Vapnik–Chervonenkis dimension bound arguments, we apply the PAC-Bayes theorem by leveraging a formal connection between kernelized empirical inverse Christoffel functions and Gaussian process regression models.},

By quantifying the approximation error between NN-based and MPC-based state-to-input mappings, we first establish suitable conditions involving two key quantities, the worst-case error and the Lipschitz constant, guaranteeing the stability of the closed-loop system.

Together these techniques provide conditions sufficient to certify the stability and performance of an ReLU-based approximation of an MPC control law.},

In this article, we address the optimal performance control problem for linear uncertain discrete-time systems over multiple additive white Gaussian noise channels, where mean power constraints are imposed on the actuator side. The desired controller is aimed to robustly stabilize the plant, to minimize the linear quadratic cost, and to satisfy diverse prespecified mean power limits associated with individual elements of the control law, simultaneously. Within the framework of system-level synthesis, the performance objective and power constraints, together with relevant upper bounds, over all admissible uncertainties are characterized in terms of system responses of the closed-loop system and statistics of the communication channels. Based on this characterization, numerically tractable algorithms are proposed for controller synthesis. The counterpart for deterministic systems is also discussed as a special case with corresponding algorithms being provided. Moreover, the relative performance loss incurred by the size of model uncertainties and the finite truncation is explicitly established. An example is also included to show the effectiveness of the present results.},

A natural performance metric in this setting is competitive ratio, which is the ratio between the cost incurred by the online controller and the cost incurred by the offline optimal controller. Using operator-theoretic techniques from robust control, we derive a computationally efficient state-space description of the controller with optimal competitive ratio in both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon settings. We extend competitive control to nonlinear systems using model predictive control (MPC) and present numerical experiments which show that our competitive controller can significantly outperform standard $H_{2}$ and $H_{\infty }$ controllers in the MPC setting.},

A new dynamic output feedback controller with dual nonidentification adaptive gains is proposed by means of a novel constructive solution of a pair of matrix inequalities including an unknown time-varying parameter. It mainly reduces the conservatism of the existing results from two aspects: 1) the unknown measurement sensitivity is allowed to be nondifferentiable with its upper bound unknown; 2) in the presence of a large measurement error, the growth rate of nonlinearities is relaxed to be $x_{1}$ -polynomial containing an unknown parameter. Furthermore, the initial value and increasing rate of dynamic gains can be set to any small positive real number, which avoids somewhat the peaking phenomenon of classical high-gain observer. Notably, the control approach of this note is nonbackstepping with the design parameters determined easily by a set of explicit constrained conditions.},

The underlying problem becomes even more complicated if such systems are networked with directed communication and state-triggering setting. In this work, we present a fully distributed adaptive tracking control scheme for multiple agent systems in strict-feedback form using triggered state from the agent itself and the triggered states from the neighbor agents. To circumvent the non-differentiability issue of virtual controllers stemming from state-triggering, we first develop a distributed continuous control scheme under regular state feedback, upon which we construct the distributed event-triggered control scheme by replacing the states in the preceding scheme with the triggered ones. Several useful lemmas are introduced to allow the stability condition to be established with such replacement, ensuring that all the closed-loop signals are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, with the output tracking error converging to a residual set around zero. Besides, with proper choices of the design parameters, the tracking performance in the mean square sense can be improved. Numerical simulation verifies the benefits and efficiency of the proposed method.},

To derive such an adaptive law, a novel scheme of uncertainty filtration with resetting is proposed, which provides the required properties of the control system. A rigorous proof of all mentioned properties of the developed adaptive law is presented. Such a law is compared with the known composite ones, which also relax the PE requirement, using the wing-rock problem to conduct numerical experiments.

A novel distributed algorithm is developed over unbalanced directed network topologies based on the topology balancing technique and adaptive control approach. The developed algorithm is fully distributed in the sense that it depends on neither the global Lipschitz continuity of the gradients nor prior global information about the network connectivity. By regarding the proposed algorithm as a perturbed system, its input-to-state stability with a vanishing perturbation is first established, and asymptotic convergence of the decision variables toward the optimal solution is then proved.},

This article proposes a modified FG that bypasses the need for an explicit estimate, instead relying entirely on the MPC terminal set. The proposed FG formulation is proven to be asymptotically stable, exhibits zero-offset tracking, satisfies constraints, and achieves finite-time convergence of the reference. Numerical comparisons featuring an MPC with a long prediction horizon show that the FG+MPC system can achieve a comparable closed-loop performance to long-horizon MPC at a significantly reduced computational cost by suitably detuning the terminal controller to enlarge the terminal set.},

This article proposes a hierarchical AGD algorithm for separable nonlinear models based on stage greedy method.

First, an integral dynamic is constructed and a new state transformation is introduced, which transforms the triangular nonlinear systems into a class of auxiliary intermediate systems. Second, by using the time-varying gain technique, designing regulating controllers for the auxiliary intermediate systems is converted into designing a dynamic parameter for a class of new systems. Third, with the help of the Lyapunov stability theorem and the characteristics of designed dynamic parameter, it is provided that the boundness of the new systems yields the regulation of the auxiliary intermediate systems, which further indicates the global feedback regulation of the considered systems.

Furthermore, the fixed-time stability of the modified projected dynamical system continues to hold, even if the assumption of strong monotonicity is relaxed to that of strong pseudomonotonicity.

In this article, we analyze both the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the stabilizability of an LDS using sparse control inputs with potentially time-varying supports. We show that an LDS is stabilizable using sparse control inputs if and only if it is stabilizable (using unconstrained inputs). For a stabilizable LDS, we present an algorithm to determine the sparse control inputs that steer the system state to zero. We show that all stabilizable LDSs are also sparse mean square stabilizable when the process noise has zero mean and bounded second moment. For such an LDS, we devise a method to sequentially estimate the sparse control inputs to stabilize the LDS in the mean square sense. We prove that a detectable and stabilizable LDS is sparse stabilizable through output feedback and develop an algorithm for finding the corresponding sparse control inputs. Finally, we analyze the stabilizability of an LDS using sparse control inputs with common support. Our results shed light on the conditions under which a given LDS is stabilizable using sparse control inputs and the design of the corresponding control inputs.},

In particular, while the load balancing process occurs over directed links, agents&#39; communication is assumed to be bidirectional. For this optimization setting, first, an optimality condition is derived; then, a provably convergent distributed algorithm to compute the optimal solution is developed, and an upper bound on the convergence rate is characterized.

This control input is globally admissible and computed based on an aggregated system that reflects the overall behavior of the ensemble. To limit the computational complexity of the control task, the aggregated system is designed such that its dimension is independent of the number of subsystems.

  abstract     = {In this article, we provide a system-theoretic treatment of certain continuous-time homogeneous polynomial dynamical systems (HPDS) via tensor algebra. In particular, if a system of homogeneous polynomial differential equations can be represented by an orthogonally decomposable (odeco) tensor, we can construct its explicit solution by exploiting tensor Z-eigenvalues and Z-eigenvectors. We refer to such HPDS as odeco HPDS. By utilizing the form of the explicit solution, we are able to discuss the stability properties of an odeco HPDS. We illustrate that the Z-eigenvalues of the corresponding dynamic tensor can be used to establish necessary and sufficient stability conditions, similar to these from linear systems theory. In addition, we are able to obtain the complete solution to an odeco HPDS with constant control. Finally, we establish results that enable one to determine if a general HPDS can be transformed to or approximated by an odeco HPDS, where the previous results can be applied. We demonstrate our framework with simulated and real-world examples.},

  abstract     = {In distributed optimization (DO), the designed algorithms are expected to have a fast convergence rate but less computation cost. Moreover, the boundedness of the control inputs is generally required for practical networking agent systems with actuator limitations. Motivated by these observations, we first revisit the well-known finite-time distributed average tracking (FTDAT) problem where a novel sufficient condition on the control gain and the finite settling time estimation are derived based on the minimum cut of the underlying topology. Then, based on FTDAT, three types of discontinuous dynamics with bounded inputs are designed for solving unconstrained and constrained DO problems, respectively. The first algorithm can successfully find the optimal solution for an unconstrained DO in finite time. For DO problems with a common constraint set or separated equality constraints, two projection-based algorithms are designed and utilized to first make the agents&#39; states achieve consensus in finite time, and then drive the common state to the optimum exponentially. Finally, several case studies and extensive numerical simulations are conducted to testify the designed algorithms.},

Different from event-triggered impulsive control strategy in which the triggering conditions need to be continuously or periodically monitored to determine whether an impulse should be generated, our proposed STIC strategy does not require those monitoring because it can utilize the measurable information to predict the next impulse instant. Based on the proposed STIC strategy, some Lyapunov-based sufficient conditions for globally asymptotical stability are derived by adopting the comparison approach. Moreover, we prove that the Zeno behavior can be excluded from our results. Specifically, we apply the theoretical results to resolve the STIC problem for a class of nonlinear systems, where two different cases are fully considered, that is, state-based STIC and output-based STIC. For each case, the design method of STIC strategy is given in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified by two numerical examples and their simulations.},

The local observer estimates and broadcasts the observable states among neighbors so that the full-state vector can be recovered at each node and the estimation error reaches zero after a predefined fixed time in the absence of perturbation. This represents a new distributed estimation framework that enables faster convergence speed and further reduced information exchange compared to a conventional Luenberger-like approach. The ubiquitous time-varying communication delay across the network is suitably compensated by a prediction scheme.

  abstract     = {Control Lyapunov function is a central tool in stabilization. It generalizes an abstract energy function—a Lyapunov function—to the case of controlled systems. It is a known fact that most control Lyapunov functions are nonsmooth—so is the case in nonholonomic systems, like wheeled robots and cars. Frameworks for stabilization using nonsmooth control Lyapunov functions exist, such as Dini aiming and steepest descent. This work generalizes the related results to the stochastic case. As the groundwork, a sampled control scheme is chosen in which control actions are computed at discrete moments in time using discrete measurements of the system state. In such a setup, special attention should be paid to the sample-to-sample behavior of the control Lyapunov function. A particular challenge here is a random noise acting on the system. The central result of this work is a theorem that states, roughly, that if there is a, generally nonsmooth, control Lyapunov function, the given stochastic dynamical system can be practically stabilized in the sample-and-hold mode meaning that the control actions are held constant within sampling time steps. A particular control method chosen is based on Moreau–Yosida regularization, in other words, inf-convolution of the control Lyapunov function, but the overall framework is extendable to further control schemes. It is assumed that the system noise be bounded almost surely, although the case of unbounded noise is briefly addressed.},

This article aims to determine whether or not a stochastic state feedback control can make a given nonlinear hybrid differential equation, which is not stable in distribution, to become stable in distribution. We will refer to this problem as stabilisation in distribution by noise or stochastic stabilisation in distribution.

The entropy control can be considered as an optimization problem for the system randomness attenuation, but the mean value has to be considered separately. To overcome this disadvantage, a new representation of the system stochastic properties was given using the cumulant-generating function based on the moment-generating function, in which the mean value and the entropy was reflected by the shape of the cumulant-generating function. Based on the samples of the system output and control input, a time-variant linear model was identified, and the minimum entropy optimization was transformed to system stabilization. Then, an optimal control strategy was developed to achieve the randomness attenuation, and the boundedness of the controlled system output was analyzed. The effectiveness of the presented control algorithm was demonstrated by a numerical example. In this article, a data-driven minimum entropy design is presented without preknowledge of the system model; entropy optimization is achieved by the system stabilization approach in which the stochastic distribution control and minimum entropy are unified using the same identified structure; and a potential framework is obtained since all the existing system stabilization methods can be adopted to achieve the minimum entropy objective.},

The resulting algorithms not only are suitable for settings with real-time requirements but also provide provable performance guarantees. To this end, they merge noisy data from only a single finite-horizon trajectory and, if available, various forms of side information. Such side information may include knowledge of the regularity of the dynamics, algebraic constraints on the states, monotonicity, or decoupling in the dynamics between the states. Specifically, we develop two algorithms, DaTaReach and DaTaControl , to overapproximate the reachable set and design control signals for the system on the fly. DaTaReach constructs a differential inclusion that contains the unknown dynamics. Then, in a discrete-time setting, it overapproximates the reachable set through interval Taylor-based methods applied to systems with dynamics described as differential inclusions. We provide a bound on the time step size that ensures the correctness and termination of DaTaReach . DaTaControl enables convex-optimization-based control using the computed overapproximation and the receding-horizon control framework. Besides, DaTaControl achieves near-optimal control and is suitable for real-time control of such systems. We establish a bound on its suboptimality and the number of primitive operations it requires to compute control values. Then, we theoretically show that DaTaControl achieves tighter suboptimality bounds with an increasing amount of data and richer side information. Finally, experiments on a unicycle, quadrotor, and aircraft systems demonstrate the efficacy of both algorithms over existing approaches.},

Next, based on the estimated system model, we design a decentralized control policy that satisfies the desired information structure. We show that the suboptimality gap between our control policy and the optimal decentralized control policy (designed using accurate knowledge of the system model) scales linearly with the estimation error of the system model.

  abstract     = {The estimation of an unknown source coefficient and of the solution to a 1-D wave equation via exponentially convergent state observers is the problem under consideration in this work. The coefficient is assumed to depend on the space variable only and to be polynomial. The main observation information for this inverse problem is the value of the solution to the wave equation in a subinterval of the domain, including also some of its higher order spatial derivatives. In order to estimate the source coefficient, we turn it into a new state as in finite-dimensional parameter identification approaches. However in this infinite-dimensional setting, this requires the introduction of a novel indirect approach involving an infinite-dimensional state transformation. Sufficient conditions allow the design of a composite observer consisting of an internal observer, which estimates in higher regularity spatial norms both the source term and the solution on a subinterval, and a boundary observer, in order to eventually provide the estimation of the solution everywhere. The observer convergence is proven by means of Lyapunov analysis. An extension of this approach to the case of the identification of a potential in the wave equation is finally considered, which is a nonlinear inverse problem since here, in the equation, the unknown coefficient multiplies the solution.},

  abstract     = {Distributed optimization enables networked agents to cooperatively solve a global optimization problem. Despite making significant inroads, most existing results on distributed optimization rely on noise-free information sharing among the agents, which is problematic when communication channels are noisy, messages are coarsely quantized, or shared information are obscured by additive noise for the purpose of achieving differential privacy. The problem of information-sharing noise is particularly pronounced in the state-of-the-art gradient-tracking-based distributed optimization algorithms, in that information-sharing noise will accumulate with iterations on the gradient-tracking estimate of these algorithms, and the ensuing variance will even grow unbounded when the noise is persistent. This article proposes a new gradient-tracking-based distributed optimization approach that can avoid information-sharing noise from accumulating in the gradient estimation. The approach is applicable even when the interagent interaction is time-varying, which is key to enable the incorporation of a decaying factor in interagent interaction to gradually eliminate the influence of information-sharing noise. In fact, we rigorously prove that the proposed approach can ensure the almost sure convergence of all agents to the same optimal solution even in the presence of persistent information-sharing noise. The approach is applicable to general directed graphs. It is also capable of ensuring the almost sure convergence of all agents to an optimal solution when the gradients are noisy, which is common in machine learning applications. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

We say that a sparsity pattern has full structural rank if the maximal rank of matrices contained in it is $n$ . In this article, we investigate the degree of resilience of patterns with full structural rank: We address questions, such as how many $\star$ -entries can be removed without decreasing the structural rank and, reciprocally, how many $\star$ -entries one needs to add so as to increase the said degree of resilience to reach a target. Our approach goes by translating these questions into max-flow problems on appropriately defined bipartite graphs.

In practice, the dual decomposition algorithm is desired to admit an asynchronous implementation due to imperfect communication, such as time delay and packet drop. In addition, computational errors also exist when the individual agents solve their own subproblems. In this article, we analyze the convergence of the dual decomposition algorithm in the distributed optimization when both the communication asynchrony and the subproblem solution inexactness exist. We find that the interaction between asynchrony and inexactness slows down the convergence rate from $\mathcal {O} (1 / k)$ to $\mathcal {O} (1 / \sqrt{k})$ . Specifically, with a constant step size, the value of the objective function converges to a neighborhood of the optimal value, and the solution converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution. Moreover, the violation of the constraints diminishes in $\mathcal {O} (1 / \sqrt{k})$ . Our result generalizes and unifies the existing ones that only consider either asynchrony or inexactness.

We consider the presence of a passive intruder (eavesdropper) that knows the dynamic model of the system and can use the generated information flow to infer some “secret” of the system. A system is said to be opaque if it always holds the plausible deniability for its secret. Existing notions of opacity only consider secret either as currently visiting some secret states or as having visited some secret states in the past. In this article, we investigate information-flow security from a new angle by considering the secret of the system as the intention to execute some particular behavior of importance in the future. To this end, we propose a new class of opacity called pre-opacity that characterizes whether or not the intruder can predict the visit of secret states a certain number of steps ahead before the system actually does so. Depending the prediction task of the intruder, we propose two specific kinds of pre-opacity called $K$-step instant pre-opacity and $K$-step trajectory pre-opacity to specify this concept. For each notion of pre-opacity, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition as well as an effective verification algorithm. The complexity for the verification of pre-opacity is exponential in the size of the system as we show that pre-opacity is inherently PSPACE-hard. Finally, we generalize our setting to the case where the secret intention of the system is modeled as executing a particular sequence of events rather than visiting a secret state.},

In previous works, explicit system models are required to design a predictor-based resilient controller. These models can be either given a priori or obtained through a prior system identification step. Recent research efforts have focused on data-driven control based on precollected input–output trajectories (i.e., without explicit system models). In this article, we take an initial step toward data-driven stabilization of LTI systems under DoS attacks, and develop a resilient model predictive control scheme driven purely by data-dependent conditions. The proposed data-driven control method achieves the same level of resilience as the model-based control method. For example, local input-to-state stability (ISS) is achieved under mild assumptions on the noise and the DoS attacks. To recover global ISS, two modifications are further suggested at the price of reduced resilience against DoS attacks or increased computational complexity. Finally, a numerical example is given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

Despite its popularity, theoretical guarantees of this method, especially its finite-time performance, are mostly achieved for the linear case while the results for the nonlinear counterpart are very sparse. Motivated by the classic control theory for singularly perturbed systems, we study in this article the asymptotic convergence and finite-time analysis of the nonlinear two-time-scale stochastic approximation. Under some fairly standard assumptions, we provide a formula that explicitly characterizes the rate of convergence of the main iterates to the desired solutions. In particular, we show that the mean square error generated by the method convergences to zero at a rate ${\mathcal O}(1/k^{2/3})$ , where $k$ is the number of iterations.

This article investigates the problem of inner approximating robust reach-avoid sets for discrete-time polynomial dynamical systems subject to disturbances over open (i.e., not bounded a priori) time horizons. The robust reach-avoid set of interest is a set of all initial states such that the system starting from each of them should reach a target set within a bounded time horizon while staying inside a safe set before the first target hitting time, despite the actual disturbance. Based on a discounted value function and the dynamic programming principle, we show that the robust reach-avoid set can be characterized exactly via the unique bounded solution to a Bellman-type equation. Due to the insurmountable challenge in solving this equation analytically, we reformulate the Bellman-type equation such that its straightforward relaxation can result in a set of novel constraints for inner approximating the robust reach-avoid set. When the data involved are polynomials, i.e., the safe set, target set, and disturbance set are semialgebraic, the problem of solving this set of constraints can be encoded into a semidefinite program, which can be solved efficiently in polynomial time via interior point methods. Finally, several examples demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.},

The structures of the optimal strategy and the best linear strategy are characterized. It is shown that the major agent&#39;s optimal control action is a linear function of the major agent&#39;s minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimate of the system state while the minor agent&#39;s optimal control action is a linear function of the major agent&#39;s MMSE estimate of the system state and a “correction term” that depends on the difference of the minor agent&#39;s MMSE estimate of its local state and the major agent&#39;s MMSE estimate of the minor agent&#39;s local state. Since the noise is non-Gaussian, the minor agent&#39;s MMSE estimate is a nonlinear function of its observation. It is shown that replacing the minor agent&#39;s MMSE estimate with its linear least mean square estimate gives the best linear control strategy. The results are proved using a direct method based on conditional independence, common-information-based splitting of state and control actions, and simplifying the per-step cost based on conditional independence, orthogonality principle, and completion of squares.},

  abstract     = {Decentralized optimization, particularly the class of decentralized composite convex optimization (DCCO) problems, has found many applications. Due to ubiquitous communication congestion and random dropouts in practice, it is highly desirable to design decentralized algorithms that can handle stochastic communication networks. However, most existing algorithms for DCCO only work in networks that are deterministically connected during bounded communication rounds, and therefore, cannot be extended to stochastic networks. In this article, we propose a new decentralized dual averaging (DDA) algorithm that can solve DCCO in stochastic networks. Under a rather mild condition on stochastic networks, we show that the proposed algorithm attains global linear convergence if each local objective function is strongly convex. Our algorithm substantially improves the existing DDA-type algorithms as the latter were only known to converge sublinearly prior to our work. The key to achieving the improved rate is the design of a novel dynamic averaging consensus protocol for DDA, which intuitively leads to more accurate local estimates of the global dual variable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first linearly convergent DDA-type decentralized algorithm and also the first algorithm that attains global linear convergence for solving DCCO in stochastic networks. Numerical results are also presented to support our design and analysis.},

To reveal the global vulnerability of state omniscience, we investigate decentralized FDI (DFDI) attacks that destabilize the estimation error dynamics but eliminate their influences on the residual in each sensor node. First, the sufficiency and necessity for the existence of such attacks are studied from system eigenvalues and attackable sensors. Second, the self-generated DFDI attack sequences independent of system real-time data are designed to achieve the attack objective with elaborate parameters. Especially, the DFDI attack sequences are improved to maintain real values even if the system matrix only has unstable imaginary eigenvalues. Finally, we analyze the secure range for observer interaction weights and the sensor protection scheme to guarantee the security of state omniscience under DFDI attacks. The theoretical results for DFDI attacks are demonstrated with the linearized discrete-time model of an aircraft system.},

  abstract     = {We present a framework for systematically combining data of an unknown linear time-invariant system with prior knowledge on the system matrices or on the uncertainty for robust controller design. Our approach leads to linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based feasibility criteria that guarantee stability and performance robustly for all closed-loop systems consistent with the prior knowledge and the available data. The design procedures rely on a combination of multipliers inferred via prior knowledge and learnt from measured data, where for the latter, a novel and unifying disturbance description is employed. While large parts of the article focus on linear systems and input-state measurements, we also provide extensions to robust output-feedback design based on noisy input–output data and against nonlinear uncertainties. We illustrate through numerical examples that our approach provides a flexible framework for simultaneously leveraging prior knowledge and data, thereby reducing conservatism and improving performance significantly if compared to black-box approaches to data-driven control.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider a deterministic estimation problem to find the input and state of a linear dynamical system, which minimize a weighted integral squared error between the resulting output and the measured output. A completion of squares approach is used to find the unique optimum in terms of the solution of a Riccati differential equation. The optimal estimate is obtained from a two-stage procedure that is reminiscent of the Kalman filter. The first stage is an end-of-interval estimator for the finite horizon, which may be solved in real time as the horizon length increases. The second stage computes the unique optimum over a fixed horizon by a backward integration over the horizon. A related tracking problem is solved in an analogous manner. Making use of the solution to both the estimation and tracking problems, a constrained estimation problem is solved which shows that the Riccati equation solution has a least squares interpretation that is analogous to the meaning of the covariance matrix in stochastic filtering. This article shows that the estimation and tracking problems considered here include the Kalman filter and the linear quadratic regulator as special cases. The infinite horizon case is also considered for both the estimation and tracking problems. Stability and convergence conditions are provided and the optimal solutions are shown to take the form of left inverses of the original system.},

The presented algorithms work in time polynomial with respect to the representation of the model and they synthesize strategies ensuring that a given set of goal states will be reached (once or infinitely many times) with probability 1 without resource exhaustion. In particular, when the amount of resource becomes too low to safely continue in the mission, the strategy changes course of the agent toward one of a designated set of reload states where the agent replenishes the resource to full capacity; with a sufficient amount of resource, the agent attempts to fulfill the mission again. We also present two heuristics that attempt to reduce the expected time that the agent needs to fulfill the given mission, a parameter important in practical planning. The presented algorithms were implemented, and the numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness (in terms of computation time) of the planning approach based on consumption Markov decision processes and the positive impact of the two heuristics on planning in a realistic example.},

However, the theoretical analysis of SCP has received comparatively limited attention, and it is often restricted to discrete-time formulations. In this article, we present a unifying theoretical analysis of a fairly general class of SCP procedures for continuous-time optimal control problems. In addition to the derivation of convergence guarantees in a continuous-time setting, our analysis reveals two new numerical and practical insights. First, we show how one can more easily account for manifold-type constraints, which are a defining feature of optimal control of mechanical systems. Second, we show how our theoretical analysis can be leveraged to accelerate SCP-based optimal control methods by infusing techniques from indirect optimal control.},

We extend these results to the setting where each player has only partial information of the opponents’ decisions. In addition, by introducing an inverse Lipschitz property, we are able to extend the results to hypomonotone games. We modify Heavy Anchor via a distributed Laplacian feedback and show how we can exploit equilibrium-independent passivity properties to achieve convergence to the Nash equilibrium in hypomonotone regimes.},

Furthermore, we show that the equilibrium number of interventions by Player 2 is upper bounded. Furthermore, we specialize the obtained results in a scalar two-player linear–quadratic differential game. In this game, Player 1’s objective is to drive the state variable toward a specific target value, and Player 2 has a similar objective with a different target value. We provide, for the first time, an analytical characterization of the feedback Nash equilibrium in a linear–quadratic differential game with impulse control.

The new abstraction algorithm builds symbolic models with the same number of states but fewer transitions in comparison to the one produced by the standard algorithm. At the same time, the new abstract system is at least as controllable as the standard one. The proposed algorithm is based on the solution of a region-to-region control synthesis problem. This solution is formally obtained using the theory of viscosity solutions of the dynamic programming equation and the theory of differential equations with discontinuous righthand side. In the new abstraction algorithm, the symbolic controls are essentially the feedback controllers that solve this control synthesis problem. The improvement in the number of transitions is achieved by reducing the number of successors for each symbolic control. For a certain class of control systems, with a suitable set of discretization parameters, the new algorithm may even produce deterministic abstract systems or systems with a singleton input alphabet. The approach is illustrated by examples that compare the two abstraction algorithms},

We first transform the system to a time-delay system with the delay being the period of averaging, which can be regarded as a perturbation of the classical averaged system. The stability of the original system can be guaranteed by the resulting time-delay system. Then, under assumption of the classical averaged system being exponentially stable, we derive sufficient stability conditions for the resulting time-delay system, and find a quantitative upper bound on the small parameter that ensures the exponential stability. Moreover, we extend our method to input-to-state stability analysis of the perturbed systems. Finally, we apply the approach to the practical stability of discrete-time switched affine systems, where an explicit ultimate bound in terms of the switching period is presented. Two numerical examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of results.},

In the recent paper (Mukherjee and Pal, 2021), it has been shown that every autonomous $n$ -D system admits a minimal characteristic set that is the union of a sublattice (of rank equal to the Krull dimension of the system) and its finitely many parallel translates. Treating the restrictions of every solution trajectories to such a characteristic set as initial/boundary conditions, in this article, we provide a full parametrization of the set of all initial/boundary conditions of a discrete autonomous $n$ -D system. The key to this parametrization is that the set of allowable initial/boundary conditions itself can be viewed as a discrete $d$ -D system, where $d$ is the Krull dimension of the system: we prove this result here. An upshot of this parametrization is the answer to free assignability of these initial/boundary conditions.},

This article considers the identifiability of $Q$ / $R$ using the correlation-based measurement difference approach. More specifically, we establish 1) necessary conditions under which $Q$ and $R$ can be uniquely jointly identified; 2) necessary and sufficient conditions under which $Q$ can be uniquely identified, when $R$ is known; 3) necessary conditions under which $R$ can be uniquely identified, when $Q$ is known. It will also be shown that for achieving the results mentioned above, the measurement difference approach requires some decoupling conditions for constructing a stationary time series, which are proved to be sufficient for the well-known strong detectability requirements established by Hautus.},

Roughly speaking, the formula $p \,\mathcal {U} q$ is satisfied means that the solutions, initially satisfying proposition $p$ , keep satisfying this proposition until proposition $q$ is satisfied. To certify such a formula, connections to invariance notions—specifically, conditional invariance and eventual conditional invariance—as well as finite-time convergence properties are established. As a result, sufficient conditions involving the data of the hybrid system and an appropriate choice of Lyapunov-like functions, such as barrier functions, are derived. Examples illustrate the results throughout the article.},

  abstract     = {Deception is a useful tool in situations where an agent operates in the presence of its adversaries. We consider a setting where a supervisor provides a reference policy to an agent, expects the agent to operate in an environment by following the reference policy, and partially observes the agent&#39;s behavior. The agent instead follows a different deceptive policy to achieve a different task. We model the environment with a Markov decision process and study the synthesis of optimal deceptive policies under partial observability. We formalize the notion of deception as a hypothesis testing problem and show that the synthesis of optimal deceptive policies is nondeterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard). As an approximation, we consider the class of mixture policies, which provides a convex optimization formulation of the deception problem. We give an algorithm that converges to the optimal mixture policy. We also consider a special class of Markov decision processes where the transition and observation functions are deterministic. For this case, we give a randomized algorithm for path planning that generates a path for the agent in polynomial time and achieves the optimal value for the considered objective function.},

We assume mixed-observable settings, where the system&#39;s state is fully observable and the environment&#39;s state defining the goal location is only partially observed. In these settings, the planning problem is an infinite-dimensional optimization problem where the objective is to minimize the expected cost. We show how to reformulate the control problem as a finite-dimensional deterministic problem by optimizing over a trajectory tree. Leveraging this result, we demonstrate that when the environment is static, the observation model piecewise, and cost function convex, the original control problem can be reformulated as a mixed-integer convex program that can be solved to global optimality using a branch-and-bound algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on navigation tasks, where the goal location should be inferred through noisy measurements.},

It is further shown that an equivalent discretization of the generalized plant exists, which means that the aforementioned discrete-time system can be represented as the feedback connection of the discretized plant and the same discrete-time controller as the one in the sampled-data system. It is also shown that the supremum of the quasi $L_{2}/L_{2}$ Hankel norms at ${\mathit {\Theta }}$ belonging to a sampling interval is actually attained as the maximum, which means that what is called a critical instant always exists and the $L_{2}/L_{2}$ Hankel operator is always definable (as the quasi $L_{2}/L_{2}$ Hankel operator at the critical instant).

For stable systems, the designed encryption strategies can effectively impair the eavesdropper’s estimation performance. For unstable systems, the encryption can be designed to make the eavesdropper’s estimation error covariance divergent.

In the online stage using the precomputed low-rank approximation tensors, we can quickly solve the FKE given new observation data. Therefore, we can solve the NLF problem in a real-time manner.

While $R_{0}$ is widely known to scientists, policymakers, and the general public, it has received comparatively little attention in the controls community. This note provides two novel characterizations of $R_{0}$ : a stability characterization and a geometric program characterization. The geometric program characterization allows us to write $R_{0}$ -constrained and budget-constrained optimal resource allocation problems as geometric programs, which are easily transformed into convex optimization problems. We apply these programs to allocating vaccines and antidotes in numerical examples, finding that targeting $R_{0}$ instead of the spectral abscissa of the Jacobian matrix (a common target in the controls literature) leads to qualitatively different solutions.},

In this class of CPSs, network attacks can break the feedback loop at two different points for an arbitrarily long period. In this scenario, we design a novel control architecture that, by taking a worst-case approach, aims to preserve the safety of the systems while minimizing, whenever possible, the tracking performance degradation. On the plant side, a local safety controller is designed to take care of attacks on the actuation channel. In particular, given a finite number of predetermined admissible safe equilibrium points, this unit exploits a Voronoi partition of the state space and a family of dual-model set-theoretic model predictive controllers to safely confine, in a finite number of steps, the system into the closest robust control invariant region. On the other hand, on the controller side, the reference tracking controller operations are enhanced with an add-on module in charge of dealing with attack occurrences on the measurement channel. Specifically, by leveraging the Voronoi partition used on the plant’s side and reachability arguments, the objective of this unit is to reduce the performance loss by allowing a supervised system evolution until the best outcome in terms of tracking is achieved. The obtained theoretical results are proved and the solution’s effectiveness is shown through a simulation example.},

It is shown that, under certain conditions satisfied by several protocols reported in the literature, consensus in MAS can be ensured by studying a set comprising a small number of quasipolynomials of reduced complexity. Specifically, if the graph is undirected, it suffices to guarantee the stability of only two quasipolynomials in the set. If the graph is directed, then the set consists of a family of quasipolynomials, possibly two as well, associated with a polytope enclosing the eigenvalues of a Laplacian-like matrix.

The goal is to design directly from the input and state sequences a controller that enforces a certain performance specification on the transient behavior of the unknown system. The performance specification is expressed through a subset of the complex plane where closed-loop eigenvalues need to belong, a so called linear matrix inequality (LMI) region. For this control design problem, we provide here convex programs to enforce the performance specification from data in the form of LMIs. For generic LMI regions, these are sufficient conditions to assign the eigenvalues within the LMI region for all possible dynamics consistent with data, and become necessary and sufficient conditions for special LMI regions. In this way, we extend classical model-based conditions from a work in the literature to the setting of data-driven control from noisy data. Numerical examples substantiate the analysis.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes an adaptive subsystem-based control (SBC) for systematic and straightforward nonlinear control of n th-order strict-feedback form (SFF) systems. By decomposing the SFF system to subsystems, a generic term (namely stability connector) can be created to address dynamic interactions between the subsystems. This 1) enables modular control design with global asymptotic stability, 2) such that the control design and its stability analysis can be performed locally at a subsystem level, 3) while avoiding an excessive growth of the control design complexity when the system order n increases. The abovementioned properties make the proposed method suitable especially for high-order systems. We also design a smooth projection function for the system parametric uncertainties. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated in simulations with a nonlinear fifth-order system.},

We define two novel notions of critical observability called first, the $k$-step critical observability that requires that the critical states can be distinguished from noncritical ones after a loss of consecutive $k$ events, and second, the definite critical observability that is a generalization of $k$ -step critical observability for all nonnegative integers $k$ . Then, a structure called $k$-extended detector is proposed. Necessary and sufficient conditions for $k$ -step critical observability are derived, which can be verified with polynomial complexity. Moreover, we prove that the definite critical observability can be verified by checking the $(\frac{1}{2}(|Q|^{2}+|Q|))$ -step critical observability, where $Q$ is the set of states of a plant. For a plant that is not definitely critically observable, a polynomial algorithm has been proposed to obtain a maximal nonnegative integer $k_{\text{max}}$ (if it exists) such that the plant is $k_{\text{max}}$ -step critically observable.},

We derive the equivalence between the two types of informativity based on a newly introduced vector autoregressive with exogenous input (VARX) framework, which is suitable for time-domain analyses, such as state-space models, while directly representing input–output characteristics, such as transfer functions. Moreover, we show a duality between the characterization of all VARX models explaining data and that of all VARX controllers stabilizing such VARX models.},

For this problem, the recursive expression of the system state conditioned on the event-triggered measurement information is constructed under a suitably designed reference probability measure, based on which the event-based minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimate for the considered estimation problem is further obtained.

By introducing the embedded point iteration step, the proposed recursive algorithm can properly exploit the coupling relationship of linear parameters and nonlinear parameters.

First, a novel event-based adaptive distributed observer with time-dependent power functions as the event-triggering threshold is proposed to estimate the exosystem matrix and the exogenous signal simultaneously. A new analytical method based on the weighted mean-value theorem for integrals and Bellman–Gronwall lemma is developed to prove that the estimation errors converge to zero asymptotically. Second, a distributed dynamic control law is proposed based on the event-based adaptive observer, and it is shown that the tracking errors of the resulting closed-loop system converge to zero asymptotically. Two distinctive advantages of this work are that 1) the event-triggered control protocol is fully distributed, and 2) a positive minimum inter-event time is explicitly given so that Zeno behavior is strictly excluded. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed fully distributed ETC protocol is illustrated by a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {In the model predictive control formulations of trajectory tracking problems, infeasible reference trajectories and a priori unknown constraints can lead to cumbersome designs, aggressive tracking, and loss of recursive feasibility. This is the case, for example, in trajectory tracking applications for mobile systems in the presence of constraints that are not fully known a priori. In this article, we propose a new framework called model predictive flexible trajectory tracking control, which relaxes the trajectory tracking requirement. In addition, we accommodate recursive feasibility in the presence of a priori unknown constraints, which might render the reference trajectory infeasible. In the proposed framework, constraint satisfaction is guaranteed at all times while the reference trajectory is tracked as good as constraint satisfaction allows, thus simplifying the controller design and reducing possibly aggressive tracking behavior. The proposed framework is illustrated with three numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the optimal control of linear systems over wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels, where the wireless MIMO fading and random access of the remote controller may cause intermittent controllability or uncontrollability of the closed-loop control system. We consider the finite-time horizon optimal control first and then check the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of optimal control for the infinite-time horizon case. Specifically, for the finite-time horizon case, we show that the optimal control gain matrix can be computed offline based on the distribution of the wireless MIMO fading and random access of the controller. For the infinite-time horizon case, we show that, when the closed-loop system is almost surely controllable, the optimal control solution always exists and is unique. In the case that MIMO fading channels and the random access of the remote controller destroy the closed-loop controllability, we propose a novel controllable and uncontrollable positive semidefinite cone decomposition induced by the singular value decomposition of the MIMO fading channel contaminated control input matrix. This enables a closed-form characterization of the sufficient condition for both the existence and the uniqueness of the optimal control solution. The closed-form sufficient condition reveals the fact that the optimal control action may still exist even if the closed-loop system suffers from intermittent controllability or almost sure uncontrollability. We further propose a novel stochastic approximation (SA)-based online learning algorithm that can learn the optimal control action on the fly based on the plant state observations. We finally extend the technical results to the case in which the channel state information (CSI) is unavailable at the controller. We show that the sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of the optimal control solution is more difficult to satisfy due to the penalty caused by the unknown CSI. The proposed scheme is also compared with various baselines, and we show that significant performance gains can be achieved.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the problem of safety-critical control for multiagent systems with unknown dynamics in unknown environments. It has been shown that stabilizing affine control systems to desired (sets of) states while optimizing quadratic costs subject to state and control constraints can be reduced to a sequence of quadratic programs (QPs) by using control barrier functions (CBFs) and control Lyapunov functions (CLFs). One of the main challenges in this approach is obtaining accurate system dynamics of all components in the system, which is especially difficult when online model identification is required given limited computational resources and system data. We address this problem by proposing a robust framework (to unknown dynamics including uncertainties) through defining adaptive affine control dynamics that are updated based on the error states obtained by real-time sensor measurements. We define a CBF for a safety requirement on the unmodeled agents based on the adaptive dynamics and error states, and reformulate the safety-critical control problem as the abovementioned sequence of QPs. Then, we determine a set of events that trigger the QPs and ensure safety when solving them. We also derive a condition that guarantees the satisfaction of a CBF constraint between events. The proposed framework can also be used for state convergence guarantees for systems with unknown dynamics based on CLFs. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on a robot control problem, an adaptive cruise control problem and a traffic merging problem using autonomous vehicles. We also compare the proposed event-driven method with the classical time-driven approach.},

We not only show that EDAS asymptotically achieves the same network independent convergence rate as centralized stochastic gradient descent for minimizing strongly convex and smooth objective functions, but also characterize the transient time needed for the algorithm to approach the asymptotic convergence rate, which behaves as $K_{T}=\mathcal {O}\left(\frac{n}{1-\lambda _{2}}\right)$ , where $1-\lambda _{2}$ stands for the spectral gap of the mixing matrix. To the best of our knowledge, EDAS achieves the shortest transient time when the average of the $n$ cost functions is strongly convex and each cost function is smooth.

Second, the relation between the solvability of the cross-coupled generalized Lyapunov equations and the exact observability, exact detectability, and stability of the mean-field dynamic system is well characterized. It is then shown that the cross-coupled algebraic Riccati equations (CC-AREs) admit a unique positive-definite (positive-semidefinite, respectively) solution under exact observability (exact detectability, respectively), which is also a feedback stabilizing solution. Furthermore, all the Pareto optimal strategies and solutions can be, respectively, derived via the solutions to the weighted CC-AREs and the weighted cross-coupled algebraic Lyapunov equations.

By virtue of disclosure resources of reliable sensors and disruption resources of unreliable ones, a stealthy linear attack strategy is given, which can deceive the anomaly detectors and degrade the estimation performance. In this article, we obtain feasible criteria under which such attack policies can bypass existing detectors. The evolution of estimation error covariance at the remote end under the attacks is analyzed. Then, a closed-form expression of the optimal linear deception attack maximizing estimation error covariance is derived.

The linear Gaussian dynamics characterizes a large number of interacting agents evolving under a centralized control and external disturbances. The aggregate state of the agents is only partially known to the centralized controller by means of the samples taken randomly in time and from anonymous randomly selected agents. Due to the removal of the agent identity from the samples, the observation set has a non-Gaussian structure, and as a consequence, the optimal control law that minimizes a quadratic cost is essentially nonlinear and infinite-dimensional, for any finite number of agents. For infinitely many agents, however, this article shows that the optimal control law is the solution to a reduced order, finite-dimensional linear quadratic Gaussian problem with Gaussian observations sampled only in time. For this problem, the separation principle holds and is used to develop an explicit optimal control law by combining a linear quadratic regulator with a separately designed finite-dimensional minimum mean square error state estimator. Conditions are presented under which this simple optimal control law can be adopted as a suboptimal control law for finitely many agents.},

The mobile Attacker seeks to reach the perimeter of the circular target, whereas the Defender(s) seeks to align itself with the Attacker, thereby ending the game. In the former case, the Attacker-wins, and the Attacker and Defender play a zero-sum differential game where the payoff/cost is the terminal angular separation.

  abstract     = {By enabling multiple agents to cooperatively solve a global optimization problem in the absence of a central coordinator, decentralized stochastic optimization is gaining increasing attention in areas as diverse as machine learning, control, and sensor networks. Since the associated data usually contain sensitive information, such as user locations and personal identities, privacy protection has emerged as a crucial need in the implementation of decentralized stochastic optimization. In this article, we propose a decentralized stochastic optimization algorithm that is able to guarantee provable convergence accuracy even in the presence of aggressive quantization errors that are proportional to the amplitude of quantization inputs. The result applies to both convex and nonconvex objective functions, and enables us to exploit aggressive quantization schemes to obfuscate shared information and, hence, enables privacy protection without losing provable optimization accuracy. In fact, by using a stochastic ternary quantization scheme, which quantizes any value to three numerical levels, we achieve quantization-based rigorous differential privacy in decentralized stochastic optimization, which has not been reported before. In combination with the presented quantization scheme, the proposed algorithm ensures, for the first time, rigorous differential privacy in decentralized stochastic optimization without losing provable convergence accuracy. Simulation results for a distributed estimation problem as well as numerical experiments for decentralized learning on a benchmark machine learning dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The proposed algorithm employs knowledge regarding the constraints on states and control inputs to extrapolate their admissible values in the entire predictive horizon. The Kalman filter is utilized to estimate the system states, introducing estimated error. The error and disturbance are both involved in the time-varying tubes to construct the tightened constraints. For each follower, by penalizing the control input difference from its neighbors’ control inputs and the deviation of the states from the convex hull produced by its neighbors’ states, the containment problem is optimized only by utilizing the local nominal state and control sequences. To overcome the problem that followers may fall slightly out of the convex hull of the leaders caused by disturbance, a full containment control algorithm is introduced by designing a tightened convex hull. Then the recursive feasibility and robust stability are proved through the design of proper distributed terminal controllers and constraints.

  abstract     = {This article investigates a two-timescale opinion dynamics model, named the concatenated Friedkin–Johnsen (FJ) model, which describes the evolution of the opinions of a group of agents over a sequence of discussion events. The topology of the underlying graph changes with the event, in the sense that the agents can participate or less to an event, and the agents are stubborn, with stubbornness that can vary from one event to the other. Concatenation refers to the fact that the final opinions of an event become initial conditions of the next event. We show that a concatenated FJ model can be represented as a time-varying product of stochastic transition matrices having a special form. Conditions are investigated under which a concatenated FJ model can achieve consensus in spite of the stubbornness. Four different sufficient conditions are obtained, mainly based on the special topological structure of our stochastic matrices.},

We focus on the case when the continuous system is not stabilizable by linear or smooth feedback, and thus, local exponential stabilizability is not fulfilled. With the aid of the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method and weighted homogeneity, we prove that for a multi-input multi-output nonlinear system with homogeneous degree zero, global asymptotic stabilizability by nonsmooth but Hölder continuous state or output feedback implies global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system with input delay, i.e., global input delay tolerance (GIDT). We then illustrate applications of the obtained GIDT results to significant classes of time-delay nonlinear systems with uncontrollable/unobservable linearization, including but not limited to a chain of nonlinear integrators, higher order systems with a lower or upper triangular structure, and beyond.},

This result is used to provide Lyapunov theorems for finite time stability in probability for Itô-type stationary nonlinear stochastic difference equations involving Lyapunov difference conditions on the minimum of the Lyapunov function itself along with a fractional power of the Lyapunov function. In addition, we establish sufficient conditions for almost sure lower semicontinuity of the stochastic settling-time capturing the average settling time behavior of the discrete-time nonlinear stochastic dynamical system. Furthermore, a stochastic finite-time optimal control framework is developed by exploiting connections between Lyapunov theory for finite time stability in probability and stochastic Bellman theory. In particular, we show that finite time stability in probability of the closed-loop nonlinear system is guaranteed by means of a Lyapunov function that can clearly be seen to be the solution to the steady state form of the stochastic Bellman equation, and hence, guaranteeing both stochastic finite time stability and optimality.},

Two sufficient linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions are proposed for establishing robust structural stability obtained by introducing an equivalent closed-loop complex system and by searching for real or complex structured Lyapunov functions and matrix annihilators parameterized by the uncertainties and auxiliary quantities. Moreover, it is shown that lower bounds of the introduced robust structural stability margins and maximum uncertainty amplification can be obtained by solving quasi-convex optimization problems under some restrictions on the sought Lyapunov functions or on the set of uncertainties.

The Kullback–Leibler divergence between the compromised innovation and nominal one is utilized as the stealthiness measure. Without presupposing a linear attack model, the optimal attack policy that can cause maximum performance loss and deceive the false data detector is derived. For both attacks with strict and relaxed stealthiness, the optimal compromised innovation, which is shown to be generated by a linear time-varying system, can be determined with two steps. First, the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimate of the prediction error is obtained using attackers&#39; available information. Then, the faked innovation is designed as a linear transformation of the MMSE estimate. Within a unified framework, this separation principle enables handling more general attack scenarios, where the attacker may obtain more (or less) measurement data than the remote estimator. The optimality of the information-based strategy is verified by theoretical analysis, numerical examples, as well as comparative studies with existing methods.},

Different from most studied distributed optimization problems with time-invariant objective functions and constraints, the optimal solutions in this article are time varying and form a trajectory. First, for the case where there exist only time-varying nonlinear inequality constraints, we present a distributed control algorithm that consists of a sliding-mode consensus part and a Hessian-based optimization part coupled with the log-barrier penalty functions. The algorithm can guarantee the asymptotical tracking of the optimal solution with a zero tracking error. Second, we extend the previous result to the case where there exist not only time-varying nonlinear inequality constraints but also linear equality constraints. An extended algorithm is presented, where quadratic penalty functions are introduced to account for the equality constraints and an adaptive control gain is designed to remove the restriction on knowing the upper bounds on certain information. The asymptotical convergence of the extended algorithm to the vicinity of the optimal solution is studied under suitable assumptions. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is illustrated in simulation. In addition, one proposed algorithm is applied to a multirobot multitarget navigation problem with experimental demonstration on a multicrazyflie platform to validate the theoretical results.},

Different from most existing works, system dynamic knowledge of the leader node is unaccessible to any follower node in our article. Distributed adaptive observers are designed for all follower nodes to simultaneously estimate the state and parameters of the leader node. The observer design does not rely on the frequency knowledge of the leader node, and the estimation errors are shown to converge to zero exponentially. Moreover, the results are applied to general directed graphs, where the symmetry of Laplacian matrix does not hold. This is due to two newly developed Lyapunov equations, which solely depend on communication network topologies. Interestingly, using these Lyapunov equations, many results of multiagent systems over undirected graphs can be extended to general directed graphs. Finally, this article also advances the knowledge base of adaptive control systems by providing a main tool in the analysis of parameter convergence for adaptive observers.},

Feedback control design in the presence of measurement noise can benefit from the framework immediately if plants are nonlinear, irrespective of application areas. This article proposes a toolkit for providing robustness guarantees in observer-based output feedback control subject to measurement noise. For a nonlinear plant, the couplings among the plant state, the estimation error, and the measurement noise arising in the closed-loop equations often hinder global analysis, such as ISS with respect to the measurement noise. In the formalism of iISS, this article demonstrates that the flexibility in dealing with the couplings allows one to establish the robustness globally. Moreover, it gives a condition under which the closed-loop system can possess ISS and strong iISS, which are stronger than iISS.},

The proposed HAC is applied to a nonlinear converter model that is connected to an infinite bus or a center-of-inertia dynamic grid models. We provide parametric sufficient existence, uniqueness, stability, and boundedness conditions that are met by appropriate choice of control parameters. Next, we take into account the safety constraints of power converter, and synthesize a new current-limiting control that is compatible with HAC. Last, we present details on the practical implementation of HAC that are followed by a robustness analysis (which showcases a theory–practice gap), uncover the HAC droop behavior, derive a feedforward-like ac voltage and power control, and illustrate the behavior of the system with simulation case studies.},

Typically, the constrained RMPC problem with state-feedback parameterizations is nonlinear (and nonconvex) with a prohibitively high computational burden for online implementation. To remedy this, a novel approach is proposed to linearize the state-feedback RMPC problem, with minimal conservatism, through the use of semidefinite relaxation techniques. The proposed algorithm computes the state-feedback gain and perturbation online by solving a linear matrix inequality optimization that, in comparison to other schemes in the literature is shown to have a substantially reduced computational burden without adversely affecting the tracking performance of the controller. Additionally, an offline strategy that provides initial feasibility on the RMPC problem is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through numerical examples from the literature.},

Moreover, a dual-mode ETMPC algorithm is developed, and sufficient conditions on the algorithm feasibility and the system robust stability are provided.

For upper triangular nonlinear systems, we propose a new low-gain domination design, the advantage of which is that it can effectively deal with the sensor noise with arbitrarily large intensities. These two designs can both ensure that the closed-loop system has an almost surely unique global solution; the origin of the closed-loop system is mean-square stable, and the states can be regulated to zero almost surely.

The newly designed control scheme cannot only circumvent the problem of the explosion of complexity, but also remove the singularity issue typical of conventional backstepping technique. In the meanwhile, an event-triggered mechanism with a dynamic threshold is devised to reduce the waste of network resources.

By designing a new shift function and with the aid of barrier functions, the constrained system is transformed into an unconstrained one. A new disturbance observer is then designed to estimate unknown disturbances. The resultant control method is able to not only address the OCOLT, but also deal with the constraint-free output case and the infinite-time constrained one (i.e., constraints existing for all $t\geq 0$ ) without the need to revise the control structure.

Using appropriate semidefinite positive matrix constraints, an SDP moment-based approach can be used to compute moments of the exit time. However, the approach is impeded when analyzing higher dimensional physical systems as the dynamics are limited to polynomials. Computational scalability is also poor as the dimensionality of the state grows, largely due to the combinatorial growth of the optimization program. We propose methods to make feasible the safety analysis of higher dimensional physical systems. The restriction to polynomial dynamics is lifted by using state augmentation, which allows one to generate the optimization for a broader class of nonlinear stochastic systems. We then reformulate the constraints to mitigate the computational limitations associated with an increase in state dimensionality. We employ our methods on two example processes to characterize their safety via exit times and show the ability to handle multidimensional systems that were previously unsupported by the existing SDP method of moments.},

In previous work, finite-state abstractions were created, capturing the sampling behavior of linear time-invariant (LTI) ETC systems with quadratic triggering functions. Offering an infinite-horizon look to ETC systems’ sampling patterns, such abstractions can be used for scheduling of ETC traffic. Here, we significantly extend this framework, by abstracting perturbed uncertain nonlinear ETC systems with general triggering functions. To construct an ETC system’s abstraction: 1) the state space is partitioned into regions; 2) for each region, an interval is determined, containing all intersampling times of points in the region; and 3) the abstraction’s transitions are determined through reachability analysis. To determine intervals and transitions, we devise algorithms based on reachability analysis. For partitioning, we propose an approach based on isochronous manifolds, resulting into tighter intervals and providing control over them, thus containing the abstraction’s nondeterminism. Simulations showcase our developments.},

Agents in a network want to minimize the sum of local cost functions, each one depending both on a local optimization variable, subject to a local constraint, and on an aggregated version of all the variables (e.g., the mean). We focus on a challenging online scenario in which the cost, the aggregation functions, and the constraints can all change over time, thus enlarging the class of captured applications. Inspired by an existing scheme, we propose a distributed algorithm with constant step size, named projected aggregative tracking, to solve the online optimization problem. We prove that the dynamic regret is bounded by a constant term and a term related to time variations. Moreover, in the static case (i.e., with constant cost and constraints), the solution estimates are proved to converge with a linear rate to the optimal solution. Finally, numerical examples show the efficacy of the proposed approach on a robotic surveillance scenario.},

We consider a nonstandard optimal control problem in which the goal is to minimize the CVaR of a maximum random cost subject to a Borel-space Markov decision process. The objective represents the maximum departure from a desired operating region averaged over a given fraction of the worst cases. This problem provides a safety criterion for a stochastic system that is informed by both the probability and severity of the potential consequences of the system’s behavior. In contrast, existing safety analysis frameworks apply stagewise risk constraints or assess the probability of constraint violation without quantifying the potential severity of the violation. To the best of our knowledge, the problem of interest has not been solved. To solve the problem, we propose and study a family of stochastic dynamic programs on an augmented state space. We prove that the optimal CVaR of a maximum random cost enjoys an equivalent representation in terms of the solutions to these dynamic programs under appropriate assumptions. For each dynamic program, we show the existence of an optimal policy that depends on the dynamics of an augmented state under the assumptions. In a numerical example, we illustrate how our safety analysis framework is useful for assessing the severity of combined sewer overflows under precipitation uncertainty.},

Conversely, the goal of the attacker is to disrupt the system&#39;s performance by leveraging its significant information advantage against the defender. Both players implement their policies in a moving horizon fashion, according to the principles of receding horizon control. However, because the defender has no access to the full state of the system, it concurrently employs receding horizon estimation to overcome this limitation. Rigorous theoretical analysis shows that such a concurrent policy can guarantee closed-loop boundedness, despite the stealthy attacks and the information disadvantage.

  abstract     = {It is known that discrete-time controllers, whose state matrices have no noninteger element, are beneficial in homomorphic-based encrypted control systems. Nevertheless, it has been recently shown that possessing state matrices with integer elements usually yields unstable discrete-time controllers. In this article, we investigate the problem from a nonminimality perspective. It is shown that nonminimal realizations, in comparison to minimal ones, can theoretically provide a wider framework to obtain controllers having state matrices with integer elements. However, in the case of dealing with bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stable controllers, this framework cannot preserve internal stability. But, benefiting from the introduced framework, a class of unstable controllers is introduced, which can be realized by state-space forms having state matrices with integer elements. Numerical examples are presented to verify the usefulness of the introduced framework in the realization of unstable controllers with integer state matrices.},

  abstract     = {For control systems where the closed-loop system description is governed by linear delay-differential equations of neutral type, it is known that stability may be fragile, in the sense of sensitive to infinitesimal perturbations to parameters in the system model or arbitrarily small errors in the implementation of the controller. A natural approach to resolve this problem of ill-posedness and to break down the underlying instability mechanisms, rooted in characteristic roots moving from the left plane to the right one via the point at infinity, consists of including a low-pass filter in the control loop, provided the inclusion preserves stability. Independently of the particular control problem, the addition of a low-pass filter essentially boils down to a “regularization” of delay-difference equations and delay equations of neutral type in terms of parametrized delay equations of retarded type, where the parameter can be interpreted as the inverse of the filter&#39;s cut-off frequency. In this article, the stability properties of these parametrized delay equations are analyzed in a general, multidelay setting, with focus on the transition to the original delay-difference or neutral equations. It is illustrated that the spectral abscissa may not be continuous at the transition, which may impact stability. Hence, conditions for preservation of stability in terms of a robustified stability indicator called filtered spectral abscissa are presented, for which mathematical characterizations and a computationally tractable expression are provided. The application of a proportional-derivative (PD) controller to a time-delay system with relative degree one is used to motivate the structure of the equations studied throughout this article, and to explicate the implications of the presented results on control design, discussed in the last section.},

First, a decoupling method in the setting of directed networks is employed to decompose networked SPSs related to complex eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix. Then, based on an improved piecewise continuous Lyapunov function, an $\varepsilon$ -dependent synchronization criterion is established. The relationship among the impulse interval, the impulse gain matrix, and $\varepsilon$ is revealed. By employing the newly obtained synchronization criterion, some sufficient conditions on the existence of an $\varepsilon$ -dependent impulse gain matrix are derived.

Different from the design of offline attacks, which is only based on the system&#39;s model, to design the online attack, the attacker also estimates the system&#39;s state with the intercepted data at each instant and computes the optimal attack accordingly. To ensure stealthiness, the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the innovations with and without attacks at each instant should be smaller than a threshold. We show that the attacker should solve a convex optimization problem at each instant to compute the mean and covariance of the attack. The feasibility of the attack policy is also discussed. Furthermore, for the strictly stealthy case with zero threshold, the analytical expression of the unique optimal attack is given. Finally, a numerical example of the longitudinal flight control system is adopted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack.},

The topology of the sensor graph among all robots is described by a directed graph containing a spanning tree, and the node denoting the center is only required to be globally reachable in the sensor graph. A dynamic control law is developed such that the multi-robot systems with speed constraint are able to globally converge to a circular formation prescribed by a stationary center, a radius, and a spacing configuration. Remarkably, the proposed control law does not rely on any communication, and only requires each robot to use local measurements with respect to its neighbors based on its local coordinate frame, which makes it feasible to implement this control law in a decentralized manner. The global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop multi-robot system is established by small-gain theorem of which the small-gain condition is guaranteed by a low gain parameter in the designed observer.},

For rigid joint robot manipulators, global nonlinear proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers have been introduced few years ago. However, for the case of flexible joint robot manipulators, the design and analysis of such nonlinear PID laws is much more challenging. Only local asymptotic stability results have been reported. Thus, a novel global regulator for flexible joint robots is presented in this document. The proposed controller considers a nonlinear integral action and it requires only motor position measurements because an estimator subsystem is used to replace the motor velocity measurements. In other words, a nonlinear proportional–integral–“derivative” (PI“D”)-type controller is introduced. According to the closed-loop system analysis, conditions on the controller gains are established. Thus, the global asymptotic stability is concluded. Finally, experimental results on a two degrees-of-freedom serial flexible joint robot are shown and discussed.},

However, the characterization of the set of globally optimal solutions in this tradeoff for multidimensional Gauss–Markov processes has been an open problem. In this article, we characterize a policy profile that belongs to this set without imposing any restrictions on the information structure or the policy structure. We prove that such a policy profile consists of a symmetric threshold triggering policy based on the value of information and a certainty-equivalent control policy based on a non-Gaussian linear estimator. These policies are deterministic and can be designed separately. Besides, we provide a global optimality analysis for the value of information $\mathbf{{VoI}}_{{\boldsymbol{k}}}$ , a semantic metric that emerges from the rate-regulation tradeoff as the difference between the benefit and the cost of a data packet. We prove that it is globally optimal that a data packet containing sensory information at time ${\boldsymbol{k}}$ be transmitted to the controller only if $\mathbf{{VoI}}_{{\boldsymbol{k}}}$ becomes nonnegative. These findings have important implications in the areas of communication and control.},

We propose an adaptive event-triggered prescribed-time control scheme for nonlinear systems with asymmetric output constraints, using an exponential-type barrier Lyapunov function. We show that this PPTS control scheme can guarantee tracking error convergence performance, while restricting the output state according to the prescribed asymmetric constraints. Compared with traditional finite/fixed-time control, the proposed methodology yields separately user-defined settling time and convergence domain without the prior information on disturbance. Moreover, asymmetric state constraints can be handled in the control structure through bias state transformation, which offers an intuitive analysis technique for general constraint issues.

A model-based approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach, which is facilitated using a concurrent learning-based system identifier, approximates the optimal value function. To reduce the computational complexity of model-based ADP, the state space is segmented into user-defined segments (i.e., regions). Off-policy trajectories are selected within each segment to facilitate learning of the value function weight estimates; this process is called Bellman error (BE) extrapolation. Within certain segments of the state space, sparse neural networks are used to reduce the computational expense of BE extrapolation. Discontinuities occur in the weight update laws since different groupings of extrapolated BE trajectories are active in certain regions of the state space. A Lyapunov-like stability analysis is presented to prove boundedness of the overall system in the presence of discontinuities. Simulation results are included to demonstrate the performance and validity of the developed method. The simulation results demonstrate that using the sparse, switched BE extrapolation method developed in this article reduces the computation time by 85.6\% when compared to the traditional BE extrapolation method.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the finite-horizon $H_{\infty }$ filtering problem for a class of discrete time-varying nonlinear systems over high-rate networks whose signal exchanges are scheduled by the FlexRay protocol. To improve the efficiency of the data transmission, a high-rate network is deployed for the measurement signals to be broadcasted from the sensors to the filter. The FlexRay protocol is embedded into the high-rate network to orchestrate the transmission rule of the signals with different attributes, thereby further enhancing the transmission flexibility. On the basis of the round-robin and try-once-discard protocols, a novel FlexRay-protocol-based measurement model is proposed by using certain data holding strategies. A sufficient condition is provided to guarantee that the filtering error dynamics meets the desirable disturbance attenuation level against exogenous disturbances over a finite horizon. The parameterized form of the filter gain is attained by the solutions to some matrix inequalities. Numerical simulation is carried out to substantiate the proposed filter design algorithm.},

Typically, the disturbance set is either assumed to be known a priori or estimated from data through set-membership identification. However, the problem of computing a suitable input disturbance set in case the set of possible output values is assigned a priori has received relatively little attention. This problem arises in many contexts, such as in supervisory control, actuator design, decentralized control, and others. In this article, we propose a method to compute input disturbance sets (and the corresponding set of states) such that the resulting set of outputs matches as closely as possible a given set of outputs, while additionally satisfying strict (inner or outer) inclusion constraints. We formulate the problem as an optimization problem by relying on the concept of robust invariance. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated in numerical examples that illustrate how to solve safe reference set and input constraint set computation problems.},

We encode the estimation objectives via the smoother entropy , which is the conditional entropy of the state trajectory given measurements and controls. Consideration of the smoother entropy contrasts with previous approaches that instead resort to marginal (or instantaneous) state entropies due to tractability concerns. By establishing novel expressions for the smoother entropy in terms of the POMDP belief state, we show that both the problems of minimizing and maximizing the smoother entropy in POMDPs can surprisingly be reformulated as belief-state Markov decision processes with concave cost and value functions. The significance of these reformulations is that they render the smoother entropy a tractable optimization objective, with structural properties amenable to the use of standard POMDP solution techniques for both active estimation and obfuscation. Simulations illustrate that optimization of the smoother entropy leads to superior trajectory estimation and obfuscation compared to alternative approaches.},

Existing methods encode such specifications by either using integer constraints or by employing set invariance techniques. While in the first case this results in a mixed integer linear program (MILP), control problems, in the latter case, designer-specific choices may induce conservatism in the robot&#39;s performance and the satisfaction of the task. In this article, a continuous-time receding horizon control scheme (RHS) is proposed that exploits the tradeoff between task satisfaction and performance costs such as actuation and state costs, traditionally considered in RHS schemes. The satisfaction of the STL tasks is encoded using time-varying control barrier functions that are designed online, thus avoiding the integer expressions that are often used in literature. The recursive feasibility of the proposed scheme is guaranteed by the satisfaction of a time-varying terminal constraint that ensures the satisfaction of the task with predetermined robustness.

In this article, the state of the system is not required to be observable, and the event occurrence is allowed to be partially observed. We propose an algorithm that computes a nonblocking supervisor from a possibly blocking one by iteratively removing certain states. Then, we identify two key properties of input supervisors, named state-unmergedness and strong maximal permissiveness, which together guarantee the maximal permissiveness of output nonblocking supervisors. The algorithm is applied to a supervisor with these two properties to obtain a maximally permissive nonblocking supervisor. In addition, we show that a nonblocking supervisor is generated by the algorithm if and only if there exists a solution to the nonblocking similarity control problem.},

The external boundaries through which temperature sensing and heat flux actuation are performed are assumed to be solid. First, a full-state single-sided tracking feedback controller is presented. Then, an observer is proposed and proven to provide a stable full-state reconstruction. Finally, by combining a full-state controller with an observer, the output feedback trajectory tracking control laws are presented and the closed-loop convergence of the temperature and the interface errors proven for the single-sided and the two-sided Stefan problems.

The synthesized attacker needs to ensure both the damage-reachability and the covertness against all the supervisors, which are consistent with the given set of observations.

Zonotopes, a type of symmetric, convex polytope, are similarly frequently used, because they allow efficient numerical implementations of affine maps and exact Minkowski sums. Both of these representations also enable efficient, convex collision detection for fault detection or formal verification tasks, wherein one checks if the reachable set of a system collides (i.e., intersects) with an unsafe set. However, both representations often result in conservative representations for reachable sets of arbitrary systems, and neither is closed under intersection. Recently, representations, such as constrained zonotopes and constrained polynomial zonotopes, have been shown to overcome some of these conservativeness challenges, and are closed under intersection. However, constrained zonotopes cannot represent shapes with smooth boundaries, such as ellipsoids, and constrained polynomial zonotopes can require solving a nonconvex program for collision checking or fault detection. This article introduces ellipsotopes , a set representation that is closed under affine maps, Minkowski sums, and intersections. Ellipsotopes combine the advantages of ellipsoids and zonotopes while ensuring convex collision checking. The utility of this representation is demonstrated on several examples.},

The application of mathematical principles, especially systems and control theories, is lacking for frequency modulated multiagent systems (MASs). This article aims to introduce a new formulation of the synchronization of frequency-modulated MASs. It develops new tools to solve the synchronization problem by addressing the following three issues: frequency observation in nonlinear frequency-modulated oscillators subject to network influence, frequency consensus via network interaction subject to observation error, and a well-placed small-gain condition among them.

Therefore, this article addresses the problem of path planning and control of autonomous vehicles in a dynamic adversarial reach–avoid scenario with two noncooperative vehicles and their competitive objectives: 1) “reaching a target and avoiding the other vehicle” for one of them, called attacker, and 2) “protecting the target and capturing the opponent vehicle” for the other one, called defender. In the proposed solution, first, a discrete version of the problem is formulated and solved using linear temporal logic, temporal games, and $\mu$ -calculus to construct winning discrete strategies that guarantee safety and reachability. A comprehensive discussion on the existence, correctness, and complexity analysis of the solution is also provided. Finally, a novel correct-by-design hybrid controller is designed to generate smooth control signals that preserve the satisfaction of safety and reachability.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we address the efficient implementation of moving horizon state estimation of constrained discrete-time linear systems. We propose a novel iteration scheme that employs a proximity-based formulation of the underlying optimization algorithm and reduces computational effort by performing only a limited number of optimization iterations each time a new measurement is received. We outline conditions under which global exponential stability of the underlying estimation errors is ensured. Performance guarantees of the iteration scheme in terms of regret upper bounds are also established. A combined result shows that both exponential stability and a sublinear regret, which can be rendered smaller by increasing the number of optimization iterations, can be guaranteed. The stability and regret results of the proposed estimator are showcased through numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a new opinion dynamics model where a group of agents holds two kinds of opinions: inherent and declared. Each agent’s inherent opinion is fixed and unobservable by the other agents. At each time step, agents broadcast their declared opinions on a social network, which are governed by the agents’ inherent opinions and social pressure. In particular, we assume that agents may declare opinions that are not aligned with their inherent opinions to conform with their neighbors. This raises the natural question: Can we estimate the agents’ inherent opinions from observations of declared opinions? For example, agents’ inherent opinions may represent their true political alliances (Democrat or Republican), while their declared opinions may model the political inclinations of tweets on social media. In this context, we may seek to predict the election results by observing voters’ tweets, which do not necessarily reflect their political support due to social pressure. We analyze this question in the special case where the underlying social network is a complete graph. We prove that, as long as the population does not include large majorities, estimation of aggregate and individual inherent opinions is possible. On the other hand, large majorities force minorities to lie over time, which makes asymptotic estimation impossible.},

The objective is to ensure the stability of the closed-loop system, in a stochastic sense, together with given control performance, while minimizing the average power used for communications. The controller is designed by emulation, i.e., ignoring the network, and the transmission power is given by threshold policies. These policies involve waiting a given amount of time since the last successful transmission instant, as well as requiring that the measured wireless channel gain is above a given threshold, before attempting a new transmission. Two power control laws are investigated: 1) a constant power and 2) a power level inversely proportional to the channel gain. We explain how to select the waiting time, the channel threshold, and the power level to minimize the induced average communication power while ensuring the desired control objectives.},

The channels suffer from both multiplicative and additive randomness subject to unknown probability distributions. The statistics of this randomness, such as mean and covariance, are nonrepetitive in the iteration domain. This nonrepetitive randomness introduces nonstationary contamination and drifts to the actual signals, yielding essential challenges in signal processing and learning control. Therefore, we propose a practical framework constituted by an unbiased estimator of the mean inverse, a signal correction mechanism, and learning control schemes. The convergence and tracking performance are strictly established for both constant and decreasing step-lengths. If the statistics satisfy asymptotic repetitiveness in the iteration domain, a consistent estimator applies to the framework while retaining the framework’s asymptotic properties. Illustrative examples are provided to verify the theoretical results.},

Furthermore, if knowledge of the employed transcription scheme or the approximation errors are available, then better online estimates of interupdate times can be obtained. We also detail a method of tightening constraints on the approximate system trajectory to guarantee constraint satisfaction of the continuous-time system.

In order to guarantee the detection rate, the data processes and the watermark are time-varying and secret to an adversary. Moreover, the effect on system performance caused by the watermark can be removed when the system is attack free. Furthermore, four different attack scenarios are discussed to analyze the detection ability of the proposed defense approach, and the designed strategy can be applied to detect replay attacks. Finally, an unmanned aircraft system subject to malicious attacks is leveraged to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed proactive defense strategy.},

Then, we construct a stochastic gradient-type procedure to approximate the neural network weight parameters, and develop another recursion for adaptively approximating the optimal learning rate. The convergence of the combined approximation algorithms is obtained using stochastic averaging and martingale methods under suitable conditions. Robustness analysis of the approximation to the network parameters with the adaptive learning rate is also dealt with.

However, their performance is not completely understood theoretically. In this article, we characterize the global convergence of an online natural actor–critic algorithm in the tabular setting using a single trajectory of samples. Our analysis applies to very general settings, as we only assume ergodicity of the underlying Markov decision process. In order to ensure enough exploration, we employ an $\epsilon$ -greedy sampling of the trajectory. For a fixed and small enough exploration parameter $\epsilon$ , we show that the two-time-scale natural actor–critic algorithm has a rate of convergence of $\tilde{\mathcal {O}}(1/T^{1/4})$ , where $T$ is the number of samples, and this leads to a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal {O}}(1/\delta ^{8})$ samples to find a policy that is within an error of $\delta$ from the global optimum. Moreover, by carefully decreasing the exploration parameter $\epsilon$ as the iterations proceed, we present an improved sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal {O}}(1/\delta ^{6})$ for convergence to the global optimum.},

We propose tools to compute the MSI for a given controller and to design a controller with a preferably large MSI, both directly from a finite-length, noise-corrupted state-input trajectory of the system. We follow two distinct approaches for stability analysis, one taking a robust control perspective and the other a switched systems perspective on the aperiodically sampled system.

We prove that PARC is a block-coordinate descent algorithm that minimizes a suitably constructed objective function and that it converges in a finite number of steps.

  abstract     = {Model predictive control (MPC) algorithms have long been applied to nonlinear processes. In a quasi-linear parameter varying (qLPV) setting, nonlinearities are included into bounded scheduling parameters, which are given as a function of endogenous variables; these scheduling parameters are a priori unknown along a future prediction horizon, which complicates MPC design. To address this problem, the literature points out two options: robust MPC approaches, considering the scheduling to be uncertain; or suboptimal ones that set values for these parameters along the horizon. With respect to the latter group, this article proposes an extrapolation algorithm that estimates the future values of the qLPV scheduling parameters for a fixed prediction horizon of $N$ steps; the method is based on a recursive procedure using simple Taylor expansions. Sufficient conditions for convergent extrapolation are presented with regard to the form and class of the scheduling function and the robustness of the MPC. Different benchmark examples from the literature are presented to illustrate the algorithm, which is also compared to state-of-the-art techniques.},

Robust DeePC solves a min–max optimization problem to compute the optimal control sequence that is resilient to all possible realizations of the uncertainties in data within a prescribed uncertainty set. We present computationally tractable reformulations of the min–max problem with various uncertainty sets. Moreover, we show that even though an accurate prediction of the future behavior is unattainable due to inaccessibility of exact data, the obtained control sequence provides performance guarantees for the actually realized input and output cost in open loop.

To address this problem, we propose a general class of Hamiltonian DNNs (H-DNNs) that stem from the discretization of continuous-time Hamiltonian systems and include several existing DNN architectures based on ordinary differential equations. Our main result is that a broad set of H-DNNs ensures nonvanishing gradients by design for an arbitrary network depth. This is obtained by proving that, using a semi-implicit Euler discretization scheme, the backward sensitivity matrices involved in gradient computations are symplectic. We also provide an upper bound to the magnitude of sensitivity matrices and show that exploding gradients can be controlled through regularization. The good performance of H-DNNs is demonstrated on benchmark classification problems, including image classification with the MNIST dataset.},

Unlike the standard confidence upper bound algorithm in the context of multiarmed bandits, the notion of D-UCB helps significantly reduce the computational complexity in solving the subproblems of task planning, and thus renders our algorithm exceptionally computation-efficient in the distributed setting. The performance of our algorithm is theoretically guaranteed by showing a sublinear upper bound of the cumulative regret. Numerical results on a real-world pollution monitoring and tracking problem are also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

In this work, we leverage quadratic constraints and Lyapunov functions to analyze the stability and characterize the convergence rate of the MD algorithm as well as its distributed variant using semidefinite programming (SDP). For both algorithms, we consider both strongly convex and nonstrongly convex assumptions. For centralized MD and strongly convex problems, we construct an SDP that certifies exponential convergence rates and derive a closed-form feasible solution to the SDP that recovers the optimal rate of GD as a special case. We complement our analysis by providing an explicit $O(1/k)$ convergence rate for convex problems. Next, we analyze the convergence of distributed MD and characterize the rate numerically using an SDP whose dimensions are independent of the network size. To the best of our knowledge, the numerical rate of distributed MD has not been previously reported in the literature. We further prove an $O(1/k)$ convergence rate for distributed MD in the convex setting. Our numerical experiments on strongly convex problems indicate that our framework certifies superior convergence rates compared to the existing rates for distributed GD.},

Distinct from the existing solutions that require significant computational power for Bayesian estimation and path planning, the proposed solution is computationally affordable for onboard processors. A new concept of concurrent learning using multiple parallel estimators is proposed to learn the operational environment and quantify estimation uncertainty. The search agent is empowered with the dual capability of exploiting current-estimated parameters to track the source and probing the environment to reduce the impacts of uncertainty, namely Concurrent Learning based Dual Control for Exploration and Exploitation (CL-DCEE). In this setting, the control action not only minimizes the tracking error between future agent&#39;s position and estimated source location, but also the uncertainty of predicted estimation. More importantly, the rigorous proven properties, such as the convergence of CL-DCEE algorithm, are established under mild assumptions on noises, and the impact of noises on the search performance is examined. Simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed CL-DCEE algorithm. Compared with the information-theoretic approach, CL-DCEE not only guarantees convergence, but produces better search performance and consumes much less computational time.},

To promote the efficient use of network resources, the distributed observer uses event-triggered communication. A nonsmooth Lyapunov analysis demonstrates that the distributed event-triggered observer achieves uniformly ultimately bounded state reconstruction.

While this approach can be extended to the cooperative control of multiagent systems, it leads to a decentralized learning of the unknown nonlinearity, i.e., each agent independently infers a model. However, decentralized learning can potentially lead to poor control performance, since the models of individual agents are often accurate in merely a small region of the state space. In order to overcome this issue, we propose a novel method for the distributed aggregation of Gaussian process models, and extend probabilistic error bounds for Gaussian process regression to the proposed approach. Based on this distributed learning method, we develop a cooperative tracking control law for leader–follower consensus of multiagent systems with partially unknown, higher order, control-affine dynamics, and analyze its stability using the Lyapunov theory. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated in numerical evaluations.},

The estimation is cast in a variational-Bayes framework to best emulate the original posterior distribution of the parameters within the set of distributions with feasible moments. The recursive concept we propose approximates the exact posterior comprising undistorted information about the estimated parameters. In many practical settings, the incomplete model of parameter variations is compensated by forgetting of obsolete information. As a rule, the forgetting operation is initiated by the inclusion of an appropriate prediction alternative into the time update. It is shown that the careful formulation of the prediction alternative, which relies on Bayesian conditioning, results in partial forgetting. This article inspects two options with respect to the order of the conditioning in the posterior, which proves vital in the successful localization of the source of inconsistency in the data-generating process. The geometric mean of the discussed alternatives then modifies recursive learning through the matrix forgetting factor. We adopt the decision-making approach to revisit the posterior uncertainty by dynamically allocating the probability to each of the prediction alternatives to be combined.},

The two architectures share common features, since they both consist of a purely continuous-time control architecture and are based on the forward integration of the differential Riccati equation (DRE). They profoundly differ, instead, in the estimation mechanism of the vector field of the underlying DRE from collected data: The first relies on a characterization of properties of the advantage function associated to the problem, whereas the second is inspired by tools from adaptive control theory and ensures semi-global exponential convergence to the optimal solution. Advantages and drawbacks of the architectures are discussed, while the performance is validated via a benchmark numerical example.},

Several reachability algorithms are presented for different types of systems generating the data. First, an algorithm for computing over-approximated reachable sets based on matrix zonotopes is proposed for linear systems. Constrained matrix zonotopes are introduced to provide less conservative reachable sets at the cost of increased computational expenses and utilized to incorporate prior knowledge about the unknown system model. Then we extend the approach to polynomial systems and, under the assumption of Lipschitz continuity, to nonlinear systems. Theoretical guarantees are given for these algorithms in that they give a proper over-approximate reachable set containing the true reachable set. Multiple numerical examples and real experiments show the applicability of the introduced algorithms, and comparisons are made between algorithms.},

We show that regret-optimal filters and regret-optimal controllers can be derived in state space form using operator-theoretic techniques from robust control. Our results can be viewed as extending traditional robust estimation and control, which focuses on minimizing worst-case cost, to minimizing worst-case regret.

The goal of each agent is to minimize the cumulative expected regret with respect to the true rewards of the arms, where the mean of each arm&#39;s true reward equals the average of the means of all agents&#39; observed biased rewards. Each agent recursively updates its decision by utilizing the information from its neighbors. Neighbor relationships are described by a time-dependent directed graph $\mathbb{G}(t)$ whose vertices correspond to agents and whose arcs depict neighbor relationships. A fully distributed bandit algorithm is proposed, which couples the classical distributed averaging algorithm and the celebrated upper confidence bound bandit algorithm. It is shown that for any uniformly strongly connected sequence of $\mathbb{G}(t)$ , the algorithm achieves guaranteed regret for each agent at the order of $O(\log T)$ .},

The main target is to verify the safety of unknown systems based on the construction of barrier certificates via a set of data collected from trajectories of systems while providing an a-priori guaranteed confidence on the safety. In our proposed framework, we first cast the original safety problem as a robust convex program (RCP). Solving the proposed RCP is not tractable in general since the unknown model appears in one of the constraints. Instead, we collect finite numbers of data from trajectories of the system and provide a scenario convex program (SCP) corresponding to the original RCP. We then establish a probabilistic closeness between the optimal value of SCP and that of RCP, and as a result, we formally quantify the safety guarantee of unknown systems based on the number of data points and a required level of confidence. We propose our framework in both discrete-time and continuous-time settings. We illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed results by first applying them to an unknown continuous-time room temperature system. We verify that the temperature of the room maintains in a comfort zone with some desirable confidence by collecting data from trajectories of the system. To show the applicability of our techniques to higher dimensional systems with nonlinear dynamics, we then apply our results to a continuous-time nonlinear jet engine compressor and a discrete-time DC motor.},

We discuss the inclusion of various forms of regularization and constraints in the learning problem, such as the operator norm, the Frobenius norm, the operator rank, the nuclear norm, and the stability.

  abstract     = {This article puts forward the concept that learning to take safe actions in unknown environments, even with probability one guarantees, can be achieved without the need for an unbounded number of exploratory trials. This is indeed possible, provided that one is willing to navigate tradeoffs between optimality, level of exposure to unsafe events, and the maximum detection time of unsafe actions. We illustrate this concept in two complementary settings. We first focus on the canonical multiarmed bandit problem and study the intrinsic tradeoffs of learning safety in the presence of uncertainty. Under mild assumptions on sufficient exploration, we provide an algorithm that provably detects all unsafe machines in an (expected) finite number of rounds. The analysis also unveils a tradeoff between the number of rounds needed to secure the environment and the probability of discarding safe machines. We then consider the problem of finding optimal policies for a Markov decision process (MDP) with almost sure constraints. We show that the action-value function satisfies a barrier-based decomposition that allows for the identification of feasible policies independently of the reward process. Using this decomposition, we develop a barrier-learning algorithm, that identifies such unsafe state–action pairs in a finite expected number of steps. Our analysis further highlights a tradeoff between the time lag for the underlying MDP necessary to detect unsafe actions, and the level of exposure to unsafe events. Simulations corroborate our theoretical findings, further illustrating the aforementioned tradeoffs, and suggesting that safety constraints can speed up the learning process.},

We prove recursive feasibility of the resulting MPC scheme and show that the original chance constraints remain satisfied at every time step. Furthermore, we show that under sufficient decrease of the confidence levels, the resulting MPC scheme renders the closed-loop system mean-square stable with respect to the true-but-unknown distributions, while remaining less conservative than a fully robust approach.

This is a sequential decision making problem with two sequences of arbitrarily varying convex loss and constraint functions. At each round, each agent selects a decision from the decision set, and then only a portion of the loss function and a coordinate block of the constraint function at this round are privately revealed to this agent. The goal of the network is to minimize the network-wide loss accumulated over time. Two distributed online algorithms with full-information and bandit feedback are proposed. Both dynamic and static network regret bounds are analyzed for the proposed algorithms, and network cumulative constraint violation is used to measure constraint violation, which excludes the situation that strictly feasible constraints can compensate the effects of violated constraints. In particular, we show that the proposed algorithms achieve $\mathcal {O}(T^{\max \lbrace \kappa,1-\kappa \rbrace })$ static network regret and $\mathcal {O}(T^{1-\kappa /2})$ network cumulative constraint violation, where $T$ is the time horizon and $\kappa \in (0,1)$ is a user-defined tradeoff parameter. Moreover, if the loss functions are strongly convex, then the static network regret bound can be reduced to $\mathcal {O}(T^{\kappa })$ .

  abstract     = {In this work, we introduce a learning model designed to meet the needs of applications in which computational resources are limited, and robustness and interpretability are prioritized. Learning problems can be formulated as constrained stochastic optimization problems, with the constraints originating mainly from model assumptions that define a tradeoff between complexity and performance. This tradeoff is closely related to overfitting, generalization capacity, and robustness to noise and adversarial attacks, and depends on both the structure and complexity of the model, as well as the properties of the optimization methods used. We develop an online prototype-based learning algorithm based on annealing optimization that is formulated as an online gradient-free stochastic approximation algorithm. The learning model can be viewed as an interpretable and progressively growing competitive-learning neural network model to be used for supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. The annealing nature of the algorithm contributes to minimal hyperparameter tuning requirements, poor local minima prevention, and robustness with respect to the initial conditions. At the same time, it provides online control over the performance–complexity tradeoff by progressively increasing the complexity of the learning model as needed, through an intuitive bifurcation phenomenon. Finally, the use of stochastic approximation enables the study of the convergence of the learning algorithm through mathematical tools from dynamical systems and control, and allows for its integration with reinforcement learning algorithms, constructing an adaptive state–action aggregation scheme.},

  abstract     = {The problem of establishing out-of-sample bounds for the values of an unknown ground-truth function is considered. Kernels and their associated Hilbert spaces are the main formalism employed herein, along with an observational model where outputs are corrupted by bounded measurement noise. The noise can originate from any compactly supported distribution, and no independent assumptions are made on the available data. In this setting, we show how computing tight, finite-sample uncertainty bounds amounts to solving parametric quadratically constrained linear programs. Next, the properties of our approach are established, and its relationship with another method is studied. Numerical experiments are presented to exemplify how the theory can be applied in various scenarios and to contrast it with other closed-form alternatives.},

To this end, we deduce from data for the unidentified ground-truth system three possible set-membership representations, compare their accuracy, and prove that they are asymptotically consistent with respect to the amount of samples. Moreover, we leverage these representations to compute guaranteed upper bounds on nonlinearity measures and the corresponding optimal linear approximation model via semidefinite programming.

In the fixed budget setting, the learner aims at estimating the state transition matrix A from a random system trajectory of fixed length, whereas in the fixed confidence setting, the learner also controls the length of the observed trajectory – she can stop when she believes that enough information has been gathered. For both settings, we analyze the sample complexity in the probably approximately correct (PAC) framework defined as the length of the observed trajectory required to identify the system parameters with prescribed accuracy and confidence levels $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ . In the fixed budget setting, we first establish problem-specific sample complexity lower bounds. We then present a finite-time analysis of the estimation error of the least-squares estimator (LSE) for stable systems, and show that in the high-accuracy regime, the sample complexity of the LSE matches our lower bounds. Our analysis of the LSE is sharper and easier to interpret than existing analyzes, and relies on novel concentration results for the covariates matrix. In the fixed confidence setting, in addition to the estimation objective, the learner also has to decide when to stop the collection of observations. The sample complexity then corresponds to the expected stopping time. For this setting, we also provide problem specific sample complexity lower bounds. We also propose a stopping rule which combined to the LSE enjoys a sample complexity that matches our lower bounds in the high-accuracy and high-confidence regime.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the problem of predicting observations generated online by an unknown, partially observable linear system, which is driven by Gaussian noise. In the linear Gaussian setting, the optimal predictor in the mean square error sense is the celebrated Kalman filter, which can be explicitly computed when the system model is known. When the system model is unknown, we have to learn how to predict observations online based on finite data, suffering possibly a nonzero regret with respect to the Kalman filter&#39;s prediction. We show that it is possible to achieve a regret of the order of $\text{poly}\log (N)$ with high probability, where $N$ is the number of observations collected. This is achieved using an online least-squares algorithm, which exploits the approximately linear relation between future observations and past observations. The regret analysis is based on the stability properties of the Kalman filter, recent statistical tools for finite sample analysis of system identification, and classical results for the analysis of least-squares algorithms for time series. Our regret analysis can also be applied to other predictors, e.g., multiple step-ahead prediction, or prediction under exogenous inputs including closed-loop prediction. A fundamental technical contribution is that our bounds hold even for the class of nonexplosive systems (including marginally stable systems), which was not addressed before in the case of online prediction.},

A network of agents, each with its own operator and data observations, cooperatively find the fixed point of the aggregate operator over a decentralized communication graph. Our main contribution is to provide a finite-time analysis of this decentralized SA method when the data observed at each agent are sampled from a Markov process; this lack of independence makes the iterates biased and (potentially) unbounded. Under fairly standard assumptions, we show that the convergence rate of the proposed method is essentially the same as if the samples were independent, differing only by a log factor that accounts for the mixing time of the Markov processes. The key idea in our analysis is to introduce a novel Lyapunov–Razumikhin function, motivated by the one used in analyzing the stability of delayed ordinary differential equations. We also discuss applications of the proposed method on a number of interesting learning problems in multiagent systems.},

Although these criteria are often solved separately with different tools to maintain formal guarantees, it is also common practice in reinforcement learning (RL) to simply modify reward functions by penalizing failures, with the penalty treated as a mere heuristic. We rigorously examine the relationship of both safety and optimality to penalties, and formalize sufficient conditions for safe value functions (SVFs): value functions that are both optimal for a given task, and enforce safety constraints. We reveal this structure by examining when rewards preserve viability under optimal control, and show that there always exists a finite penalty that induces an SVF. This penalty is not unique, but upper-unbounded: larger penalties do not harm optimality. Although it is often not possible to compute the minimum required penalty, we reveal clear structure of how the penalty, rewards, discount factor, and dynamics interact. This insight suggests practical, theory-guided heuristics to design reward functions for control problems where safety is important.},

Using techniques from geometric control theory, we identify a class of activation functions that allow us to ensure controllability on an open and dense submanifold of sample points. Using this result, and resorting to the notion of monotonicity, we establish that any continuous function can be approximated on a compact set to arbitrary accuracy, with respect to the uniform norm, by this class of neural networks.

Two key aspects should be addressed when input–output data are corrupted by noise: how much uncertainty can one tolerate without compromising safety, and to what extent is the control performance affected? By focusing on finite-horizon constrained linear– quadratic problems, we provide an answer to these questions in terms of the model mismatch incurred during a preliminary identification phase. We propose a control design procedure based on a quasiconvex relaxation of the original robust problem and we prove that, if the uncertainty is sufficiently small, the synthesized controller is safe and near-optimal, in the sense that the suboptimality gap increases linearly with the model mismatch level. Since the proposed method is independent of the specific identification procedure, our analysis holds in combination with state-of-the-art behavioral estimators beyond standard least squares.

In such architectures, the error is computed via the evolution of the Hamiltonian function (or, possibly, of its integral) along the trajectories of the closed-loop system. Herein the temporal difference error is instead obtained via two subsequent steps: first the dynamics of the underlying costate variable in the Hamiltonian system is steered by means of a (virtual) control input in such a way that the stable invariant manifold becomes externally attractive. Then, the distance-from-invariance of the manifold, induced by approximate solutions, yields a natural candidate measure for the policy evaluation step. The policy improvement phase is then performed by means of standard gradient descent methods that allows us to correctly update the weights of the underlying functional approximator. The above-mentioned architecture then yields an iterative (episodic) learning scheme based on a scalar, constant reward at each iteration, the value of which is insensitive to the length of the episode, as in the original spirit of reinforcement learning strategies for discrete-time systems. Finally, the theory is validated by means of a numerical simulation involving an automatic flight control problem.},

  abstract     = {While learning-based control techniques often outperform classical controller designs, safety requirements limit the acceptance of such methods in many applications. Recent developments address this issue through so-called predictive safety filters, which assess if a proposed learning-based control input can lead to constraint violations and modifies it if necessary to ensure safety for all future time steps. The theoretical guarantees of such predictive safety filters rely on the model assumptions and minor deviations can lead to failure of the filter putting the system at risk. This article introduces an auxiliary soft-constrained predictive control problem that is always feasible at each time step and asymptotically stabilizes the feasible set of the original predictive safety filter problem, thereby providing a recovery mechanism in safety–critical situations. This is achieved by a simple constraint tightening in combination with a terminal control barrier function. By extending discrete-time control barrier function theory, we establish that the proposed auxiliary problem provides a “predictive” control barrier function. The resulting algorithm is demonstrated using numerical examples.},

The formulation does not involve any terminal ingredients, thus allowing for a simple implementation without (potential) feasibility issues. The proposed approach relies on an implicit description of linear time-invariant systems based on behavioral systems theory, which only requires one input–output trajectory of an unknown system. For the nominal case with noise-free data, we prove that the data-driven MPC scheme ensures exponential stability for the closed loop if the prediction horizon is sufficiently long. Moreover, we analyze the robust data-driven MPC scheme for noisy output measurements for which we prove closed-loop practical exponential stability. The advantages of the presented approach are illustrated with a numerical example.},

The objective is to minimize the sum of local time-varying cost functions, each of which is known by only one individual agent. The optimal solution is a time-varying affine transformation of a nominal configuration rather than some constants. To tackle the difficulty caused by the dynamic aspect of the local cost functions and handle affine formation constraints, the fixed-time distributed estimator and distributed gradient tracking technique are developed, respectively, to compensate the time variation of solution trajectory and calculate the weighted sum of local gradients to eliminate the tracking error. The time-varying optimal solution trajectory is thus accurately tracked with the proposed estimator-based gradient tracking algorithm. Using appropriately chosen coefficients, the tracking error is guaranteed to vanish at an exponential rate. The proposed estimator-based gradient tracking algorithm is further validated through numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Distributed linear algebraic equation over networks, where nodes hold a part of problem data and cooperatively solve the equation via node-to-node communications, is a basic distributed computation task receiving an increasing research attention. Communications over a network have a stochastic nature, with both temporal and spatial dependence due to link failures, packet dropouts, or node recreation, etc. In this article, we study the convergence and convergence rate of distributed linear equation protocols over a $\ast$ -mixing random network, where the temporal and spatial dependencies between the node-to-node communications are allowed. When the network linear equation admits exact solutions, we prove the exponential convergence rate of the distributed projection consensus algorithm in the mean-squared sense. Motivated by the randomized Kaczmarz algorithm, we also propose a distributed randomized projection consensus algorithm, where each node randomly selects one row of local linear equations for projection per iteration, and establish an exponential rate of convergence. When the network linear equation admits no exact solution, we prove that a distributed gradient-descent-like algorithm with diminishing step-sizes can drive all nodes’ states to a least-squares solution at a sublinear rate. These results collectively illustrate that distributed computations may overcome communication correlations if the prototype algorithms enjoy certain contractive properties or are designed with suitable parameters.},

Moreover, a new concept of ideality is introduced, which serves as a measure of conservativity of the triggering mechanism during the stability regions of trajectories. To construct the ETM, we employ a diagonal transformation to facilitate the design in a component-wise fashion. Moreover, the interpretation of stating ETM in the transformed coordinate is given by when the trajectories reach $p$ -norm contour curves. A proof of Zeno behavior exclusion is also given, which is required to justify the efficiency of the presented method for practical implementation.

Such objectives arise from quadratic integral penalty methods for the direct transcription of optimal control problems. The augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) has a number of advantages over the quadratic penalty method (QPM). However, if the equality constraints are inconsistent, then ALM might not converge to a point that minimizes the bias of the objective and penalty term. Therefore, we present a modification of ALM that fits our purpose. We prove convergence of the modified method and bound its local convergence rate by that of the unmodified method. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the modified ALM can minimize certain quadratic penalty augmented functions faster than QPM, whereas the unmodified ALM converges to a minimizer of a significantly different problem.},

However, the linear relationship may insufficiently or excessively characterize the occurrence number of impulses to stabilize impulsive time-varying systems. In this article, the impulsive density is introduced to describe a time-varying FIO, such that the occurrence number of impulses can be characterized more explicitly. Under the impulsive density, the asymptotical stability is considered for impulsive stochastic time-varying systems, where the continuous dynamics of systems, impulsive strengths, and instants are all assumed to be time-varying. In addition, the exponential stability is also investigated for impulsive stochastic time-varying systems with time-delay, which can extend some existing results. Two examples, including one example of the consensus for impulsive time-varying multiagent systems with time-delay, are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.},

By combining nonlinear filters and an adaptive back-stepping control scheme, a novel dynamic surface control (DSC) scheme is presented. Different from the DSC scheme with the traditional linear filter, the proposed DSC not only solves the inherent problem of computational complexity explosion, but also enhances the control property. In addition, in order to further enhance the tracking performance understructure the fixed-time prescribed performance, a novel barrier Lyapunov function is proposed by considering the transform error constraint based on the fixed-time prescribed performance functions. The design control scheme can ensure that all the dynamic errors can be converged in predefined bounds within a fixed time. By choosing the barrier Lyapunov function, the stability of the closed-loop system is proof. Finally, the validity and innovation of the proposed strategy are verified by numerical practical simulation examples.},

We establish the consensus conditions for bipartite consensus and zero-value consensus by employing the gauge transformation and robust analysis of signed networks. When the signed networks are strongly connected and the intersection of intervals is empty, the system reaches an asymptotically stable and unique equilibrium. Moreover, the equilibrium states are only decided by the network structure and interval constraints, and are not related to initial agents’ states.

The unknown initial condition of the state is strategically included as an additional unknown parameter in the estimation framework, which, as far as the authors are aware, is a first of its kind technique in the context of adaptive observer design. The extended estimation error dynamics ensures the global uniformly ultimately bounded stability of the estimation error dynamics. Furthermore, estimation errors in a disturbance-free case result in uniform global exponential stability in a delayed sense. Simulation results are presented, and the estimation performance of the proposed adaptive observer is compared with that of the existing algorithms to illustrate the effectiveness.},

This is the first attempt to investigate the cooperative output regulation problem for nonlinear MASs under DoS attacks, and a novel distributed control scheme consisting of a resilient distributed observer and a distributed adaptive controller is proposed. Specifically, a novel resilient distributed observer in the form of an upper triangular chain of first-order low pass filters is designed to estimate the exosystem state based on a composite output observability condition. Then, a distributed adaptive controller is designed. It is shown that the resilient cooperative output regulation problem for the concerned class of uncertain nonlinear MASs can be solved by the proposed control scheme. A simulation example is finally provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

Usually, linear convergence of distributed ADMM is proved under either second-order conditions or strong convexity. When both conditions fail, an alternative is expected to play the role. In this article, it is shown that distributed ADMM can achieve a linear convergence rate by imposing metric subregularity on a defined mapping. Furthermore, it is proved that both second-order conditions and strong convexity imply metric subregularity under reasonable conditions, e.g., the cost functions being twice continuously differentiable in a neighborhood. In addition, nonergodic convergence rates are presented as well for problems under consideration. Finally, simulation results are carried out to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

This article aims to bring the “control design” idea into the mathematics by providing an observer-based iterative method that focuses on solving linear algebraic equations (LAEs). An inherent relationship is revealed between the problem-solving of LAEs and the design of observer-based control systems, with which the iterative method for solving LAEs is exploited based on the design of the basic state observers. It is shown that all (least squares) solutions for any (un)solvable LAEs can be determined exponentially fast or monotonically with the different selections of initial conditions. Moreover, the general solution subspace and particular (least squares) solutions of LAEs are related closely with the unobservable subspace and observable states of their associated observer systems, respectively. Through incorporating the design idea of the deadbeat control, the solving of LAEs can be realized within only finite iterations. In particular, our proposed iterative method can be leveraged to develop a new observer-based design algorithm for traditional two-dimensional iterative learning control to realize the perfect tracking tasks.},

By a lossless decomposition of the optimal steady-state Kalman filter, we show that the problem of distributed estimation can be reformulated as that of the synchronization of homogeneous linear systems. Based on such decomposition, a distributed estimator is proposed, where each sensor node runs a local filter using only its own measurement, alongside with a consensus algorithm to fuse the local estimate of every node. We prove that the average of local estimates from all sensors coincides with the optimal Kalman estimate, and under certain condition on the graph Laplacian matrix and the system matrix, the covariance of local estimation error is bounded and the asymptotic error covariance is derived. As a result, the distributed estimator is stable for each single node. We further show that the proposed algorithm has a low message complexity of $\min (m,n)$ .

This article proposes a distributed dynamic compensator to address the adaptive output consensus problem of heterogeneous nonlinear multiagent systems with unknown parameters. The distributed dynamic compensator only requires the output information to be exchanged through communication networks. In addition, the distributed dynamic compensator converts the original consensus problem into standard asymptotic tracking problems of nonlinear systems, without requiring extra stability conditions in the literature. Then, well-established and standard control approaches can be used to design tracking controllers and solve the standard asymptotic tracking problems. This article adopts the standard adaptive backstepping approach as an example to design adaptive tracking controllers. It is further proved that all signals in the closed-loop system are globally uniformly bounded, and the proposed scheme enables the outputs of all agents to track the leader’s signal asymptotically.

In this article, we investigate the global convergence of the gradient method for quadratic optimal control of discrete-time Markovian jump linear systems (MJLS). First, we study the optimization landscape of direct policy optimization for MJLS, with static-state feedback controllers and quadratic performance costs. Despite the nonconvexity of the resultant problem, we are still able to identify several useful properties such as coercivity, gradient dominance, and smoothness. Based on these properties, we prove that the gradient method converges to the optimal-state feedback controller for MJLS at a linear rate if initialized at a controller, which is mean-square stabilizing. This article brings new insights for understanding the performance of the policy gradient method on the Markovian jump linear quadratic control problem.},

The state of a second-order kinematic system on a matrix Lie group is naturally posed on the tangent bundle of the group with the inputs lying in the tangent of the tangent bundle known as the double-tangent bundle. We provide a simple parameterization of both the tangent bundle state-space and the input space (the fiber space of the double-tangent bundle) and then introduce a semidirect product group and group actions onto both the state and input spaces. We show that with the proposed group actions, the second-order kinematics are equivariant. An equivariant lift of the kinematics onto the symmetry group is derived and used to design nonlinear observers on the lifted state-space using nonlinear constructive design techniques. The observer design is specialized to kinematics on groups that themselves admit a semidirect product structure and include applications in rigid-body motion amongst others. A simulation based on an ideal hovercraft model verifies the performance of the proposed observer architecture.},

We then obtain some necessary and sufficient conditions for global stochastic stability of the considered sampled-data BCN under two types of noisy sampling intervals. However, in analyzing the stochastic stability of large-scale sampled-data BCNs under noisy sampling interval, using the abovementioned necessary and sufficient conditions, leads to huge computational cost. Therefore, for a large-scale sampled-data BCN, we have to transform it into a size-reduced probabilistic logical network. Then, by studying the stochastic stability of the probabilistic logical network, some sufficient conditions for global stochastic stability of the large-scale sampled-data BCN are obtained. Moreover, based on the given steady-state probabilities of the transformed PBN, the reconstruction problem of sampled-data BCNs under noisy sampling interval can be well-solved as a linear programming problem.

  abstract     = {Determining the reachable set for a given nonlinear control system is crucial for system control and planning. However, computing such a set is impossible if the system’s dynamics are not fully known. This article is motivated by a scenario where a system suffers an adverse event mid-operation, resulting in a substantial change to the system’s dynamics, rendering them largely unknown. Our objective is to conservatively approximate the system’s reachable set solely from its local dynamics at a single point and the bounds on the rate of change of its dynamics. We translate this knowledge about the system dynamics into an ordinary differential inclusion. We then derive an underapproximation of the velocities available to the system at every system state. An inclusion using this approximation can be interpreted as a control system; the trajectories of the derived control system are guaranteed to be the trajectories of the unknown system. To illustrate the practical implementation and consequences of our work, we apply our algorithm to a simplified model of an unmanned aerial vehicle.},

The main characteristic of this study is that none of the agents has information of a common reference model or of a common reference trajectory. Therefore, the agents must simultaneously and in a distributed way: achieve consensus to a common reference model (group model); achieve consensus to a common reference trajectory; and reject the unknown disturbances. We show that this is possible via a suitable combination of techniques of distributed “observers,” internal model principle and adaptive regulation. The proposed design generalizes recent results on group model learning, which have been studied for linear agents over undirected networks. In this article, group model learning is achieved for Euler–Lagrange dynamics over directed networks in the presence of persistent unknown disturbances.},

This output tracking problem only allows to utilize the outputs of the reference system and the controlled system, rather than their states, and differs from most existing works that depend on the state of the system. The optimal tracking problem is formulated into a linear quadratic regulation problem by proposing a family of dynamic discrete-time controllers. Then, it is shown that solving the output tracking problem is equivalent to solving output regulation equations, whose solution, however, requires the knowledge of the complete and accurate system dynamics. To remove such a requirement, an off-policy RL algorithm is proposed using only the measured output data along the trajectory of the system and the reference output. By introducing reexpression error and analyzing the rank condition of the parameterization matrix, we ensure the uniqueness of the proposed RL-based optimal control via output feedback.},

The control objective is to steer the output of the controlled system toward some desired set, or toward the best reachable set, in the case of unreachable targets. The considered MPC formulation combines a stabilizing MPC scheme without terminal ingredients with an output tracking formulation using an artificial steady state. In addition, we propose an offset cost that is applicable to general nonconvex steady-state manifolds. The resulting MPC scheme is simple to implement since it does not require the design of terminal ingredients (i.e., terminal controller, terminal cost, and terminal region) and is applicable to general (possibly unreachable) output specifications. We show the benefits of the proposed approach by means of a numerical example where we compare it with the state-of-the-art tracking MPC formulation.},

However at the same time, additional restrictions on the eigenvalues of the open-loop plant have to be imposed for low-gain controllers, which are not required in the backstepping design.

  abstract     = {This article provides a delay-dependent and a necessary and sufficient delay-independent stability criterion for linear autonomous continuous-time systems with a discrete delay. We take a simple perspective on the two-variable formulation of the characteristic equation, which leads to the following advantageous but not widespread delay-independent criterion: The sum of the coefficient matrix of the delay-free term and the elementwise unitarily rotated matrix of the delay term must remain Hurwitz for all rotation angles. A graphical test for the latter is shown to require no more than three lines of code. Concerning delay-independent stability, our main contribution is to extend this sufficient criterion to a necessary and sufficient one. Concerning delay-dependent stability, the focus is on the critical delay that bounds the initial delay interval of stability. We formulate a constrained minimization problem that gives the exact value of this critical delay. The taken perspective is especially insightful in terms of how the coefficient matrices may look like, and, for scalar systems, the delay-dependent stability chart becomes obvious at a first glance. The presented criteria are complementary to the well-known frequency-sweeping test, which results from another of three possible perspectives on the two-variable criterion. Besides of a unified treatment of these different perspectives, the article also discusses corollaries of the one taken, which include Mori’s famous criterion.},

  abstract     = {In previous work a variational integration scheme for mechanical systems containing linear dissipation was developed (Limebeer et al., 2020). The key idea is to use a transmission line as the solution to a power-balancing control problem—in the physics literature controllers of this type are known as “heat baths.” The power-balanced closed-loop system is thereby made amenable to analysis with Hamilton&#39;s principle. As a consequence, variational principles can be used to find symplectic integration schemes for dissipative systems. The outcome of this work is a coherent physical explanation as to why variational/symplectic integration algorithms for the open dissipative system can perform as well as their conservative counterparts. An important application of these integration algorithms is the solution of long-time-horizon optimal control problems. In this article, these ideas are extended to systems with smooth memoryless nonlinear dissipation. This extension employs a nonlinear lossless transmission line, which is again the solution to a power-balancing control problem. As in the case of linear dissipation, the resulting variational integration schemes are demonstrated to have excellent numerical properties, which are significantly less demanding computationally than their implicit nonvariational counterparts.},

Finally, using outputs as the set of logical functions, the minimum output based dual dynamics is considered and proposed as the minimum realization of BCNs. The minimum realization might have much smaller size, which provides a possible solution to overcome the computational complexity of large scale BNs/BCNs.

Since involved data usually contain sensitive information like user locations, healthcare records, and financial transactions, privacy protection has become an increasingly pressing need in the implementation of decentralized stochastic optimization algorithms. In this article, we propose a decentralized stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, which is embedded with inherent privacy protection for every participating agent against other participating agents and external eavesdroppers. This proposed algorithm builds in a dynamics based gradient-obfuscation mechanism to enable privacy protection without compromising optimization accuracy, which is in significant difference from differential-privacy based privacy solutions for decentralized optimization that have to trade optimization accuracy for privacy. The dynamics based privacy approach is encryption-free, and hence avoids incurring heavy communication or computation overhead, which is a common problem with encryption based privacy solutions for decentralized stochastic optimization. Besides rigorously characterizing the convergence performance of the proposed decentralized SGD algorithm under both convex objective functions and nonconvex objective functions, we also provide rigorous information-theoretic analysis of its strength of privacy protection. Simulation results for a distributed estimation problem as well as numerical experiments for decentralized learning on a benchmark machine learning dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Such bilinear systems naturally induce two interaction graphs: one graph from the drift, and another from the controlled dynamics. As a result, the system controllability or accessibility becomes a property of the two graphs in view of the classical Lie algebra rank condition. We establish a systemic way of transforming the Lie bracket operations in the underlying Lie algebra, into specific operations of removing or creating links over the drift and controlled interaction graphs. As a result, we establish a series of graphical conditions for the controllability and accessibility of such bilinear systems, which rely only on the connectivity of the union of the drift and controlled interaction graphs.

Based on a modified dynamic feedback linearization technique and a refined stability analysis, we first propose a new class of saturated sampled-data controllers for unicycle mobile robots of which the state is subject to sampling (measurement) errors. It is guaranteed that the generated control inputs are restricted to within desired ranges, and the unicycle trajectory practically converges toward a time-varying trajectory as long as the sampling errors satisfy a saturated sector bound condition with a nonnegative offset. The proposed robust controller gives rise to a novel event-triggered sampling mechanism with a saturated threshold signal, which adjusts the sampling errors online to steer the tracking error to a desired neighborhood of the origin and guarantees a positive lower bound for the intersampling intervals. As a special case, by designing appropriately the controller and the event-triggered sampling mechanism, asymptotic tracking is achievable. New self-triggered and periodic sampling mechanisms are also developed as natural extensions of the event-triggered tracking control result. Both numerical and physical experiments are employed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed event-based control methodology.},

  abstract     = {We develop a probabilistic control algorithm, GTLProCo , for swarms of agents with heterogeneous dynamics and objectives, subject to high-level task specifications. The resulting algorithm not only achieves decentralized control of the swarm but also significantly improves scalability over state-of-the-art existing algorithms. Specifically, we study a setting in which the agents move along the nodes of a graph, and the high-level task specifications for the swarm are expressed in a recently proposed language called graph temporal logic (GTL). By constraining the distribution of the swarm over the nodes of the graph, GTL can specify a wide range of properties, including safety, progress, and response. GTLProCo , with a computational complexity agnostic to the number of agents comprising the swarm, controls the density distribution of the swarm in a decentralized and probabilistic manner. To this end, it synthesizes a time-varying Markov chain modeling the time evolution of the density distribution under the GTL constraints. We first identify a subset of GTL, namely reach-avoid specifications, for which we can reduce the synthesis of such a Markov chain to either linear or semidefinite programs. Then, in the general case, we formulate the synthesis of the Markov chain as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). We exploit the structure of the problem to provide an efficient sequential mixed-integer linear programming scheme with trust regions to solve the MINLP. We empirically demonstrate that our sequential scheme is at least three orders of magnitude faster than off-the-shelf MINLP solvers and illustrate the effectiveness of GTLProCo in several swarm scenarios.},

The traffic flow consists of both adaptive cruise control-equipped (ACC-equipped) and manually driven vehicles. The control input is the time gap of ACC-equipped and connected vehicles, which is subject to delays resulting from communication lag. For the linearized system, a novel three-branch bakcstepping transformation with explicit kernel functions is introduced to compensate the input delay. The transformation is proved to be bounded, continuous, and invertible, with explicit inverse transformation derived. Based on the transformation, we obtain the explicit predictor-feedback controller. We prove exponential stability of the closed-loop system with the delay compensator in $L_{2}$ norm. The performance improvement of the closed-loop system under the proposed controller is illustrated in simulation.},

For the stability analysis, we transfer the “feasibility-implies-stability/robustness” paradigm from model predictive control to the context of moving horizon estimation in the following sense. Using a suitably defined, feasible candidate solution based on an auxiliary observer, robust stability of the proposed suboptimal estimator is inherited independently of the horizon length and even if no optimization is performed. Moreover, the proposed design allows for the choice between two cost functions different in structure: the former in the manner of a standard least squares approach, which is typically used in practice, and the latter following a time-discounted modification, resulting in better theoretical guarantees. We apply the proposed suboptimal estimator to a nonlinear chemical reactor process, verify the theoretical assumptions, and show that even a few iterations of the optimizer are sufficient to significantly improve the estimation results of the auxiliary observer. Furthermore, we illustrate the flexibility of the proposed design by employing different solvers and compare the performance with two state-of-the-art fast moving horizon estimation schemes from the literature.},

In this article, we tackle this challenging problem. We first propose two novel notions referred to as sample identifying complexity and sample deciphering time in an encrypted control framework. The former explicitly captures the relation between the dynamical characteristics of control systems and the level of identifiability of the systems while the latter shows the relation between the computation time for the identification and the key length of a cryptosystem. Based on these two tractable new notions, we propose a systematic method for designing both of an optimal key length to prevent system identification with a given precision within a given life span of systems and of an optimal controller to maximize both of the control performance and the difficulty of the identification. The efficiency of the proposed method in terms of security level and realtime-ness is investigated through numerical simulations.

To address such a problem, a general approximate method of multipliers (AMM) is developed, which attempts to approximate the method of multipliers by virtue of a surrogate function with numerous options. We then design the possibly nonseparable, time-varying surrogate function in various ways, leading to different distributed realizations of AMM. We demonstrate that AMM generalizes more than ten state-of-the-art distributed optimization algorithms, and certain specific designs of its surrogate function result in a variety of new algorithms to the literature. Furthermore, we show that AMM is able to achieve an $O(1/k)$ rate of convergence to optimality, and the convergence rate becomes linear when the problem is locally restricted strongly convex and smooth. Such convergence rates provide new or stronger convergence results to many prior methods that can be viewed as specializations of AMM.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by its broad applications in system identifications, stochastic control, and machine learning, we study the popular stochastic gradient descent (SGD) when the gradient samples of the underlying objective function are generated from Markov processes. This Markov sampling leads to the gradient samples being biased and not independent. The existing results for the convergence of SGD under Markov settings are often established under the assumption on the boundedness of either the iterates or the gradient samples. This assumption can be guaranteed through an impractical projection step to a compact set often defined over the unknown optimal solution of the underlying problem. In this article, we show that this projection step is unnecessary in many settings. In particular, we study the convergence of SGD under Markov samples without requiring any projection step for different objective functions, ranging from strongly convex to nonconvex objectives satisfying Polyak–Łojasiewicz conditions. We show that SGD converges nearly at the same rate with Markovian gradient samples as with independent gradient samples. The only difference is a logarithmic factor that accounts for the mixing time of the Markov process. Finally, we provide numerical experiments in robust identification problems to illustrate our theoretical results, where we consider SGD with samples generated by a Markov process.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study decentralized convex constrained optimization problems in networks. We focus on the dual averaging-based algorithmic framework that is well-documented to be superior in handling constraints and complex communication environments simultaneously. Two new decentralized dual averaging (DDA) algorithms are proposed. In the first one, a second-order dynamic average consensus protocol is tailored for DDA-type algorithms, which equips each agent with a provably more accurate estimate of the global dual variable than conventional schemes. We rigorously prove that the proposed algorithm attains $\mathcal {O}(1/t)$ convergence for general convex and smooth problems, for which existing DDA methods were only known to converge at $\mathcal {O}(1/\sqrt{t})$ prior to our work. In the second one, we use the extrapolation technique to accelerate the convergence of DDA. Compared to existing accelerated algorithms, where typically two different variables are exchanged among agents at each time, the proposed algorithm only seeks consensus on local gradients. Then, the extrapolation is performed based on two sequences of primal variables, which are determined by the accumulations of gradients at two consecutive time instants, respectively. The algorithm is proved to converge at $\mathcal {O}(1)\left(\frac{1}{t^{2}}+\frac{1}{t(1-\beta)^{2}}\right)$ , where $\beta$ denotes the second largest singular value of the mixing matrix. We remark that the condition for the algorithmic parameter to guarantee convergence does not rely on the spectrum of the mixing matrix, making itself easy to satisfy in practice. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.},

However, the Lie-algebraic conditions are in general difficult to verify if the system dimension is high. In this article, we propose a new perspective to study controllability of continuous-time bilinear systems without using the Lie-algebraic conditions. Specifically, we first consider controllability of the bilinear systems in the single-input case under a commutativity condition. We show that, although the Lie algebra rank condition for the homogeneous counterparts, which is necessary for a classical controllability result to work, does not fit such bilinear systems, they can still be controllable. Our approach to proving controllability is using controllability of the discrete-time counterparts of the continuous-time systems, and we derive a necessary and sufficient controllability criterion without the Lie algebra rank condition, which is algebraically verifiable for any finite dimension. More importantly, through this controllability study, we propose a new perspective to deal with the controllability problems of continuous-time bilinear systems by changing the verification of the Lie algebra rank condition to solving two linear algebra problems. That is, we establish a new method beyond Lie algebra methods to controllability of continuous-time bilinear systems. We also generalize the proposed perspective to continuous-time state-affine nonlinear systems to obtain algebraic controllability criteria.

  abstract     = {Based on temporally switching networks, this article studies the qualitative and quantitative influences of time parameters on network controllability. In particular, this article presents a necessary and sufficient condition under which the network controllability must take into account time parameters. For the time parameters that never participate in determining network controllability, a more concise expression of controllability criterion is derived. From the perspective of input matrix formulation, this article also presents a sufficient condition under which the network controllability could avoid the interference of time parameters. By taking control energy as the quantitative measurement, it is difficult to give a general conclusion on whether the increase in time parameters is beneficial or detrimental to network controllability. Because the increase in time parameter $T_{i}$ ( $i \in \lbrace 1,2,\ldots,m\rbrace$ ) would decrease the lower bound of minimum control energy. However, the increase in time parameter $T_{i}$ ( $i \in \lbrace 2,3,\ldots,m-1\rbrace$ ) may cause an upsurge in the upper bound of minimum control energy. In addition, we find that different time parameters ( $T_{i}$ and $T_{j}$ , $i \ne j$ ) usually have different importance to the control energy. Through simulations based on real-world temporal network data, we show that there exists a statistically significant correlation between time parameter influence level and network characteristic. This article highlights for the first time that subtle changes in time parameters could reshape or even worsen the controllability of temporally switching networks.},

A typical form of the Tavis–Cummings model is composed of an ensemble of noninteracting two-level systems (TLSs) that are collectively coupled to a common cavity resonator. The associated quantum linear passive system is proposed, whose canonical form reveals typical features of the Tavis–Cummings model, including $\sqrt{N}$ - scaling, dark states, bright states, single-excitation superradiant, and subradiant states. The passivity of this linear system is related to the vacuum Rabi mode splitting phenomenon in Tavis–Cummings systems. On the basis of the linear model, an analytic form is presented for the steady-state output state of the Tavis–Cummings model driven by a single-photon state. Master equations are used to study the excitation properties of the Tavis–Cummings model in the multiexcitation scenario. Finally, in terms of the transition matrix for a linear time-varying system, a computational framework is proposed for calculating the state of the Tavis–Cummings model, which is applicable to the multiexcitation case.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the robustness of the event-triggered consensus algorithms against frequency-domain uncertainties. It is revealed that the sampling errors resulted by event triggering are essentially images of linear finite-gain $\mathcal {L}_{2}$ -stable operators acting on the consensus errors of the sampled states and the event-triggered mechanism is equivalent to a negative feedback loop introduced additionally to the feedback system. In virtue of this, the robust consensus problems of the event-triggered network systems subject to additive dynamic uncertainties and network multiplicative uncertainties are considered, respectively. In both cases, quantitative relationships among the parameters of the controllers, the Laplacian matrix of the network topology, and the robustness against aperiodic event triggering and frequency-domain uncertainties are unveiled. Furthermore, the event-triggered dynamic average consensus (DAC) problem is also investigated, wherein the sampling errors are shown to be images of nonlinear finite-gain operators. The robust performance of the proposed DAC algorithm is analyzed, which indicates that the robustness and the performance are negatively related to the eigenratio of the Laplacian matrix. Simulation examples are also provided to verify the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {Maximum entropy reinforcement learning methods have been successfully applied to a range of challenging sequential decision-making and control tasks. However, most of the existing techniques are designed for discrete-time systems although there has been a growing interest to handle physical processes evolving in continuous time. As a first step toward their extension to continuous-time systems, this article aims to study the theory of maximum entropy optimal control in continuous time. Applying the dynamic programming principle, we derive a novel class of Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equations and prove that the optimal value function of the maximum entropy control problem corresponds to the unique viscosity solution of the HJB equation. We further show that the optimal control is uniquely characterized as Gaussian in the case of control-affine systems and that, for linear-quadratic problems, the HJB equation is reduced to a Riccati equation, which can be used to obtain an explicit expression of the optimal control. The results of our numerical experiments demonstrate the performance of our maximum entropy method in continuous-time optimal control and reinforcement learning problems.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a specification-guided framework for control of nonlinear systems with linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications. In contrast with well-known abstraction-based methods, the proposed framework directly characterizes the winning set, i.e., the set of initial conditions from which a given LTL formula can be realized, over the continuous state space of the system via a monotonic operator. Following this characterization, an algorithm is proposed to practically approximate the operator via an adaptive interval subdivision scheme, which yields a finite-memory control strategy. We show that the proposed algorithm is sound for full LTL specifications, and robustly complete for specifications recognizable by deterministic Büchi automaton (DBA), the latter in the sense that control strategies can be found whenever the given specification can be satisfied with additional bounded disturbances. Without having to compute and store the abstraction and the resulting product system with the DBA, the proposed method is more memory efficient, which is demonstrated by complexity analysis and performance tests. A preprocessing stage is also devised to reduce computational cost via a decomposition of the specification. We show that the proposed method can effectively solve real-world control problems, such as jet engine compressor control and motion planning for manipulators and mobile robots.},

Motivated by two scenario programs that possess analytic solutions and the fact that the existing bound for scenario programs with discarded constraints is not tight, we analyze a removal scheme that consists of a cascade of optimization problems, where, at each step, we remove a superset of the active constraints. By relying on results from compression learning theory, we show that such a removal scheme leads to less conservative bounds for the probability of constraint violation than the existing ones. We also show that the proposed bound is tight by characterizing a class of optimization problems which achieves the given upper bound. The performance improvement of the proposed methodology is illustrated by an example that involves a resource sharing linear program.},

For this class of systems, we introduce a notion of stochastic relative degree and a change of coordinates, which transforms the dynamics to a stochastic normal form. The normal form is instrumental for the design of a state-feedback control, which linearizes and makes the dynamics deterministic. We observe that this control is idealistic , i.e ., it is not practically implementable because it employs a feedback of the Brownian motion (which is never available) to cancel the noise. Using the idealistic control as a starting point, we introduce a hybrid control architecture, which achieves practical path-wise control. This hybrid controller uses measurements of the state to perform periodic compensations for the noise contribution to the dynamics. We prove that the hybrid controller retrieves the idealistic performances in the limit as the compensating period approaches zero. We address the problem of asymptotic output tracking, solving it in the idealistic and in the practical framework. We finally validate the theory by means of a numerical example.},

The first-order algorithms achieve exact convergence to the Nash equilibrium of the game in a finite time that can be additionally upper bounded by a constant that is independent of the initial conditions of the actions of the players. Moreover, these fixed-time bounds can be prescribed a priori by the system designer under an appropriate tuning of the parameters of the algorithms. When players have access only to measurements of their cost functions, we consider a class of distributed multitime scale zeroth-order model-free adaptive dynamics that achieve semiglobal practical fixed-time stability, qualitatively preserving the fixed-time bounds of the first-order dynamics as the time scale separation increases. Moreover, by leveraging the property of fixed-time input-to-state stability, further results are obtained for mixed games where some of the players implement different seeking dynamics. Fast and slow switching communication graphs are also incorporated using tools from hybrid systems. We consider potential games as well as general nonpotential strongly monotone games.

The statistical similarities of the replayed signal and the true observations make the replay attack difficult to detect. In this article, we address the problem of replay attack detection by adding watermarking to the control inputs and then perform resilient detection using cumulative sum (CUSUM) test on the joint statistics of the innovation signal and the watermarking signal, whereas existing work considers only the marginal distribution of the innovation signal. We derive the expression of the Kullback–Liebler divergence (KLD) between the two joint distributions before and after the replay attack, which is, asymptotically, inversely proportional to the detection delay. We perform a structural analysis of the derived KLD expression and suggest a technique to improve the KLD for the systems with relative degree greater than one. A scheme to find the optimal watermarking signal variance for a fixed increase in the control cost to maximize the KLD under the CUSUM test is presented. We provide various numerical simulation results to support our theory.

In consideration of these defects, this article is the first to design a time-delay feedback control strategy with distributed characteristics. The designed controller may not only remain the invariance of the quantity and position of equilibriums, but also ensure the continuity of stability intervals on the controlled system.

  abstract     = {In this article, we design the distributed pinning controllers to globally stabilize a Boolean network (BN), especially a sparsely connected large-scale one, toward a preassigned subset of states through the node-to-node message exchange. Given an appointed set of states, system nodes are partitioned into two disjoint parts, whose states are, respectively, fixed or arbitrary with respect to the given state set. With such node division, three parts of pinned nodes are selected and the state feedback controllers are accordingly designed such that the resulting BN satisfies all three conditions: the information of the arbitrary-state nodes cannot be passed to the others, the subgraph of network structure induced by the fixed-state nodes is acyclic, and the fixed states of these nodes are compatible with the preassigned state set. If the network structure of controlling BN is acyclic, the stabilizing time is revealed to be no more than the diameter of the resulting subgraph plus one. Based on this, we further design the pinning controllers with the constraint of stabilizing time. Noting that the overall procedure runs in an exponentially increasing time complexity with respect to the largest number of functional variables in the dynamics of pinned nodes, the sparsely connected large-scale BNs can be well addressed in a reasonable amount of time. Finally, we demonstrate the applications of our theoretical results in a T-cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) survival signal network with 29 nodes and a T-cell receptor signaling network with 90 nodes.},

Then, the state-tracking error and the error between control parameters and ideal ones of the resulting closed-loop system are proven to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Moreover, based on the designed event-triggering condition, the interevent time between two consecutive triggering points is proven to have a positive lower bound.

A dynamic output compensator is constructed and composed of an $n$ -dimensional nonlinear observer and an observer-based controller, both of them with saturated states. As a consequence, an affine system in a lower triangular form with input delay is shown to be SGAS by $n$ -dimensional memoryless output feedback. These results provide some answers to the open question in (Wang and Lin, 2022) where $(2n-1)$ -dimensional output feedback controllers were found by a dynamic extension method: when and how to design delay-free, $n$ -dimensional SGAS output feedback controllers for a significant class of SISO nonaffine systems?},

By utilizing the prior information of the sojourn-time upper bound for each switching mode, sufficient conditions under the equivalent DSMC law are proposed for the mean square stability. Moreover, the designed DSMC law realizes the finite-time reachability of the sliding region, and makes the sliding dynamics converge to the predesignated sliding region in a finite time.

We show that IPLUX achieves an $O(1/k)$ rate of convergence in terms of optimality and feasibility, which is stronger than the convergence results of the alternative methods and eliminates the standard assumption on the compactness of the feasible region. Finally, IPLUX exhibits faster convergence and higher efficiency than several state-of-the-art methods in the simulation.},

Thanks to the prediction technique and feedback domination method, a novel coupled design method of predictor-based continuous-discrete observer and linear controller is proposed when only delayed sampled-data output is accessible. The proposed predictor-based observer can effectively estimate the unknown state by compensating the influences of sampling and output delay. The main advantage of the proposed control method is that the full state information and accurate model nonlinearities do not need to be known any more. The global exponential stability of the overall hybrid control system can be ensured when there hold some sufficient conditions with respect to the maximum allowable sampling period and output delay.},

In many real-time and embedded scenarios, only a few iterations can be performed and traditional convergence metrics cannot be used to evaluate performance in these nonasymptotic regimes. In this article, we examine the transient behavior of accelerated first-order optimization algorithms. For convex quadratic problems, we employ tools from linear systems theory to show that transient growth arises from the presence of nonnormal dynamics. We identify the existence of modes that yield an algebraic growth in early iterations and quantify the transient excursion from the optimal solution caused by these modes. For strongly convex smooth optimization problems, we utilize the theory of integral quadratic constraints to establish an upper bound on the magnitude of the transient response of Nesterov’s accelerated algorithm. We show that both the Euclidean distance between the optimization variable and the global minimizer and the rise time to the transient peak are proportional to the square root of the condition number of the problem. Finally, for problems with large condition numbers, we demonstrate tightness of the bounds that we derive up to constant factors.},

By a novel approach, we establish Lyapunov–Razumikhin-type theorems on exponential stability of stochastic impulsive delay systems. Based on our fundamental results, we develop a foundational theory for the impulsive stabilization of stochastic delay systems with input delay. Our proposed theory provides an impulsive control design method for systems with input delay and the upper bound of input delay which the designed impulsive control scheme can admit while the resulting controlled system remains exponentially stable. As future work, we present event-triggered impulsive control systems that are a natural and significant generalization of the classical impulsive control systems in the literature.},

Assuming that the closed-loop system is stable in the absence of quantization and self-triggered sampling, we propose a joint design method of an encoding scheme and a self-triggering mechanism for stabilization.

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the problem of computing a tight lower bound on the dimension of the strong structurally controllable subspace (SSCS) in networks with Laplacian dynamics. The bound is based on a sequence of vectors containing the distances between leaders (nodes with external inputs) and followers (remaining nodes) in the underlying network graph. Such vectors are referred to as the distance-to-leaders vectors. We give exact and approximate algorithms to compute the longest sequences of distance-to-leaders vectors, which directly provide distance-based bounds on the dimension of SSCS. The distance-based bound is known to outperform the other known bounds (for instance, based on zero-forcing sets), especially when the network is partially strong structurally controllable. Using these results, we discuss an application of the distance-based bound in solving the leader selection problem for strong structural controllability. Further, we characterize strong structural controllability in path and cycle graphs with a given set of leader nodes using sequences of distance-to-leaders vectors. Finally, we numerically evaluate our results on various graphs.},

We then prove that our algorithm converges to the (unique) NE with a linear convergence rate. We further study a single-round communication version of our algorithm, which can also achieve linear convergence rate with an additional condition related to the structure of the graph and the properties of the aggregative game.

We bring forth the ideas from reinforcement learning (RL) in conjunction with sufficient stability and performance guarantees in order to design these structured gains using the trajectory measurements of states and controls. We first formulate a model-based linear quadratic regulator (LQR) framework to compute the structured control gain. Subsequently, we transform this model-based LQR formulation into a data-driven RL algorithm to remove the need for knowing the system state matrix. Theoretical guarantees are provided for the stability of the closed-loop system and the convergence of the structured RL (SRL) algorithm. A remarkable application of the proposed SRL framework is in designing distributed static feedback control, which is necessary for automatic control of many large-scale cyber–physical systems. As such, we validate our theoretical results with numerical simulations on a multiagent networked linear time-invariant dynamical system.},

Conventional parameter projection techniques are generally unable to handle explicit eigenvalue bounds. The continuous projection scheme presented here maintains the closed-loop stability properties for adaptive controllers while simultaneously satisfying a priori available eigenvalue bounds of the uncertain symmetric matrix valued parameters. The projection scheme uses the eigen decomposition of the symmetric matrix parameter to project its eigenvalues to lie within the prescribed bounds. The eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix may be lower bounded or upper bounded or both. A direct adaptation over the eigenvalues and the eigen projections of the symmetric matrix parameter is also derived to help circumvent expensive eigen decomposition calculations. The new projection here shows improved performance in numerical simulations of rigid body attitude tracking control and trajectory tracking of robotic manipulators with unknown inertia parameters.},

In particular, the consensus of all the agents is achieved within a prescribed interval, which is merely available to partial agents, though. The PWM protocol effectively relieves the running burden of the agents without the additional analogue-to-digital conversion. The modulation periods of different agents are allowed to be heterogeneous. By nominating the agents that have access to the given interval as leaders and others as followers, the proposed distributed PWM protocol introduces a projection operator for the leaders in order for the collective aggregation. In terms of the graph connectivity condition of containing a spanning tree, it is shown that the concerned interval consensus objective is realized by the proposed distributed PWM protocol. Simulations are eventually performed to validate the established theoretical results.},

From an analytic point of view, this problem has been shown to involve the zero-error capacity of the communication channel. By applying results from Turing machine theory and zero-error coding, we analyze several related variants of the decision problem mentioned above. Our analysis also incorporates a weakened form of the state estimation objective, which has been shown to depend on the classical Shannon Capacity instead.

Finite-time stability of the closed-loop nonlinear system is guaranteed by means of a Lyapunov function that satisfies a difference inequality involving fractional powers and a minimum operator. This Lyapunov function can clearly be seen to be the solution to a difference equation that corresponds to a steady-state form of the Bellman equation, and hence, guaranteeing both finite-time stability and optimality. Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed finite-time discrete stabilization framework.},

The prior knowledge needed for identifiability is the number of inputs, lag, and order of the true system. Our results are based on a modification of the notion of a most powerful unfalsified model for finite data and a novel algorithm for its computation. We provide a generalization of a result that became known as the fundamental lemma and a novel nonparametric data-driven representation of the system behavior based on general data matrix structures. The results assume exact data, however, low-rank approximation allows their application in the case of noisy data. We compare empirically low-rank approximation of the Hankel, Page, and trajectory matrices in the errors-in-variables setting. Although the Page and trajectory matrices are unstructured, the parameter estimates obtained are less accurate than the one obtained from the Hankel matrix.},

Then, a sufficient criterion is established to guarantee the $\mathcal {L}_\infty$ performance for the considered 2-D FMLSS system with the event-triggered scheme.

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the distributed filtering issue for linear discrete-time systems under bounded noises and constrained bit rate over wireless sensor networks. The communication between different sensor nodes is implemented via a wireless digital communication network with limited bandwidth. A bit rate constraint, which is subject to the so-called bandwidth allocation strategy, is placed to quantify the effect of the network bandwidth on the distributed filtering performance. An improved coding–decoding procedure is proposed to enable each node to decode messages from its neighbor nodes. Based on this procedure, a decoded-innovation-based distributed filtering scheme is put forward and a sufficient condition is established to ensure that the filtering error dynamics is ultimately bounded. Subsequently, a relationship between the bit rate and certain specific filtering performance is discovered. The desired parameters of the distributed filter are determined via solving two optimization problems whose objectives are actually the filtering performance indices including the smallest ultimate bound and the fastest decay rate. Furthermore, the codesign issue of the bit rate allocation protocol and the filter gain is converted into the mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, which is solved by means of the particle swarm optimization algorithm and the linear matrix inequality technique. Finally, numerical simulations on three scenarios are provided to verify the validity of the proposed distributed filtering approach.},

Our proposed oracles are appealing in several practical contexts, for instance, risk measure estimation from a batch of independent and identically distributed samples, or simulation optimization, where the function measurements are “biased” due to computational constraints. In either case, increasing the batch size reduces the estimation error. We highlight the applicability of our biased gradient oracles in a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning setting. In the stochastic nonconvex optimization context, we analyze a variant of the randomized stochastic gradient algorithm with a biased gradient oracle. We quantify the convergence rate of this algorithm by deriving nonasymptotic bounds on its performance. Next, in the stochastic convex optimization setting, we derive nonasymptotic bounds for the last iterate of a stochastic gradient descent algorithm with a biased gradient oracle.},

This article proposes a novel quantitative model describing the decentralized process by which individuals in a team learn who has what abilities, while concurrently assigning tasks to each of the team members. In the model, the appraisal network represents team members’ evaluations of one another, and each team member chooses their own workload. The appraisals and workload assignment change simultaneously: each member builds their own local appraisal of neighboring members based on the performance exhibited on previous tasks, while the workload is redistributed based on the current appraisal estimates. We show that the appraisal states can be reduced to a lower dimension due to the presence of conserved quantities associated with the cycles of the appraisal network. Building on this, we provide rigorous results characterizing the ability, or inability, of the team to learn each other’s skills and, thus, converge to an allocation maximizing the team performance. We complement our analysis with extensive numerical experiments.},

An adaptive mechanism is included in the iAILC method to regulate the learning gain using input–output measurements in real time. An iAILC method is first designed for linear systems to improve control performance by fully utilizing model information if such a linear model is known exactly. Then, an iterative dynamic linearization (IDL)-based iAILC is proposed for a nonlinear nonaffine system, whose model is completely unknown. The IDL technique is employed to deal with the strong nonlinearity and nonaffine structure of the systems such that a linear data model can be attained consequently for the algorithm design and performance analysis. The convergence of the developed iAILC schemes is proved rigorously, where contraction mapping, two-dimensional (2-D) Roesser’s system theory, and mathematical induction are employed as the basic analysis tools. Simulation studies are provided to verify the developed theoretical results.},

The triggering condition is designed based on evaluating both the actuation deviation caused by the difference between the plant states and their sampled values, and the growth of the plant norm. When either condition is met, the piecewise-constant control input and parameter estimates are updated simultaneously. For the closed-loop system, the following results are proved: first, the absence of a Zeno phenomenon; second, finite-time exact identification of the unknown parameters in most situations; third, exponential regulation of the plant states to zero.

A standard assumption in these dynamics is that all the players are homogeneous, and their decision strategies can be modeled as perturbed versions of myopic best or better response strategies. We relax this assumption and propose a robustness criteria, which characterizes a stochastically stable action profile as robust to heterogeneous behaviors if a small fraction of heterogeneous players cannot alter the long-run behavior of the rest of the population. In particular, we consider confused players who randomly update their actions, stubborn players who never update their actions, and strategic players who attempt to manipulate the population behavior. We establish that radius–coradius based analysis can provide valuable insights into the robustness properties of stochastic learning dynamics for various game settings. We derive sufficient conditions for a stochastically stable profile to be robust to a confused, stubborn, or strategic player and elaborate these conditions through carefully designed examples. Then we explore the role of network structure in our proposed notion of robustness by considering graphical coordination games and identifying network topologies in which a single heterogeneous player is sufficient to alter the population’s behavior. Our results will provide foundations for future research on designing networked systems that are robust to players with heterogeneous decision strategies.},

In the multiagent case, prior literature has considered scenarios where all agents cooperate to ensure that the corresponding set remains invariant. However, these works do not consider scenarios where a subset of the agents are behaving adversarially with the intent to violate safety bounds. In addition, prior results on multiagent CBFs typically assume that control inputs are continuous and do not consider sampled-data dynamics. This article presents a framework for normally behaving agents in a multiagent system with heterogeneous control-affine, sampled-data dynamics to render a safe set forward invariant in the presence of adversarial agents. The proposed approach considers several aspects of practical control systems including input constraints, clock asynchrony and disturbances, and distributed calculation of control inputs. Our approach also considers functions describing safe sets having high relative degree with respect to system dynamics. The efficacy of these results are demonstrated through simulations.},

The fluctuations in systems with a single extremum seeking loop are generally small. However, for systems with many extremum seeking loops, the fluctuations in each loop may add up to an intolerable amount of fluctuation in the total performance. In this article, we propose a method to cancel the dither-induced fluctuations in the overall system performance to a large extent by smartly constructing the dither signals in each extremum seeking loop using a centralized coordinator. The novelty of our method lies in the direct calculation of the dither signals that avoids the heavy computations required by other methods.

  abstract     = {The applicability of model-based online reinforcement learning algorithms is often limited by the amount of exploration required for learning the environment model to the desired level of accuracy. A promising approach to addressing this issue is to exploit side information, available either a priori or during the agent’s mission, for learning the unknown dynamics. Side information in our context refers to information in the form of bounds on the differences between transition probabilities at different states in the environment. We use this information as a measure of reusability of the direct experience gained by performing actions and observing the outcomes at different states. We propose a framework to integrate side information into existing model-based reinforcement learning algorithms by complementing the samples obtained directly at states with second-hand information obtained from other states with similar dynamics. Additionally, we propose an algorithm for synthesizing the optimal control strategy in unknown environments by using side information to effectively balance between exploration and exploitation. We prove that, with high probability, the proposed algorithm yields a near-optimal policy in the Bayesian sense, while also guaranteeing the safety of the agent during exploration. We obtain the near-optimal policy in time steps that are polynomial in terms of the parameters describing the model. We illustrate the utility of the proposed algorithms in a setting of a Mars rover, with data from onboard sensors and a companion aerial vehicle acting as the side information.},

We first propose a new nonscaling output-feedback control scheme to solve the prescribed-time mean-square stabilization problem for stochastic nonlinear systems without sensor uncertainty. In this case, compared with the existing results on stochastic nonlinear prescribed-time stabilization, an appealing feature in our design is that the order of the scaling function in the controller is dramatically reduced, which yields a simpler controller and with the control effort reduced. We then consider prescribed-time output-feedback control for stochastic nonlinear systems with sensor uncertainty. In this case, the new design ingredient is that a time-varying controller is designed to guarantee prescribed-time mean-square stabilization, different from the existing results where an adaptive controller is designed to ensure almost sure regulation (as time goes to infinity). Finally, two simulation examples are given to illustrate the stochastic nonlinear prescribed-time output-feedback designs.},

Nonlinearity is introduced by saturating opinion exchanges, and this is enough to enable a significantly greater range of opinion-forming behaviors with our model as compared to existing linear and nonlinear models. For a group of agents that communicate opinions over a network, these behaviors include multistable agreement and disagreement, tunable sensitivity to input, robustness to disturbance, flexible transition between patterns of opinions, and opinion cascades. We derive network-dependent tuning rules to robustly control the system behavior and we design state-feedback dynamics for the model parameters to make the behavior adaptive to changing external conditions.

The key analytical step is the decomposition of the one-step error recursion of our algorithm into algorithmic error and perturbation error . We show that the perturbation error decays exponentially with the lag between two consecutive receding horizons, whereas the algorithmic error, determined by Newton&#39;s method, achieves quadratic convergence instead. Overall this approach induces our local exponential convergence result in terms of the receding horizon length for suitable values of $L$ . Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {A path-following control algorithm enables a system’s trajectories under its guidance to converge to and evolve along a given geometric desired path. There exist various such algorithms, but many of them can only guarantee local convergence to the desired path in its neighborhood. In contrast, the control algorithms using a well-designed guiding vector field can ensure almost global convergence of trajectories to the desired path; here, “almost” means that in some cases, a measure-zero set of trajectories converge to the singular set where the vector field becomes zero (with all other trajectories converging to the desired path). In this article, we first generalize the guiding vector field from the Euclidean space to a general smooth Riemannian manifold. This generalization can deal with path-following in some abstract configuration space (such as robot arm joint space). Then, we show several theoretical results from a topological viewpoint. Specifically, we are motivated by the observation that singular points of the guiding vector field exist in many examples where the desired path is homeomorphic to the unit circle, but it is unknown whether the existence of singular points always holds in general (i.e., is inherent in the topology of the desired path). In the $n$ -dimensional Euclidean space, we provide an affirmative answer, and conclude that it is not possible to guarantee global convergence to desired paths that are homeomorphic to the unit circle. Furthermore, we show that there always exist nonpath-converging trajectories (i.e., trajectories that do not converge to the desired path) starting from the boundary of a ball containing the desired path in an $n$ -dimensional Euclidean space where $n \geq 3$ . Examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.},

This is, we aim to control a Markov decision process of which we do not know the transition probabilities, but we have access to sample trajectories through experience. We define safety as the agent remaining in a desired safe set with high probability during the operation time. The drawbacks of this formulation are twofold. The problem is nonconvex and computing the gradients of the constraints with respect to the policies is prohibitive. Hence, we propose an ergodic relaxation of the constraints with the following advantages. 1) The safety guarantees are maintained in the case of episodic tasks and they hold until a given time horizon for continuing tasks. 2) The constrained optimization problem despite its nonconvexity has arbitrarily small duality gap if the parametrization of the controller is rich enough. 3) The gradients of the Lagrangian associated with the safe learning problem can be computed using standard reinforcement learning results and stochastic approximation tools. Leveraging these advantages, we exploit primal-dual algorithms to find policies that are safe and optimal. We test the proposed approach in a navigation task in a continuous domain. The numerical results show that our algorithm is capable of dynamically adapting the policy to the environment and the required safety levels.},

In the context of linear output regulation, it was proved that embedding an internal model of the exogenous signals is necessary and sufficient to achieve tracking of the desired reference signals in spite of external disturbances and parametric uncertainties. This result is commonly known as the internal model principle. A complete extension of such linear result to general nonlinear systems is still an open problem, exacerbated by the large number of alternative definitions of uncertainty and desired control goals that are possible in a nonlinear setting. In this article, we develop a general framework in which all these different notions can be formally characterized in a unifying way. Classical results are reinterpreted in the proposed setting, and new results and insights are presented with a focus on robust rejection/tracking of arbitrary harmonic content. Moreover, we show by counterexample that, in the relevant case of continuous unstructured uncertainties, there are problems for which no smooth finite-dimensional robust regulator exists ensuring exact regulation.},

This could be effectively used to describe several applications settings, ranging from sensor-network-based border patrolling to IoT-based environmental precision farming. In this context, our contribution is threefold: 1) we show that, under the assumption that a global optimal solution exists, then such a solution can be computed by solving a relaxed problem, where the irreducibility and aperiodicity constraints are lifted; 2) we derive an algebraic optimality condition for the relaxed problem; and 3) we design a distributed algorithm that provably converges towards this optimality condition.},

An additional difficulty is that the LC map is not assumed to come from an underlying optimization problem, which prevents exploiting strong global properties, such as convexity or Lipschitzianity. Yet, we propose a distributed algorithm and prove its convergence, in fact showing that it maintains the linear rate of the standard Banach–Picard iteration for the average LC map.

We show that there is a subtle error in Bar-Shalom and Tse’s proof of the claim that CE implies NDE. Moreover, we prove that the claim does not hold by providing a counterexample. As our second and primary contribution, we introduce an alternative and a more relaxed notion of dual freeness and establish that this new notion is sufficient to guarantee the separation of estimation and control and CE in the same control problem considered by Bar-Shalom and Tse.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the conditions for convergence of the recently introduced dynamic regressor extension and mixing (DREM) parameter estimator when the extended regressor is generated using linear time-invariant filters. In particular, we are interested in relating these conditions with the ones required for convergence of the classical gradient (or least squares), namely the well-known persistent excitation (PE) requirement on the original regressor vector, $\phi (t) \in \mathbb {R}^q$ , with $q \in \mathbb {N}$ the number of unknown parameters. Moreover, we study the case when only interval excitation (IE) is available, under which DREM, concurrent, and composite learning schemes ensure global convergence, being the convergence for DREM in a finite time . Regarding PE, we prove, under some mild technical assumptions, that if $\phi$ is PE, then the scalar regressor of DREM, $\Delta _N \in \mathbb {R}$ , is also PE ensuring exponential convergence. Concerning IE, we prove that if $\phi$ is IE, then $\Delta _N$ is also IE. All these results are established in the almost sure sense, namely proving that the set of filter parameters for which the claims do not hold is of zero measure. The main technical tool used in our proof is inspired by a study of Luenberger observers for nonautonomous nonlinear systems recently reported in the literature.},

Each player’s strategy is constrained to a convex and compact set and should satisfy some global affine constraints. In order to decouple players’ strategies under the global constraints, an extra player is introduced aiming at minimizing the violation of the coupling constraints, which transforms the original SGNE problems to extended stochastic Nash equilibrium problems. Due to the unknown stochastic effects in the objective, the gradient of the objective function is infeasible and only noisy objective values are observable. Instead of gradient-based methods, a semidecentralized zeroth-order method is developed to achieve the SGNE under a two-point gradient estimation. The convergence proof is provided for strongly monotone stochastic generalized games. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm through the Cournot model for resource allocation problems.},

The time-varying likelihood of transmission failures on this channel depends on the power of the jamming interference signal emitted by an attacker. We show that jamming attacks can prevent stability when the system faces disturbance, even if the attacked system without disturbance is stable. We also show that stability under jamming and disturbance can be achieved if the average jamming interference power is restricted in a certain way that we characterize in this article.

  abstract     = {Real-time optimization in cyber–physical network systems with unknown system parameters must integrate optimization and parameter estimation, leading to adaptive optimization problems. Such problems encounter fundamental conflict between optimization and system identifiability. Recently, a new method of employing a stochastic or periodic dither has been introduced to resolve this conflict and achieve convergence toward optimal solutions. However, adding a dither introduces persistent disturbances to the optimal solution, resulting in an essential tradeoff between convergence rate and steady-state error. This article introduces a method of adding decaying periodic dither signals into the cyber–physical system, which can still provide sufficient excitations for estimating the unknown parameters and, at the same time, asymptotically reduce optimality errors down to zero without affecting negatively on identifiability. The convergence properties of parameter estimation and optimization updates are provided simultaneously, first for noise-free and model uncertain free cases, followed by general systems that include observation noise and modeling errors. A simulation example is used to illustrate the adaptive optimization algorithms and the main properties.},

A suitable averaging analysis reveals that the solutions of the closed-loop system converge locally uniformly to the solutions of an averaged system in the large-amplitude high-frequency limit. This in turn leads to the effect that stability properties of the averaged system carry over to the approximating closed-loop system. Descent directions of the objective function are given by symmetric products of vector fields in the averaged system. Under suitable assumptions, we prove that minimum points of the objective function are asymptotically stable for the averaged system and therefore practically asymptotically stable for the closed-loop system.

A control mapping is constructed based on the input matrix condition, and a nonlinear operator is introduced to convert the controllability into the existence of a fixed point. A sufficient controllability criterion is obtained under the Banach’s contraction mapping principle. Second, a linear growth condition is imposed on the nonlinearity. A switched control mapping is constructed using the inverse of controllability matrix, and a corresponding nonlinear operator is introduced. An alternative controllability condition is then developed by resorting to the Rothe’s fixed point theorem.

To estimate the unknown parameters of the uncertain leader, distributed intermediate parameter estimators based on event-triggered communication mechanism are first introduced. To guarantee that high-order derivatives exist when applying the backstepping method, such estimators are further modified to obtain final estimators having a polynomial form by using the Hermite interpolation method. Moreover, novel high-order filters are proposed to generate local reference signals and to ensure the existence of high-order derivatives of the filter states. Based on the developed filters, a backstepping-based decentralized adaptive controller is developed. It is proved that consensus errors are asymptotically convergent with the developed method.

Compared with some other globally stable formation control systems using local relative position measurements, our approach is shown to be more computationally effective and scalable. Moreover, by additionally controlling the relative position between a pair of neighboring agents, we also propose formation control laws to globally stabilize triangularly angle rigid formations with prescribed orientation and scale. Compared with other angle-constrained formations with prescribed orientation and scale, our proposed formation control law guarantees global stability instead of almost global stability. Finally, we remark that the proposed approach can also be used to globally stabilize triangular formations specified by ratio-of-distance constraints.

  abstract     = {This article introduces a closed-loop frequency analysis tool for reset control systems. To begin with sufficient conditions for the existence of the steady-state response for a closed-loop system with a reset element and driven by periodic references are provided. It is then shown that, under specific conditions, such a steady-state response for periodic inputs is periodic with the same period as the input. Furthermore, a framework to obtain the steady-state response and to define a notion of closed-loop frequency response, including high order harmonics, is presented. Finally, pseudosensitivities for reset control systems are defined. These simplify the analysis of this class of systems and allow a direct software implementation of the analysis tool. This methods gives deeper insight into the performance of the system than that achieved with the describing function method.},

The so-called perspective observability criteria exist to verify this observability property algebraically, but they provide only a binary answer. The present contribution studies the assessment of perspective and Riccati observability in a quantitative way, in terms of the distance to the closest nonobservable system. For this purpose, a distance measure is proposed. An optimization problem for determining it is derived, which features a quadratic cost function and an orthogonality constraint. The solution of this optimization problem by means of a descent algorithm is discussed and demonstrated in the course of a practically motivated numerical example.},

First, sufficient criteria are established for global uniform exponential stability (GUES) of switched nonlinear systems. Then, based on the constructed SMDLF, we derive less conservative stability conditions for switched linear neutral systems. Furthermore, a set of time-dependent state feedback controllers are designed to guarantee the GUES of the underlying system.

Using row- and column-stochastic weights, we propose a family of distributed momentum methods. It is a parametric distributed momentum (PDM) method, for which different values of parameter can lead to different distributed momentum methods. PDM includes the distributed heavy-ball method ( $\mathcal {AB}m$ ) and the distributed Nesterov gradient method ( $\mathcal {ABN}$ ) as its special cases. When the step sizes and the momentum coefficient do not exceed some upper bounds, we prove that PDM can converge to the optimal solution at a global $R$ -linear rate. The convergence result of PDM not only covers that of $\mathcal {AB}m$ , but also supplements that of $\mathcal {ABN}$ , which lacks theoretical convergence result. Simulation results on classification problems that arise in machine learning show that PDM with an appropriate negative parameter value can achieve faster acceleration than the existing distributed momentum algorithms.},

We first give the necessary and sufficient condition for the inexistence of the strictly stealthy attack, which does not change the residual and can lead to unbounded estimate error. When the strictly stealthy attack does not exist, a lower bound of the secondary moment of the estimate error is then derived via the posterior Cramér–Rao bound. The zero-mean Gaussian attack that maximizes this lower bound is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem.

These analyses are done in conventional control-theoretic terms, which we use to develop guidelines for calibrating privacy as a function of system parameters.

Asymptotic tracking remains an open problem for such dynamics. This note gives a positive answer to this problem in the framework of prescribed performance control, without approximation structures (neural networks, fuzzy logic, etc.) being involved in the control design. The unknown system uncertainties are first transformed to unknown but bounded terms using barrier Lyapunov functions, and then these terms are compensated by appropriate adaptation laws. A method is also proposed to extract the control terms in a linear-like fashion during the control design, which overcomes the difficulty that virtual or actual control signals appear in a nonaffine manner. A practical poppet valve system is used to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical findings.},

This problem can be cast as a convex optimization problem, where the global objective is to minimize a sum of convex functions corresponding to individual DER generation cost while satisfying 1) linear inequality constraints corresponding to the DER capacity limits and 2) a linear equality constraint corresponding to the total power generated by the DERs being equal to the total power demand. We develop distributed algorithms to solve the DER coordination problem over time-varying communication networks with either bidirectional or unidirectional communication links. The proposed algorithms can be seen as distributed versions of a centralized primal–dual algorithm. One of the algorithms proposed for directed communication graphs has a geometric convergence rate even when communication out-degrees are unknown to agents. We showcase the proposed algorithms using the standard IEEE 39-bus test system and compare their performance against other ones proposed in the literature.},

  abstract     = {This article develops distributed synchronous and asynchronous algorithms for the large-scale semidefinite programming with diagonal constraints, which has wide applications in combinatorial optimization, image processing, and community detection. The information of the semidefinite programming is allocated to multiple interconnected agents such that each agent aims to find a solution by communicating to its neighbors. Based on the low-rank property of solutions and the Burer–Monteiro factorization, we transform the original problem into a distributed optimization problem over unit spheres to reduce variable dimensions and ensure positive semidefiniteness without involving semidefinite projections, which are computationally expensive. For the distributed optimization problem, we propose distributed synchronous and asynchronous algorithms, both of which reduce computational burden and storage space compared with existing centralized algorithms. Specifically, the distributed synchronous algorithm almost surely escapes strict saddle points and converges to the set of optimal solutions to the optimization problem. In addition, the proposed distributed asynchronous algorithm allows communication delays and converges to critical points to the optimization problem under mild conditions. By applying the proposed algorithms to image segmentation, we illustrate the efficiency and convergence performance of the two proposed algorithms.},

We consider a cost function that combines a general economic cost with a user-defined learning cost function that aims at incentivizing learning of the unknown system. In particular, due to the finite horizon of the MPC scheme and to the presence of disturbances, the open-loop trajectory usually differs from the closed-loop one. Such a mismatch causes existing learning-based MPC schemes to only show a learning phase in the open-loop prediction, without providing any formal guarantee on the actual closed-loop learning. In this article, we show how existing MPC schemes can be easily modified in order to guarantee closed-loop learning of the system by including a suitable discount factor in the chosen learning cost function, and implementing an additional constraint in the original MPC scheme. We show that various techniques for online learning the system dynamics, such as kinky inference methods, Gaussian processes, or parametric approaches, can be used within the proposed general framework.},

The connection with the Sylvester equation and its solution is also given. The functional observer parameters are obtained from the Sylvester equation and the functional detectability condition. Necessary and sufficient conditions for stability of functional observers are given in the form of matrix inequalities based on two approaches: the first approach is based on stability analysis of the solution of the Sylvester equation, and the second approach is based on the Frobenius canonical form and its spectrum, which leads to a static output feedback formulation. Necessary and sufficient conditions and some simple sufficient conditions in the form of linear matrix inequality are given for the functional observer design.

This new class captures and unifies all the existing stable subclasses of negative imaginary (NI) systems and is capable of distinguishing between the strict subclasses (e.g., strongly strictly negative imaginary, output strictly negative imaginary (OSNI), input strictly negative imaginary, etc.) in the literature. In addition to a frequency-domain definition, the proposed IONI class has been characterized in a time-domain dissipative framework in terms of a new quadratic supply rate $w(u,\bar{u},\dot{\bar{y}})$ . This supply rate consists of the system’s input ( $u$ ), an auxiliary input ( $\bar{u}$ ) that is a filtered version of the system’s input, and the time-derivative of an auxiliary output of the system ( $\dot{\bar{y}}$ ). This supply rate corrects earlier supply rate attempts in the literature, which were only expressed in terms of the input ( $u$ ) and the time-derivative of the system’s output ( $\dot{y}$ ). In this article, IONI systems are proved to be a class of dissipative systems with respect to the proposed supply rate $w(u,\bar{u},\dot{\bar{y}})$ . Subsequently, an equivalent frequency-dependent $(Q(\omega), S(\omega), R(\omega))$ dissipative supply rate is also proposed for IONI systems. These findings reveal the connections between the NI property and classical dissipativity in both the time domain and frequency domain. We also provide linear matrix inequality (LMI) tests on the state-space matrices to check whether a system belongs to the IONI class or any of its important subclasses. Finally, the derived results are specialized for OSNI systems since such systems exhibit interesting closed-loop stability properties when connected, in a positive feedback loop, to NI systems without poles at the origin. Several illustrative numerical examples are provided to make the results intuitive and useful.},

In this article, we introduce a new notion of block factor-width-two matrices and build a new hierarchy of inner and outer approximations of the cone of positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices. This notion is a block extension of the standard factor-width-two matrices, and allows for an improved inner-approximation of the PSD cone. In the context of SOS optimization, this leads to a block extension of the scaled diagonally dominant sum-of-squares (SDSOS) polynomials. By varying a matrix partition, the notion of block factor-width-two matrices can balance a tradeoff between the computation scalability and solution quality for solving semidefinite and SOS optimization problems. Numerical experiments on a range of large-scale instances confirm our theoretical findings.},

In the present article, we leverage these results to introduce a new scheme where the size of the sample of scenarios is iteratively tuned to the current complexity of the solution so as to eventually hit a desired level of risk.

A range of techniques are nowadays available to design event-triggered controllers. However, we generally have only very little information about the actual behavior of the transmission instants and thus about the amount of transmissions being actually generated, though this is a key feature of the design. In this article, we analyze the inter-event times, i.e., the times between two successive transmission instants, when the plant is modeled as a two-dimensional linear time-invariant system. The controller is a state-feedback law and the triggering rule is the relative threshold policy, which is allowed to be time-regularized. One of the main results in this article is the explanation of the oscillatory behavior of the inter-event times when the constant used to define the threshold is small relative to 1, a phenomenon commonly observed in simulations but never explained so far. More generally, the presented results help to understand the behavior of the inter-event times, instead of solely relying on numerical simulations, and thereby can be exploited to rigorously evaluate the performance of the considered triggering condition in terms of (average) inter-transmission times.},

We formulate these two problems in the language of behavioral systems theory and parametric mathematical programs, and we bridge them through a multicriteria formulation trading off system identification and control objectives. We illustrate our results with two methods from subspace identification and control: namely, subspace predictive control and low-rank approximation, which constrain trajectories to be consistent with a nonparametric predictor derived from (respectively, the column span of) a data Hankel matrix. In both cases, we conclude that direct and regularized data-driven control can be derived as convex relaxation of the indirect approach, and the regularizations account for an implicit identification step. Our analysis further reveals a novel regularizer and a plausible hypothesis explaining the remarkable empirical performance of direct methods on nonlinear systems.},

The closed-loop stability analysis employs Lyapunov methods in the framework of the singular perturbations theory. Finally, we show that if the plant satisfies the asymptotic gain property, then the closed-loop system is globally asymptotically stable for any sufficiently small controller gain.

To ensure parameter privacy, we propose a filter design framework which consists of two components: a randomizer and a nonlinear transformation. The randomizer takes the private parameter as input and randomly generates a pseudo parameter. The nonlinear mapping transforms the measurements such that the joint p.d.f. of the filter&#39;s output depends on the pseudo parameter rather than the private parameter. It also ensures that the joint p.d.f. of the filter&#39;s output belongs to the same family of distributions as that of the measurements. The design of the randomizer is formulated as an optimization problem subject to a privacy constraint, in terms of mutual information, and it is shown that the optimal randomizer is the solution of a convex optimization problem. Using information-theoretic inequalities, we show that the performance of any estimator of the private parameter, based on the output of the privacy filter, is limited by the privacy constraint. The structure of the nonlinear transformation is studied in the special cases of independent and identically distributed, Markovian, and Gauss-Markov measurements. Our results show that the privacy filter in the Gauss-Markov case can be implemented as two one-step ahead Kalman predictors and a set of minimum mean square error predictors. A numerical example on occupancy privacy in a building automation system illustrates the approach.},

The proposed architecture, in the setting of standard neural network (NN)-based adaptive control, augments an external working memory to the NN. The controller, through a write operation, writes the hidden layer feature vector of the NN to the external working memory and can also update this information with the observed error in the output. Through a read operation, the controller retrieves information from the working memory to modify the final control signal. First, we consider a simpler estimation problem to theoretically study the effect of an external memory and prove that the estimation accuracy can be improved by incorporating memory. We, then, consider a model reference NN adaptive controller for linear systems with matched uncertainty to implement and illustrate our ideas. We prove that the resulting controller leads to a uniformly bounded stable closed-loop system. Through extensive simulations and specific metrics, such as peak deviation and settling time, we show that memory augmentation improves learning significantly. Importantly, we also provide evidence for and insights on the mechanism by which this specific memory augmentation improves learning.},

  abstract     = {Structural identifiability is a property of a differential model with parameters that allows for the parameters to be determined from the model equations in the absence of noise. The method of input–output (IO) equations is one method for verifying structural identifiability. This method stands out in its importance because the additional insights it provides can be used to analyze and improve models. However, its complete theoretical grounds and applicability are still to be established. A subtlety and key for this method to work correctly is knowing whether the coefficients of these equations are identifiable. In this article, to address this, we prove identifiability of the coefficients of IO equations for types of differential models that often appear in practice, such as linear models with one output and linear compartment models in which, from each compartment, one can reach either a leak or an input. This shows that checking identifiability via IO equations for these models is legitimate, and as we prove, that the field of identifiable functions is generated by the coefficients of the IO equations. Finally, we exploit a connection between IO equations and the transfer function matrix to show that, for a linear compartment model with an input and strongly connected graph, the field of all identifiable functions is generated by the coefficients of the transfer function matrix even if the initial conditions are generic.},

  abstract     = {A continuous controller is developed for a centralized network control system (NCS), which is composed of agents with nonlinear dynamics subject to a time-delay-switch (TDS) attack and additive disturbances. Since the state tracking error is unmeasurable during TDS attacks, controllers cannot use the state tracking error to coordinate the NCS. Therefore, a novel error signal is designed to address this unique challenge and enable the NCS to achieve a formation control objective. Furthermore, a TDS attack mitigation strategy is developed, which uses both learning- and model-based approaches to estimate an agent’s state for TDS attack detection and compensation. Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals are used in the stability analysis to prove that the tracking errors converge to a steady-state residual, which is a function of the system uncertainty and TDS attack properties. The leader–follower formation control problem for unmanned aerial vehicles based on a pure pursuit guidance law is selected for a simulation study to validate the performance of the proposed method.},

For the special case of parametric constrained least-squares problems that arise from model predictive control (MPC) formulations, we propose a novel and very efficient QR factorization method for eliminating equality constraints. Together with SVD or $K$ -SVD, the method provides a numerically robust alternative to standard condensing and move blocking, and to other complexity reduction methods for MPC based on basis functions. We show the good performance of the proposed techniques in numerical tests and in a problem of linearized MPC of a nonlinear benchmark process.},

Semistability is the property whereby the solutions of a dynamical system converge to Lyapunov stable equilibrium points determined by the system initial conditions. In this article, we build on the theories of semistability and finite-time semistability for continuous-time dynamical systems to develop a rigorous framework for discrete semistability and discrete finite-time semistability. Specifically, Lyapunov and converse Lyapunov theorems for semistability and finite-time semistability are developed, and the regularity properties of the Lyapunov function establishing finite-time semistability are shown to be related to the settling time function capturing the finite settling time behavior of the dynamical system. These results are then used to develop a general framework for designing semistable and finite-time semistable consensus protocols for discrete dynamical networks for achieving multiagent coordination tasks asymptotically and in finite time. The proposed controller architectures involve the exchange of generalized energy state information between agents guaranteeing that the closed-loop dynamical network is semistable to an equipartitioned equilibrium representing a state of consensus consistent with basic thermodynamic principles.},

This article also studies the implications of the sufficient condition in the case when the RKHS is finite or infinite-dimensional. When the RKHS is finite-dimensional, the sufficient condition implies parameter convergence as in the conventional analysis. On the other hand, when the RKHS is infinite-dimensional, the same condition implies that the function estimate error is ultimately bounded by a constant that depends on the approximation error in the infinite-dimensional RKHS.

We assume that the dynamics of the linear system is unknown and only noisy measurements of the state variable are available. Using noisy measurements of the state variable, we propose two model-free iterative algorithms to solve the LQ problem. The proposed algorithms are variants of policy iteration routine where the policy is greedy with respect to the average of all previous iterations. We rigorously analyze the properties of the proposed algorithms, including stability of the generated controllers and convergence. We analyze the effect of measurement noise on the performance of the proposed algorithms, the classical off-policy, and the classical $Q$ -learning routines. We also investigate a model-building approach, inspired by adaptive control, where a model of the dynamical system is estimated and the optimal control problem is solved assuming that the estimated model is the true model. We use a benchmark to evaluate and compare our proposed algorithms with the classical off-policy, the classical $Q$ -learning, and the policy gradient. We show that our model-building approach performs nearly identical to the analytical solution and our proposed policy iteration-based algorithms outperform the classical off-policy and the classical $Q$ -learning algorithms on this benchmark but do not outperform the model-building approach.},

Specifically, in SPARQ-SGD, each node takes a fixed number of local gradient steps and then checks if the model parameters have significantly changed compared to its last update; only when the change is beyond a certain threshold (specified by a design criterion), it compresses its local model parameters using both quantization and sparsification and communicates them to its neighbors. We prove that SPARQ-SGD converges as $O(\frac{1}{nT})$ and $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{nT}})$ in the strongly convex and nonconvex settings, respectively, matching the convergence rates of plain decentralized SGD. This demonstrates that we get communication efficiency achieved by aggressive compression, local iterations, and event-triggered communication essentially for free . We evaluate SPARQ-SGD over real datasets to demonstrate significant amount of savings in communication over the state-of-the-art while achieving similar performance.},

We consider two approaches: a Nash setup, with no prior commitment, and a Stackelberg solution concept, where the encoder is committed to a given announced policy a priori . We show that the Stackelberg equilibrium cost of the encoder is upper semicontinuous, under the Wasserstein metric, as encoder’s prior approaches the decoder’s prior, and it is also lower semicontinuous with Gaussian priors. For the Stackelberg setup, the optimality of affine policies for Gaussian signaling no longer holds under prior mismatch, and thus, team-theoretic optimality of linear/affine policies are not robust to perturbations. We provide conditions under which there exist informative Nash and Stackelberg equilibria with affine policies. Finally, we show existence of fully informative Nash and Stackelberg equilibria for the cheap talk problem under an absolute continuity condition.},

A necessary and sufficient condition for the insecurity of the distributed estimator is derived, in which the stealthy attack can evade the detector and degrade the estimation performance. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed to generate stealthy attack sequences. To overcome the vulnerability, a data transmission strategy based on watermarking is proposed. The effect of the watermarking parameters on the attack in different scenarios is subsequently analyzed. It is proved that the K–L divergence detector can effectively distinguish the stealthy attack with the help of the proposed strategy, thereby ensuring the security of the distributed state estimator. Compared with traditional encryption mechanisms, the proposed strategy neither increases the computational complexity nor sacrifices the estimation performance in the absence of attacks.

  abstract     = {In this technical article, to seek the optimal solution to time-dependent nonlinear optimization subject to linear inequality and equality constraints (TDNO-IEC), the gradient-based differential neural-solution, termed as GDN model, is proposed and researched. Notably, TDNO-IEC is first converted into the nonhomogeneous linear equation with the dynamic parameter. Second, differential neural-solution with the aid of gradient is designed. The contrastive theoretical analyses among the GDN model, gradient-based neural network (GNN), and the dual neural network (DNN) prove that the proposed GDN model has higher accuracy for eliminating the large solution error with exponential convergence. In addition, reasonable convergent time of the GDN model is guaranteed by activation functions with simple formulation. Last, an illustrative example and real-world applications, including robot motion planning and data dimension reduction and reconstruction, further validate the high availability of the proposed GDN model.},

  abstract     = {Accelerated first-order methods, also called fast gradient methods, are popular optimization methods in the field of convex optimization. However, they are prone to suffer from oscillatory behavior that slows their convergence when medium to high accuracy is desired. In order to address this, restart schemes have been proposed in the literature, which seek to improve the practical convergence by suppressing the oscillatory behavior. This article presents a restart scheme for accelerated first-order methods, for which we show linear convergence under the satisfaction of a quadratic functional growth condition, thus encompassing a broad class of non-necessarily strongly convex optimization problems. Moreover, the worst-case convergence rate is comparable to the one obtained using an (generally nonimplementable) optimal fixed-rate restart strategy. We compare the proposed algorithm with other restart schemes by applying them to a model predictive control case study.},

Unfortunately, the convergence rate of these solvers is significantly affected by the conditioning of the problem data, with ill-conditioned problems requiring a large number of iterations. To reduce the number of iterations required, we present a simple method for computing a horizon-independent preconditioning matrix for the Hessian of the condensed problem. The preconditioner is based on the block Toeplitz structure of the Hessian. Horizon independence allows one to use only the predicted system and cost matrices to compute the preconditioner, instead of the full Hessian. The proposed preconditioner has equivalent performance to an optimal preconditioner in numerical examples, producing speedups between 2x and 9x for the FGM. Additionally, we derive horizon-independent spectral bounds for the Hessian in terms of the transfer function of the predicted system, and show how these can be used to compute a novel horizon-independent bound on the condition number for the preconditioned Hessian.},

Then, we establish a relationship between Nash equilibria of the induced game and the solutions of the corresponding variational inequality problem. Next, a distributed algorithm is proposed, and finally, its converges to the Nash equilibrium of the induced game is proved under certain assumptions.

We show that, when a linear independence constraint qualification (LICQ) condition holds, the LMPC scheme guarantees strict iterative performance improvement and optimality, meaning that the closed-loop cost evaluated over the entire task converges asymptotically to the optimal cost of the infinite-horizon control problem. Compared to previous works, this sufficient LICQ condition can be easily checked, it holds for a larger class of systems and it can be used to adaptively select the prediction horizon of the controller, as demonstrated by a numerical example.},

We focus on finding a policy that selects the switching actions at each mode such that the switched system is guaranteed to be stable. Given a policy in the MDP, the considered MDP-JLS reduces to a Markov jump linear system (MJLS). We consider both mean-square stability and stability with probability one. For mean-square stability, we leverage existing stability conditions for MJLSs and propose efficient semidefinite programming formulations to find a stabilizing policy in the MDP. For stability with probability one, we derive new sufficient conditions and compute a stabilizing policy using linear programming.

It describes whether one can use observed output sequences to determine the current and subsequent states. Delayed detectability generalizes detectability in the sense that when doing state estimation at a time instant, some outputs after the instant are also considered, making the estimation more accurate. In this article, we use a novel concurrent-composition method to give polynomial-time algorithms for verifying several delayed versions of strong detectability of discrete-event systems modeled by finite-state automata in the contexts of formal languages and $\omega$ -languages without any assumption, which strengthen the polynomial-time verification algorithms in the literature based on two fundamental assumptions of liveness (aka deadlock-freeness) and divergence-freeness (the former implies an automaton will never halt and the latter implies the running of an automaton will always be eventually observed). In addition, based on our verification algorithms, we obtain polynomial-time algorithms for enforcing these notions of delayed strong detectability in an open-loop manner, which work in a different way compared with the existing exponential-time enforcement algorithms under the supervisory control framework in a closed-loop manner. Moreover, by using our methods, polynomial-time enforcement algorithms can be designed for many polynomially verifiable inference-based properties such as diagnosability and predictability.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the distributed nonrecursive averaging filter design for the quantized consensus of discrete-time first-order multiagent systems over undirected and connected networks. The quantized consensus problem is cast into the robust consensus problem with sector bound uncertainties associated with the edges of communication graphs, and then an edge sensitivity design approach is utilized for the filter parameter design. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the filter parameter for preserving robust consensus with sector bound uncertainties are provided, which are shown to be dependent on the $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ norm of the edge complementary sensitivity transfer matrix of the closed-loop multiagent system. Then, the optimal filter parameter design is provided by solving a constrained optimization problem, under which robust consensus with maximal allowable sector bound parameter is reached. The results show that the supremum of the sector bound parameter of the logarithmic quantizer for preserving robust consensus is independent of the communication network topologies and the sampling period.},

We relax the standard requirement that the interaction graph between components is a tree and, for the general case, we investigate under which conditions the local consistency of the local estimates imply their global consistency. Moreover, we show that if the information exchanged between agents incorporates additional information related to the execution time intervals of the shared transitions, the globally consistent estimates become equal to the results derived in a CR.},

For coordination, we propose a distributed controller for covering moving, compact domains which consists in a double integrator with bounded input forces. This control policy is based on artificial potentials and alignment forces designed to promote desired vehicle-domain and intervehicle separations and relative velocities. We prove that certain coverage configurations are locally asymptotically stable. For safety, we establish energy conditions for collision-free motion and utilize Hamilton–Jacobi (HJ) reachability theory for last-resort pairwise collision avoidance. We derive an analytical solution to the associated HJ partial differential equation corresponding to the collision avoidance problem between two double integrator vehicles. We demonstrate our approach in several numerical simulations involving vehicles covering convex and nonconvex moving domains.},

By applying polynomial chaos theory, the control synthesis problem is solved using a high-dimensional expanded system, which characterizes stochastic state uncertainty propagation. A closed-loop polynomial chaos transformation is proposed to derive the closed-loop expanded system. The approach explicitly accounts for the closed-loop dynamics and preserves the $\mathcal {L}_2$ -induced gain, which results in smaller transformation errors compared to existing polynomial chaos transformations. The effect of using finite-degree polynomial chaos expansions is first captured by a norm-bounded linear differential inclusion, and then addressed by formulating a robust polynomial chaos based control synthesis problem. This proposed approach avoids the use of high-degree polynomial chaos expansions to alleviate the destabilizing effect of truncation errors, which significantly reduces computational complexity.

The ultimate bounds depend only on the magnitude of the largest perturbation and the network diameter, and three design parameters trading off competing aspects of performance. For example, as in many dynamical systems, values leading to greater resilience to network perturbations slow convergence and vice versa.},

By transforming the ES system to the time-delay system, we have developed a stability analysis via a Lyapunov–Krasovskii method. We derive the practical stability conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities for the resulting time-delay system. The time-delay approach offers a quantitative calculation on the upper bound of the dither and sampling periods, constant delays that the ES system is able to tolerate, as well as the ultimate bound of the extremum seeking error.

By constructing a novel event generator function, the order of the event triggering sequence is identified on two independent directions. Then, the probabilistic constraint is enforced onto the shift-varying LRPs under the influence of the event-triggered mechanism. With the aid of the Chi-square distribution and the completing-the-square technique, a controller design algorithm is proposed to ensure that both the probabilistic constraints and the quadratic cost index are satisfied by using the actual information at the triggering instants. Sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the existence of event-based controllers, and the controller gains are obtained at each step by solving a series of matrix inequalities.

By synthesizing the observer dynamics among the neighbors, a novel cooperative tracking controller is developed to address nonidentical parameters both in model uncertainties and nonlinear dynamics. Then, the robust consensus tracking problem can be solved if the cooperative behaviors between the chasers and their observers can be achieved synchronically. A special case of the identical model uncertainty and nonlinear dynamics scenario is also discussed.

Second, a novel PET output feedback controller is designed for the underlying strict feedback nonlinear multiagent systems.

Compared with the existing conditions in (Patil et al., 2019) and (Roy et al., 2020), which require the network topology to be undirected, this condition is more general. Furthermore, the discernibility of topological variations for multiagent systems is revisited. A new necessary and sufficient condition is established, and the indiscernible space is completely characterized. Differing from the condition provided in (Roy et al., 2020), this condition removes the requirements on the multiagent system and has broader applicability. The effectiveness of the results is demonstrated by several examples.},

In particular, we extend the framework of $\rho$ -hard IQCs for exponential stability analysis to external inputs. This result yields that the error between the true uncertain system and the nominal prediction model is bounded by an exponentially stable scalar system. In the proposed tube-based MPC scheme, the state of this error bounding system is predicted along with the nominal model and used as a scaling parameter for the tube size. We prove that this method achieves robust constraint satisfaction and input-to-state stability despite dynamic uncertainties and additive bounded disturbances.

The underlying system is subject to both additive and multiplicative stochastic noises, and the measurement is transmitted to the remote estimator only when the current energy storage is larger than the transmission energy consumption. A binary encoding scheme is utilized in the communication process, under which the measurements are quantized into a bit string, transmitted via memoryless binary symmetric channels with certain probabilistic bit flips, and recovered at the receiver. A minmax robust estimator is designed to minimize the worst-case covariance of the estimation error in terms of the solutions to Riccati-like difference equations. Furthermore, the influence of the length of bit stream on the transmission rate and the estimation performance is discussed, and conditions guaranteeing the boundedness of the proposed estimator are provided.

In this article, we present a maximum likelihood framework to obtain an optimal data-driven model, the signal matrix model, in the presence of output noise. Data compression and noise-level estimation schemes are also proposed to apply the algorithm efficiently to large datasets and unknown noise-level scenarios. Two approaches in system identification and receding horizon control are developed based on the derived optimal estimator. The first one identifies a finite impulse response model. This approach improves the least-squares estimator with less restrictive assumptions. The second one applies the signal matrix model as the predictor in predictive control. The control performance is shown to be better than existing data-driven predictive control algorithms, especially under high noise levels. Both approaches demonstrate that the derived estimator provides a promising framework to apply data-driven algorithms to noisy data.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies optimal motion planning subject to motion and environment uncertainties. By modeling the system as a probabilistic labeled Markov decision process (PL-MDP), the control objective is to synthesize a finite-memory policy, under which the agent satisfies complex high-level tasks expressed as linear temporal logic (LTL) with desired satisfaction probability. In particular, the cost optimization of the trajectory that satisfies infinite horizon tasks is considered, and the trade-off between reducing the expected mean cost and maximizing the probability of task satisfaction is analyzed. The LTL formulas are converted to limit-deterministic Büchi automata (LDBA) with a reachability acceptance condition and a compact graph structure. The novelty of this work lies in considering the cases where LTL specifications can be potentially infeasible and developing a relaxed product MDP between PL- MDP and LDBA. The relaxed product MDP allows the agent to revise its motion plan whenever the task is not fully feasible and quantify the revised plan’s violation measurement. A multi- objective optimization problem is then formulated to jointly consider the probability of task satisfaction, the violation with respect to original task constraints, and the implementation cost of the policy execution. The formulated problem can be solved via coupled linear programs. This work first bridges the gap between probabilistic planning revision of potential infeasible LTL specifications and optimal control synthesis of both plan prefix and plan suffix of the trajectory over the infinite horizons. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Identifiability of a single module in a network of transfer functions is determined by whether a particular transfer function in the network can be uniquely distinguished within a network model set, on the basis of data. Whereas previous research has focused on the situations that all network signals are either excited or measured, we develop generalized analysis results for the situation of partial measurement and partial excitation. As identifiability conditions typically require a sufficient number of external excitation signals, this article introduces a novel network model structure such that excitation from unmeasured noise signals is included, which leads to less conservative identifiability conditions than relying on measured excitation signals only. More importantly, graphical conditions are developed to verify global and generic identifiability of a single module based on the topology of the dynamic network. Depending on whether the input or the output of the module can be measured, we present four identifiability conditions which cover all possible situations in single module identification. These conditions further lead to synthesis approaches for allocating excitation signals and selecting measured signals, to warrant single module identifiability. In addition, if the identifiability conditions are satisfied for a sufficient number of external excitation signals only, indirect identification methods are developed to provide a consistent estimate of the module. All the obtained results are also extended to identifiability of multiple modules in the network.},

In this article, we provide a characterization of the probability that the arrival of a new agent affects the resource share of other agents, which means that accommodating the new agent request at the detriment of the other agents allocation provides some payoff. This probability represents a sensitivity index for the optimal solution of a linear programming resource sharing problem when a new agent shows up, and it is of fundamental importance for a correct and profitable operation of the multi-agent system. Our developments build on the equivalence between the resource sharing problem and certain dual reformulations that can be interpreted as scenario programs with the number of scenarios corresponding to the number of agents in the primal problem. The recent “wait-and-judge” scenario approach is then used to obtain the sought sensitivity index. Our theoretical findings are demonstrated through a numerical example on optimal cargo aircraft loading.},

Then, we introduce a hold time analysis and the rate of change for the loss of time to capture along the dispersal line, and show that the rate has a well-defined saddle point along the dispersal line, which can be used to resolve the dilemma. Moreover, we prove that the saddle point of the rate characterizes optimal game actions not only on the dispersal line, but also for all other states of the game. Finally, we analyze the same game in a version with a nonzero hold time and show that in that case, the actions from the dispersal line have to be applied both on the dispersal line and in a narrow band around it. To illustrate that, we use an example to compute the band around the line.},

Our objective is to avoid offline system identification or hand-specified models and allow a system to safely and autonomously estimate and adapt its own model during operation. Given streaming observations of the system state, we use Bayesian learning to obtain a distribution over the system dynamics. Specifically, we propose a new matrix variate Gaussian process (MVGP) regression approach with an efficient covariance factorization to learn the drift and input gain terms of a nonlinear control-affine system. The MVGP distribution is then used to optimize the system behavior and ensure safety with high probability, by specifying control Lyapunov function (CLF) and control barrier function (CBF) chance constraints. We show that a safe control policy can be synthesized for systems with arbitrary relative degree and probabilistic CLF-CBF constraints by solving a second-order cone program. Finally, we extend our design to a self-triggering formulation, adaptively determining the time at which a new control input needs to be applied in order to guarantee safety.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose two distributed control protocols for discrete-time multiagent systems, which solve the dynamic consensus problem on the max value. In this problem, each agent is fed an exogenous reference signal and has the objective to estimate and track the instantaneous and time-varying value of the maximum among all the signals fed to the network by exploiting only local and anonymous interactions among the agents. The first protocol achieves bounded steady-state and tracking errors which can be tradedoff for convergence time. The second protocol achieves zero steady-state error and requires knowledge of an upper bound to the diameter of the graph representing the network. Modified versions of both protocols are provided to solve the dual dynamic min-consensus problem. These protocols are then exploited to solve a distributed size estimation problem in a network of anonymous agents in a dynamic setting where the size of the network is time-varying during the execution of the estimation algorithm. Numerical simulations are provided in order to corroborate the characterization of the proposed protocols.},

  abstract     = {We analyze a time-coarsening strategy for model predictive control (MPC) that we call diffusing-horizon MPC. This strategy seeks to overcome the computational challenges associated with optimal control problems that span multiple timescales. The coarsening approach uses a time discretization grid that becomes exponentially more sparse as one moves forward in time. This design is motivated by a recently established property of optimal control problems that is known as exponential decay of sensitivity (EDS). This property states that the impact of a parametric perturbation at a future time decays exponentially as one moves backward in time. We establish conditions under which this property holds for a constrained MPC formulation with linear dynamics and costs. Moreover, we show that the proposed coarsening scheme can be cast as a parametric perturbation of the MPC problem and, thus, the exponential decay condition holds. We use a HVAC plant case study with real data to demonstrate the proposed approach. Specifically, we show that computational times can be reduced by two orders of magnitude while increasing the closed-loop cost by only 3\%.},

Via a counterexample, we show the lack of existence of autonomous and continuous barrier functions certifying safety for a nonlinear system that is not only safe but also has a smooth right-hand side. Guided by converse Lyapunov theorems for (nonasymptotic) stability, time-varying barrier functions and appropriate infinitesimal conditions are shown to be both necessary as well as sufficient under mild regularity conditions on the right-hand side of the system. More precisely, we propose a general construction of a time-varying barrier function in terms of a marginal function involving the finite-horizon reachable set. Using techniques from set-valued and nonsmooth analysis, we show that such a function guarantees safety when the system is safe. Furthermore, we show that the proposed barrier function construction inherits the regularity properties of the proposed reachable set. In addition, when the system is safe and smooth, we build upon the constructed barrier function to show the existence of a smooth barrier function guaranteeing safety. Comparisons and relationships to results in the literature are also presented.},

In this article, we show that the natural temporal variation may help simple online tracking methods find and track time-varying global minima. To this end, we investigate the properties of a time-varying projected gradient flow system with inertia, which can be regarded as the continuous-time limit of (1) the optimality conditions for a discretized sequential optimization problem with a proximal regularization and (2) the online tracking scheme. We introduce the notion of the dominant trajectory and show that the inherent temporal variation could reshape the landscape of the Lagrange functional and help a proximal algorithm escape the spurious local minimum trajectories if the global minimum trajectory is dominant. For a problem with twice continuously differentiable objective function and constraints, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee that no matter how a local search method is initialized, it will track a time-varying global solution after some time. The results are illustrated on a benchmark example with many local minima.},

By exploiting the framework of monotone operator theory and operator splitting, we first critically review the most relevant available algorithms and then design two novel schemes: 1) a single-layer, fixed-step algorithm with convergence guarantee for general (noncocoercive, nonstrictly) monotone aggregative games and 2) a single-layer proximal-type algorithm for a class of monotone aggregative games with linearly coupled cost functions. We also design novel accelerated variants of the algorithms via (alternating) inertial and over-relaxation steps.

To understand the complexity of finding a global solution of this problem, we introduce the notion of spurious (i.e., nonglobal) local trajectory as a generalization to the notion of spurious local solution in nonconvex (time-invariant) optimization. We develop an ordinary differential equation (ODE) associated with a time-varying nonlinear dynamical system which, at limit, characterizes the spurious local solutions of the time-varying optimization problem. We prove that the absence of spurious local trajectory is closely related to the transient behavior of the developed system. In particular, we show that if the problem is time-varying, the data variation may force all of the ODE trajectories initialized at arbitrary local minima at the initial time to gradually converge to the global solution trajectory. We study the Jacobian of the dynamical system along a local minimum trajectory and show how its eigenvalues are manipulated by the natural data variation in the problem, which may consequently trigger escaping poor local minima over time.},

Several network-induced imperfections are considered simultaneously, including time-varying intersampling times, sensor node scheduling, and especially, large time-varying transmission delays, where the transmitted signal may arrive at the destination node after the next transmission occurs. A new hybrid system approach is provided to model the closed-loop system that contains all communication related behavior. Then, by constructing new storage functions on the system state and updating errors, the relationship between the maximum allowable sampling period and maximum allowable delay number in sampling is analyzed, where the latter denotes how many inter-sampling periods can be included in one transmission delay. Moreover, to efficiently reduce unnecessary transmissions, a new dynamic event-triggered control scheme is proposed, where the event-triggering conditions are detected only at aperiodic and asynchronous sampling instants. From emulation-based method, where the controllers are initially designed by ignoring all the network-induced imperfections, sufficient conditions on the dynamic event-triggered control are given to ensure closed-loop input-to-state stability with respect to external disturbances. Finally, two nonlinear examples are simulated to illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the theoretical results.},

We define perfect secrecy as keeping the averaged expected error covariance bounded at the legitimate estimator and unbounded at the adversary. By analyzing the stationary distribution of the expected error covariance, we show that perfect secrecy can be attained for unstable systems only if the ACK channel has no packet dropouts.
