  abstract     = {In this article, a novel switched observer-based neural network (NN) adaptive control algorithm is established, which addresses the security control problem of switched nonlinear systems (SNSs) under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The considered SNSs are described in lower triangular form with external disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. Note that when an attack is launched in the sensor–controller channel, the controller will not receive any message, which makes the standard backstepping controller not workable. To tackle the challenge, a set of NN adaptive observers are designed under two different situations, which can switch adaptively depending on the DoS attack on/off. Further, an NN adaptive controller is constructed and the dynamic surface control method is borrowed to surmount the complexity explosion phenomenon. To eliminate double damage from DoS attacks and switches, a set of switching laws with average dwell time are designed via the multiple Lyapunov function method, which in combination with the proposed controllers, guarantees that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded. Finally, an illustrative example is offered to verify the availability of the proposed control algorithm.},

  abstract     = {With the development of the economy, distributed manufacturing has gradually become the mainstream production mode. This work aims to solve the energy-efficient distributed flexible job shop scheduling problem (EDFJSP) while simultaneously minimizing makespan and energy consumption. Some gaps are stated following: 1) the previous works usually adopt the memetic algorithm (MA) with variable neighborhood search. However, the local search (LS) operators are inefficient due to strong randomness; 2) the confidence-based adaptive operator selection model follows the experiences of the major crowds, which ignores the efficient operators with low weight, so it can not select the really efficient operator; 3) the previous works lack of efficient strategy to save energy; and 4) the mainstream memetic framework adopts LS to all solutions, which causes the population to converge too quickly and the diversity is extremely reduced. Thus, we propose a surprisingly popular-based adaptive MA (SPAMA) to overcome the above deficiencies. The contributions are as follows: 1) four problem-based LS operators are employed to improve the convergence; 2) a surprisingly popular degree (SPD) feedback-based self-modifying operators selection model is proposed to find the efficient operators with low weight and correct crowd decision making; 3) the full active scheduling decoding is presented to reduce the energy consumption; and 4) an elite strategy is designed to balance the resources between global and LS. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of SPAMA, it is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms on Mk and DP benchmarks. The results demonstrate the superiority of SPAMA to the state-of-art algorithms for solving EDFJSP.},

First, in this study, practically predefined-time stochastic stabilization (PPSS) in the $p$ th moment sense is introduced, and a Lyapunov-type criterion for PPSS is proposed to assure the stabilization of the system considered. With these ideas, based on the backstepping design method, a semiglobally practically predefined-time adaptive fuzzy tracking control algorithm is proposed with a fuzzy system used to approximate the unknown part of the system. Moreover, the settling time of the system response can be arbitrarily adjusted in a mean-value sense, and such freedom can be used to improve the stochastic finite-/fixed-time control results. Finally, a practical example and a numerical example of a comparison are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

In order to save network resources effectively, two event-triggered schemes (ETSs) are introduced to test whether the measurement output and control input are transmitted under network communication. While the ETS brings advantages, it also leads to a mismatch between the premise variables of the system and the controller. To solve this problem, an asynchronous premise reconstruct method is considered, which relaxes the condition of the previous results that the premises of the plant and the controller are synchronous. Furthermore, two crucial factors, including actuator failure and deception attacks, are taken into consideration simultaneously. Then, the mean square asymptotic stability conditions of the resultant augmented system are derived by utilizing the Lyapunov stability theory. Besides, controller gains and event-triggered parameters are co-designed with the help of linear matrix inequality techniques. Finally, a cart-damper-spring system and a nonlinear mass-spring-damper mechanical system are presented to verify the theoretical analysis.},

The proposed distributed optimization process consists of two steps: 1) the controller initially leads each agent to the minimizer of its local function and 2) then guides all agents toward achieving leaderless formation and reaching the global function’s minimizer. The proposed scheme requires fewer adjustable parameters than most existing methods in the literature without the need for auxiliary variables or time-variable gains. Additionally, one can consider highly nonlinear multivalued strongly convex cost functions, while the agents do not share the gradients and Hessians.

First, a novel mixed $H_{\infty }$ and energy-to-peak performance index is proposed, which covers the $H_{\infty }$ performance index and energy-to-peak performance index as special cases. Second, in addition to designing the switching filters, the filter state jump rules are constructed at filter switching instants. Finally, both system states and filter states jump in a asynchronous manner. The switching law is devised through the mode-dependent average dwell time (MDADT) approach. A new type of Lyapunov-like functionals is constructed, which will increase when the subsystem is running with its mismatched filter and jump while the subsystem or the filter is switching. Then, new conditions are deduced to ensure the filtering error systems with multiple state impulsive jumps to be asymptotically stable with a mixed $H_{\infty }$ and energy-to-peak performance level. Filter design conditions expressing as linear matrix inequality (LMI) are obtained. Finally, the effectiveness of the derived results is illustrated by two examples.},

However, most deep CNN-based pansharpening models are based on “black-box” architecture and require supervision, making these methods rely heavily on the ground-truth data and lose their interpretability for specific problems during network training. This study proposes a novel interpretable unsupervised end-to-end pansharpening network, called as IU2PNet, which explicitly encodes the well-studied pansharpening observation model into an unsupervised unrolling iterative adversarial network. Specifically, we first design a pansharpening model, whose iterative process can be computed by the half-quadratic splitting algorithm. Then, the iterative steps are unfolded into a deep interpretable iterative generative dual adversarial network (iGDANet). Generator in iGDANet is interwoven by multiple deep feature pyramid denoising modules and deep interpretable convolutional reconstruction modules. In each iteration, the generator establishes an adversarial game with the spatial and spectral discriminators to update both spectral and spatial information without ground-truth images. Extensive experiments show that, compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our proposed IU2PNet exhibits very competitive performance in terms of quantitative evaluation metrics and qualitative visual effects.},

Moreover the feasibility of the observer is strictly proved. Subsequently, combined with the observer and follower dynamics, an augmented system and a distributed cooperative performance index with discount factors are established. On this basis, the optimal distributed cooperative synchronization problem changes into solving the numerical solution of the Hamilton–Jacobian–Bellman (HJB) equation. Finally, an online off-policy algorithm is proposed, which can be used to optimize the distributed synchronization problem of the MASs in real time based on measured data. In order to prove the stability and convergence of the online off-policy algorithm more conveniently, an offline on-policy algorithm whose stability and convergence are proved is given before the online off-policy algorithm is proposed.

First, the human-exosuit coupled dynamic model is formulated to express the mathematical relationship between the exo-suit actuation system and the human ankle joint. Then, a gait detection approach, including plantarflexion assistance timing and planning, is proposed. Inspired by the control strategy that is used by the human central nervous system (CNS) to handle interaction tasks, a human-in-the-loop adaptive controller is proposed to adapt the unknown exo-suit actuator dynamics and human ankle impedance. The proposed controller can emulate human CNS behaviors which adapt feedforward force and environment impedance in interaction tasks. The resulting adaptation of actuator dynamics and ankle impedance is demonstrated with five unimpaired subjects and implemented on a developed soft exo-suit. The human-like adaptivity is performed by the exo-suit in several human walking speeds and illustrates the promising potential of the novel controller.},

For the first time, state and disturbance can be robustly estimated by using an event-triggered state observer. Our method uses only information of the output vector when an event-triggered condition is satisfied. This contrasts with previous methods of simultaneous state and disturbance estimation based on augmented state observers where the information of the output vector was assumed to be always continuously available. This salient feature, thus, lessens the stress on communication resources while can still maintain an acceptable estimation performance. First, to solve the new problem of event-triggered state and disturbance estimation, and to tackle unknown time-varying delays, we propose a novel event-triggered state observer and establish a sufficient condition for its existence. Then to overcome some technical difficulties in synthesizing observer parameters, we introduce some algebraic transformations and use inequalities, such as the Cauchy matrix inequality and the Schur complement lemma to establish a convex optimization problem in which observer parameters and optimal disturbance attenuation levels can be systematically derived. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the method by using two numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Iterative learning model predictive control (ILMPC) has been recognized as an excellent batch process control strategy for progressively improving tracking performance along trials. However, as a typical learning-based control method, ILMPC generally requires the strict identity of trial lengths to implement 2-D receding horizon optimization. The randomly varying trial lengths extensively existing in practice can result in the insufficiency of learning prior information, and even the suspension of control update. Regarding this issue, this article embeds a novel prediction-based modification mechanism into ILMPC, to adjust the process data of each trial into the same length by compensating the data of absent running periods with the predictive sequences at the end point. Under this modification scheme, it is proved that the convergence of the classical ILMPC is guaranteed by an inequality condition relative with the probability distribution of trial lengths. Considering the practical batch process with complex nonlinearity, a 2-D neural-network predictive model with parameter adaptability along trials is established to generate highly matched compensation data for the prediction-based modification. To best utilize the real process information of multiple past trials while guaranteeing the learning priority of the latest trials, an event-based switching learning structure is proposed in ILMPC to determine different learning orders according to the probability event with respect to the trial length variation direction. The convergence of the nonlinear event-based switching ILMPC system is analyzed theoretically under two situations divided by the switching condition. The simulations on a numerical example and the injection molding process verify the superiority of the proposed control methods.},

A fuzzy estimator is delicately designed to model the immeasurable system states in the presence of DoS attacks. To achieve the preset tracking performance, a simper prescribed performance error transformation is constructed considering the characteristics of DoS attacks, which helps obtain a novel Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation to derive the optimized prescribed performance controller. Furthermore, the fuzzy-logic system, combined with the reinforcement learning (RL) technique, is employed to approximate the unknown nonlinearity existing in the prescribed performance controller design process. An optimized adaptive fuzzy security control law is then proposed for the considered nonlinear nonstrict-feedback systems subject to DoS attacks. Through the Lyapunov stability analysis, the tracking error is proved to approach the predefined region by the preset finite time, even in the presence of DoS attacks. Meanwhile, the consumed control resources are minimized due to the RL-based optimized algorithm. Finally, an actual example with comparisons verifies the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.},

In this article, without the need for PE condition, we address the problem of global exponential stabilization of strict-feedback systems with mismatched uncertainties and unknown yet time-varying control gains. The resultant control, embedded with time-varying feedback gains, is capable of ensuring global exponential stability of parametric-strict-feedback systems in the absence of persistence of excitation. By using the enhanced Nussbaum function, the previous results are extended to more general nonlinear systems where the sign and magnitude of the time-varying control gain are unknown. In particular, the argument of the Nussbaum function is guaranteed to be always positive with the aid of nonlinear damping design, which is critical to perform a straightforward technical analysis of the boundedness of the Nussbaum function. Finally, the global exponential stability of parameter-varying strict-feedback systems, the boundedness of the control input and the update rate, and the asymptotic constancy of the parameter estimate are established.

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose a multisensory mutual associative memory networks framework and memristive circuit to mimic the ability of the biological brain to make associations of information received simultaneously. The circuit inspired by neural mechanisms of associative memory cells mainly consists of three modules: 1) the storage neurons module, which encodes external multimodal information into the firing rate of spikes; 2) the synapse module, which uses the nonvolatility memristor to achieve weight adjustment and associative learning; and 3) the retrieval neuron module, which feeds the retrieval signal output from each sensory pathway to other sensory pathways, so that achieve mutual association and retrieval between multiple modalities. Different from other one-to-one or many-to-one unidirectional associative memory work, this circuit achieves bidirectional association from multiple modalities to multiple modalities. In addition, we simulate the acquisition, extinction, recovery, transmission, and consolidation properties of associative memory. The circuit is applied to cross-modal association of image and audio recognition results, and episodic memory is simulated, where multiple images in a scene are intramodal associated. With power and area analysis, the circuit is validated as hardware-friendly. Further research to extend this work into large-scale associative memory networks, combined with visual–auditory–tactile–gustatory sensory sensors, is promising for application in intelligent robotic platforms to facilitate the development of neuromorphic systems and brain-like intelligence.},

The hidden Markov model is used to characterize asynchronous constraints between the filters and the systems. Gain uncertainties of the resilient filter are the interval type in this article, which is more accurate than the norm-bounded type to model the uncertain phenomenon. The number of linear matrix inequalities constraints can be decreased significantly by separating the vertices of the uncertain interval, so that the difficulty of calculation and calculation time can be reduced. Moreover, the event-triggered scheme is applied to depress the consumption of network resources. In order to find a balance between reducing bandwidth consumed and improving system performance, the threshold parameter is designed as a diagonal matrix in the event-triggered scheme. Utilizing the convex optimization method, the sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee that the filtering error systems are stochastically stable and satisfy the extended dissipation performance.

  abstract     = {Multitask learning (MTL) is a powerful technique for jointly learning multiple tasks. However, it is difficult to achieve a tradeoff between tasks during iterative training, as some tasks may compete with each other. Existing methods manually design specific network models to mitigate task conflicts, but they require considerable manual effort and prior knowledge about task relationships to tune the model so as to obtain the best performance for each task. Moreover, few works have offered formal descriptions of task conflicts and theoretical explanations for the cause of task conflict problems. In this article, we provide a formal description of task conflicts that are caused by the gradient interference problem of tasks. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel model-agnostic approach to mitigate gradient interference (MAMG) by designing a gradient clipping rule that directly modifies the interfering components on the gradient interfering direction. Specifically, MAMG is model-agnostic and thus it can be applied to a large number of multitask models. We also theoretically prove the convergence of MAMG and its superiority to existing MTL methods. We evaluate our method on a variety of real-world large datasets, and extensive experimental results confirm that MAMG can outperform some state-of-the-art algorithms on different types of tasks and can be easily applied to various methods.},

Meanwhile, a sequence of mode-dependent variables is employed to describe the randomly occurring coupling strength. Subsequently, to alleviate the side effects from possible measurement outliers, a dynamic saturation function-based state estimator is designed, whose saturation level is adaptively varying based on previous estimation errors.

Then, the adaptive fault-tolerant containment algorithm, independent of the positions of the leaders, is proposed to guarantee the UGVs converge to the convex hull formed by the leader UAVs. The adaptive estimation scheme is constructed to compensate for the unknown system parameters and actuator loss-of-effectiveness and bias faults. The formation–containment tracking performance is analyzed based on Lyapunov theory with the synchronization errors satisfying the prescribed performance.

  abstract     = {Evolutionary multiobjective feature selection (FS) has gained increasing attention in recent years. However, it still faces some challenges, for example, the frequently appeared duplicated solutions in either the search space or the objective space lead to the diversity loss of the population, and the huge search space results in the low search efficiency of the algorithm. Minimizing the number of selected features and maximizing the classification performance are two major objectives in FS. Usually, the fitness function of a single-objective FS problem linearly aggregates these two objectives through a weighted sum method. Given a predefined direction (weight) vector, the single-objective FS task can explore the specified direction or area extensively. Different direction vectors result in different search directions in the objective space. Motivated by this, this article proposes a multiform framework, which solves a multiobjective FS task combined with its auxiliary single-objective FS tasks in a multitask environment. By setting different direction vectors, promising feature subsets from single-objective FS tasks can be utilized, to boost the evolutionary search of the multiobjective FS task. By comparing with five classical and state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, as well as four well-performing FS algorithms, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are verified via extensive experiments on 18 classification datasets. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed method is also investigated in a noisy environment.},

Inspired by the above observations, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based multimodal fusion strategy named modal-shared modal-specific GNN, which investigates the heterogeneity/homogeneity among various psychophysiological modalities as well as explores the potential relationship between subjects. Specifically, we develop a modal-shared and modal-specific GNN architecture to extract the inter/intramodal characteristics.

Previously proposed algorithms for solving CNMF use multiplicative updates which can be derived by either heuristic or majorization–minimization (MM) methods. However, these algorithms suffer from problems, such as low convergence rates, difficulty to reach exact zeroes during iterations and prone to poor local optima. Inspired by the success of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) on solving NMF, we explore variable splitting (i.e., the core idea of ADMM) for CNMF in this article. New closed-form algorithms of CNMF are derived with the commonly used $\beta $ -divergences as optimization objectives.

However, sEMG has limitations, such as low signal-to-noise ratio and insensitivity to fine finger movements, so we consider adding A-mode ultrasound (AUS) to enhance the recognition impact. To explore the influence of multisource sensing data on gesture recognition and better integrate the features of different modules. We proposed a multimodal multilevel converged attention network (MMCANet) model for multisource signals composed of sEMG and AUS. The proposed model extracts the hidden features of the AUS signal with a convolutional neural network (CNN). Meanwhile, a CNN-LSTM (long-short memory network) hybrid structure extracts some spatial-temporal features from the sEMG signal. Then, two types of CNN features from AUS and sEMG are spliced and transmitted to a transformer encoder to fuse the information and interact with sEMG features to produce hybrid features. Finally, the classification results are output employing fully connected layers. Attention mechanisms are used to adjust the weights of feature channels. We compared MMCANet’s feature extraction and classification performance with that of manually extracted sEMG-AUS features using four traditional machine-learning (ML) algorithms. The recognition accuracy increased by at least 5.15\%. In addition, we tried deep learning (DL) methods with CNN on single modals. The experimental results showed that the proposed model improved 14.31\% and 3.80\% over the CNN method with single sEMG and AUS, respectively. Compared with some state-of-the-art fusion techniques, our method also achieved better results.},

  abstract     = {The multiobjective optimal control method optimizes the performance indexes of nonlinear systems to obtain setpoints, and designs a controller to track the setpoints. However, the stepwise optimal control method that independently analyzes the optimization process may obtain unfeasible and difficult to track setpoints, which will reduce the operation and control performance of the systems. To solve this problem, a multiobjective integrated optimal control (MIOC) strategy is proposed for nonlinear systems in this article. The main contributions of MIOC are threefold. First, in the framework of multiobjective model predictive control, an integrated control structure with a comprehensive cost function and a collaborative optimization algorithm is designed to achieve the coordinate optimal control. Second, for the time inconformity of setpoints and control laws caused by the characteristic of tracking control, the different prediction horizons are designed for the comprehensive cost function. Then, the collaborative optimization algorithm is proposed for the comprehensive cost function to achieve the integrated solution of setpoints and control laws to enhance the operation and control performance of nonlinear systems. Third, the stability and control performance analysis of MIOC is provided. Finally, the proposed MIOC method is applied for a nonlinear system to demonstrate its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Soft magnetic miniature robots (SMMRs) have potential biomedical applications due to their flexible size and mobility to access confined environments. However, navigating the robot to a goal site with precise control performance and high repeatability in unstructured environments, especially in flow rate conditions, still remains a challenge. In this study, drawing inspiration from the control requirements of drug delivery and release to the goal lesion site in the presence of dynamic biofluids, we propose a flow rate rejection control strategy based on a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to actuate an SMMR to achieve goal-reaching and hovering in fluidic tubes. To this end, an SMMR is first fabricated, which can be operated by an external magnetic field to realize its desired functionalities. Subsequently, a simulator is constructed based on neural networks to map the relationship between the applied magnetic field and robot locomotion states. With minimal prior knowledge about the environment and dynamics, a gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based DRL algorithm is formulated by considering the designed history state–action and estimated flow rates. In addition, the randomization technique is applied during training to distill the general control policy for the physical SMMR. The results of numerical simulations and experiments are illustrated to demonstrate the robustness and efficacy of the presented control framework. Finally, in-depth analyses and discussions indicate the potentiality of DRL for soft magnetic robots in biomedical applications.},

To study this problem, we develop a multiplex framework that couples epidemic spreading across subpopulations in a metapopulation network (i.e., physical layer) with the spreading of awareness about the epidemic in a communication network (i.e., virtual layer). We explicitly study the interactions between the mobility patterns across subpopulations and the awareness propagation among individuals. We analyze the coupled dynamics using microscopic Markov chains (MMCs) equations and validate the theoretical results via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. We find that with the spreading of awareness, reducing human mobility becomes more effective in mitigating the large-scale epidemic. We also investigate the influence of varying topological features of the physical and virtual layers and the correlation between the connectivity and local population size per subpopulation. Overall the proposed modeling framework and findings contribute to the growing literature investigating the interplay between the spatiotemporal spread of epidemics and human behavior.},

The discovered information in FU pattern mining from real-life quantitative databases with item profits is suitable for interpreting data from a human perspective because it is not expressed using numerical values but linguistic terms which consist of natural languages. State-of-the-art approaches in this literature provide extended results by considering temporal factors, such as seasons, which can be influential in real-life situations. However, they still suffer from scalability issues because they are based on level-wise approaches which generate a number of candidates. In this article, we propose a scalable and efficient approach with a novel data structure for mining high temporal FU patterns without generating candidates. Efficient pruning techniques and algorithms are presented to improve the performance of the proposed approach. Performance experiments on both real and synthetic datasets show that the suggested algorithm has better performance than the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of runtime, memory usage, and scalability.},

  abstract     = {Emotion recognition based on text–audio modalities is the core technology for transforming a graphical user interface into a voice user interface, and it plays a vital role in natural human–computer interaction systems. Currently, mainstream multimodal learning research has designed various fusion strategies to learn intermodality interactions but hardly considers that not all modalities play equal roles in emotion recognition. Therefore, the main challenge in multimodal emotion recognition is how to implement effective fusion algorithms based on the auxiliary structure. To address this problem, this article proposes an adaptive interactive attention network (AIA-Net). In AIA-Net, text is treated as a primary modality, and audio is an auxiliary modality. AIA-Net adapts to textual and acoustic features with different dimensions and learns their dynamic interactive relations in a more flexible way. The interactive relations are encoded as interactive attention weights to focus on the acoustic features that are effective for textual emotional representations. AIA-Net performs well in adaptively assisting the textual emotional representation with the acoustic emotional information. Moreover, multiple collaborative learning (co-learning) layers of AIA-Net achieve multiple multimodal interactions and the deep bottom-up evolution of emotional representations. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the great effectiveness of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In this article, inspired by the Halanay inequality, we study stability of sampled-data systems with packet losses by proposing a nonuniform sampling interval approach. First, a sampled-data controller with an exponential gain is put forward to reduce conservatism. We obtain the sufficient condition for linear sampled-data systems to be exponentially stable by extending the famous Halanay inequality to sampled-data systems. The obtained sufficient conditions indicate that the maximal-allowable bound of sampling intervals is determined by the constant terms in the Halanay inequality, and the decay rate is presented in the form of a Lambert function. Compared with some existing results on the stability of sampled-data systems by using the Gronwall–Bellman Lemma, the conservatism induced by the exponential term via the Gronwall–Bellman Lemma can be reduced to some extent. Considering the phenomenon of packet losses, a new lemma is further proposed to generalize the proposed Halanay-like inequality. The results derived by the new lemma permit that there exist some sampling intervals with the upper bound violating the desired condition of the Halanay-like inequality. This permits us to establish exponential stability in significant cases that do not satisfy the Halanay-like inequality needed in the previous results. Finally, the sampled-data local exponential stability is investigated for nonlinear systems with strong nonlinearity.},

Then, a completely mode-free reinforcement learning algorithm is employed to address the game-coupled algebraic Riccati equations without using the information of the system dynamics, in order to reach the Nash equilibrium. The learning algorithm includes one iteration loop by updating the control policy and the disturbance policy simultaneously. Also, the exploration signal is added for motivating the system, and the convergence of the CMFIRL iteration algorithm is rigorously proved.

To achieve a better trend-oriented granulation of a time series, ${l}_{1}$ trend filtering is firstly carried out to result in segments which are then optimized by the proposed segment merging algorithm. By constructing a linear fuzzy information granule (LFIG) on each segment, a granular time series which well reflects the linear trend characteristic of the original time series is produced. With the novel designed distance that can well measure the trend similarity of two LFIGs, the distance between two granular time series is calculated by the modified dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm. Based on this distance, the LFIG-based FCM algorithm is developed for clustering time series. In this algorithm, cluster prototypes are iteratively updated by the specifically designed granule splitting and merging algorithm, which allows the lengths of prototypes to change in the process of iteration. This overcomes the serious drawback of the existing approaches, where the lengths of prototypes cannot be changed. Experimental studies demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm in clustering time series with different shapes or trends.},

Hence, one cannot solve the event-triggered control problem based on corresponding continuous feedback as done in the emulation-based method. In view of the unsolvability, we pursue a nonemulation-based strategy, directly conducting event-triggered control design. First, a parameterized output feedback controller incorporating a dynamic high gain is designed, which would globally stabilize the system once the adjustable parameter therein is suitable. Then, an event-triggering mechanism is developed to not only decide when the controller is sampled/executed but also determine which constant value the adjustable parameter takes. Just due to the instantly varying (discontinuous) adjustable parameter, the feedback ability of the controller is large enough, making it possible to solve the control design problem in the event-triggered framework.

  abstract     = {In recent years, numerous efficient many-objective optimization evolutionary algorithms have been proposed to find well-converged and well-distributed nondominated optimal solutions. However, their scalability performance may deteriorate drastically to solve large-scale many-objective optimization problems (LSMaOPs). Encountering high-dimensional solution space with more than 100 decision variables, some of them may lose diversity and trap into local optima, while others may achieve poor convergence performance. This article proposes a multipopulation-based differential evolution algorithm, called LSMaODE, which can solve LSMaOPs efficiently and effectively. In order to exploit and explore the exponential decision space, the proposed algorithm divides the population into two groups of subpopulations, which are optimized with different strategies. First, the randomized coordinate descent technique is applied to 10\% of individuals to exploit the decision variables independently. This subpopulation maintains diversity in the decision space to avoid premature convergence into local optimum. Second, the remaining 90\% of individuals are optimized with the nondominated guided random interpolation strategy, which interpolates individual among three nondominated solutions randomly. The strategy can guide the population convergent toward the nondominated solutions quickly, meanwhile, maintain good distribution in objective space. Finally, the proposed LSMaODE is evaluated on the LSMOP test suites from the scalability in both decision and objective dimensions. The performance is compared against five state-of-the-art large-scale many-objective evolutionary algorithms. The experimental results show that LSMaODE provides highly competitive performance.},

However, most data-driven methods suffer from using a single-domain space, ignoring the importance of the learned features, and failing to incorporate the handcrafted features assisted by domain knowledge. To solve these limitations, a novel deep learning approach is proposed for machining condition monitoring in the IIoT environment, which consists of three phases, including: 1) the unsupervised parallel feature extraction; 2) adaptive feature importance weighting; and 3) hybrid feature fusion. First, separate sparse autoencoders are utilized to conduct the unsupervised parallel feature extraction, which enables to learn abstract feature representation from multiple domain spaces simultaneously. Then, an attention module is designed for the adaptive feature importance weighting, which can assign higher weights to those critical features accordingly. Moreover, a hybrid feature fusion is deployed to complement the automatic feature learning and further yield better model performance by fusing the handcrafted features assisted by domain knowledge. Finally, a real-life case study and extensive experiments have been conducted to show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.},

Second, knowledge fusion is proposed based on the merge and deletion of the extracted rules from the DBN model.

In comparison with DBN, KT-SDBN has a more sparse network structure and better learning performance on the existing knowledge and data. The experimental results in the benchmark data indicate that KT-SDBN not only has effective feature learning performance with 30\% of the original network parameters but also shows a large compression rate that is far larger than other structure optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel singular value decomposition (SVD)-based robust distributed model predictive control (SVD-RDMPC) strategy for linear systems with additive uncertainties. The system is globally constrained and consists of multiple interrelated subsystems with bounded disturbances, each of whom has local constraints on states and inputs. First, we integrate the steady-state target optimizer into the MPC problem through the offset cost function to formulate a modified single optimization problem for tracking changing targets from real-time optimization. Then, the concept of constraint tightening is utilized to enhance the robustness and ensure robust constraint satisfaction in the presence of interferences. On this basis, the SVD method is introduced to decompose the new optimization problem into several independent subsystems on the orthogonal projection space, and a distributed dual gradient algorithm with convergence proved is implemented to obtain the control of each nominal subsystem. The recursive feasibility is then ensured and the tracking ability of the strategy is analyzed. It is verified that for a target, the system can be steered to a neighborhood of the closest possible steady setpoint. At last, the effectiveness of the raised SVD-RDMPC strategy is established in two simulations on building temperature control and load frequency control.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a data-driven distributed filtering method based on the consensus protocol and information-weighted strategy for discrete-time sensor networks with switching topologies. By introducing a data-driven method, a linear-like state equation is designed by utilizing only the input and output (I/O) data without a controlled object model. In the identification step, data-driven adaptive optimization recursive identification (DD-AORI) is exploited to identify the recurrence of time-varying parameters. It is proved that for discrete-time switching networks, estimation errors of all nodes are ultimately bounded when data-driven distributed information-weighted consensus filtering (DD-DICF) is executed. The algorithm combines with the received neighbors and direct or indirect observations for the target node to produce modified gains, resulting in a novel state estimator containing an information interaction mechanism. Subsequently, convergence analysis is performed on the basis of the Lyapunov equation to guarantee the boundedness of DD-DICF estimate error. Simulations verify the performance of the DD-DICF against the theoretical results as well as in comparison with some existing filtering algorithms.},

The data-guided prior is learned from a provided dataset and captures the details of imaging targets since it is a specific image. A new numerical scheme that allows a complex optimization problem to be split into a few less difficult subproblems is developed to solve the challenging difference of convex functions programming problem. A new dimensionality reduction method is developed and combined with the relevance vector machine to generate a new learning engine for the forecast of the data-guided prior. The new imaging method fuses multisource information and unifies data-guided and measurement physics modeling paradigms.

  abstract     = {Multichannel image completion with mixture noise is a common but complex problem in the fields of machine learning, image processing, and computer vision. Most existing algorithms devote to explore global low-rank information and fail to optimize local and joint-mode structures, which may lead to oversmooth restoration results or lower quality restoration details. In this study, we propose a novel model to deal with multichannel image completion with mixture noise based on adaptive sparse low-rank tensor subspace and nonlocal self-similarity (ASLTS-NS). In the proposed model, a nonlocal similar patch matching framework cooperating with Tucker decomposition is used to explore information of global and joint modes and optimize the local structure for improving restoration quality. In order to enhance the robustness of low-rank decomposition to data missing and mixture noise, we present an adaptive sparse low-rank regularization to construct robust tensor subspace for self-weighing importance of different modes and capturing a stable inherent structure. In addition, joint tensor Frobenius and $l_{1}$ regularizations are exploited to control two different types of noise. Based on alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM), a convergent learning algorithm is designed to solve this model. Experimental results on three different types of multichannel image sets demonstrate the advantages of ASLTS-NS under five complex scenarios.},

In this article, we propose a scalable lifelong RL method that dynamically expands the network capacity to accommodate new knowledge while preventing past memories from being perturbed. We use a Dirichlet process mixture to model the nonstationary task distribution, which captures task relatedness by estimating the likelihood of task-to-cluster assignments and clusters the task models in a latent space. We formulate the prior distribution of the mixture as a Chinese restaurant process (CRP) that instantiates new mixture components as needed. The update and expansion of the mixture are governed by the Bayesian nonparametric framework with an expectation maximization (EM) procedure, which dynamically adapts the model complexity without explicit task boundaries or heuristics. Moreover, we use the domain randomization technique to train robust prior parameters for the initialization of each task model in the mixture; thus, the resulting model can better generalize and adapt to unseen tasks. With extensive experiments conducted on robot navigation and locomotion domains, we show that our method successfully facilitates scalable lifelong RL and outperforms relevant existing methods.},

While in the physical layer, the fault compensator, working as the virtual actuator, is applied to reconfigure faulty plants adaptively. This design enjoys the advantages that the nominal controller needs no adjustment and all its properties can be preserved after failure. Moreover, the proposed control scheme is distinguished by the following features: 1) the commonly imposed rank condition on outage faults is removed; 2) the norm bound of the leader’s input is allowed to be unknown even though the topologies are switching and directed; and 3) there is no need to use the estimates of faults in the virtual actuator design, which means the negative impacts caused by the inaccurate fault estimation can be avoided.

Both the single-order fully actuated system (FAS) and the multiorder FAS representations of the controllable subsystem are introduced. The problem of robust stabilization of such a compound system with full-state feedback can be converted into an input-to-state GUA stabilization problem of the fully actuated subsystem, which is solved for both types of single- and multiorder FASs with very general assumptions on the uncertain perturbed functions. Under certain conditions, the solution reduces to that for robust stabilization with partial-state feedback, and naturally reduce to that for robust stabilization of FASs.

While traditional summarization is static, that is, the document collections about a specific topic remain unchanged, update summarization addresses dynamic document collections based on a specific topic. Therefore, update summarization consists of summarizing the new document collection under the assumption that the user has already read a previous summarization and only the new information is interesting. The multiobjective number-one-selection genetic algorithm (MONOGA) has been designed and implemented to address this problem. The proposed algorithm produces a summary that is relevant to the user’s given query, and it also contains updates information. Experiments were conducted on Text Analysis Conference (TAC) datasets, and Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) metrics were considered to assess the model performance. The results obtained by the proposed approach outperform those from the existing approaches in the scientific literature, obtaining average percentage improvements between 12.74\% and 55.03\% in the ROUGE scores.},

Microgrids are seeing an increased penetration of eco-friendly electric vehicles (EVs) in recent years. However, the uncontrolled charging of EVs can easily overwhelm such electric networks. In this work, we propose an efficient demand response (DR) scheme based on dynamic pricing to enhance the capacity of the microgrid to securely host a large number of EVs. A hierarchical two-level optimization framework is introduced to realize the DR scheme. At the upper level, the dynamic prices for the participating users in DR are optimized while at the lower level, each user optimizes its energy consumption based on the price signal from the upper level. An evolutionary algorithm and a mixed-integer linear programming model is employed to solve the upper and lower level problems, respectively. Energy scheduling problems of the users are solved in a distributed manner which adds to the scalability of the approach. The proposed DR scheme is tested on a microgrid system adopted from the IEEE European low-voltage distribution network. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed DR scheme compared to the benchmark pricing policies from the literature.},

The solution starts with developing resilient distributed observers for each follower in the presence of DoS attacks. Then, a resilient communication mechanism and a time-varying sampling period are introduced to, respectively, ensure the neighbor state is available as soon as attacks disappear and to avoid targeted attacks launched by intelligent attackers. Furthermore, a model-based fault-tolerant and resilient controller is designed based on the Lyapunov approach and the output regulation theory. In order to remove the reliance on system parameters, we leverage a new data-driven algorithm to learn controller parameters via the collected data. Rigorous analysis shows that the closed-loop system can resiliently achieve practical cooperative output regulation.

  abstract     = {This work is devoted to the nonasymptotic and robust fractional derivative estimation of the pseudo-state for a class of fractional-order nonlinear systems with partial unknown terms in noisy environments. In particular, the estimation for the pseudo-state can be obtained by setting the fractional derivative’s order to zero. For this purpose, the fractional derivative estimation of the pseudo-state is achieved by estimating both the initial values and the fractional derivatives of the output, thanks to the additive index law of fractional derivatives. The corresponding algorithms are established in terms of integrals by employing the classical and generalized modulating functions methods. Meanwhile, the unknown part is fitted via an innovative sliding window strategy. Moreover, error analysis in discrete noisy cases is discussed. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to verify the correctness of the theoretical results and the noise reduction efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel hybrid reinforcement $Q$ -learning control method is proposed to solve the adaptive fuzzy $H_{\infty }$ control problem of discrete-time nonlinear Markov jump systems based on the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model. First, the core problem of adaptive fuzzy $H_{\infty }$ control is converted to solving fuzzy game coupled algebraic Riccati equation, which can hardly be solved by mathematical methods directly. To solve this problem, an offline parallel hybrid learning algorithm is first designed, where system dynamics should be known as a prior. Furthermore, an online parallel $Q$ -learning hybrid learning algorithm is developed. The main characteristics of the proposed online hybrid learning algorithms are threefold: 1) system dynamics are avoided during the learning process; 2) compared with the policy iteration method, the restriction of the initial stable control policy is removed; and 3) compared with the value iteration method, a faster convergence rate can be obtained. Finally, we provide a tunnel diode circuit system model to validate the effectiveness of the present learning algorithm.},

First, to improve safety, considering the human balance, the OpenPose-based visual feedback is used to estimate the individual’s pose, then, the active human-following algorithm is proposed for the exoskeleton robot to achieve the body weight support and active human-following. Second, taking the human’s intention and voluntary efforts into account, we develop a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract surface electromyography (sEMG) to build the estimation model of joints’ angles, that is, the multichannel sEMG signals can be correlated with flexion/extension (FE) joints’ angles of the human lower limb. Finally, to make the robot motion adapt to the locomotion of subjects under uncertain nonlinear dynamics, an adaptive control strategy is designed to drive the exoskeleton robot to track the desired locomotion trajectories stably. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed control framework, several recruited subjects participated in the experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed joints’ angles estimation model based on the LSTM network has a higher estimation accuracy and predicted performance compared with the existing deep neural network, and good simultaneous locomotion tracking performance is achieved by the designed control strategy, which indicates that the proposed control can assist subjects to perform gait training effectively.},

  abstract     = {Open-set domain adaptation (OSDA) aims to achieve knowledge transfer in the presence of both domain shift and label shift, which assumes that there exist additional unknown target classes not presented in the source domain. To solve the OSDA problem, most existing methods introduce an additional unknown class to the source classifier and represent the unknown target instances as a whole. However, it is unreasonable to treat all unknown target instances as a group since these unknown instances typically consist of distinct categories and distributions. It is challenging to identify all unknown instances with only one additional class. In addition, most existing methods directly introduce marginal distribution alignment to alleviate distribution shift between the source and target domains, failing to learn discriminative class boundaries in the target domain since they ignore categorical discriminative information in the adaptation. To address these problems, in this article, we propose a novel prototype-based shared-dummy classifier (PSDC) model for the OSDA. Specifically, our PSDC introduces an auxiliary dummy classifier to calibrate the source classifier and simultaneously develops a weighted adaptation procedure to align class-wise prototypes for adaptation. We further design a pseudo-unknown learning algorithm to reduce the open-set risk. Extensive experiments on Office-31, Office-Home, and VisDA datasets show that the proposed PSDC can outperform existing methods and achieve the new state-of-the-art performance. The code will be made public.},

Because the full state is also difficult to obtain in practical scenarios, an output-feedback control scheme was used. In addition, an HMM-based event-triggered mechanism was also employed in the design of the controller to reduce the communication burden of the networked system. Sufficient conditions for the stochastic admissibility of a closed-loop singular MJS with a prescribed $H_{\infty }$ performance index were established using the Lyapunov functional technique. Finally, design procedures for an asynchronous event-triggered controller were summarized as a linear-matrix-inequality-based optimization algorithm.

In particular, a dynamic triggering mechanism is first developed by introducing a dynamic changing variable with specific dynamics. Then, by the internal model principle, a class of dynamic output feedback control laws is designed.

We focus on the problem of how to schedule the transmission of the sensor to minimize the estimation error at the remote side with less communication cost. Using the framework of the Markov decision process (MDP), the optimal scheduling policy is shown to be deterministic stationary (DS). We further derive its double threshold structure with respect to remote estimation errors and channel states. Moreover, a necessary and sufficient condition guaranteeing the mean-square stability of the remote estimator is given based on the structured scheduling policy.

  abstract     = {The region of attraction of the Lyapunov asymptotic stability at the origin is defined to be a ball centered at the origin, which is clearly simply connected and also bounded in the local case. In this article, the concept of substability is proposed, which allows “gaps” and “holes” in the region of attraction of the Lyapunov exponential stability, and also allows the origin to be a boundary point of the region of attraction. The concept is meaningful and useful in many practical applications, but is particularly made so with the control of single- and multi-order subfully actuated systems. Specifically, the singular set of a sub-FAS is first defined, and a substabilizing controller is then designed such that the closed-loop system is a constant linear one with an arbitrarily assignable eigen-polynomial, but with its initial values restricted within a so-called region of exponential attraction (ROEA). Consequently, the substabilizing controller drives all the state trajectories starting from the ROEA exponentially to the origin. The introduced concept of substabilization is of great importance because, on the one side, it is often practically useful since the designed ROEA is often large enough for certain applications, while on the other side, Lyapunov asymptotically stabilizing controllers can be further easily established based on substabilization. Several examples are given to demonstrate the proposed theories.},

  abstract     = {The evolutionary multitask optimization (EMTO) algorithm is a promising approach to solve many-task optimization problems (MaTOPs), in which similarity measurement and knowledge transfer (KT) are two key issues. Many existing EMTO algorithms estimate the similarity of population distribution to select a set of similar tasks and then perform KT by simply mixing individuals among the selected tasks. However, these methods may be less effective when the global optima of the tasks greatly differ from each other. Therefore, this article proposes to consider a new kind of similarity, namely, shift invariance, between tasks. The shift invariance is defined that the two tasks are similar after linear shift transformation on both the search space and the objective space. To identify and utilize the shift invariance between tasks, a two-stage transferable adaptive differential evolution (TRADE) algorithm is proposed. In the first evolution stage, a task representation strategy is proposed to represent each task by a vector that embeds the evolution information. Then, a task grouping strategy is proposed to group the similar (i.e., shift invariant) tasks into the same group while the dissimilar tasks into different groups. In the second evolution stage, a novel successful evolution experience transfer method is proposed to adaptively utilize the suitable parameters by transferring successful parameters among similar tasks within the same group. Comprehensive experiments are carried out on two representative MaTOP benchmarks with a total of 16 instances and a real-world application. The comparative results show that the proposed TRADE is superior to some state-of-the-art EMTO algorithms and single-task optimization algorithms.},

In this work, we propose the controller design method for the prescribed-instant stability of ${n}$ -order integrator systems. The proposed control is bounded and can gradually go to zero at an arbitrarily selected time instant, at which the system states reach zero simultaneously.

  abstract     = {Part-level attribute parsing is a fundamental but challenging task, which requires the region-level visual understanding to provide explainable details of body parts. Most existing approaches address this problem by adding a regional convolutional neural network (RCNN) with an attribute prediction head to a two-stage detector, in which attributes of body parts are identified from localwise part boxes. However, localwise part boxes with limit visual clues (i.e., part appearance only) lead to unsatisfying parsing results, since attributes of body parts are highly dependent on comprehensive relations among them. In this article, we propose a knowledge-embedded RCNN (KE-RCNN) to identify attributes by leveraging rich knowledge, including implicit knowledge (e.g., the attribute “above-the-hip” for a shirt requires visual/geometry relations of shirt-hip) and explicit knowledge (e.g., the part of “shorts” cannot have the attribute of “hoodie” or “lining”). Specifically, the KE-RCNN consists of two novel components, that is: 1) implicit knowledge-based encoder (IK-En) and 2) explicit knowledge-based decoder (EK-De). The former is designed to enhance part-level representation by encoding part–part relational contexts into part boxes, and the latter one is proposed to decode attributes with a guidance of prior knowledge about part–attribute relations. In this way, the KE-RCNN is plug-and-play, which can be integrated into any two-stage detectors, for example, Attribute-RCNN, Cascade-RCNN, HRNet-based RCNN, and SwinTransformer-based RCNN. Extensive experiments conducted on two challenging benchmarks, for example, Fashionpedia and Kinetics-TPS, demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the KE-RCNN. In particular, it achieves higher improvements over all existing methods, reaching around 3\% of ${\mathrm{ AP}}^{\mathrm{ all}}_{\rm IoU+F_{1}}$ on Fashionpedia and around 4\% of ${\mathrm{ Acc}}_{p}$ on Kinetics-TPS.

First, the input-output feedback linearization method transforms the voltage regulation issue into an output feedback tracking problem for linear multiagent systems (MASs) with nonlinear dynamics. This transformation provides the necessary preprocessing for load voltage regulation. Then, an OBEDFT secondary control protocol that considers full-state immeasurability is proposed. The actuators of distributed generators (DGs) may experience partial loss of effectiveness (PLOE) and bias faults, and these fault parameters may be heterogeneous and time-varying. The protocol introduces adaptive techniques to avoid information related to fault parameters while using event-driven mechanisms to achieve discrete measurements of neighboring DG. Additionally, the protocol uses boundary layers to construct smooth controllers that prevent the chattering effect caused by nonsmooth controllers. Finally, simulation results confirm the effectiveness of this load voltage regulation strategy.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted much research attention and achieved great improvements in single-image dehazing. However, previous learning-based dehazing methods are mainly trained on synthetic data, which greatly degrades their generalization capability on natural hazy images. To address this issue, this article proposes a semi-supervised learning approach for single-image dehazing, where both synthetic and realistic images are leveraged during training. Considering the situation that it is hard to obtain the realistic pairs of hazy and haze-free images, how to utilize the realistic data is not a trivial work. In this article, a domain alignment module is introduced to narrow the distribution distance between synthetic data and realistic hazy images in a latent feature space. Meanwhile, a haze-aware attention module is designed to describe haze densities of different regions in the image, thus adaptively responds for different hazy areas. Furthermore, the dark channel prior is introduced to the framework to improve the quality of the unsupervised learning results by considering the statistical characters of haze-free images. Such a semi-supervised design can significantly address the domain shift issue between the synthetic and realistic data, and improve generalization performance in the real world. Experiments indicate that the proposed method obtains state-of-the-art performance on both public synthetic and realistic hazy images with better visual results.},

The HMASs contain heterogeneous multiple leaders, all of which have the input signals to generate flexible reference, and only the output information can be measured. All leaders do not have access to the same followers, that is, the well-informed follower assumption is removed in this article. In this setting, the adaptive multileader state compensator is designed for each follower to estimate the integrated state information of all leaders, which can equip with two kinds of dynamic event-triggered mechanisms, that is, node-based event-triggered mechanism and edge-based event-triggered mechanism, to save communication bandwidth. Then, the TVF controllers are built by some estimation values to regulate the followers to achieve and maintain the geometric shape while tracking the reference which is the convex combination of outputs of leaders. The event-triggered compensator and TVF controller constitute the control protocol of HMASs, which are independent of global information with the fully distributed manner. The stability analysis and numerical simulations are given to verify the presented control protocol.},

Meanwhile, by using an error transformation, the developed control scheme is able to ensure tracking with a prescribed accuracy within a pregiven time at a preassigned convergence rate under any bounded initial condition, eliminating the long-standing initial condition dependence issue inherited with conventional prescribed performance control methods, and guaranteeing the predeterminability of convergence time simultaneously.

  abstract     = {Matrix completion (MC) aims at recovering missing entries, given an incomplete matrix. Existing algorithms for MC are mainly designed for noiseless or Gaussian noise scenarios and, thus, they are not robust to impulsive noise. For outlier resistance, entry-wise $\ell _{p}$ -norm with $0 &amp;lt; p &amp;lt; 2$ and M-estimation are two popular approaches. Yet the optimum selection of $p$ for the entrywise $\ell _{p}$ -norm-based methods is still an open problem. Besides, M-estimation is limited by a breakdown point, that is, the largest proportion of outliers. In this article, we adopt entrywise $\ell _{0}$ -norm, namely, the number of nonzero entries in a matrix, to separate anomalies from the observed matrix. Prior to separation, the Laplacian kernel is exploited for outlier detection, which provides a strategy to automatically update the entrywise $\ell _{0}$ -norm penalty parameter. The resultant multivariable optimization problem is addressed by block coordinate descent (BCD), yielding $\ell _{0}$ -BCD and $\ell _{0}$ -BCD-F. The former detects and separates outliers, as well as its convergence is guaranteed. In contrast, the latter attempts to treat outlier-contaminated elements as missing entries, which leads to higher computational efficiency. Making use of majorization–minimization (MM), we further propose $\ell _{0}$ -BCD-MM and $\ell _{0}$ -BCD-MM-F for robust non-negative MC where the nonnegativity constraint is handled by a closed-form update. Experimental results of image inpainting and hyperspectral image recovery demonstrate that the suggested algorithms outperform several state-of-the-art methods in terms of recovery accuracy and computational efficiency.},

However, deep spiking reinforcement learning (DSRL), that is, the reinforcement learning (RL) based on SNNs, is still in its preliminary stage due to the binary output and the nondifferentiable property of the spiking function. To address these issues, we propose a deep spiking $Q$ -network (DSQN) in this article. Specifically, we propose a directly trained DSRL architecture based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons and deep $Q$ -network (DQN). Then, we adapt a direct spiking learning algorithm for the DSQN. We further demonstrate the advantages of using LIF neurons in DSQN theoretically. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on 17 top-performing Atari games to compare our method with the state-of-the-art conversion method. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of performance, stability, generalization and energy efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple Atari games with the directly trained SNN.},

  abstract     = {The multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) with the penalty-based boundary intersection (PBI) function (denoted as MOEA/D-PBI) has been frequently used in many studies in the literature. One essential issue in MOEA/D-PBI is its penalty parameter value specification. However, it is not easy to specify the penalty parameter value appropriately. This is because MOEA/D-PBI shows different search behavior when the penalty parameter values are different. The PBI function with a small penalty parameter value is good for convergence. However, the PBI function with a large value of penalty parameter is needed to preserve the diversity and uniformity of solutions. Although some methods for adapting the penalty parameter value for each weight vector have been proposed, they usually lead to slow convergence. In this article, we propose the idea of using two different values of penalty parameter simultaneously in MOEA/D-PBI. Although the idea is simple, the proposed algorithm is able to utilize both the convergence ability of a small penalty parameter value and the diversification ability of a large penalty parameter value of the PBI function. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm works well on a wide range of test problems.},

Hence, it is always necessary to investigate anti-forensics to expose the vulnerabilities of forensics tools. It is beneficial for forensics researchers to develop new tools as countermeasures. To date, one of the potential threats is the generative adversarial networks (GANs), which could be employed for fabricating or forging falsified data to attack forensics detectors. In this article, we investigate the anti-forensics performance of GANs by proposing a novel model, the ExS-GAN, which features an extra supervision system. After training, the proposed model could launch anti-forensics attacks on various manipulated images. Evaluated by experiments, the proposed method could achieve high anti-forensics performance while preserving satisfying image quality. We also justify the proposed extra supervision via an ablation study.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the event-triggered output regulation problem (EORP) under the denial-of-service (DoS) attacks is considered for networked switched systems (NSSs) with unstable switching dynamics (USDs). The USDs here refer to the unsolvable output regulation of each subsystem and the destabilization at partial switching instants, which indicates that the Lyapunov function does not decrease monotonically in activation intervals of each subsystem and increases at partial switching instants. First, long-duration DoS attacks (LDDAs) are considered, where LDDAs imply that their duration may be longer than the total dwell time (DT) of several adjacent activated subsystems. By imposing constraints at switching instants, consecutive asynchronous subsystem switching caused by LDDAs and USDs is allowed, that is, the subsystem switches several times but the controller switching is blocked by LDDAs and controllers fail to switch correspondingly. Second, mixed event-triggered mechanisms (ETMs), combining event-triggered conditions and periodic sampling conditions, are designed to reduce network burden under LDDAs and improve system performance subject to destabilizing switching. Then, an improved DT for switching signal permits irregular arrangement of destabilizing and stabilizing switching and is more suitable for NSSs subject to LDDAs. Moreover, sufficient conditions ensure the solvability of EORP for NSSs with USDs under LDDAs, network-induced delays, random packet losses, and packet disorders. Finally, a switched RLC circuit shows the feasibility of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Centralized particle swarm optimization (PSO) does not fully exploit the potential of distributed or parallel computing and suffers from single-point-of-failure. Particularly, each particle in PSO comprises a potential solution (e.g., traveling route and neural network model parameters) which is essentially viewed as private data. Unfortunately, previously neither centralized nor distributed PSO algorithms fail to protect privacy effectively. Inspired by secure multiparty computation and multiagent system, this article proposes a privacy-preserving multiagent PSO algorithm (called PriMPSO) to protect each particle’s data and enable private data sharing in a privacy-preserving manner. The goal of PriMPSO is to protect each particle’s data in a distributed computing paradigm via existing PSO algorithms with competitive performance. Specifically, each particle is executed by an independent agent with its own data, and all agents jointly perform global optimization without sacrificing any particle’s data. Thorough investigations show that selecting an exemplar from all particles and updating particles through the exemplar are critical operations for PSO algorithms. To this end, this article designs a privacy-preserving exemplar selection algorithm and a privacy-preserving triple computation protocol to select exemplars and update particles, respectively. Strict privacy analyses and extensive experiments on a benchmark and a realistic task confirm that PriMPSO not only protects particles’ privacy but also has uniform convergence performance with the existing PSO algorithm in approximating an optimal solution.},

  abstract     = {In this work, the problem of tracking control for discrete-time nonlinear actuator-saturated systems via interval type-2 (IT2) T–S fuzzy framework is investigated. Improved on the (type-1) T–S fuzzy system, the IT2 T–S fuzzy system has a better capability for the expression of system uncertainty, and correspondingly, it will increase the difficulty of analysis, especially for the membership-functions-dependent (MFD) method. In addition, in this case, the control input nonlinearity caused by actuator saturation will complicate the stability analysis of the systems. We make an attempt to address the challenges that the information of membership functions (MFs) is underutilized or not utilized, by developing an MFD analysis approach, which allows the enhancement of design flexibility of IT2 fuzzy controller and effectiveness of lessening the conservativeness of the analysis result. The piecewise MFs which are formed by connecting the sample point on or close to the original IT2 MFs are utilized to approximate the original IT2 MFs, and the error between the piecewise MFs and the original upper and lower MFs is taken into account in the stability analysis. To acquire the linear matrix inequality-based (LMI-based) constraint, the actuator saturation is converted to a sector nonlinear issue. $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance is considered to limit the difference between the reference system and the control saturated system. Examples are presented to illustrate the validity of the results.},

  abstract     = {Person attribute recognition (PAR) aims to simultaneously predict multiple attributes of a person. Existing deep learning-based PAR methods have achieved impressive performance. Unfortunately, these methods usually ignore the fact that different attributes have an imbalance in the number of noisy-labeled samples in the PAR training datasets, thus leading to suboptimal performance. To address the above problem of imbalanced noisy-labeled samples, we propose a novel and effective loss called drop loss for PAR. In the drop loss, the attributes are treated differently in an easy-to-hard way. In particular, the noisy-labeled candidates, which are identified according to their gradient norms, are dropped with a higher drop rate for the harder attribute. Such a manner adaptively alleviates the adverse effect of imbalanced noisy-labeled samples on model learning. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed loss, we train a simple ResNet-50 model based on the drop loss and term it DropNet. Experimental results on two representative PAR tasks (including facial attribute recognition and pedestrian attribute recognition) demonstrate that the proposed DropNet achieves comparable or better performance in terms of both balanced accuracy and classification accuracy over several state-of-the-art PAR methods.},

  abstract     = {Distributed clustering based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) has exhibited excellent clustering capabilities in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. However, more iterative numbers and communication overhead are required to achieve the consensus in existing distributed GMM clustering algorithms. In addition, the truth that it cannot find a closed form for the update of parameters in GMM causes the imprecise clustering accuracy. To solve these issues, by utilizing the transfer learning technique, a general transfer distributed GMM clustering framework is exploited to promote the clustering performance and accelerate the clustering convergence. In this work, each node is treated as both the source domain and the target domain, and these nodes can learn from each other to complete the clustering task in distributed P2P networks. Based on this framework, the transfer distributed expectation–maximization algorithm with the fixed learning rate is first presented for data clustering. Then, an improved version is designed to obtain the stable clustering accuracy, in which an adaptive transfer learning strategy is adopted to adjust the learning rate automatically instead of a fixed value. To demonstrate the extensibility of the proposed framework, a representative GMM clustering method, the entropy-type classification maximum-likelihood algorithm, is further extended to the transfer distributed counterpart. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the presented algorithms in contrast with the existing GMM clustering approaches.},

A sliding mode controller is designed to drive the state into the sliding domain around the specified sliding surface, and sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the exponentially ultimate boundedness of the resultant closed-loop system in the mean-square sense.

  abstract     = {Temporal community detection is helpful to discover and analyze significant groups or clusters hidden in dynamic networks in the real world. A variety of methods, such as modularity optimization, spectral method, and statistical network model, has been developed from diversified perspectives. Recently, network embedding-based technologies have made significant progress, and one can exploit deep learning superiority to network tasks. Although some methods for static networks have shown promising results in boosting community detection by integrating community embedding, they are not suitable for temporal networks and unable to capture their dynamics. Furthermore, the dynamic embedding methods only model network varying without considering community structures. Hence, in this article, we propose a novel unsupervised dynamic community detection model, which is based on network embedding and can effectively discover temporal communities and model dynamic networks. More specifically, we propose the community prior by introducing the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in the variational autoencoder, which can obtain community information and better model the evolutionary characteristics of community structure and node embedding by utilizing the variant of gated recurrent unit (GRU). Extensive experiments conducted in real-world and artificial networks demonstrate that our proposed model has a better effect on improving the accuracy of dynamic community detection.},

In this article, we propose a new metric called the optimization degree of the convergence-related decision variable to each objective to calculate the contribution objective of each decision variable. All decision variables are grouped according to their contribution objectives. Then, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, namely, decision variable contributing to objectives evolutionary algorithm (DVCOEA), has been proposed. In order to balance the convergence and diversity of the population, the DVCOEA algorithm combines the multipopulation multiobjective framework, where two different optimization strategies are designed to optimize the subpopulation and individuals in the external archive, respectively. Finally, DVCOEA is compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms on a number of benchmark functions.

In this case, any full-information game learning dynamics can be recast into a distributed form, and its convergence can be determined from the structure of the augmented game. We apply the proposed approach to generate both deterministic and stochastic distributed gradient play and obtain several negative convergent results about the distributed gradient play: 1) a Nash equilibrium is convergent under the classic gradient play, yet its corresponding augmented Nash equilibrium may be not convergent under the distributed gradient play and, on the other side, 2) a Nash equilibrium is not convergent under the classic gradient play, yet its corresponding augmented Nash equilibrium may be convergent under the distributed gradient play. In particular, we show that the variational stability structure (including monotonicity as a special case) of a game is not guaranteed to be preserved in its augmented game.

However, variable grouping is not well studied in large-scale dynamic optimization when cooperating with multipopulation strategies. Specifically, when the numbers/sizes of the variable subcomponents are large, the performance of the algorithms will be substantially degraded. To address this issue, we propose a bilevel variable grouping (BLVG)-based framework. First, the primary grouping applies a state-of-the-art variable grouping method based on variable interaction analysis to group the variables into subcomponents. Second, the secondary grouping further groups the subcomponents into variable cells, that is, combination variable cells and decomposition variable cells. We then tailor a multipopulation strategy to process the two types of variable cells efficiently in a cooperative coevolutionary (CC) way. As indicated by the empirical study on large-scale dynamic optimization problems (DOPs) of up to 300 dimensions, the proposed framework outperforms several state-of-the-art frameworks for large-scale dynamic optimization.},

  abstract     = {Semisupervised classification with a few labeled training samples is a challenging task in the area of data mining. Moore–Penrose inverse (MPI)-based manifold regularization (MR) is a widely used technique in tackling semisupervised classification. However, most of the existing MPI-based MR algorithms can only generate loosely connected feature encoding, which is generally less effective in data representation and feature learning. To alleviate this deficiency, we introduce a new semisupervised multilayer subnet neural network called SS-MSNN. The key contributions of this article are as follows: 1) a novel MPI-based MR model using the subnetwork structure is introduced. The subnet model is utilized to enrich the latent space representations iteratively; 2) a one-step training process to learn the discriminative encoding is proposed. The proposed SS-MSNN learns parameters by directly optimizing the entire network, accepting input from one end, and producing output at the other end; and 3) a new semisupervised dataset called HFSWR-RDE is built for this research. Experimental results on multiple domains show that the SS-MSNN achieves promising performance over the other semisupervised learning algorithms, demonstrating fast inference speed and better generalization ability.},

  abstract     = {Remote sensing image captioning (RSIC), which describes a remote sensing image with a semantically related sentence, has been a cross-modal challenge between computer vision and natural language processing. For visual features extracted from remote sensing images, global features provide the complete and comprehensive visual relevance of all the words of a sentence simultaneously, while local features can emphasize the discrimination of these words individually. Therefore, not only global features are important for caption generation but also local features are meaningful for making the words more discriminative. In order to make full use of the advantages of both global and local features, in this article, we propose an attention-based global–local captioning model (GLCM) to obtain global–local visual feature representation for RSIC. Based on the proposed GLCM, the correlation of all the generated words and the relation of each separate word and the most related local visual features can be visualized in a similarity-based manner, which provides more interpretability for RSIC. In the extensive experiments, our method achieves comparable results in UCM-captions and superior results in Sydney-captions and RSICD which is the largest RSIC dataset.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a multiobjective operation optimization method based on reinforcement self-learning and knowledge guidance for quality assurance and consumption reduction of wastewater treatment process (WWTP) with nonstationary time-varying dynamics. First, operation optimization models are developed by online sequential random vector functional-link (OS-RVFL) neural network, which can realize online sequential learning of model parameters. Then, a knowledge base is established to store typical optimization cases for knowledge guiding the subsequent optimizations. Based on it, a reinforcement self-learning-based multiobjective particle swarm optimization (RSL-MOPSO) algorithm is proposed to perform optimization calculation. In this algorithm, reinforcement self-learning is used for interaction learning between environment and action in optimization, and the particle motion trend of algorithm is adjusted according to the feedback information of the optimization process. The effects of wastewater state parameters on particles are recorded and reused to improve the solution quality and calculation efficiency of optimization. Moreover, to make good use of the information of the previous optimizations and balance the coordination between global search in the early stage and local search in the later stage, a selective information feedback mechanism is further proposed to ensure the diversity and convergence of the algorithm. Finally, prediction-based intelligent decision making is performed to select the final optimization solution as the final setpoints for the lower-level controllers from the Pareto frontier with considering specific technical requirements. Data experiments show that the proposed method can effectively reduce energy consumption and ensure effluent quality.},

  abstract     = {Performance in an engineering system tends to degrade over time due to a variety of wearing or ageing processes. In supervisory controlled processes there are typically many signals being monitored that may help to characterize performance degradation. It is preferred to select the least amount of information to obtain high quality of predictive analysis from a large amount of collected data, in which labeling the data is not always feasible. To this end a novel unsupervised feature selection method, robust with respect to significant measurement disturbances, is proposed using the notion of “weak monotonicity” (WM). The robustness of this notion makes it very attractive to identify the common trend in the presence of measurement noises and population variation from the collected data. Based on WM, a novel suitability indicator is proposed to evaluate the performance of each feature. This new indicator is then used to select the key features that contribute to the WM of a family of processes when noises and variations among processes exist. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework of the WM and suitability, a comparative study with other nine state-of-the-arts unsupervised feature evaluation and selection methods is carried out on well-known benchmark datasets. The results show a promising performance of the proposed framework on unsupervised feature evaluation in the presence of measurement noises and population variations.},

To solve the above problems, we propose a latent LRR with weighted distance penalty (LLRRWD) for clustering in this article. First, a weighted distance is proposed to enhance the original Euclidean distance by enlarging the distance among the unconnected samples, which can enhance the discriminitation of the distance among the samples. By leveraging on the weighted distance, a weighted distance penalty is introduced to the LatLRR model to enable the method to preserve both the local geometric information and global information, improving discrimination of the learned affinity matrix. Moreover, a weight matrix is imposed on the sparse error norm to reduce the effect of noise and redundancy.

Recent studies have shown that evolutionary computing (EC) is very promising for FS due to its powerful search capability. However, most existing EC-based FS methods use a length-fixed encoding to represent feature subsets. This inflexible encoding turns ineffective when high-dimension data are handled, because it results in a huge search space, as well as a large amount of training time and memory overhead. In this article, we propose a length-adaptive genetic algorithm with Markov blanket (LAGAM), which adopts a length-variable individual encoding and enables individuals to evolve in their own search space. In LAGAM, features are rearranged decreasingly based on their relevance, and an adaptive length changing operator is introduced, which extends or shortens an individual to guide it to explore in a better search space. Local search based on Markov blanket (MB) is embedded to further improve individuals. Experiments are conducted on 12 high-dimensional datasets and results reveal that LAGAM performs better than existing methods. Specifically, it achieves a higher classification accuracy by using fewer features.},

In addition, minority class sometimes means extremely important information for users or is corrupted by noises and/or outliers in practical application scenarios such as medical diagnosis, which actually inspires us to generalize the AUC concept to reflect such importance or upper bound of noises or outliers. In order to address these issues, by means of both the generalized AUC metric and the core vector machine (CVM) technique, a fast AUC maximizing learning machine, called $\rho $ -AUCCVM, with simultaneous outlier detection is proposed in this study. $\rho $ -AUCCVM has its notorious merits: 1) it indeed shares the CVM’s advantage, that is, asymptotically linear time complexity with respect to the total number of sample pairs, together with space complexity independent on the total number of sample pairs and 2) it can automatically determine the importance of the minority class (assuming no noise) or the upper bound of noises or outliers. Extensive experimental results about benchmarking imbalanced datasets verify the above advantages of $\rho $ -AUCCVM.},

  abstract     = {The dendritic neural model (DNM) is computationally faster than other machine-learning techniques, because its architecture can be implemented by using logic circuits and its calculations can be performed entirely in binary form. To further improve the computational speed, a straightforward approach is to generate a more concise architecture for the DNM. Actually, the architecture search is a large-scale multiobjective optimization problem (LSMOP), where a large number of parameters need to be set with the aim of optimizing accuracy and structural complexity simultaneously. However, the issues of irregular Pareto front, objective discontinuity, and population degeneration strongly limit the performances of conventional multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) on the specific problem. Therefore, a novel competitive decomposition-based MOEA is proposed in this study, which decomposes the original problem into several constrained subproblems, with neighboring subproblems sharing overlapping regions in the objective space. The solutions in the overlapping regions participate in environmental selection for the neighboring subproblems and then propagate the selection pressure throughout the entire population. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can possess a more powerful optimization ability than the state-of-the-art MOEAs. Furthermore, both the DNM itself and its hardware implementation can achieve very competitive classification performances when trained by the proposed algorithm, compared with numerous widely used machine-learning approaches.},

However, to further extend its applications, there are still some issues need to be addressed, such as the limited type of structural constraints, the marginally stable solutions, and the low computation efficiency. In this article, we aim to make this method applicable to a class of structural constraints for some elements in the gain matrix being zero or with intrarow and intracolumn constraints. To address such structured control problem, we propose a procedure to transform the original system to an extended system with the decentralized feedback matrix. From here, the mapping rules to the parameter space are given for the decentralized feedback matrix with both intrarow and intracolumn constraints. To avoid oscillatory closed-loop dynamics, we include the closed-loop dominant pole constraints during optimization. In addition, to improve the computation efficiency during optimization, we revise the cutting plane logic, which allows adding multiple linear constraints within a single iteration.

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms are becoming increasingly attractive as highly integrated miniature sensors and processors deliver extraordinary performance. The employment of UAV swarms on complex real-life tasks has motivated exploration on allocation problems involving multiple UAVs, complex constraints, and multiple tasks with coupling relationships. Such problems have been summarized domain independently as multirobot task allocation problems with temporal and ordering constraints (MRTA/TOC). The majority of MRTA/TOC works have hitherto focused on deterministic settings, while their stochastic counterparts are sparsely explored. In this article, allocation problems incorporating classification uncertainty of targets and soft ordering constraints of tasks are considered. To address such problems, a novel market-based allocation algorithm, the probability-tuned market-based allocation (PTMA), is proposed. PTMA consists of iterations between two phases: 1) the first phase updates local perception of global situational awareness and 2) the second phase is a market-based allocation scheme with embedded artificial randomness to locally generate allocation results. Under reasonable assumptions on classification uncertainty, the proposed PTMA algorithm is proven to guarantee a superior performance compared with conventional auctions, verifying the feasibility of using randomness to counter randomness theoretically. Three groups of numerical experiments have been conducted to assess the performance of the proposed PTMA. The first group of experiments compares PTMA with the consensus-based auction algorithm (CBAA), the chance-constrained CBAA, and the PTMA-I (specialization of PTMA with the Identity matrix), on simulated task scenarios with varying degrees of classification uncertainty. The second group evaluates the stability of PTMA. The third group tests the scalability of PTMA on expanded task scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate a satisfactory performance in effectiveness, robustness, stability, and scalability of the proposed PTMA.},

Although the existing methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved the state-of-the-art performance, many challenges still remain in medical tumor segmentation. This is because, although the human visual system can detect symmetries in 2-D images effectively, regular CNNs can only exploit translation invariance, overlooking further inherent symmetries existing in medical images, such as rotations and reflections. To solve this problem, we propose a novel group equivariant segmentation framework by encoding those inherent symmetries for learning more precise representations. First, kernel-based equivariant operations are devised on each orientation, which allows it to effectively address the gaps of learning symmetries in existing approaches. Then, to keep segmentation networks globally equivariant, we design distinctive group layers with layer-wise symmetry constraints. Finally, based on our novel framework, extensive experiments conducted on real-world clinical data demonstrate that a group equivariant Res-UNet (called GER-UNet) outperforms its regular CNN-based counterpart and the state-of-the-art segmentation methods in the tasks of hepatic tumor segmentation, COVID-19 lung infection segmentation, and retinal vessel detection. More importantly, the newly built GER-UNet also shows potential in reducing the sample complexity and the redundancy of filters, upgrading current segmentation CNNs, and delineating organs on other medical imaging modalities.},

  abstract     = {Modern classifier systems can effectively classify targets that consist of simple patterns. However, they can fail to detect hierarchical patterns of features that exist in many real-world problems, such as understanding speech or recognizing object ontologies. Biological nervous systems have the ability to abstract knowledge from simple and small-scale problems in order to then apply it to resolve more complex problems in similar and related domains. It is thought that lateral asymmetry of biological brains allows modular learning to occur at different levels of abstraction, which can then be transferred between tasks. This work develops a novel evolutionary machine-learning (EML) system that incorporates lateralization and modular learning at different levels of abstraction. The results of analyzable Boolean tasks show that the lateralized system has the ability to encapsulate underlying knowledge patterns in the form of building blocks of knowledge (BBK). Lateralized abstraction transforms complex problems into simple ones by reusing general patterns (e.g., any parity problem becomes a sequence of the 2-bit parity problem). By enabling abstraction in evolutionary computation, the lateralized system is able to identify complex patterns (e.g., in hierarchical multiplexer (HMux) problems) better than existing systems.},

Considering only binary-valued measurement information with stochastic noise can be received from its neighbors for each agent, a new two-iteration-scale framework that alternates estimation and control is designed. Under the proposed framework, each agent estimates the neighbors’ states based on the empirical measurement method during a dwell iteration interval, during which each agent’s states will keep constant along the iteration axis. Further, in view of the impacts of system uncertainties and actuator faults, a novel adaptive iterative learning fault-tolerant averaging consensus control scheme is designed based on its own states and the estimated neighbors’ states. Finally, the resulting closed-loop system is rigorously proved to be stable, and numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed control strategy.},

Then, a distributed fault estimation observer design scheme that utilizes the associated information among subsystems is presented to not only reconstruct faults, but also suppress disturbances in the sense of robust $H_{\infty }$ optimization. Besides, to improve the fault estimation performance, a common Lyapunov matrix-based multiconstrained design method is first given to solve the observer gain, which is further extended to the different Lyapunov matrices-based multiconstrained calculation method. Thus, the conservatism is reduced. Finally, simulation experiments are shown to verify the validity of our distributed fault estimation scheme.},

The primary purpose of this article is to establish a unified framework that integrates the convergence analysis, the accuracy evaluation, and the privacy level for the developed DPAC algorithm under the LDED communication scheme. By means of the matrix eigenvalue analysis method, the Jury stability criterion, and the probability theory, a sufficient condition (with respect to the quantization accuracy, the coupling strength, and the communication topology) is first derived to ensure the almost sure convergence of the proposed DPAC algorithm, and the convergence accuracy and privacy level are thoroughly investigated by resorting to the Chebyshev inequality and $\epsilon $ -differential privacy index.

From the perspective of malicious attackers, this article aims to devise an efficient scheme on false data-injection (FDI) attacks such that the performance on remote state estimation is degraded as much as possible. First, an event-based stealthy FDI attack mechanism is introduced to selectively inject false data while evading a residual-based anomaly detector. Compared with some existing methods, the main advantage of this mechanism is that it decides when to launch the FDI attacks dynamically according to real-time residuals. Second, the state estimation error covariance of the compromised system is used to evaluate the performance degradation under FDI attacks, and the larger the state estimation error covariance, the more the performance degradation. Moreover, under attack stealthiness constraints, an optimal strategy is presented to maximize the trace of the state estimation error covariance. Finally, simulation experiments are carried out to illustrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with some existing ones.},

Moreover, it is still an open problem how to extract the most suitable low-dimensional features for the support vector machine (SVM) and simultaneously avoid singularity so as to enhance the SVM’s performance. To address these problems, this article designs a novel framework that integrates the discriminative feature extraction and sparse feature selection into the support vector framework to make full use of the classifiers’ characteristics to find the optimal/maximal classification margin. As such, the extracted low-dimensional features from high-dimensional data are more suitable for SVM to obtain good performance. Thus, a novel algorithm, called the maximal margin SVM (MSVM), is proposed to achieve this goal. An alternatively iterative learning strategy is adopted in MSVM to learn the optimal discriminative sparse subspace and the corresponding support vectors. The mechanism and the essence of the designed MSVM are revealed. The computational complexity and convergence are also analyzed and validated. Experimental results on some well-known databases (including breastmnist, pneumoniamnist, colon-cancer, etc.) show the great potential of MSVM against classical discriminant analysis methods and SVM-related methods, and the codes can be available on https://www.scholat.com/laizhihui .},

However, many existing feature selection approaches ignore the fact that there are multiple optimal solutions to a feature selection problem. Multiple feature subsets with different features selected can achieve very similar or the same classification accuracy. To search for multiple optimal feature subsets, a niching-based differential evolution (DE) method with duplication analysis is proposed. In the proposed method, the duplicated feature subsets in the population are modified by the proposed subset repairing scheme which can produce unique feature subsets. Second, the mutation operator in DE is improved, which uses both the niche and global information to produce promising feature subsets. Third, a new selection method considering the diversity among feature subsets is adopted to form a new population for the next-generation. In the experiments, the proposed method is compared with seven evolutionary feature selection algorithms and two typical feature selection methods on 18 datasets. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher classification accuracy than the compared methods on most of the used datasets. Furthermore, the proposed method can find different feature subsets with very similar or the same classification accuracy.},

To obtain its reliable and high-quality schedule in a reasonable time, a learning-based cuckoo search (LCS) algorithm is presented. In it, cuckoo search is selected as an optimizer. To produce promising solutions in a high-dimensional solution space, a sparse autoencoder is introduced to compress a high-dimensional solution into an informative low-dimensional one. It extends the application area of autoencoder-embedded evolutionary optimization methods into combinational optimization by developing an improved one-hot encoding method. Then, in order to reveal the linkages among decision variables and enhance the explore ability of the proposed method, a factorization machine (FM) is used, for the first time, to capture the relevant and complementary features of population. Hence, a parallel framework involving three co-evolved subpopulations is constructed. The first one is an autoencoder embedded subpopulation, the second one is assisted by an FM, and the last one undergoes a regular iteration process. To balance the exploration and exploitation of the proposed framework and avoid unnecessary computation, a reinforcement learning algorithm is used to adaptively adjust the proportion of subpopulations and tune parameters of each subpopulation iteratively. Numerical simulations with benchmarks are performed to compare it with CPLEX, some classical heuristics, and several recently developed methods. The results shows that it well outperforms them.},

  abstract     = {Spatial–spectral classification (SSC) has become a trend for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, most SSC methods mainly consider local information, so that some correlations may not be effectively discovered when they appear in regions that are not contiguous. Although many SSC methods can acquire spatial-contextual characteristics via spatial filtering, they lack the ability to consider correlations in non-Euclidean spaces. To address the aforementioned issues, we develop a new semisupervised HSI classification approach based on normalized spectral clustering with kernel-based learning (NSCKL), which can aggregate local-to-global correlations to achieve a distinguishable embedding to improve HSI classification performance. In this work, we propose a normalized spectral clustering (NSC) scheme that can learn new features under a manifold assumption. Specifically, we first design a kernel-based iterative filter (KIF) to establish vertices of the undirected graph, aiming to assign initial connections to the nodes associated with pixels. The NSC first gathers local correlations in the Euclidean space and then captures global correlations in the manifold. Even though homogeneous pixels are distributed in noncontiguous regions, our NSC can still aggregate correlations to generate new (clustered) features. Finally, the clustered features and a kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM) are employed to achieve the semisupervised classification. The effectiveness of our NSCKL is evaluated by using several HSIs. When compared with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification approaches, our newly proposed NSCKL demonstrates very competitive performance.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt for privacy computing method that jointly combines secure multiparty computing and neural network. Theoretically, this method can ensure that the accuracy of the model will not be reduced due to encryption, and the calculation speed is very fast.

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been proposed in recent years to solve data-driven optimization problems. Most existing surrogate-assisted EAs are for centralized optimization and do not take into account the challenges brought by the distribution of data at the edge of networks in the era of the Internet of Things. To this end, we propose edge–cloud co-EAs (ECCoEAs) to solve distributed data-driven optimization problems, where data are collected by edge servers. Specifically, we first propose a distributed framework of ECCoEAs, which consists of a communication mechanism, edge model management, and cloud model management. This communication mechanism is to avoid deadlock during the collaboration of edge servers and the cloud server. In edge model management, the edge models are trained based on local historical data and data composed of new solutions generated by co-evolutionary and their real evaluation values. In cloud model management, the black-box prediction functions received from edge models are used to find promising solutions to guide the edge model management. Moreover, two ECCoEAs are implemented, which proves the generality of the framework. To verify the performance of algorithms for distributed data-driven optimization problems, we design a novel benchmark test suite. The performance on the benchmarks and practical distributed clustering problems shows the effectiveness of ECCoEAs.},

To facilitate the transient faults, a semi-Markov process is addressed to model the dynamic behavior of IMAPSs. In order to modulate transmission frequency, a novel area-dependent dynamic-memory event-triggered protocol (DMETP) is scheduled by resorting to a set of the historically released packets (HRPs), which ensures better dynamic performance. From the viewpoint of the defender, the randomly occurring deception attack is taken into account, which is regulated by a Bernoulli-distributed scalar. Benefitting from the DMETP scheduling, a novel framework of the memory-based asynchronous control strategy is formulated, in which the hidden semi-Markov model is adopted to reveal the mode mismatches. Based on the Lyapunov theory, sufficient conditions are established to ensure the stochastic stability of the resulting systems. In the end, the simulation result is presented to reveal the efficiency of the proposed dynamic-memory event-triggered-based approach.},

The main contributions are twofold: 1) a discrete-time scenario of the dynamic periodic event-triggered mechanism is developed to schedule the transmissions of measurements. The proposed mechanism monitors the synchronization error in a periodic manner, which is beneficial to reduce the calculation resources of sensors. Simultaneously, the proposed mechanism increases the triggering threshold so that it contributes to enlarging the average interevent interval and 2) a new Lyapunov functional is developed to deal with the periodic samplings. On the one hand, the proposed functional involves a delay-dependent term, which is convenient to formulate the synchronization criterion by the delay analysis technique. On the other hand, the functional takes the sawtooth constraint of periodic samplings into consideration by introducing a piecewise functional. Finally, a succinct criterion is derived such that the considered networks are synchronized with a predetermined error level. A simulation example is provided to show our advantages in comparison with the existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {This work concentrates on the adaptive resilient dynamic surface controller design problem for uncertain nonlinear lower triangular stochastic cyber–physical systems (CPSs) subject to unknown deception attacks based on a switching threshold event-triggered mechanism. The adverse effect of deception attacks on the stochastic CPSs is that the exact system state variables become unavailable. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that the coexistence of unknown nonlinearities, stochastic perturbations, and unknown sensor and actuator attacks makes it a very difficult and challenging event to implement the control design. To get the desired controller, radial basis function (RBF) neural networks (NNs) are introduced so that the design obstacle caused from the unknown nonlinearities can be easily solved. On this basis, in order to save resources and effectively transmit, the event-triggered control scheme based on a switching threshold strategy is further considered. In the backstepping design process, the dynamic surface control (DSC) technique is presented to deal with the issue of “explosion of complexity.” By skillfully designing a new coordinate transformation and the attack compensators, the problem of unknown deception attacks is successfully handled. Under our proposed control scheme, all the closed-loop signals are bounded in probability and the stabilization errors converge to an adjustable neighborhood of the origin in probability. Finally, the simulation results on the double chemical reactor show the validity of the proposed design scheme.},

It is shown that under the adaptive controller designed based on the proposed framework, the tracking errors between the outputs of all the agents and the output of the leader converge to a residual set. It is also shown that the tracking errors will converge to zero asymptotically when the disturbances are absent.

To this end, distributed optimal coordinators (DOCs) are used to generate optimal solutions of local objective functions that converge to the desired output, and fuzzy reference-tracking controllers are designed to ensure that all agents can track the optimal solutions. As novel technical results, two Lyapunov-based fuzzy input-to-state stability (ISS) small-gain theorems are proposed for the T–S fuzzy interconnected system.

  abstract     = {The data generated by modern industrial processes often exhibit high-dimensional, nonlinear, timing, and multiscale characteristics. Presently, most of the fault diagnosis methods based on deep learning only consider the part of the characteristics of industrial data, which will cause the loss of part of the feature information during training, thereby affecting the final diagnosis effect. In order to solve the above problems, this article proposes an end-to-end multiscale feature learning method based on model fusion, which can simultaneously extract multiscale spatial features and temporal features of data, effectively reducing the loss of feature information. First, this article combines the convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual learning and designs a multiscale residual network (MRCNN) to extract high-dimensional nonlinear spatial features of different scales in the data. Then, the extracted features are input into the long and short-term memory (LSTM) network to further extract the temporal features of the data. After the fully connected layer, it is input into the classifier for final fault classification. The residual learning in MRCNN can effectively avoid the problem of model degradation and improve the training efficiency of the model. Through the fusion of MRCNN and LSTM, we can significantly improve the feature extraction ability of the model, thereby greatly improving the diagnosis effect. In the final case experiment, the method improved the comprehensive diagnostic accuracy of the Tennessee-Eastman (TE) process and industrial coking furnace datasets to 94.43\% and 97.80\%, respectively, which was significantly better than the existing deep learning model and proves the effectiveness and superiority of this method.},

In multiplayer Markov games (MGs), however, the interaction is nonstationary due to the behaviors of other players, so the agent has no fixed optimization objective. The challenge becomes finding equilibrium policies for all players. In this research, we treat the evolution of player policies as a dynamical process and propose a novel learning scheme for Nash equilibrium. The core is to evolve one’s policy according to not just its current in-game performance, but an aggregation of its performance over history. We show that for a variety of MGs, players in our learning scheme will provably converge to a point that is an approximation to Nash equilibrium. Combined with neural networks, we develop an empirical policy optimization algorithm, which is implemented in a reinforcement-learning framework and runs in a distributed way, with each player optimizing its policy based on own observations. We use two numerical examples to validate the convergence property on small-scale MGs, and a pong example to show the potential on large games.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the practical prescribed-time leaderless consensus problem for multiple networked strict-feedback systems under directed topology. Different from most existing protocols for finite-time consensus that rely on the signum function or fractional power state feedback (thus, the finite convergence time is contingent upon the initial positions of the agents or other design parameters), the proposed distributed neuroadaptive consensus solution is based on a two-phase performance adjustment approach, which exhibits several salient features: 1) the consensus error is ensured to converge to a preassigned arbitrarily small residual set within prescribed time; 2) the tunable transient behavior and desired steady-state control performance of the consensus error is maintained under any unknown initial conditions; and 3) the control scheme involves only one parameter estimation, significantly reducing the design complexity and online computation. Furthermore, we extend the result to practical prescribed-time leader-following consensus control under directed communication topology. Numerical simulation verifies the benefits and efficiency of the proposed method.},

In the proposed method, a submartingale criterion is proposed on the basis of the equivalence relationship between the optimal policy and martingale, and then an advanced value iteration (AVI) method is proposed to conduct value iteration with a high accuracy. Based on this foundation, an anti-martingale (AM) reinforcement learning framework is established to efficiently select the sample data that is conducive to policy optimization. In succession, an AM proximal policy optimization (AMPPO) method, which combines the AM framework with proximal policy optimization (PPO), is proposed to reasonably accelerate the updating process of state value that satisfies the submartingale criterion. Experimental results on the Mujoco platform show that AMPPO can achieve better performance than several state-of-the-art comparative DRL methods.},

Existing data stream clustering algorithms face two critical issues: 1) evaluating the relationship among data objects with individual landmark windows of fixed size and 2) passing useful knowledge from previous landmark windows to the current landmark window. Based on sparse representation techniques, this article proposes a two-stage sparse representation clustering (TSSRC) method. The novelty of the proposed TSSRC algorithm comes from evaluating the effective relationship among data objects in the landmark windows with an accurate number of clusters. First, the proposed algorithm evaluates the relationship among data objects using sparse representation techniques. The dictionary and sparse representations are iteratively updated by solving a convex optimization problem. Second, the proposed TSSRC algorithm presents a dictionary initialization strategy that seeks representative data objects by making full use of the sparse representation results. This efficiently passes previously learned knowledge to the current landmark window over time. Moreover, the convergence and sparse stability of TSSRC can be theoretically guaranteed in continuous landmark windows under certain conditions. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TSSRC.},

  abstract     = {Supervised deep learning techniques have been widely explored in real photograph denoising and achieved noticeable performances. However, being subject to specific training data, most current image denoising algorithms can easily be restricted to certain noisy types and exhibit poor generalizability across testing sets. To address this issue, we propose a novel flexible and well-generalized approach, coined as dual meta attention network (DMANet). The DMANet is mainly composed of a cascade of the self-meta attention blocks (SMABs) and collaborative-meta attention blocks (CMABs). These two blocks have two forms of advantages. First, they simultaneously take both spatial and channel attention into account, allowing our model to better exploit more informative feature interdependencies. Second, the attention blocks are embedded with the meta-subnetwork, which is based on metalearning and supports dynamic weight generation. Such a scheme can provide a beneficial means for self and collaborative updating of the attention maps on-the-fly. Instead of directly stacking the SMABs and CMABs to form a deep network architecture, we further devise a three-stage learning framework, where different blocks are utilized for each feature extraction stage according to the individual characteristics of SMAB and CMAB. On five real datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach against the state of the art. Unlike most existing image denoising algorithms, our DMANet not only possesses a good generalization capability but can also be flexibly used to cope with the unknown and complex real noises, making it highly competitive for practical applications.},

The periodic event-triggered output-feedback control law is then designed via the disturbance/uncertainty estimation and attenuation (DUEA) method, such that the communication times can be remarkably reduced and, at the same time, the disturbance rejection ability can be effectively enhanced. Under the predictor-based event-triggered control method, the influence of the time delays is effectively attenuated, and the effect of external disturbance is considerably attenuated due to the prediction technique and the DUEA method. By using the small-gain arguments, this article gives some sufficient stability conditions for the overall control system, and the explicit computations of sampling/updating period and time delays are presented as well.

Meanwhile, Zeno behavior can be excluded under the proposed triggering schemes. Second, since the full-state information is not available to the controller, by developing an observer, the system state is estimated and a controller based on estimated state information is designed. Due to the irregular sampling of information communication and state estimation error affects each other, the parameters of the state observer, the controller, and the event-triggering mechanism should be jointly designed.

However, there are still some challenges for developing AI system: 1) most current COVID-19 infection segmentation methods mainly relied on 2-D CT images, which lack 3-D sequential constraint; 2) existing 3-D CT segmentation methods focus on single-scale representations, which do not achieve the multiple level receptive field sizes on 3-D volume; and 3) the emergent breaking out of COVID-19 makes it hard to annotate sufficient CT volumes for training deep model. To address these issues, we first build a multiple dimensional-attention convolutional neural network (MDA-CNN) to aggregate multiscale information along different dimension of input feature maps and impose supervision on multiple predictions from different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) layers. Second, we assign this MDA-CNN as a basic network into a novel dual multiscale mean teacher network (DM ${^{2}}\text{T}$ -Net) for semi-supervised COVID-19 lung infection segmentation on CT volumes by leveraging unlabeled data and exploring the multiscale information. Our DM ${^{2}}\text{T}$ -Net encourages multiple predictions at different CNN layers from the student and teacher networks to be consistent for computing a multiscale consistency loss on unlabeled data, which is then added to the supervised loss on the labeled data from multiple predictions of MDA-CNN. Third, we collect two COVID-19 segmentation datasets to evaluate our method. The experimental results show that our network consistently outperforms the compared state-of-the-art methods.},

The considered switched reference model consists of submodels possessing safe system behaviors that are governed by switching signals to achieve satisfactory performances. A state-dependent switching control technique based on the time-varying safe sets is proposed by utilizing the multiple Lyapunov functions method, which guarantees the state of the subsystem is within the corresponding safe set when the subsystem is activated. To deal with uncertainties, a switched adaptive controller with different update laws is constructed by resorting to the projection operator, which reduces the conservatism caused by the common update law adopted in all subsystems. Moreover, a sufficient condition is obtained by structuring a switched time-varying safety function, which ensures the safety of switched systems and the boundedness of error systems in the presence of uncertainties. As a special case, the safety control problem under arbitrary switching is considered and a corollary is deduced. Finally, a numerical example and a wing rock dynamics model are provided to verify the effectiveness of the developed approach.},

  abstract     = {Small target motion detection within complex natural environments is an extremely challenging task for autonomous robots. Surprisingly, the visual systems of insects have evolved to be highly efficient in detecting mates and tracking prey, even though targets occupy as small as a few degrees of their visual fields. The excellent sensitivity to small target motion relies on a class of specialized neurons, called small target motion detectors (STMDs). However, existing STMD-based models are heavily dependent on visual contrast and perform poorly in complex natural environments, where small targets generally exhibit extremely low contrast against neighboring backgrounds. In this article, we develop an attention-and-prediction-guided visual system to overcome this limitation. The developed visual system comprises three main subsystems, namely: 1) an attention module; 2) an STMD-based neural network; and 3) a prediction module. The attention module searches for potential small targets in the predicted areas of the input image and enhances their contrast against a complex background. The STMD-based neural network receives the contrast-enhanced image and discriminates small moving targets from background false positives. The prediction module foresees future positions of the detected targets and generates a prediction map for the attention module. The three subsystems are connected in a recurrent architecture, allowing information to be processed sequentially to activate specific areas for small target detection. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed visual system for detecting small, low-contrast moving targets against complex natural environments.},

Converging evidence shows that a multiview graph provides a more comprehensive relationship between nodes than a single-view graph to capture the intrinsic topology. However, little attention has been paid to excavating discriminative representations of each node from multiview heterogeneous networks in an unsupervised manner. To that end, we propose a novel unsupervised multiview graph embedding method, called multiview deep graph infomax (MVDGI). The backbone of our proposed model sought to maximize the mutual information between the view-dependent node representations and the fused unified representation via contrastive learning. Specifically, the MVDGI first uses an encoder to extract view-dependent node representations from each single-view graph. Next, an aggregator is applied to fuse the view-dependent node representations into the view-independent node representations. Finally, a discriminator is adopted to extract highly discriminative representations via contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the MVDGI achieves better performance than the benchmark methods on five real-world datasets, indicating that the obtained node representations by our proposed approach are more discriminative than by its competitors for classification and clustering tasks.},

First, a map-building algorithm based on the improved Rao–Blackwellized particle filter is applied for the WIP vehicle to construct the environmental map. Then, a multiobjective optimization using the genetic algorithm is performed to find an optimized path between the given start and target point with path length, path curvature, and safe distance being taken into consideration simultaneously. Moreover, on the basis of kinematical and dynamical analysis, velocity, and acceleration constraints are parameterized with a path parameter, and the minimum-time trajectory along the optimized path is further planned with a sequence of maximum acceleration and deceleration trajectories. Finally, a WIP vehicle platform based on the robot operating system is designed, and related experiments in a real obstacle environment are conducted to validate the feasibility of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The multilayer one-class classification (OCC) frameworks have gained great traction in research on anomaly and outlier detection. However, most multilayer OCC algorithms suffer from loosely connected feature coding, affecting the ability of generated latent space to properly generate a highly discriminative representation between object classes. To alleviate this deficiency, two novel OCC frameworks, namely: 1) OCC structure using the subnetwork neural network (OC-SNN) and 2) maximum correntropy-based OC-SNN (MCOC-SNN), are proposed in this article. The novelties of this article are as follows: 1) the subnetwork is used to build the discriminative latent space; 2) the proposed models are one-step learning networks, instead of stacking feature learning blocks and final classification layer to recognize the input pattern; 3) unlike existing works which utilize mean square error (MSE) to learn low-dimensional features, the MCOC-SNN uses maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) for discriminative feature encoding; and 4) a brand-new OCC dataset, called CO-Mask, is built for this research. Experimental results on the visual classification domain with a varying number of training samples from 6131 to 513 061 demonstrate that the proposed OC-SNN and MCOC-SNN achieve superior performance compared to the existing multilayer OCC models.

  abstract     = {Decomposition methods have been widely employed in evolutionary algorithms for tackling multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) due to their good mathematical explanation and promising performance. However, most decomposition methods only use a single ideal or nadir point to guide the evolution, which are not so effective for solving MOPs with extremely convex/concave Pareto fronts (PFs). To solve this problem, this article proposes an effective method to adapt decomposed directions (ADDs) for solving MOPs. Instead of using one single ideal or nadir point, each weight vector has one exclusive ideal point in our method for decomposition, in which the decomposed directions are adapted during the search process. In this way, the adapted decomposed directions can evenly and entirely cover the PF of the target MOP. The effectiveness of our method is analyzed theoretically and verified experimentally when embedding it into three representative multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), which can significantly improve their performance. When compared to seven competitive MOEAs, the experiments also validate the advantages of our method for solving 39 artificial MOPs with various PFs and one real-world MOP.},

  abstract     = {A number of real-world multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) are driven by the data from experiments or computational simulations. In some cases, no new data can be sampled during the optimization process and only a certain amount of data can be sampled before optimization starts. Such problems are known as offline data-driven MOPs. Although multiple surrogate models approximating each objective function are able to replace the real fitness evaluations in evolutionary algorithms (EAs), their approximation errors are easily accumulated and therefore, mislead the solution ranking. To mitigate this issue, a new surrogate-assisted indicator-based EA for solving offline data-driven multiobjective problems is proposed. The proposed algorithm adopts an indicator-based selection EA as the baseline optimizer due to its selection robustness to the approximation errors of surrogate models. Both the Kriging models and radial basis function networks (RBFNs) are employed as surrogate models. An adaptive model selection mechanism is designed to choose the right type of models according to a maximum acceptable approximation error that is less likely to mislead the indicator-based search. The main idea is that when the uncertainty of the Kriging models exceeds the acceptable error, the proposed algorithm selects RBFNs as the surrogate models. The results comparing with state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark problems with up to ten objectives indicate that the proposed algorithm is effective on offline data-driven optimization problems with up to 20 and 30 decision variables.},

It generally encodes image into hash code with feature similarity preserving, that is, geometric-structure preservation, and achieves promising retrieval results. In this article, we find that existing geometric-structure preservation manner inadequately ensures feature discrimination, while improving feature discrimination of hash code essentially determines hash learning retrieval performance. This fact principally spurs us to propose a discriminative geometric-structure-based deep hashing method (DGDH), which investigates three novel loss terms based on class centers to induce the so-called discriminative geometrical structure. In detail, the margin-aware center loss assembles samples in the same class to the corresponding class centers for intraclass compactness, then a linear classifier based on class center serves to boost interclass separability, and the radius loss further puts different class centers on a hypersphere to tentatively reduce quantization errors. An efficient alternate optimization algorithm with guaranteed desirable convergence is proposed to optimize DGDH. We theoretically analyze the robustness and generalization of the proposed method. The experiments on five popular benchmark datasets demonstrate superior image retrieval performance of the proposed DGDH over several state of the arts.},

Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results on purely supervised graph classification by virtue of the powerful representation ability of neural networks. However, almost all of them ignore the fact that graph classification usually lacks reasonably sufficient labeled data in practical scenarios due to the inherent labeling difficulty caused by the high complexity of graph data. The existing semisupervised GNNs typically focus on the task of node classification and are incapable to deal with graph classification. To tackle the challenging but practically useful scenario, we propose a novel and general semisupervised GNN framework for graph classification, which takes full advantage of a slight amount of labeled graphs and abundant unlabeled graph data. In our framework, we train two GNNs as complementary views for collaboratively learning high-quality classifiers using both labeled and unlabeled graphs. To further exploit the view itself, we constantly select pseudo-labeled graph examples with high confidence from its own view for enlarging the labeled graph dataset and enhancing predictions on graphs. Furthermore, the proposed framework is investigated on two specific implementation regimes with a few labeled graphs and the extremely few labeled graphs, respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed semisupervised GNN framework for graph classification on several benchmark datasets.},

The SR-NNN makes full use of partial truth information and the mighty local fitting ability of neural networks.

The maximum root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of DR is 0.096 and the maximum RMSE of SR-NNN is 0.053, which has been improved by 55\%. In addition, the motion model obtained by SR-NNN online training can avoid the error introduced by the predetermined motion model and overcome the interference of the external environment. The intelligent CNaC still can achieve satisfactory control performance based on the estimated position given by the SR-NNN rather than the ground truth which is formed by postprocessing.

  abstract     = {For the 2-D laser-based tasks, e.g., people detection and people tracking, leg detection is usually the first step. Thus, it carries great weight in determining the performance of people detection and people tracking. However, many leg detectors ignore the inevitable noise and the multiscale characteristics of the laser scan, which makes them sensitive to the unreliable features of point cloud and further degrades the performance of the leg detector. In this article, we propose a multiscale adaptive-switch random forest (MARF) to overcome these two challenges. First, the adaptive-switch decision tree is designed to use noise-sensitive features to conduct weighted classification and noise-invariant features to conduct binary classification, which makes our detector perform more robust to noise. Second, considering the multiscale property that the sparsity of the 2-D point cloud is proportional to the length of laser beams, we design a multiscale random forest structure to detect legs at different distances. Moreover, the proposed approach allows us to discover a sparser human leg from point clouds than others. Consequently, our method shows an improved performance compared to other state-of-the-art leg detectors on the challenging Moving Legs dataset and retains the entire pipeline at a speed of 60+ FPS on low-computational laptops. Moreover, we further apply the proposed MARF to the people detection and tracking system, achieving a considerable gain in all metrics.},

  abstract     = {Model quantization can reduce the model size and computational latency, it has been successfully applied for many applications of mobile phones, embedded devices, and smart chips. Mixed-precision quantization models can match different bit precision according to the sensitivity of different layers to achieve great performance. However, it is difficult to quickly determine the quantization bit precision of each layer in deep neural networks under some constraints (for example, hardware resources, energy consumption, model size, and computational latency). In this article, a novel sequential single-path search (SSPS) method for mixed-precision model quantization is proposed, in which some given constraints are introduced to guide the searching process. A single-path search cell is proposed to combine a fully differentiable supernet, which can be optimized by gradient-based algorithms. Moreover, we sequentially determine the candidate precisions according to the selection certainties to exponentially reduce the search space and speed up the convergence of the searching process. Experiments show that our method can efficiently search the mixed-precision models for different architectures (for example, ResNet-20, 18, 34, 50, and MobileNet-V2) and datasets (for example, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and COCO) under given constraints, and our experimental results verify that SSPS significantly outperforms their uniform-precision counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Facial image-based kinship verification is a rapidly growing field in computer vision and biometrics. The key to determining whether a pair of facial images has a kin relation is to train a model that can enlarge the margin between the faces that have no kin relation while reducing the distance between faces that have a kin relation. Most existing approaches primarily exploit duplet (i.e., two input samples without cross pair) or triplet (i.e., single negative pair for each positive pair with low-order cross pair) information, omitting discriminative features from multiple negative pairs. These approaches suffer from weak generalizability, resulting in unsatisfactory performance. Inspired by human visual systems that incorporate both low-order and high-order cross-pair information from local and global perspectives, we propose to leverage high-order cross-pair features and develop a novel end-to-end deep learning model called the adaptively weighted $k$ -tuple metric network (AW $k$ -TMN). Our main contributions are three-fold. First, a novel cross-pair metric learning loss based on $k$ -tuplet loss is introduced. It naturally captures both the low-order and high-order discriminative features from multiple negative pairs. Second, an adaptively weighted scheme is formulated to better highlight hard negative examples among multiple negative pairs, leading to enhanced performance. Third, the model utilizes multiple levels of convolutional features and jointly optimizes feature and metric learning to further exploit the low-order and high-order representational power. Extensive experimental results on three popular kinship verification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed AW $k$ -TMN approach compared with several state-of-the-art approaches.

Under such settings, existing transfer evolutionary optimization (TrEO) frameworks grapple with simultaneously satisfying two important quality attributes, namely: 1) scalability against a growing number of source tasks and 2) online learning agility against sparsity of relevant sources to the target task of interest. Satisfying these attributes shall facilitate practical deployment of transfer optimization to scenarios with big task instances, while curbing the threat of negative transfer. While applications of existing algorithms are limited to tens of source tasks, in this article, we take a quantum leap forward in enabling more than two orders of magnitude scale-up in the number of tasks; that is, we efficiently handle scenarios beyond 1000 source task instances. We devise a novel TrEO framework comprising two co-evolving species for joint evolutions in the space of source knowledge and in the search space of solutions to the target problem. In particular, co-evolution enables the learned knowledge to be orchestrated on the fly, expediting convergence in the target optimization task. We have conducted an extensive series of experiments across a set of practically motivated discrete and continuous optimization examples comprising a large number of source task instances, of which only a small fraction indicate source–target relatedness. The experimental results show that not only does our proposed framework scale efficiently with a growing number of source tasks but is also effective in capturing relevant knowledge against sparsity of related sources, fulfilling the two salient features of scalability and online learning agility.},

  abstract     = {Due to the extraordinary abilities in extracting complex patterns, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performances and received increasing attention in recent years. Despite their prominent achievements, recent GNNs do not pay enough attention to discriminate nodes when determining the information sources. Some of them select information sources from all or part of neighbors without distinction, and others merely distinguish nodes according to either graph structures or node features. To solve this problem, we propose the concept of the Influence Set and design a novel general GNN framework called the graph influence network (GINN), which discriminates neighbors by evaluating their influences on targets. In GINN, both topological structures and node features of the graph are utilized to find the most influential nodes. More specifically, given a target node, we first construct its influence set from the corresponding neighbors based on the local graph structure. To this aim, the pairwise influence comparison relations are extracted from the paths and a HodgeRank-based algorithm with analytical expression is devised to estimate the neighbors’ structure influences. Then, after determining the influence set, the feature influences of nodes in the set are measured by the attention mechanism, and some task-irrelevant ones are further dislodged. Finally, only neighbor nodes that have high accessibility in structure and strong task relevance in features are chosen as the information sources. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performances over several baselines and prove the effectiveness of discriminating neighbors in graph representation learning.},

Moreover, based on the nonholonomic model, the proposed control also considers the heading angles of the agents. Thus, the maneuver controller can achieve a more natural tracking movement where the heading of the formation will align to the direction of the reference trajectory during the tracking motion. Several simulation examples are given to validate our results and demonstrate the competence for various maneuver tasks of MASs.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel version of the general regression neural network (Imp_GRNN) is developed to control a class of multiinput and multioutput (MIMO) nonlinear discrete-time (DT) systems. The improvements retain the features of the original GRNN along with a significant improvement of the control accuracy. The enhancements include developing a method to set the input-hidden weights of GRNN using the inputs recursive statistical means, introducing a new output layer and adaptable forward weighted connections from the inputs to the new layer, and suggesting an interval-type smoothing parameter to eradicate the need for selecting the parameter beforehand or adapting it online. Also, controller stability is studied using Lyapunov’s method for DT systems. The controller performance is tested with different simulation examples and compared with the original GRNN to verify its superiority over it. Also, Imp_GRNN performance is compared with an adaptive radial basis function network controller, an adaptive feedforward neural-network (NN) controller, and a proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller, where it demonstrated higher accuracy in comparison with them. In comparison with the formerly proposed control methods for MIMO DT systems, our controller is capable of producing high control accuracy while it is model free, does not require complex mathematics, has low computational complexity, and can be utilized for a wide range of DT dynamic systems. Also, it is one of the few methods that aims to improve the control system accuracy by improving the NN structure.},

First, a novel description for the dynamics, resolved in the proposed vertical frame, is proposed to facilitate further position loop controller design. Then, a radial base function neural network (RBFNN)-based adaptive control strategy is proposed, which employs a switching strategy to keep the system away from dangerous flight conditions and achieve efficient flight. The learning process of the neural network pauses, resumes, or alternates its update strategy when switching between different modes. Moreover, saturation functions and barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs) are introduced to constrain the lateral velocity within proper ranges. The closed-loop system is theoretically guaranteed to be semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded with arbitrarily small bound, based on Lyapunov techniques and hybrid system analysis. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the excellent reliability and efficiency of the proposed controller.

  abstract     = {Machine-learning solutions for pattern classification problems are nowadays widely deployed in society and industry. However, the lack of transparency and accountability of most accurate models often hinders their safe use. Thus, there is a clear need for developing explainable artificial intelligence mechanisms. There exist model-agnostic methods that summarize feature contributions, but their interpretability is limited to predictions made by black-box models. An open challenge is to develop models that have intrinsic interpretability and produce their own explanations, even for classes of models that are traditionally considered black boxes like (recurrent) neural networks. In this article, we propose a long-term cognitive network (LTCN) for interpretable pattern classification of structured data. Our method brings its own mechanism for providing explanations by quantifying the relevance of each feature in the decision process. For supporting the interpretability without affecting the performance, the model incorporates more flexibility through a quasi-nonlinear reasoning rule that allows controlling nonlinearity. Besides, we propose a recurrence-aware decision model that evades the issues posed by the unique fixed point while introducing a deterministic learning algorithm to compute the tunable parameters. The simulations show that our interpretable model obtains competitive results when compared to state-of-the-art white and black-box models.},

Combining the model-based condition with a recent data-based system representation, a data-driven stability criterion in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is established, which also offers a way of co-designing the ETS matrix and the controller. To further alleviate the sampling burden of ETS due to its continuous/periodic detection, a self-triggering scheme (STS) is developed. Leveraging precollected input-state data, an algorithm for predicting the next transmission instant is given, while achieving system stability. Finally, numerical simulations showcase the efficacy of ETS and STS in reducing data transmissions as well as practicality of the proposed co-design methods.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies on heterogeneous information network (HIN) embedding-based recommendations have encountered challenges. These challenges are related to the data heterogeneity of the associated unstructured attribute or content (e.g., text-based summary/description) of users and items in the context of HIN. In order to address these challenges, in this article, we propose a novel approach of semantic-aware HIN embedding-based recommendation, called SemHE4Rec. In our proposed SemHE4Rec model, we define two embedding techniques for efficiently learning the representations of both users and items in the context of HIN. These rich-structural user and item representations are then used to facilitate the matrix factorization (MF) process. The first embedding technique is a traditional co-occurrence representation learning (CoRL) approach which aims to learn the co-occurrence of structural features of users and items. These structural features are represented for their interconnections in terms of meta-paths. In order to do that, we adopt the well-known meta-path-based random walk strategy and heterogeneous Skip-gram architecture. The second embedding approach is a semantic-aware representation learning (SRL) method. The SRL embedding technique is designed to focus on capturing the unstructured semantic relations between users and item content for the recommendation task. Finally, all the learned representations of users and items are then jointly combined and optimized while integrating with the extended MF for the recommendation task. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SemHE4Rec in comparison with the recent state-of-the-art HIN embedding-based recommendation techniques, and reveal that the joint text-based and co-occurrence-based representation learning can help to improve the recommendation performance.},

A predefined-time bipartite consensus tracking framework is developed, where both cooperative communication and adversarial communication among neighbor agents are implemented. Different from the finite-time and the fixed-time controller design methods for MASs, the prominent advantage of the controller design algorithm presented in this work is that our algorithm can make the followers track either the output or the opposite output of the leader within the predefined time in accordance to the user requirements. In order to obtain the desired control performance, an improved time-varying nonlinear transformed function is skillfully introduced for the first time to handle the asymmetric full-state constraints and radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs) are employed to deal with the unknown nonlinear functions. Then, the predefined-time adaptive neural virtual control laws are constructed by using the backstepping technique, while their derivatives are estimated by the first-order sliding-mode differentiators. It is theoretically testified that the proposed control algorithm not only guarantees the bipartite consensus tracking performance of the constrained nonlinear MASs in the predefined time but also remains the boundedness of all the resulting closed-loop signals. Finally, the simulation research on a practical example shows the validity of the presented control algorithm.},

Sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are given to guarantee the GES a.s., even though both synchronizing and nonsynchronizing modes coexist and maybe the minimum DT of synchronizing modes is very small.

The fundamental design philosophy is to develop a hierarchical algorithm based on shortest route technology that recasts the bipartite consensus tracking problem for MASs into the tracking problem for a single agent and eliminates the need for any global information of the Laplacian matrix. As the sensors suffer from malicious deception attacks, the states cannot be measured accurately, we thus construct a novel dynamic estimator to estimate the actual states, which, together with a new coordinate transformation involving the attacked and estimated state variables, allows a distributed security control scheme to be developed, in which the singularity of the adaptive iterative process involved in existing works is completely avoided. Furthermore, the Nussbaum functions are included in the controller to account for the influence of the unknown control gains caused by sensor deception attacks. It is shown that the distributed consensus tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin, and all the signals in the closed-loop system remain bounded. Simulation on a forced damped pendulums (FDPs) is conducted to demonstrate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

First, a new practical robust fixed-time sliding-mode control method based on the time-based generator is proposed. Second, two fixed-time distributed consensus tracking observers for double-integrator-type multiagent systems are designed to estimate the state disagreement between the leader and the followers under undirected and directed communication, respectively. Third, a fixed-time distributed average tracking observer for double-integrator-type multiagent systems is designed to measure the average value of multiple reference signals under undirected communication. Note that all the proposed observers are constructed with time-based generators and can be trivially extended to that for high-order integrator-type multiagent systems. Furthermore, by combining the proposed fixed-time sliding-mode control method with the information provided by the fixed-time observers, the fixed-time controllers are designed to solve the fixed-time distributed consensus tracking and the distributed average tracking problems.

  abstract     = {Nonsmooth nonlinear systems can model many practical processes with discontinuous property and are difficult to be stabilized by classical control methods like smooth nonlinear systems. This article considers the output-feedback adaptive neural network (NN) control problem for nonsmooth nonlinear systems with input deadzone and saturation. First, the nonsmooth input deadzone and saturation is converted to a smooth function of affine form with bounded estimation error by means of the mean-value theorem. Second, with the help of approximation theorem and Filippov’s differential inclusion theory, the given nonsmooth system is converted to an equivalent smooth system model. Then, by introducing a proper logarithmic barrier Lyapunov function (BLF), an output-feedback adaptive NN strategy is set up by constructing an appropriate observer and adopting the adaptive backstepping technique. A new stability criterion is established to guarantee that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Finally, comparative simulations through Chua’s oscillator are offered to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.},

Therefore, this article proposes a novel quantitative evaluation metric for AVs’ chassis-domain performance. We reveal mathematically explicit chassis steady boundaries of various vehicle maneuvers based on the modeling of chassis-domain dynamics and vehicle spatiotemporal signal analysis for safety-critical AVs. By defining and analyzing the multiperformance appraisal problem, this article gives mathematically prerequisites for evaluation metrics. Then, a rigorous metric is developed to quantify AVs’ safety and comfort performance comprehensively. Wherein, the steady boundaries are leveraged to the metric normalization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed quantitative evaluation methodology in various scenarios. Test results illustrate that the proposed method provides a quantitative way to test AVs’ integrated dynamics performance.},

Due to the existence of the unknown inherent nonlinear dynamics and the undetectable actuation faults, the resultant control gain of the system becomes unknown and time varying, making the control impact on the system uncertain and the prescribed-time control synthesis nontrivial. The underlying problem becomes further complex as the switching is arbitrary and unknown. To circumvent the aforementioned difficulties, the following major steps are employed. First, by integrating a novel time-varying feedback gain and performance function into the control synthesis, the nonvanishing uncertainties are completely rejected and the transient performance is guaranteed. Second, to facilitate the stability analysis under arbitrarily switching, the concept of the constraining function is introduced and incorporated into a skillfully chosen common Lyapunov function. Third, to deal with the uncertain control gain, a new Nussbaum-related lemma is derived. The proposed control is shown to be capable of ensuring that the tracking error not only evolves within the prescribed bound during all the operation time but also converges to zero at the rate of convergence that can be preassigned as fast as desired, in the presence of self-switching dynamics and unknown control directions. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, most existing SAEAs only focus on the problems with low dimensionality and they rarely consider solving large-scale EOPs (LSEOPs). To fill this research gap, this article proposes an ensemble surrogate-based coevolutionary optimizer for tackling LSEOPs. First, some local surrogate models are trained with low-dimensional data subsets by using feature selection on the large-scale decision variables, a part of which are used to build a selective ensemble surrogate for better approximating the target LSEOP. Then, a coevolutionary optimizer guided by the ensemble surrogate is designed by running two populations to cooperatively solve the target LSEOP and the simplified auxiliary problem. The information of offspring from the two populations is shared to facilitate the coevolution process, which can exploit the searching experience from the simplified auxiliary problem to help solving the target LSEOP. Finally, an effective infill selection criterion is used to update the ensemble surrogate and enhance its approximate performance. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, a number of well-known benchmark problems are used and the experimental results validate our superior performance over nine state-of-the-art SAEAs on most cases.},

To solve these problems, a conveniently distributed diffusion least-mean-square (DLMS) algorithm with cross-verification (CV) is proposed against FDI attacks. The proposed DLMS with CV (DLMS-CV) algorithm is comprised of two subsystems: one subsystem provides a detection test of agents based on the CV mechanism, while the other provides a secure distribution estimation. In the CV mechanism, a smoothness strategy is introduced, which can improve the detection performance. The convergence performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed, and then the design method of the adaptive threshold is also formulated. In particular, the probabilities of missing alarm and false alarm are examined, and they decay exponentially to zero under sufficiently small step size. Finally, simulation experiments are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and simplicity of the proposed DLMS-CV algorithm in comparison to other algorithms against FDI attacks.},

  abstract     = {Clinically, retinal vessel segmentation is a significant step in the diagnosis of fundus diseases. However, recent methods generally neglect the difference of semantic information between deep and shallow features, which fail to capture the global and local characterizations in fundus images simultaneously, resulting in the limited segmentation performance for fine vessels. In this article, a global transformer (GT) and dual local attention (DLA) network via deep-shallow hierarchical feature fusion (GT-DLA-dsHFF) are investigated to solve the above limitations. First, the GT is developed to integrate the global information in the retinal image, which effectively captures the long-distance dependence between pixels, alleviating the discontinuity of blood vessels in the segmentation results. Second, DLA, which is constructed using dilated convolutions with varied dilation rates, unsupervised edge detection, and squeeze-excitation block, is proposed to extract local vessel information, consolidating the edge details in the segmentation result. Finally, a novel deep-shallow hierarchical feature fusion (dsHFF) algorithm is studied to fuse the features in different scales in the deep learning framework, respectively, which can mitigate the attenuation of valid information in the process of feature fusion. We verified the GT-DLA-dsHFF on four typical fundus image datasets. The experimental results demonstrate our GT-DLA-dsHFF achieves superior performance against the current methods and detailed discussions verify the efficacy of the proposed three modules. Segmentation results of diseased images show the robustness of our proposed GT-DLA-dsHFF. Implementation codes will be available on https://github.com/YangLibuaa/GT-DLA-dsHFF .},

  abstract     = {In this article, two boundary feedback controllers are designed via the backstepping approach for a class of gantry crane systems. To provide an accurate and concise representation of the dynamic behavior, the gantry crane with a flexible cable is described by a hybrid system. The hybrid system is formed by an ordinary differential equation coupled with a partial differential equation. In the first control strategy, a backstepping-based boundary state-feedback controller is proposed for the gantry crane to transport a payload to an expected position with less shaking. In the second control strategy, a boundary output-feedback controller is explored with an observer estimating the inaccessible states. By using the backstepping technique and kernel functions, the original systems with different control strategies are transformed into target systems. By using the operator semigroup and Lyapunov stability theories, the target system is proven to be well-posed and exponentially stable, respectively. Finally, numerical simulations and comparisons are provided to illustrate the efficiency and the advantages of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of services computing in the past decade, Quality-of-Service (QoS)-aware selection of Web services has become a hot yet thorny issue. Conducting warming-up tests on a large set of candidate services for QoS evaluation is time consuming and expensive, making it vital to implement accurate QoS-estimators. Existing QoS-estimators barely consider the temporal patterns hidden in QoS data. However, such data are naturally time dependent. For addressing this critical issue, this study presents a Kalman-filter-incorporated latent factor analysis (KLFA)-based QoS-estimator for accurate representation to temporally dynamic QoS data. Its main idea is to make the user latent features (LFs) time dependent, while the service ones time consistent. A novel iterative training scheme is designed, where the user LFs are learned through a Kalman filter for precisely modeling the temporal patterns, and the service ones are alternatively trained via an alternating least squares algorithm for precisely representing the historical QoS data. Empirical studies on large-scale and real Web service QoS datasets demonstrate that the proposed KLFA model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art QoS-estimators in estimation accuracy for dynamic QoS data.},

First, a multi-instant gain-scheduling mechanism with a single adjustable parameter is given for the first time in order to produce more reasonable switch modes over previous results reported in recent literature. Second, for every switch mode, a batch of specified observer gain matrices is determined by developing an efficient balanced matrix approach so that the updated values of adjacent normalized fuzzy weighting functions can be flexibly exploited. Since the implied information of each specific switch mode is capable of being absorbed and utilized more thoroughly by the aid of the refined higher-order balanced matrices, the conservatism can be prominently reduced at the price of consuming extra computational burden within the allowable range.

The computational cost of analyzing the SA of high-dimensional data is high, and models available for SA techniques usually have limited generalization capacity. Therefore, we propose a novel high-dimensional data global SA (GSA) approach based on a deep soft sensor model to address these issues. We first develop an approximately incremental grouping (AIG) algorithm and a region-based cooperative co-evolution (RBCC) algorithm to decompose the high-dimensional data into independent regions for the GSA. Subsequently, a multihead deep soft sensor model with generalization performance is designed to determine the GSA indices of each decomposed region. Specifically, the region of interest (RoI) align algorithm provides the multihead with precisely located decomposed region features. Finally, based on the uncertainty analysis of each model head, we present a joint loss function with the Monte Carlo dropout (MC-dropout) algorithm to measure the GSA indices of each decomposed region on QoIs. Experimental evaluation results on a benchmark dataset and a real-world one demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in addressing the GSA of high-dimensional data in industrial processes.},

Besides, for economizing the communication times, an innovative 2-D AETM is constructed, which can dynamically regulate the event-triggered thresholds to strive for better system performance. Then, by utilizing the 2-D Lyapunov stability theory, nonlinear matrix inequalities are built to ensure the asymptotic mean-square stability with an $H_{\infty }$ performance for the closed-loop 2-D system. To avoid introducing any conservatism when handling the above nonlinear matrix inequalities, a binary-based genetic algorithm (BGA) is exploited to treat some variables as known, such that derive some directly solvable linear matrix inequalities.

However, tremendous and unsynchronized data from agricultural cyber–physical systems bring large computational costs as well as complicate performing conventional machine learning methods. To precisely estimate evapotranspiration with acceptable computational costs under the background of IoT, we combine time granulation computing techniques and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) with Bayesian optimization (BO) to propose a hybrid machine learning approach. In the combination, a fuzzy granulation method and a time calibration technique are introduced to break voluminous and unsynchronized data into small-scale and synchronized granules with high representativeness. Subsequently, GBDT is implemented to predict evapotranspiration, and BO is utilized to find the optimal hyperparameter values from the reduced granules. IoT data from Xi’an Fruit Technology Promotion Center in Shaanxi Province, China, verify that the proposed granular-GBDT-BO is effective for cherry tree evapotranspiration estimation with reduced computational time, and acceptable and robust predictive accuracy. Consequently, the precise estimation of crop evapotranspiration could provide operational guidance for plant irrigation, plant conservations, and pest control in the agricultural greenhouse.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic object perception is an important yet challenging direction in the field of robot navigation. Without any prior knowledge about motion and objects, a novel dynamic rigid bodies mining and motion estimation method based on monocular camera is proposed in this article. Different from the existing works based on sampling that associate feature points to motion hypotheses according to the reprojection errors, our work endeavors to find the intrinsic relevance among motion hypotheses. To represent this relevance, the concept of the probabilistic field on the Lie group Sim(3) manifold is introduced, which is established using random sampling. It provides a computable way for the regions on the manifold where rigid bodies possibly appear. The probability of a motion hypothesis falling on a region is expressed by its confidence. The regions with large confidences in the probabilistic field are selected as potential rigid bodies, whose corresponding feature points are further sampled for pose calculation. As a result, the randomness of sampling is reduced and the inliers for possible rigid bodies are enhanced, which guarantees the accuracy of motion estimation. On this basis, the tracking of rigid bodies is achieved. The proposed method distinguishes the feature points of dynamic objects with 3-D motion from those in the static background, thus enabling simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) to be initialized in dynamic environments. The experimental results on the KITTI, Hopkins 155, and MTPV62 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness. Comparison experiments indicate that our method outperforms the other methods in sensitivity of dynamic objects perception.},

  abstract     = {Partial domain adaptation (PDA) attempts to learn transferable models from a large-scale labeled source domain to a small unlabeled target domain with fewer classes, which has attracted a recent surge of interest in transfer learning. Most conventional PDA approaches endeavor to design delicate source weighting schemes by leveraging target predictions to align cross-domain distributions in the shared class space. Accordingly, two crucial issues are overlooked in these methods. First, target prediction is a double-edged sword, and inaccurate predictions will result in negative transfer inevitably. Second, not all target samples have equal transferability during the adaptation; thus, “ambiguous” target data predicted with high uncertainty should be paid more attentions. In this article, we propose a critical classes and samples discovering network (CSDN) to identify the most relevant source classes and critical target samples, such that more precise cross-domain alignment in the shared label space could be enforced by co-training two diverse classifiers. Specifically, during the training process, CSDN introduces an adaptive source class weighting scheme to select the most relevant classes dynamically. Meanwhile, based on the designed target ambiguous score, CSDN emphasizes more on ambiguous target samples with larger inconsistent predictions to enable fine-grained alignment. Taking a step further, the weighting schemes in CSDN can be easily coupled with other PDA and DA methods to further boost their performance, thereby demonstrating its flexibility. Extensive experiments verify that CSDN attains excellent results compared to state of the arts on four highly competitive benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have attracted increasing research attention, which merits in its strong ability to handle graph data, such as the citation network or social network. Existing models typically use first-order neighborhood information to design specific convolution operations, which aggregate the features of all adjacent nodes. However, such models ignore the high-order spatial relationship among neighboring nodes in noisy data due to its modeling complexity. In this article, we propose a novel robust graph relational network to address this issue toward modeling high-order relationships in noisy data for graph convolution. Our key innovation lies in designing a generic relation network layer, which is used to infer the underlying relations among adjacent noisy nodes. Specifically, a fixed number of adjacent nodes for each node is chosen by solving the ridge regression problem, in which the regression coefficients are used to rank the adjacent nodes of each node in a graph. Furthermore, to mine the rich features, we extract high-order information from the nodes to significantly enhance the representation ability of the GCNs for extensive applications. We conduct extensive semisupervised node classification experiments on the noisy benchmark datasets, which clearly show that our model is superior to the existing methods and can achieve state-of-the-art performance.},

The proposed DETS uses both the current and past samples to determine the next trigger, unlike the traditional event-triggered scheme (ETS) that uses only the current sample. The proposed DETS is employed in a dual setup for two network channels to significantly reduce redundant data transmission. A DOFC is designed to achieve the synchronization of the NNs. Stability criteria of the synchronisation error system are derived based on the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method, and the co-design of the DOFC and DETS parameters are accomplished using the Cone-complementarity linearization (CCL) approach.

Recently, 2-D feature selection methods show good performance on image analysis by utilizing the structure information of image. Current 2-D methods usually adopt a sparse regularization to spotlight the key features. However, such scheme introduces additional hyperparameter needed for pruning, limiting the applicability of unsupervised algorithms. To overcome these challenges, we design a feature filter to estimate the weight of image features for unsupervised feature selection. Theoretical analysis shows that a sparse regularization can be derived from the feature filter by transformation, indicating that the filter plays the same role as the popular sparse regularization does. We deploy two distinct strategies in terms of feature selection, called multiple feature filters and single common feature filter. The former divides the optimization problem into multiple independent subproblems and selects features that meet the respective interests of each subproblem. The latter selects features that are in the interest of the overall optimization problem. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show that our unsupervised 2-D weight-based feature selection methods achieve superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods.},

FDES can be used to describe a large class of practical systems that consist of fuzzy discrete states, fuzzy discrete events, and transitions among fuzzy discrete states via fuzzy discrete events. Because fuzzy discrete states, fuzzy discrete events, and fuzzy transitions are well defined in FDES, the FDES model is highly explainable, which is important in many applications, especially in biomedical applications. Based on this explainable model, the proposed learning algorithm can be used to learn events and event sequences in the model. Hence, it allows system developers to build an explainable model for a complex system based on the data available.

However, containing both noisy and clean links, the observed network cannot be treated as a trustworthy information source for supervised learning. Therefore, it is necessary but also technically challenging to detect noisy links in the context of data contamination. To address this issue, in the present article, a two-phased computational model is proposed, called link-information augmented twin autoencoders, which is able to deal with: 1) link information augmentation; 2) link-level contrastive denoising; 3) link information correction. Extensive experiments on six real-world networks verify that the proposed model outperforms other comparable methods in removing noisy links from the observed network so as to recover the real network from the corrupted one very accurately. Extended analyses also provide interpretable evidence to support the superiority of the proposed model for the task of network denoising.},

In this event-triggered strategy, two stability-related conditions are checked in a parallel manner, which relaxes the requirement of the decrease of the Lyapunov function. An open-loop prediction scheme to avoid periodic transmission is designed for the states in the terminal set. As a result, the number of triggering and transmission instants can be reduced significantly.

Different from existing works on prescribed performance control (PPC), the present method can relax the restriction that the initial value must be given within a predefined region, say, PPC semiglobally. In the case that the upper bound functions for nonlinear time-delay functions are unknown, based on the approximate capacity of fuzzy-logic systems, an adaptive fuzzy approximation control strategy is proposed. When the upper bound functions are known in prior, or in a product form with unknown parameters and known functions, an output-feedback tracking controller is designed, under which the closed-loop signals are globally ultimately uniformly bounded, and tracking control with global prescribed performance can be achieved.

Through analyzing the monotonicity, stability, and convergency properties of the obtained iterative value functions and control laws, it is proved that the IADP and EIADP algorithms both converge to the optimal impulsive performance index function.

As the characteristics of these constraints are not considered in existing scheduling algorithms, schedules generated by most existing approaches are not optimal or even conflict with these constraints. In this article, a self-organizing neural scheduler (SoNS) is proposed to overcome this limitation. A long short-term memory encoder is developed to transform the variable-length structural information into fixed-length feature vectors. Moreover, the reinforcement learning model is proposed to automatically select policies for improving candidate schedules. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments are conducted on over 300 problem instances. The nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis tests confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness and robustness within a limited computational budget.

In the existing work, self-supervised learning via a single view model is widely adopted to address the problem. However, recent observation shows multiview representations of an object share the same semantic information in high-level feature space. For each sample, we generate heterogeneous representations and use view-consistency loss to make their representations consistent with each other. Multiview representation also inspires to supervise the pseudolabels generation by the aid of mutual supervision between views. In this article, we thus propose a view-consistent heterogeneous network (VCHN) to learn better representations by aligning view-agnostic semantics. Specifically, VCHN is constructed by constraining the predictions between two views so that the view pairs can supervise each other. To make the best use of cross-view information, we further propose a novel training strategy to generate more reliable pseudolabels, which thus enhances predictions of the VCHN. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods under very low label rates.},

The traditional anti-collusion methods (which aim to trace the traitors) can defend the collusion attack, but they cannot well defend some hybrid collusion attacks (e.g., a collusion attack combined with desynchronization attacks). To address this issue, we propose a frequency spectrum modification process (FSMP) to defend the collusion attack by significantly downgrading the perceptual quality of the colluded file. The severe perceptual quality degradation can demotivate the attackers from launching the collusion attack. Because FSMP is orthogonal to the existing traitor-trace-based methods, it can be combined with the existing methods to provide a double-layer protection against different attacks. In FSMP, after several signal processing procedures (e.g., uneven framing and smoothing), multiple signals (called FSMP signals) can be generated from the host signal. Launching collusion attack using the generated FSMP signals would lead to the energy disturbance and attenuation effect (EDAE) over the colluded signals. Due to the EDAE, FSMP can significantly degrade the perceptual quality of the colluded audio file, thereby thwarting the collusion attack. In addition, FSMP can well defend different hybrid collusion attacks. Theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm the validity of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {One of the important issues associated with real-life high-dimensional data analysis is how to extract significant and relevant features from multiview data. The multiset canonical correlation analysis (MCCA) is a well-known statistical method for multiview data integration. It finds a linear subspace that maximizes the correlations among different views. However, the existing methods to find the multiset canonical variables are computationally very expensive, which restricts the application of the MCCA in real-life big data analysis. The covariance matrix of each high-dimensional view may also suffer from the singularity problem due to the limited number of samples. Moreover, the MCCA-based existing feature extraction algorithms are, in general, unsupervised in nature. In this regard, a new supervised feature extraction algorithm is proposed, which integrates multimodal multidimensional data sets by solving maximal correlation problem of the MCCA. A new block matrix representation is introduced to reduce the computational complexity for computing the canonical variables of the MCCA. The analytical formulation enables efficient computation of the multiset canonical variables under supervised ridge regression optimization technique. It deals with the “curse of dimensionality” problem associated with high-dimensional data and facilitates the sequential generation of relevant features with significantly lower computational cost. The effectiveness of the proposed multiblock data integration algorithm, along with a comparison with other existing methods, is demonstrated on several benchmark and real-life cancer data.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate distributed consensus seeking with multiple convergence performance requirements for single-integrator multiagent systems under undirected graphs. A unified distributed control framework is proposed to ensure consensus or practical consensus as well as performance time requirements, which contains most existing complex protocol schemes as special cases. In the proposed framework, three functions with specific properties in the controller play different roles and can be freely designed to achieve desired convergence performances, which guarantee a high-level scalability for multiple control requirements in addition to convergence time. For highlighting the compatibility and flexibility of the proposed method, four typical scenarios are discussed to reach exponential, finite-time, fixed-time, and appointed-time consensus seeking, respectively. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Detecting overlapping communities of an attribute network is a ubiquitous yet very difficult task, which can be modeled as a discrete optimization problem. Besides the topological structure of the network, node attributes and node overlapping aggravate the difficulty of community detection significantly. In this article, we propose a novel continuous encoding method to convert the discrete-natured detection problem to a continuous one by associating each edge and node attribute in the network with a continuous variable. Based on the encoding, we propose to solve the converted continuous problem by a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) based on decomposition. To find the overlapping nodes, a heuristic based on double-decoding is proposed, which is only with linear complexity. Furthermore, a postprocess community merging method in consideration of node attributes is developed to enhance the homogeneity of nodes in the detected communities. Various synthetic and real-world networks are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The experimental results show that the proposed approach performs significantly better than a variety of evolutionary and nonevolutionary methods on most of the benchmark networks.},

First, the discrete-state decomposition technique is proposed after performing the restricted equivalent transformation for singular systems. To reduce the use of decision variables, the state-decomposed Lyapunov function is established based on the decomposed state vectors. Second, to obtain the condition with less conservatism, the two zero-value equations, especially concerning difference subsystems and algebraic ones, the discrete Wirtinger-based inequality and the extended reciprocally convex inequality are employed to bound the forward difference of the Lyapunov function. Then, the less conservative dissipativity criteria with lower computational complexity are obtained.

  abstract     = {Single-image haze removal is challenging due to its ill-posed nature. The breadth of real-world scenarios makes it difficult to find an optimal dehazing approach that works well for various applications. This article addresses this challenge by utilizing a novel robust quaternion neural network architecture for single-image dehazing applications. The architecture’s performance to dehaze images and its impact on real applications, such as object detection, is presented. The proposed single-image dehazing network is based on an encoder-decoder architecture capable of taking advantage of quaternion image representation without interrupting the quaternion dataflow end-to-end. We achieve this by introducing a novel quaternion pixel-wise loss function and quaternion instance normalization layer. The performance of the proposed QCNN-H quaternion framework is evaluated on two synthetic datasets, two real-world datasets, and one real-world task-oriented benchmark. Extensive experiments confirm that the QCNN-H outperforms state-of-the-art haze removal procedures in visual quality and quantitative metrics. Furthermore, the evaluation shows increased accuracy and recall of state-of-the-art object detection in hazy scenes using the presented QCNN-H method. This is the first time the quaternion convolutional network has been applied to the haze removal task.},

  abstract     = {Due to the existence of different stakeholders, it makes competitive game characteristic in hybrid energy systems (HESs). Combined with the high-dimensional complexity and output uncertainty of distributed energy resources, the optimal operation of HESs can be a more challenging problem. Here, this article proposes a potential game-based two-layered hierarchical optimization strategy to deal with this problem. With consideration of its high-dimensional complexity, a two-layered hierarchical HES model is created, consisting of an upper-level and a lower-level model. For properly solving competitive relationships among different stakeholders in the upper-level model, a multiagent system for stakeholders is created and a potential game is employed with a distributed primal–dual perturbed algorithm, and its convergence and optimality have been both proved. Moreover, an uncertainty and robustness analysis is done with coordination between lower and upper models, which deduces a feasible robust uncertainty interval in the lower-level model. For better dealing with the lower-level model, a gradient descent-based multiobjective differential evolution (GD-MODE) algorithm is utilized to optimize the economic cost and emission issue simultaneously, producing a set of Pareto-optimal schemes. Combined with simulation results, it is proven that the proposed method can reduce computational complexity as well as properly deal with uncertainty problems for the optimal operation of HESs.},

Therefore, we offer to process the accessible and available control code into a GT-based learning framework which is subsequently optimized in a fully distributed manner. To this end, we employ the recently developed framework of state-based potential games (PGs) and prove that under mild conditions PLC-informed (PLCi) learning forms a state-based PG framework. We conduct the experiment on a laboratory scale testbed in numerous production scenarios. The experiment’s results highlight the major potential of using the PLCi GT-learning, which is the reduction of energy consumption of the production timescales and improvement of production efficiency while nearly halven the learning times.},

  abstract     = {A visible trend in representing knowledge through information granules manifests in the developments of information granules of higher type and higher order, in particular, type-2 fuzzy sets and order-2 fuzzy sets. All these constructs are aimed at the formalization and processing data at a certain level of abstraction. Along the same line, in the recent years, we have seen intensive developments in fuzzy clustering, which are not surprising in light of a growing impact of clustering on fundamentals of fuzzy sets (as supporting ways to elicit membership functions) as well as algorithms (in which clustering and clusters form an integral functional component of various fuzzy models). In this study, we investigate order-2 information granules (fuzzy sets) by analyzing their formal description and properties to cope with structural and hierarchically organized concepts emerging from data. The design of order-2 information granules on a basis of available experimental evidence is discussed and a way of expressing similarity (resemblance) of two order-2 information granules by engaging semantically oriented distance is discussed. In the sequel, the study reported here delivers highly original contributions in the realm of order-2 clustering algorithms. Formally, the clustering problem under discussion is posed as follows: given is a finite collection of reference information granules. Determine a structure in data defined over the space of such granules. Conceptually, this makes a radical shift in comparison with data defined in the ${p}$ -dimensional space of real numbers Rp. In this situation, expressing distance between two data deserves prudent treatment so that such distance properly captures the semantics and consequently, the closeness between any two information granules to be determined in cluster formation. Following the proposal of the semantically guided distance (and its ensuing design process), we develop an order-2 variant of the fuzzy C-means (FCM), discuss its detailed algorithmic steps, and deliver interpretation of the obtained clustering results. Several relevant applied scenarios of order-2 FCM are identified for spatially and temporally distributed data, which deliver interesting motivating arguments and underline the practical relevance of this category of clustering. Experimental studies are provided to further elicit the performance of the clustering method and discuss essential ways of interpreting results.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic point location (SPL) involves a learning mechanism (LM) determining an optimal point on the line when the only inputs LM receives are stochastic information about the direction in which LM should move. The complexity of SPL comes from the stochastic responses of the environment, which may lead LM completely astray. SPL is a fundamental problem in optimization and was studied by many researchers during the last two decades, including improvement of its solution and all-pervasive applications. However, all existing SPL studies assume that the whole search space contains only one optimal point. Since a multimodal optimization problem (MMOP) contains multiple optimal solutions, it is significant to develop SPL’s multimodal version. This article extends it from a unimodal problem to a multimodal one and proposes a parallel partition search (PPS) solution to address this issue. The heart of the proposed solution involves extracting the feature of the historical sampling information to distinguish the subintervals that contain the optimal points or not. Specifically, it divides the whole search space into multiple subintervals and samples them parallelly, then utilizes the feature of the historical sampling information to adjust the subintervals adaptively and to find the subintervals containing the optimal points. Finally, the optimal points are located within these subintervals according to their respective sampling statistics. The proof of the $\epsilon $ -optimal property for the proposed solution is presented. The numerical testing results demonstrate the power of the scheme.},

Therefore, accurate process monitoring is very important for thermal power plants. The vigorous nature of the production process requires dynamic algorithms for monitoring. Since the common dynamic algorithm is mainly based on data expansion, the online computing complexity is too high because of data redundancy. Accordingly, this article proposes an innovative, dynamic process monitoring algorithm called autocorrelation feature analysis (AFA). AFA mines the dynamic information of continuous samples by calculating the correlation between the current time and past time features. While improving the monitoring effect, the AFA algorithm also has extremely low online computational complexity, even lower than common static algorithms, such as principal component analysis. Furthermore, this study exhibits the general form of dynamic additive faults for the first time and verifies the reliability of the algorithm through fault detectability analysis. Conclusively, the superiority of the AFA algorithm is verified on a numerical example, continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR), and real data measured from a 1000-MW ultrasupercritical thermal power plant.},

As users visit items in chronological order, existing methods typically capture a user’s present interests from his/her past-to-present behaviors, i.e., making recommendations with only the unidirectional past information. This article argues that future information is another critical factor for the sequential recommendation. However, directly learning from future-to-present behaviors inevitably causes data leakage. Here, it is pointed out that future information can be learned from users’ collaborative behaviors. Toward this end, this article introduces sequential graphs to depict item transition relationships: where and how each item transits from and will transit to. This temporal evolution information is called the light cone in special and general relativity. Then, a bidirectional sequential graph convolutional network (BiSGCN) is proposed to learn item representations by encoding past and future light cones. Finally, a manifold translating embedding (MTE) method is proposed to model item transition patterns in Riemannian manifolds, which helps to better capture the geometric structures of light cones and item transition patterns. Experimental comparisons and ablation studies verify the outstanding performance of BiSGCN, the benefits of learning from the future, and the improvements of learning in Riemannian manifolds.},

Different from most of the existing ETMs, the proposed SWI-based ETM leverages historical information to determine which data are necessary for the whole control system. Our approach can greatly reduce the number of unexpected triggering events of a control system with stochastic disturbances owing to the introduction of the SWI in the ETM. Moreover, Zeno phenomena are prevented thanks to periodic sampling. Sufficient conditions are derived based on the Lyapunov functional approach, and a numerical simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural network has shown a powerful performance in the medical image analysis of a variety of diseases. However, a number of studies over the past few years have demonstrated that these deep learning systems can be vulnerable to well-designed adversarial attacks, with minor disruptions added to the input. Since both the public and academia have focused on deep learning in the health information economy, these adversarial attacks would prove more important and raise security concerns. In this article, adversarial attacks on deep learning systems in medicine are analyzed from two different points of view: 1) white box and 2) black box. A fast adversarial sample generation method, Feature Space-Restricted Attention Attack is proposed to explore more confusing adversarial samples. It is based on a generative adversarial network with bound classification space to generate perturbations to achieve attacks. Meanwhile, it can employ an attention mechanism to focus this perturbation on the lesion region. This enables the perturbation closely associated with the classification information making the attack more efficient and invisible. The performance and specificity of the proposed attack method are demonstrated by conducting extensive experiments on three different types of medical images. Finally, it is expected that this work can assist practitioners become being of current weaknesses in the deployment of deep learning systems in clinical settings. And, it further investigates domain-specific features of medical deep learning systems to enhance model generalization and resistance to attacks.},

Next, a novel continuous and nonsingular PPT consensus control law is designed on the basis of the observers. Furthermore, the designed control protocol can achieve PPT stability, that is, consensus tracking errors are enforced to a neighborhood around zero within a predetermined time, which can be specified a priori , independent of initial states of agents and/or any other design parameters.

An adaptive dynamic event-triggered scheme is proposed to avoid continuous communication between followers, removing the assumption that global information should be known for controller design. Different from the existing open-loop estimation method for obtaining intermittent communication, the approach proposed in this article does not require that the system matrices of all agents be the same and known a prior. Compared with the existing static or periodic event-triggered mechanism (ETM), by introducing dynamic variables, a more general form than an exponential function, the proposed adaptive dynamic event-triggered condition provides the potential to save energy and obtain better performance. It is demonstrated that the suggested event-triggered control (ETC) method performs cooperative fault-tolerant output regulation for all followers in a completely distributed way with intermittent communication while excluding Zeno behavior.

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) has received significant attention since the use of a well-selected subset of features may achieve better classification performance than that of full features in many real-world applications. It can be considered as a multiobjective optimization consisting of two objectives: 1) minimizing the number of selected features and 2) maximizing classification performance. Ant colony optimization (ACO) has shown its effectiveness in FS due to its problem-guided search operator and flexible graph representation. However, there lacks an effective ACO-based approach for multiobjective FS to handle the problematic characteristics originated from the feature interactions and highly discontinuous Pareto fronts. This article presents an Information-theory-based Nondominated Sorting ACO (called INSA) to solve the aforementioned difficulties. First, the probabilistic function in ACO is modified based on the information theory to identify the importance of features; second, a new ACO strategy is designed to construct solutions; and third, a novel pheromone updating strategy is devised to ensure the high diversity of tradeoff solutions. INSA’s performance is compared with four machine-learning-based methods, four representative single-objective evolutionary algorithms, and six state-of-the-art multiobjective ones on 13 benchmark classification datasets, which consist of both low and high-dimensional samples. The empirical results verify that INSA is able to obtain solutions with better classification performance using features whose count is similar to or less than those obtained by its peers.},

In such systems, a decreasing gain sequence is necessary to ensure the asymptotic convergence of the generated input sequence to a fixed limit. However, the convergence speed is adversely affected by gain sequences of this nature. In this article, we propose a novel multistage learning control strategy to resolve this conflict, where each stage consists of several iterations. The learning gain remains constant in each stage but is reduced at the transition from a given stage to the subsequent stage. The switching iteration between two stages is determined by the tracking performance index of the contracted input error and the accumulated noise drift. Furthermore, an improved mechanism is proposed to optimize the lengths of the different stages. The asymptotic convergence of the input sequence generated by the newly proposed strategy is strictly established by thoroughly analyzing the properties of the proposed gain sequence. Numerical simulations are presented to verify the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral band selection aims to identify an optimal subset of bands for hyperspectral images (HSIs). For most existing clustering-based band selection methods, they directly stretch each band into a single feature vector and employ the pixelwise features to address band redundancy. In this way, they do not take full consideration of the spatial information and deal with the importance of different regions in HSIs, which leads to a nonoptimal selection. To address these issues, a region-aware hierarchical latent feature representation learning-guided clustering (HLFC) method is proposed. Specifically, in order to fully preserve the spatial information of HSIs, the superpixel segmentation algorithm is adopted to segment HSIs into multiple regions first. For each segmented region, the similarity graph is constructed to reflect the bands-wise similarity, and its corresponding Laplacian matrix is generated for learning low-dimensional latent features in a hierarchical way. All latent features are then fused to form a unified feature representation of HSIs. Finally, $k$ -means clustering is utilized on the unified feature representation matrix to generate multiple clusters from which the band with maximum information entropy is selected to form the final subset of bands. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed clustering method can achieve superior performance than the state-of-the-art representative methods on the band selection.

  abstract     = {Recently, deep neural networks have achieved promising performance for in-filling large missing regions in image inpainting tasks. They have usually adopted the standard convolutional architecture over the corrupted image, leading to meaningless contents, such as color discrepancy, blur, and other artifacts. Moreover, most inpainting approaches cannot handle well the case of a large contiguous missing area. To address these problems, we propose a generic inpainting framework capable of handling incomplete images with both contiguous and discontiguous large missing areas. We pose this in an adversarial manner, deploying regionwise operations in both the generator and discriminator to separately handle the different types of regions, namely, existing regions and missing ones. Moreover, a correlation loss is introduced to capture the nonlocal correlations between different patches, and thus, guide the generator to obtain more information during inference. With the help of regionwise generative adversarial mechanism, our framework can restore semantically reasonable and visually realistic images for both discontiguous and contiguous large missing areas. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets for image inpainting task have been conducted, and both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, on the large contiguous and discontiguous missing areas.},

Beyond the object-specific vision measurement developed for fixed object type, it is appealing to explore the object-agnostic vision measurement, which can be efficiently reconfigured and adapted to various novel objects. This article proposes a framework to mimic the human’s versatile visual measurement behavior: extract a set of contour primitives of interest (CPIs) from an image, then utilize the CPIs to calculate the key geometric information. First, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) CPieNet+ is proposed under the one-shot learning scheme, aiming to extract the pixel-level object CPI from a raw query image, given an annotated support image. The fine-grained CPI prototypes are formed by sampling multiple points on the feature map of the support image. To leverage the explicit geometric knowledge in the CNN inference, the annotation map is encoded as a shape descriptor to guide the feature channel attention, and the geometric attribute awareness is realized by supervising the model to predict the direction and size of CPI. Second, the measurement behavior tree (BT) is designed to model the hierarchical geometric calculation procedure, which is flexibly configurable for different measurement requirements and is interpretable for nonexpert users. After the execution of the measurement BT, the pixel-level CPIs are converted to the required key geometric data. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated by a series of experiments.},

To overcome the aforementioned challenge, a distributed observer-based control protocol is developed and employed. First, an adaptive state observer for estimating the states of all the leaders is constructed based on the neighboring interactions. Second, two new classes of observers are constructed for each follower exploiting the output information of the follower, in which the adaptive neural networks (NNs)-based approximation is exploited to compensate for the unknown nonlinearity in the followers’ dynamics. A practical output containment control protocol is then generated by the proposed observers, where the control parameters are determined by an algorithm including two steps. Furthermore, with the help of the Lyapunov stability theory and the output regulation method, the practical output containment criteria for the considered closed-loop system under the influences of external disturbances are derived on the basis of the presented control protocol.

We propose a principled reformulation of the successful Euclidean generalized learning vector quantization (GLVQ) methodology to deal with such data, accounting for the nonlinear Riemannian geometry of the manifold through log-Euclidean metric (LEM). We first generalize GLVQ to the manifold of SPD matrices by exploiting the LEM-induced geodesic distance (GLVQ-LEM). We then extend GLVQ-LEM with metric learning. In particular, we study both 1) a more straightforward implementation of the metric learning idea by adapting metric in the space of vectorized log-transformed SPD matrices and 2) the full formulation of metric learning without matrix vectorization, thus preserving the second-order tensor structure. To obtain the distance metric in the full LEM learning (LEML) approaches, two algorithms are proposed. One method is to restrict the distance metric to be full rank, treating the distance metric tensor as an SPD matrix, and readily use the LEM framework (GLVQ-LEML-LEM). The other method is to cast no such restriction, treating the distance metric tensor as a fixed rank positive semidefinite matrix living on a quotient manifold with total space equipped with flat geometry (GLVQ-LEML-FM). Experiments on multiple datasets of different natures demonstrate the good performance of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs) pose great difficulties to the existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), in terms of constraint handling and the tradeoffs between diversity and convergence. The constraints divide the search space into feasible and infeasible regions. A key to solving CMOPs is how to effectively utilize the information of both feasible and infeasible solutions during the optimization process. In this article, we propose a multiform optimization framework to solve a CMOP task together with an auxiliary CMOP task in a multitask setting. The proposed framework is designed to conduct a search in different sizes of feasible space that is derived from the original CMOP task. The derived feasible space is easier to search and can provide a useful inductive bias to the search process of the original CMOP task, by leveraging the transferable knowledge shared between them, thereby helping the search to toward the Pareto optimal solutions from both the infeasible and feasible regions of the search space. The proposed framework is instantiated in three kinds of MOEAs: 1) dominance-based; 2) decomposition-based; and 3) indicator-based algorithms. Experiments on four sets of benchmark test problems demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over four representative constraint-handling techniques. In addition, the comparison against five state-of-the-art-constrained MOEAs demonstrates that the proposed approach outperforms these contender algorithms. Finally, the proposed method is successfully applied to solve a real-world antenna array synthesis problem.},

To obtain the approximate solution of the event-triggered Hamilton–Jacobi (HJ) equation, a critic network for each player is established with a novel weight updating law to relax the persistence of excitation condition based on the experience replay technique. Furthermore, according to the Lyapunov stability theorem, the present event-triggered robust optimal control ensures the multiplayer system to be uniformly ultimately bounded.

In recent years, more research focused on nonparallel SVM, where twin SVM (TWSVM) is the typical one. In order to reduce the influence of outliers, more robust distance measurements are considered in these methods, but the discriminability of the models is neglected. In this article, we propose robust manifold twin bounded SVM (RMTBSVM), which considers both robustness and discriminability. Specifically, a novel norm, that is, capped $L_{1}$ -norm, is used as the distance metric for robustness, and a robust manifold regularization is added to further improve the robustness and classification performance. In addition, we also use the kernel method to extend the proposed RMTBSVM for nonlinear classification. We introduce the optimization problems of the proposed model. Subsequently, effective algorithms for both linear and nonlinear cases are proposed and proved to be convergent. Moreover, the experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our model. Compared with other methods under the SVM framework, the proposed RMTBSVM shows better classification accuracy and robustness.},

First, for uncertainty suppression, (possibly fast) time-varying but bounded uncertainty is considered, and then an adaptive law is proposed to estimate the comprehensive uncertainty bounds online. Second, the problem of formation-containment control with collision avoidance is converted into another problem of constraint-following control by taking the objectives of collision avoidance, formation, and containment, respectively, as the collision-avoidance constraint, formation constraint, and containment constraint. Third, an $\eta $ -measure is introduced to gauge the constraint-following error, and then an adaptive robust control is proposed to render the error to be uniformly bounded and uniformly ultimately bounded, regardless of the uncertainty. By this, the satellites can follow the above collision-avoidance constraint, formation constraint, and containment constraint approximately.

This article introduces a novel robust adaptive control synthesis methodology for a quadrotor robot’s attitude and altitude stabilization. The proposed method is based on the fuzzy reinforcement learning and strictly negative imaginary (SNI) property. The first stage of our control approach is to transform a nonlinear quadrotor system into an equivalent negative-imaginary (NI) linear model by means of the feedback linearization (FL) technique. The second phase is to design a control scheme that adapts online the SNI controller gains via fuzzy $Q$ -learning. The performance of the designed controller is compared with that of a fixed-gain SNI controller, a fuzzy-SNI controller, and a conventional PID controller in a series of numerical simulations. Furthermore, the proofs for the stability of the proposed controller and the adaptive laws are provided using the NI theorem.},

  abstract     = {Due to the frequent changes in operating conditions, time-varying behaviors, including slow-varying dynamics and switching modes, commonly exist in industrial processes, resulting in different degrees of shifting in the process data distribution. When the data distribution shifts in a relatively wide range, conventional adaptive methods become ineffective since they are unable to distinguish normal shifts from real faults, leading to false alarms. In this study, an incremental variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (IncVBGMM) is proposed for developing a fine-scale adaptive monitoring scheme to efficiently accommodate the shifting data distribution caused by different degrees of time-varying behaviors. First, IncVBGMM with decremental optimization is proposed to adapt to the changing data distribution via the automatic complement of local models while reducing redundancy to optimize the mixture model. Then, a fine-scale adaptive monitoring scheme is built with physical interpretations to discern between normal shifts and real faults by joint analysis of the static and dynamic information. In addition, a novel monitoring statistic called the expectation of variational Bayesian inference distance (EVBID) is proposed, which can quantify the distance from samples to the variational monitoring model and indicate the fault effects. Case studies involving a real-world three-phase flow facility reveal that the proposed method can accurately differentiate various types of faults from normal shifts and effectively adapt to the time-varying dynamics.},

Specifically, the content similarity of DCT blocks and the 64 parallel channels is used to design the distortion function. Given a JPEG image, initial embedding costs are assigned for quantized DCT coefficients using an appropriate algorithm among the existing distortion functions. Then, the similarities of blocks and channels are used to update the initial embedding costs, respectively. After combination, the final distortion function can be obtained. Using syndrome trellis coding (STC), which achieves minimal embedding distortion with respect to a given distortion function, secret data are embedded into the cover image with a final distortion function.

Besides, two chaotic maps are used in the scheme design process. By plotting the phase diagrams under different parameter conditions, the rich variation of the behavior of the chaotic maps in the phase space is exhibited.

  abstract     = {The existing clustering validity indexes (CVIs) show some difficulties to produce the correct cluster number when some cluster centers are close to each other, and the separation processing mechanism appears simple. The results are imperfect in case of noisy data sets. For this reason, in this study, we come up with a novel CVI for fuzzy clustering, referred to as the triple center relation (TCR) index. The originality of this index is twofold. On the one hand, a new fuzzy cardinality is built on the strength of the maximum membership degree, and a novel compactness formula is constructed by combining it with the within-class weighted squared error sum. On the other hand, starting from the minimum distance between different cluster centers, the mean distance as well as the sample variance of cluster centers in the statistical sense are further integrated. These three factors are combined by means of product to form a triple characterization of the relationship between cluster centers, and hence a 3-D expression pattern of separability is formed. Subsequently, the TCR index is put forward by combining the compactness formula with the separability expression pattern. By virtue of the degenerate structure of hard clustering, we show an important property of the TCR index. Finally, based on the fuzzy $C $ -means (FCMs) clustering algorithm, experimental studies were conducted on 36 data sets (incorporating artificial and UCI data sets, images, the Olivetti face database). For comparative purposes, 10 CVIs were also considered. It has been found that the proposed TCR index performs best in finding the correct cluster number, and has excellent stability.},

In order to reduce the network bandwidth occupation and lighten the computation burden, an asynchronous dynamic event-triggered protocol (ADETP) is designed to arrange the signal transmissions from sensors to the composite controllers, in which the triggering sequences of fast and slow system components are determined separately. A novel composite controller based on the proposed ADETP is designed dependent on the singular perturbation parameter (SPP) such that the closed-loop TTSCPS is asymptotically stable with meeting a required $H_{\infty }$ performance index when the SPP is no more than a given upper bound. Gain matrices of the desired composite controller are parameterized in terms of the solutions to certain matrix inequalities that are readily solvable. Finally, simulation results of a nuclear reactor are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

First, extreme learning machine (ELM) and adaptive techniques are adopted to approximate the unknown nonlinearities. Then, novel adaptive ELM-based nonlinear state observers with adaptive compensation functions are developed to estimate the unmeasurable states during DoS attacks under the influence of the disturbances. Further, by combining with the backstepping control and filtering techniques, adaptive ELM-based controllers are proposed to achieve uniformly ultimately bounded results based on the observation and adaption control signals under the influence of DoS attacks, nonlinear dynamics, and exogenous disturbances. Comparative studies are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the developed ELM-based adaptive observation and control strategies for two interconnected power systems.},

  abstract     = {Complex systems in nature and society consist of various types of interactions, where each type of interaction belongs to a layer, resulting in the so-called multilayer networks. Identifying specific modules for each layer is of great significance for revealing the structure-function relations in multilayer networks. However, the available approaches are criticized undesirable because they fail to explicitly the specificity of modules, and balance the specificity and connectivity of modules. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an accurate and flexible algorithm by joint learning matrix factorization and sparse representation (jMFSR) for specific modules in multilayer networks, where matrix factorization extracts features of vertices and sparse representation discovers specific modules. To exploit the discriminative latent features of vertices in multilayer networks, jMFSR incorporates linear discriminant analysis (LDA) into non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to learn features of vertices that distinguish the categories. To explicitly measure the specificity of features, jMFSR decomposes features of vertices into common and specific parts, thereby enhancing the quality of features. Then, jMFSR jointly learns feature extraction, common-specific feature factorization, and clustering of multilayer networks. The experiments on 11 datasets indicate that jMFSR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of various measurements.},

Generally, to effectively solve CMaOPs, an algorithm needs to balance feasibility, convergence, and diversity simultaneously. It is essential for handling CMaOPs yet most of the existing research encounters difficulties. This article proposes a novel constrained many-objective optimization EA with enhanced mating and environmental selections, namely, CMME. It can be featured as: 1) two novel ranking strategies are proposed and used in the mating and environmental selections to enrich feasibility, diversity, and convergence; 2) a novel individual density estimation is designed, and the crowding distance is integrated to promote diversity; and 3) the $\theta $ -dominance is used to strengthen the selection pressure on promoting both the convergence and diversity. The synergy of these components can achieve the goal of balancing feasibility, convergence, and diversity for solving CMaOPs. The proposed CMME is extensively evaluated on 13 CMaOPs and 3 real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority and competitiveness of CMME over nine related algorithms.},

However, exploration and reward shaping remain challenging for existing methods, especially in scenarios where extrinsic feedback is sparse. Expert demonstrations have been investigated to solve these difficulties, but a tremendous number of high-quality demonstrations are usually required. In this work, an integrated policy gradient algorithm is proposed to boost exploration and facilitate intrinsic reward learning from only a limited number of demonstrations. We achieved this by reformulating the original reward function with two additional terms, where the first term measured the Jensen–Shannon divergence between current policy and the expert’s demonstrations, and the second term estimated the agent’s uncertainty about the environment. The presented algorithm was evaluated by a range of simulated tasks with sparse extrinsic reward signals, where only limited demonstrated trajectories were provided to each task. Superior exploration efficiency and high average return were demonstrated in all tasks. Furthermore, it was found that the agent could imitate the expert’s behavior and meanwhile sustain high return.},

Although deep networks, such as the stacked autoencoder (SAE), can learn useful features from massive data with multilevel architecture, it is difficult to adapt them online to track fast time-varying process dynamics. To integrate feature learning and online adaptation, this article proposes a deep cascade gradient radial basis function (GRBF) network for online modeling and prediction of nonlinear and nonstationary processes. The proposed deep learning method consists of three modules. First, a preliminary prediction result is generated by a GRBF weak predictor, which is further combined with raw input data for feature extraction. By incorporating the prior weak prediction information, deep output-relevant features are extracted using a SAE. Online prediction is finally produced upon the extracted features with a GRBF predictor, whose weights and structure are updated online to capture fast time-varying process characteristics. Three real-world industrial case studies demonstrate that the proposed deep cascade GRBF network outperforms existing state-of-the-art online modeling approaches as well as deep networks, in terms of both online prediction accuracy and computational complexity.},

First, a multirate data filter is designed through a resolution searching strategy to turn the original process data into a multiresolution dataset. Then, the pyramid variational autoencoder (PVAE) is proposed to extract deep nonlinear features from the data with different resolutions. In PVAE, the augmented feature pyramid is constructed layer by layer to fuse extracted features from low resolution to the high. As a consequence, the extracted features with various resolutions are gathered to form the regression model, where the process information contained in data with discrepant sampling rates can be fully utilized. Due to the layer-by-layer enhanced features, the prediction accuracy of the soft sensing model are gradually improved. Meanwhile, an optimized training strategy is established to select the optimal feature pyramid for prediction.

This article proposes a framework combining cost-sensitive classification and adversarial learning together to train a model that can distinguish between the protected and unprotected classes, such that the protected classes are less vulnerable to adversarial examples. We find in this framework an interesting phenomenon during the training of deep neural networks, called the Min–Max property, that is, the absolute values of most parameters in the convolutional layer approach 0 while the absolute values of a few parameters are significantly larger, becoming bigger. Based on this Min–Max property which is formulated and analyzed in a view of random distribution, we further build a new defense model against adversarial examples for adversarial robustness improvement. An advantage of the built model is that it performs better than the standard one and can combine with adversarial training to achieve improved performance. It is experimentally confirmed that, regarding the average accuracy of all classes, our model is almost as same as the existing models when an attack does not occur and is better than the existing models when an attack occurs. Specifically, regarding the accuracy of protected classes, the proposed model is much better than the existing models when an attack occurs.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates nonstationary process monitoring under frequently varying modes, where new modes are allowed to emerge constantly. However, in current multimode process monitoring methods, generally, data are required from all possible modes and mode identification is realized by prior knowledge for multimode nonstationary processes. In contrast, recursive methods update a monitoring model based on the successive data. However, they forget the learned knowledge gracefully and fail to track drastic variations. Aimed at nonstationary data in each mode, this article proposes an adaptive cointegration analysis (CA) to distinguish real faults from normal variations, which updates a model once a normal sample is encountered and adapts to the gradual change in the cointegration relationship. Then, a modified recursive principal component analysis (RPCA) with continual learning ability is developed to deal with the remaining dynamic information, wherein elastic weight consolidation is adopted to consolidate the previously learned knowledge when a new mode appears. The preserved information is beneficial for establishing a more accurate model than traditional RPCA and avoiding drastic performance degradation for future similar modes. In addition, novel statistics are proposed with prior knowledge and thresholds are calculated by recursive kernel density estimation to enhance the performance. An in-depth comparison with recursive CA and recursive slow feature analysis is conducted to emphasize the superiority, in terms of the algorithm accuracy, memory properties, and computational complexity. Compared with state-of-the-art recursive algorithms, the effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by studying on a numerical case and a practical industrial system.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a neuroadaptive tracking control scheme embedded with memory-based trajectory predictor for Euler–Lagrange (EL) systems to closely track an unknown target. The key synthesis steps are: 1) using memory-based method to reconstruct the behavior of the unknown target based on its past trajectory information recorded/stored in the memory; 2) blending both speed transformation and barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) into the design and analysis; and 3) introducing a virtual parameter to reduce the number of online update parameters, rendering the strategy structurally simple and computationally inexpensive. It is shown that the resultant control scheme is able to ensure prescribed tracking performance in which close target tracking is achieved without the need for detailed information about system dynamics and the target trajectory; the tracking error converges to the prescribed precision set within a prespecified finite time at an assignable rate of convergence; and the full-state constraints are never violated. Furthermore, all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded and the control action is $C^{1}$ smooth. The benefits and feasibility of the developed control are also verified and confirmed by simulation.},

  abstract     = {Graph matching, or the determination of the vertex correspondences between a pair of graphs, is a crucial task in various problems in different science and engineering disciplines. This article aims to propose a distributed optimization approach for graph matching (GM) between two isomorphic graphs over multiagent networks. For this, we first show that for a class of asymmetric graphs, GM of two isomorphic graphs is equivalent to a convex relaxation where the set of permutation matrices is replaced by the set of pseudostochastic matrices. Then, we formulate GM as a distributed convex optimization problem with equality constraints and a set constraint, over a network of multiple agents. For arbitrary labelings of the vertices, each agent only has information about just one vertex and its neighborhood, and can exchange information with its neighbors. A projected primal-dual gradient method is developed to solve the constrained optimization problem, and globally exponential convergence of the agents’ states to the optimal permutation is achieved. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm through simulation examples.},

First, this article provides with the target recognition image data to be trained and detected through the automated guided vehicle (AGV) mobile platform, which can grab the recognition image of different angles and backgrounds. In order to avoid the data generalization phenomenon, the dataset can be expanded by the data normalization and data enhancement. Second, the data are input into the shared convolution layer to extract the feature image and maintain the image. The parameters of image height, width, and channel number are invariable, and the new feature image is obtained by further extraction. Furthermore, the region proposal network (RPN) prefiltering algorithm based on hierarchical clustering is used to filter the objects in the candidate box to determine the region image corresponding to the feature image. Then, the feature images of different sizes input into region of interest (ROI) pooling are used to keep the size of the image in the ROI consistent. Finally, the normalized image is input into the classifier module to obtain the category of the target recognition image to be detected. Through the simulation experiments of different groups, it can be seen that the target recognition system proposed in this design can not only accurately detect the objects but also stably recognize the objects in different environments. The target recognition accuracy for the optimized system is about 95\%.},

The development of such systems calls for mathematical driver models able to represent human drivers’ steering behavior in response to automated steering intervention. This article concerns the experimental evaluation of a game-theoretic driver steering control model. The driver model centers on a steering control strategy developed based on the Nash equilibrium of a theoretic noncooperative game between the driver and automated steering controller. The key parameters of the game-theoretic driver model are identified by fitting the model to real driver steering behavior measured from six driver subjects in an experiment using a driving simulator. The game-theoretic driver model is evaluated by compared to a “conventional” optimal-control-theoretic driver model, and analyzing their model fitting errors. Results from the analysis demonstrate that the game-theoretic driver model is statistically significantly better than the conventional driver model for representing three out of the six subjects’ steering behavior. For the other three subjects, both the two models perform statistically equivalently well.},

A scalable block-coordinate descent algorithm, with closed-form updates, is incorporated to minimize the proposed objective function. We establish theoretical guarantees on our method by Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC) theory to establish strong consistency along with uniform concentration bounds.

Although many methods have been developed to computerize the creation process of graphic patterns, most of them solely provide some facilitating tools for the designers and could not propose an automatic procedure. This article proposes a fully automatic graphic pattern generation (AGPG) model that performs the entire pattern generation process without any human interference. We then customize the proposed model for camouflage pattern design. Most of the existing camouflage pattern creation methods consider only one or a few background images. Since the objects move and their backgrounds may vary significantly, it is essential to generate multipurpose camouflage patterns with appropriate performance in various backgrounds. The previously proposed methods are also heavily dependent on the existing patterns to produce new ones and could not create novel structures in their generated patterns. Our model is equipped with a novel creative drawing engine that can create a wide variety of new graphical structures without using any existing pattern. The drawing module in our model is controlled by several parameters tuned for the desired task employing an evolutionary strategy-based algorithm. The proposed method has no limits for the number of background images and creates the camouflage patterns appropriate for any number of provided images. The experimental results show that the AGPG method can create novel multipurpose camouflage patterns automatically with high concealment capabilities.},

They traditionally assume equal misclassification costs for each class; however, real-world problems may have an uneven class distribution. This article introduces EBCS-SVM: evolutionary bilevel cost-sensitive SVMs. EBCS-SVM handles imbalanced classification problems by simultaneously learning the support vectors and optimizing the SVM hyperparameters, which comprise the kernel parameter and misclassification costs. The resulting optimization problem is a bilevel problem, where the lower level determines the support vectors and the upper level the hyperparameters. This optimization problem is solved using an evolutionary algorithm (EA) at the upper level and sequential minimal optimization (SMO) at the lower level. These two methods work in a nested fashion, that is, the optimal support vectors help guide the search of the hyperparameters, and the lower level is initialized based on previous successful solutions. The proposed method is assessed using 70 datasets of imbalanced classification and compared with several state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results, supported by a Bayesian test, provided evidence of the effectiveness of EBCS-SVM when working with highly imbalanced datasets.},

Poor illumination condition causes issues, such as high-level noise, unlikely color or texture distortions, nonuniform exposure, halo artifacts, and lack of sharpness in the images. This article presents a novel end-to-end trainable deep convolutional neural network called the deep perceptual image enhancement network (DPIENet) to address these challenges. The novel contributions of the proposed work are: 1) a framework to synthesize multiple exposures from a single image and utilizing the exposure variation to restore the image and 2) a loss function based on the approximation of the logarithmic response of the human eye. Extensive computer simulations on the benchmark MIT-Adobe FiveK and user studies performed using Google high dynamic range, DIV2K, and low light image datasets show that DPIENet has clear advantages over state-of-the-art techniques. It has the potential to be useful for many everyday applications such as modernizing traditional camera technologies that currently capture images/videos with under/overexposed regions due to their sensors limitations, to be used in consumer photography to help the users capture appealing images, or for a variety of intelligent systems, including automated driving and video surveillance applications.},

To realize the control under a model-free system, the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is adopted in the controller to enable model-free control. Unlike the traditional DDPG algorithm, which only takes the system state as input, this article incorporates historical action information as input to extract more information and achieve precise control in the case of communication latency. Additionally, in the experience replay mechanism of the DDPG algorithm, we incorporate the reward into the prioritized experience replay (PER) approach.

Based on the cooperative differential game strategy, the optimal control problem of HRC-oriented MRM systems is transformed into a cooperative game problem of multiple subsystems. By taking advantage of the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm, a joint cost function identifier is developed via the critic neural networks, which is implemented for solving the parametric Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation and Pareto optimal solutions. The trajectory tracking error under the HRC task of the closed-loop MRM system is proved to be ultimately uniformly bounded (UUB) by the Lyapunov theory.

For this purpose, a predictor-based NDSC (PNDSC) approach is presented. It introduces Nussbaum functions and predictors into the traditional NDSC for nonlinear systems with unknown control gains. Unlike NDSC that uses surface errors to update the learning parameters of neural networks (NNs), the PNDSC employs prediction errors for the same purpose, leading to improved transient performance of closed-loop control systems. To reduce the number of learning parameters, the PNDSC is further embedded with the technique of the minimal number of learning parameters (MNLPs). This avoids the problem of the “explosion of learning parameters” as the order of the system increases. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis shows that all signals are bounded in the closed-loop systems under PNDSC embedded with MNLPs. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the PNDSC approach presented in this article.},

  abstract     = {A fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) is a graph-based knowledge representation model wherein the connections of the nodes (edges) represent casual relationships between the knowledge items associated with the nodes. This model has been applied to solve various modeling tasks including forecasting time series. In the original FCM-based forecasting model, causal relationships among concepts of the FCM remain unchanged. However, causal relationships may change in time. Therefore, we propose a new learning method for training an FCM resulting in an adaptive FCM which consists of several sub-FCMs. It can select different sub-FCMs at different moments. In an active processing scenario, in which we deal with a large-scale time series with new data being continuously generated, a forecasting model built on the old data should be updated when the new data arrive. Furthermore, retraining an FCM from scratch entails increasing computing overhead that will become a serious obstacle in many practical scenarios. To overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings, this study offers an original design setting in which the FCM is updated by knowledge-guidance learning mechanism for the first time. Compared with the existing classical forecasting models, the proposed model shows higher accuracy and efficiency. Its increased performance is demonstrated through a series of reported experimental studies.},

Both actuator fault and sensor fault are taken into account. Meanwhile, using the local information, the fault compensators are introduced. Then, based on the fuzzy-logic systems (FLSs) and modification technique of adaptive law, a novel distributed adaptive resilient control protocol is developed, which can compensate the effect of faults on the actuator and sensor. It turns out that all signals of MASs are bounded, while the tracking errors enter an adjustable bounded region around the origin. Toward the end, two simulations are provided to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Realistic epidemic spreading is usually driven by traffic flow in networks, which is not captured in classic diffusion models. Moreover, the progress of a node’s infection from mild to severe phase has not been particularly addressed in previous epidemic modeling. To address these issues, we propose a novel traffic-driven epidemic spreading model by introducing a new epidemic state, that is, the severe state, which characterizes the serious infection of a node different from the initial mild infection. We derive the dynamic equations of our model with the tools of individual-based mean-field approximation and continuous-time Markov chain. We find that, besides infection and recovery rates, the epidemic threshold of our model is determined by the largest real eigenvalue of a communication frequency matrix we construct. Finally, we study how the epidemic spreading is influenced by representative distributions of infection control resources. In particular, we observe that the uniform and Weibull distributions of control resources, which have very close performance, are much better than the Pareto distribution in suppressing the epidemic spreading.},

Unlike the existing related adaptive event-triggered algorithms, the proposed algorithm could theoretically guarantee the existence of a strictly positive constant on the interevent time intervals for both communication between agents and controller update. Furthermore, it is shown by the simulation that the addition of a dynamic variable has the potential to further optimize the control cost when compared to the addition of exponential function signal or $L_{1}$ signal usually adopted in existing adaptive event-triggered mechanisms. Then, the obtained results are extended from the strongly connected graph to the directed communication graph only containing a spanning tree.

  abstract     = {Most modern satellites can provide two types of images: 1) panchromatic (PAN) image and 2) multispectral (MS) image. The former has high spatial resolution and low spectral resolution, while the latter has high spectral resolution and low spatial resolution. To obtain images with both high spectral and spatial resolution, pansharpening has emerged to fuse the spatial information of the PAN image and the spectral information of the MS image. However, most pansharpening methods fail to preserve spatial and spectral information simultaneously. In this article, we propose a framelet-based convolutional neural network (CNN) for pansharpening which makes it possible to pursue both high spectral and high spatial resolution. Our network consists of three subnetworks: 1) feature embedding net; 2) feature fusion net; and 3) framelet prediction net. Different from conventional CNN methods directly inferring high-resolution MS images, our approach learns to predict their framelet coefficients from available PAN and MS images. The introduction of multilevel feature aggregation and hybrid residual connection makes full use of spatial information of PAN image and spectral information of MS image. Quantitative and qualitative experiments at reduced- and full-resolution demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more appealing results than other state-of-the-art pansharpening methods.

  abstract     = {Feature selection aims to reduce the number of features and improve the classification accuracy, which is an essential step in many real-world problems. Multiple feature subsets with different features selected can achieve similar or even the same objective values (e.g., maximize the classification accuracy and minimize the number of selected features). This means the optimal feature subsets of a classification problem may not be unique. However, most existing feature selection methods do not take into consideration finding multiple optimal feature subsets. In this article, a multiobjective differential evolution approach is developed to search for multiple optimal feature subsets. The contributions are three-fold. First, to provide a good starting point, an initialization method considering feature relevance is proposed. Second, a clustering method is used to divide the whole population into multiple subpopulations. In each of these subpopulations, a subarchive utilizes a developed crowding distance to ensure diversity by considering both the search space and the objective space. Finally, the nondominated solutions from all the subarchives are retained in another archive to guide the evolutionary feature selection process, together with an improved hypervolume contribution indicator. The experiments on 14 datasets of varying difficulty show that the proposed approach can evolve a better Pareto front of feature subsets compared with seven other state-of-the-art methods as well as find different feature subsets with similar or the same classification performance.},

To avoid that individuals after intertask learning are not suitable for the original task due to the distribution differences and even impede overall solution efficiency, we propose a novel multitask evolutionary framework that enables knowledge aggregation and online learning among distinct tasks to solve MTO problems. Our proposal designs a domain adaptation-based mapping strategy to reduce the difference across solution domains and find more genetic traits to improve the effectiveness of information interactions. To further improve the algorithm performance, we propose a smart way to divide initial population into different subpopulations and choose suitable individuals to learn. By ranking individuals in target subpopulation, worse-performing individuals can learn from other tasks. The significant advantage of our proposed paradigm over the state of the art is verified via a series of MTO benchmark studies.},

This goes beyond standard applications of condition-based maintenance, which seeks to detect faults or failures in nonoptimizing systems. Normal agents optimize a known accepted objective function, whereas abnormal or misbehaving agents may optimize a renegade objective that does not conform to the accepted one. We provide a unified framework for anomaly detection and correction in optimizing autonomous systems described by differential equations using inverse reinforcement learning (RL). We first define several types of anomalies and false alarms, including noise anomaly, objective function anomaly, intention (control gain) anomaly, abnormal behaviors, noise-anomaly false alarms, and objective false alarms. We then propose model-free inverse RL algorithms to reconstruct the objective functions and intentions for given system behaviors. The inverse RL procedure for anomaly detection and correction has the training phase, detection phase, and correction phase. First, inverse RL in the training phase infers the objective function and intention of the normal behavior system using offline stored data. Second, in the detection phase, inverse RL infers the objective function and intention for online observed test system behaviors using online observation data. They are then compared with that of the nominal system to identify anomalies. Third, correction is executed for the anomalous system to learn the normal objective and intention. Simulations and experiments on a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) verify the proposed methods.},

The exclusion of the Zeno behavior of the DETMs is proved. Synchronization criteria formulated by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are given, by which the control gains, event-triggering weights, as well as the minimum $\mathcal {L}_{2}$ -gain are simultaneously designed.

In particular, connectivity robustness and controllability robustness reflect how well a networked system can maintain its connectedness and controllability against destructive attacks, which can be quantified by a sequence of values that record the remaining connectivity and controllability of the network after a sequence of node- or edge-removal attacks. Traditionally, robustness is determined by attack simulations, which are computationally very time-consuming or even practically infeasible for large-scale networks. In this article, an improved method for network robustness prediction is developed based on learning feature representation using the convolutional neural network (LFR-CNN). In this scheme, the higher-dimensional network data are compressed into lower-dimensional representations, which are then passed to a convolutional neural network to perform robustness prediction. Extensive experimental studies on both synthetic and real-world networks, both directed and undirected, demonstrate that: 1) the proposed LFR-CNN performs better than other two state-of-the-art prediction methods, with significantly smaller prediction errors; 2) LFR-CNN is insensitive to the variation of the input network size, which significantly extends its applicability; 3) although LFR-CNN needs more time to perform feature learning, it can achieve accurate prediction faster than attack simulations; and 4) LFR-CNN not only accurately predicts the network robustness, but also provides a good indicator for connectivity robustness, better than the classical spectral measures.},

However, two key challenges hinder the practical use of those methods: 1) effectively capturing salient waveforms in sleep signals and 2) correctly classifying confusing stages in transitioning epochs. In this study, we propose a novel deep neural-network structure, TransSleep, that captures distinctive local temporal patterns and distinguishes confusing stages using two auxiliary tasks. In particular, TransSleep captures salient waveforms in sleep signals by an attention-based multiscale feature extractor and correctly classifies confusing stages in transitioning epochs, while modeling contextual relationships with two auxiliary tasks. Results show that TransSleep achieves promising performance in automatic sleep staging. The validity of TransSleep is demonstrated by its state-of-the-art performance on two publicly available datasets: 1) Sleep-EDF and 2) MASS. Furthermore, we performed ablations to analyze our results from different perspectives. Based on our overall results, we believe that TransSleep has immense potential to provide new insights into deep-learning-based sleep staging.},

Via introducing different incremental factors, it is highlighted that we can adjust the convergence rate of the iterative cost function sequence.

  abstract     = {Evolutionary multitask multiobjective learning has been widely used for handling more than one multiobjective task simultaneously. However, it is rarely used in dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, which have valuable practical applications such as dynamic flexible job-shop scheduling (DFJSS) in manufacturing. Genetic programming (GP), as a popular hyperheuristic approach, has been used to learn scheduling heuristics for generating schedules for multitask single-objective DFJSS only. Searching in the heuristic space with GP is more difficult than in the solution space, since a small change on heuristics can lead to ineffective or even infeasible solutions. Multiobjective DFJSS is more challenging than single DFJSS, since a scheduling heuristic needs to cope with multiple objectives. To tackle this challenge, we first propose a multipopulation-based multitask multiobjective GP algorithm to preserve the quality of the learned scheduling heuristics for each task. Furthermore, we develop a multitask multiobjective GP algorithm with a task-oriented knowledge-sharing strategy to further improve the effectiveness of learning scheduling heuristics for DFJSS. The results show that the designed multipopulation-based GP algorithms, especially the one with the task-oriented knowledge-sharing strategy, can achieve good performance for all the examined tasks by maintaining the quality and diversity of individuals for corresponding tasks well. The learned Pareto fronts also show that the GP algorithm with task-oriented knowledge-sharing strategy can learn competitive scheduling heuristics for DFJSS on both of the objectives.},

It is assumed that the information of the upper layer state components is intermittently exchangeable through a strongly connected communication network among the agents. A distributed hierarchical hybrid control framework is proposed, which consists of a lower layer controller and an upper layer one. The lower layer controller is a decentralized continuous feedback controller, which makes the lower layer state components converge to their target values. The upper layer controller is a distributed impulsive controller, which enforces a scaled consensus for the upper layer state components. It is proved that the two layer controllers can be designed separately. By considering the dwell-time condition of impulses and the feature of the strongly connected Laplacian matrix, a novel weighted discontinuous function is constructed for scaled consensus analysis. By using the Lyapunov function, a sufficient condition for scaled consensus of the MAS is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. As an application of the proposed distributed hybrid control strategy, a relaxed distributed hybrid secondary control algorithm for dc microgrid is obtained, by which the balance requirement on the communication digraph is removed, and an improved current sharing condition is obtained.},

Then, the obstacle caused by the coupling of the updated parameters is eliminated by the variational Bayesian (VB) technique and fixed-point iterations.

Due to the fact that LCE has complex hysteretic nonlinearities, which are highly dependent on the environment, modeling of actuators made of LCE is a very challenging issue. In this article, a model is proposed to describe the deformation of the LCE actuator accurately and analytically by considering the dynamic phase transition process of LCE molecules. First, an overview of the physical process of LCE’s deformation is presented, and the schematic of the LCE actuator, as well as the modeling scheme are then introduced. Next, a thermodynamic analysis of the system’s free energy is performed to establish the model for the LCE actuator, which gives the relationship between the system’s deformation and the temperature. Here, to describe the complex hysteretic nonlinearity in the model, the dynamic process of the phase transition of LCE molecules is exploited. To effectively identify the model parameters, a two-step parameter identification strategy based on the differential evolution algorithm and nonlinear least-squares method is utilized. Finally, experimental results verify the validity of the proposed model. This modeling provides an approach to describe LCE’s deformation with high accuracy and can fully reflect the physical nature of LCE’s deformation, especially hysteresis. It can be utilized as a basis for accurate control over LCE actuators in photoresponsive soft robot applications.},

  abstract     = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) excels in portraying rapid neural dynamics at the level of milliseconds, but its spatial resolution has often been lagging behind the increasing demands in neuroscience research or subject to limitations imposed by emerging neuroengineering scenarios, especially those centering on consumer EEG devices. Current superresolution (SR) methods generally do not suffice in the reconstruction of high-resolution (HR) EEG as it remains a grand challenge to properly handle the connection relationship amongst EEG electrodes (channels) and the intensive individuality of subjects. This study proposes a deep EEG SR framework correlating brain structural and functional connectivities (Deep-EEGSR), which consists of a compact convolutional network and an auxiliary fully connected network for filter generation (FGN). Deep-EEGSR applies graph convolution adapting to the structural connectivity amongst EEG channels when coding SR EEG. Sample-specific dynamic convolution is designed with filter parameters adjusted by FGN conforming to functional connectivity of intensive subject individuality. Overall, Deep-EEGSR operates on low-resolution (LR) EEG and reconstructs the corresponding HR acquisitions through an end-to-end SR course. The experimental results on three EEG datasets (autism spectrum disorder, emotion, and motor imagery) indicate that: 1) Deep-EEGSR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts with normalized mean squared error (NMSE) decreased by 1\%–6\% and the improvement of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) up to 1.2 dB and 2) the SR EEG manifests superiority to the LR alternative in ASD discrimination and spatial localization of typical ASD EEG characteristics, and this superiority even increases with the scale of SR.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy membership is an effective approach used in twin support vector machines (SVMs) to reduce the effect of noise and outliers in classification problems. Fuzzy twin SVMs (TWSVMs) assign membership weights to reduce the effect of outliers, however, it ignores the positioning of the input data samples and hence fails to distinguish between support vectors and noise. To overcome this issue, intuitionistic fuzzy TWSVM combined the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy number with TWSVMs to reduce the effect of outliers and distinguish support vectors from noise. Despite these benefits, TWSVMs and intuitionistic fuzzy TWSVMs still suffer from some drawbacks as: 1) the local neighborhood information is ignored among the data points and 2) they solve quadratic programming problems (QPPs), which is computationally inefficient. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel intuitionistic fuzzy weighted least squares TWSVMs for classification problems. The proposed approach uses local neighborhood information among the data points and also uses both membership and nonmembership weights to reduce the effect of noise and outliers. The proposed approach solves a system of linear equations instead of solving the QPPs which makes the model more efficient. We evaluated the proposed intuitionistic fuzzy weighted least squares TWSVMs on several benchmark datasets to show the efficiency of the proposed model. Statistical analysis is done to quantify the results statistically. As an application, we used the proposed model for the diagnosis of Schizophrenia disease.},

Limited to expensive cost of data collection, the task of unpaired image captioning has attracted researchers’ attention. In this article, we propose a novel memorial GAN (MemGAN) with the joint semantic optimization for unpaired image captioning. The core idea is to explore implicit semantic correlation between disjointed images and sentences through building a multimodal semantic-aware space (SAS). Concretely, each modality is mapped into a unified multimodal SAS, where SAS includes the semantic vectors of image ${I}$ , visual concepts ${O}$ , unpaired sentence ${S}$ , and the generated caption ${C}$ . We adopt the memory unit based on multihead attention and relational gate as a backbone to preserve and transit crucial multimodal semantics in the SAS for image caption generation and sentence reconstruction. Then, the memory unit is embedded into a GAN framework to exploit the semantic similarity and relevance in SAS, that is, imposing a joint semantic-aware optimization on SAS without supervision clues. To summarize, the proposed MemGAN learns the latent semantic relevance of SAS’s multimodalities in an adversarial manner. Extensive experiments and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of MemGAN, achieving improvements over state of the arts on unpaired image captioning benchmarks.},

We first prove that the NE of the approximate game is the $\epsilon $ -NE of the original game and then propose a distributed algorithm to seek the $\epsilon $ -NE, where the projection is then of a standard form in quadratic optimization with linear constraints. With the help of the existing developed methods for solving quadratic optimization, we show the convergence of the proposed algorithm and also discuss the computational cost issue related to the approximation. Furthermore, based on the exponential convergence of the algorithm, we estimate the approximation accuracy related to $\epsilon $ .

  abstract     = {Many real-world problems, such as airfoil design, involve optimizing a black-box expensive objective function over complex-structured input space (e.g., discrete space or non-Euclidean space). By mapping the complex-structured input space into a latent space of dozens of variables, a two-stage procedure labeled as generative model-based optimization (GMO), in this article, shows promise in solving such problems. However, the latent dimension of GMO is hard to determine, which may trigger the conflicting issue between desirable solution accuracy and convergence rate. To address the above issue, we propose a multiform GMO approach, namely, generative multiform optimization (GMFoO), which conducts optimization over multiple latent spaces simultaneously to complement each other. More specifically, we devise a generative model which promotes a positive correlation between latent spaces to facilitate effective knowledge transfer in GMFoO. And furthermore, by using Bayesian optimization (BO) as the optimizer, we propose two strategies to exchange information between these latent spaces continuously. Experimental results are presented on airfoil and corbel design problems and an area maximization problem as well to demonstrate that our proposed GMFoO converges to better designs on a limited computational budget.},

  abstract     = {In many clustering scenes, data samples’ attribute values change over time. For such data, we are often interested in obtaining a partition for each time step and tracking the dynamic change of partitions. Normally, a smooth change is assumed for data to have a temporal smooth nature. Existing algorithms consider the temporal smoothness as an a priori preference and bias the search toward the preferred direction. This a priori manner leads to a risk of converging to an unexpected region because it is not always the case that a reasonable preference can be elicited given the little prior knowledge about the data. To address this issue, this article proposes a new clustering framework called evolutionary robust clustering over time. One significant innovation of the proposed framework is processing the temporal smoothness in an a posteriori manner, which avoids unexpected convergence that occurs in existing algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed framework automatically infers the a posteriori preference to temporal smoothness without data’s affinity matrix and predefined parameters, which holds better applicability and efficiency. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework are confirmed by comparing with state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and real datasets.},

  abstract     = {Network embedding which aims to learn a low dimensional representation of nodes is a powerful technique for network analysis. While network embedding for networks with complete attributes has been widely investigated, in many real-world applications the attributes of partial nodes are unobserved (i.e., missing) due to privacy concern or resource limit. Very recently, several network embedding methods have been proposed for attribute-missing networks. They first complete the missing attributes and then use the complemented network to learn network embedding. The parameters of these two processes cannot be adjusted by each other, resulting in compromised results. To address this problem, we propose a unified model in which the process of completing missing attributes and the process of learning embedding are not separated but closely intertwined. Being specific, completing missing attributes is under the guidance of learning network representation via mutual information maximization, and the complemented attributes directly enter network representation module which will generate further feedback for completing missing attributes. We further impose attribute-structure relationship constraint for completing missing attributes by designing a new generative adversarial networks (GANs) model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unified model for attribute-missing network embedding. Empirical results on real-world datasets show the superiority of our new method over other state-of-the-art methods on four network analysis tasks, including node classification, node clustering, link prediction, and network visualization.},

  abstract     = {An efficient energy scheduling strategy of a charging station is crucial for stabilizing the electricity market and accommodating the charging demand of electric vehicles (EVs). Most of the existing studies on energy scheduling strategies fail to coordinate the process of energy purchasing and distribution and, thus, cannot balance the energy supply and demand. Besides, the existence of multiple charging stations in a complex scenario makes it difficult to develop a unified schedule strategy for different charging stations. In order to solve these problems, we propose a multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) method to learn the optimal energy purchasing strategy and an online heuristic dispatching scheme to develop a energy distribution strategy in this article. Unlike the traditional scheduling methods, the two proposed strategies are coordinated with each other in both temporal and spatial dimensions to develop the unified energy scheduling strategy for charging stations. Specifically, the proposed MARL method combines the multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) principles for learning purchasing strategy and a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network for predicting the charging demand of EVs. Moreover, a multistep reward function is developed to accelerate the learning process. The proposed method is verified by comprehensive simulation experiments based on real data of the electricity market in Chicago. The experiment results show that the proposed method can achieve better performance than other state-of-the-art energy scheduling methods in the charging market in terms of the economic profits and users’ satisfaction ratio.},

The sensor sampling period is allowed to be different from the system updating period and, to facilitate the observer design, the underlying multirate system is cast into a general single-rate one by resorting to the lifting technique. In order to curb the communication burden and promote the data security, the encoding–decoding procedure is implemented on the sensor-to-observer channel to convert the measurement signals into binary codewords. A sufficient condition is first proposed to reveal the fundamental relationship between the bit-rate constraints and the decoding accuracy, and then the exponentially ultimate boundedness of the error dynamics is assessed with the aid of the Lyapunov method. Subsequently, the desired observer gains are determined by solving two optimization problems with the aim to achieve two distinct performance indices, namely, the smallest ultimate bound and the fastest decay rate. Finally, the validity of the developed observer design approach is thoroughly demonstrated via the simulation examples.},

A vital challenge in traditional vision-based systems is avoiding local minima and singularity problems. To tackle this issue, a full-rank interaction matrix hybrid visual servo (FRHVS) design criterion is proposed, which guarantees that the hybrid interaction matrix and its pseudoinverse matrix are both full rank. Moreover, the interaction matrix for these hybrid strategies, which combines image features with other sensors features, is derived in an analytical form.

Then, the threshold used for FD purposes is obtained via quantiles-based learning, where both estimation errors and approximation errors are considered. Compared with the existing work, the main novelties of this study include: 1) SNNCVA provides a new parameterization strategy for nonlinear Hammerstein systems by utilizing input and output data only; 2) the associated residual generator can ensure FD performance where both the system model and its nonlinearity are unknown; and 3) with consideration of modeling-induced errors, the quantiles are invoked and used to provide a reliable FD threshold in situations where only limited samples are available.

To solve the above problems, a modified DMP method is proposed for robot control by adding the scaling factor and force coupling term. First, the adjusted cosine similarity is defined to assess the similarity of the generalized trajectory with respect to the demonstrated trajectory. By optimizing the similarity, the trajectories can be generated in all situations. Next, by adding the force coupling term derived from adaptive admittance control to the transformation system of the original DMP, the controller achieves the force control ability. Then, the modified DMP-based robot control system is developed. The stability and convergence of the system are proved.

To tackle this problem, we apply an unsupervised spectral feature selection method to select some informative features, which can better reveal the balanced structure of data. Although spectral feature selection is one of the most popular unsupervised feature selection methods and has been widely studied, none of the existing spectral feature selection methods consider the balance property of data. To address this issue, in this article, we propose a novel balanced spectral feature selection (BSFS) method, which not only selects the discriminative features but also picks those to reveal the balanced structure of data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first spectral feature selection method considering balance structure of data. By introducing a balanced regularization term, we integrate the balanced spectral clustering and feature selection into a unified framework seamlessly. At last, the experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed one outperforms the conventional feature selection methods in both clustering performance and balance, which demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.},

The control design is processed by starting from a 2-D dynamics model with (possibly fast) time varying but bounded uncertainty. The uncertainty bounds are unknown. For compact formation, the CAV system is treated as an artificial swarm system, for which the ideal swarm performance is taken as a desired constraint. By this, formation control is converted into a problem of constraint following and then a performance measure $\beta $ is defined as the control object to evaluate the constraint following error. For collision avoidance, a diffeomorphism transformation on space measure between two vehicles is creatively performed, by which the space measure is positive restricted. For uncertainty handling, an adaptive robust control scheme is proposed to render the $\beta $ -measure to be uniformly bounded and uniformly ultimately bounded, that is, drive the controlled (CAV) swarm system to follow the desired constraint approximatively. As a result, the system can achieve the ideal swarm performance; thereout, compact formation is realized, regardless of the uncertainty. The main contribution of this article is exploring a 2-D formation control scheme for (CAV) swarm system under the consideration of collision avoidance and time-varying uncertainty.},

To address the issues, this article proposes a new type of the deep learning (DL) framework based on EEG and ECG called the product fuzzy convolutional network (PFCN). It should be noted that this article first investigates how to fuse EEG and ECG signals to deal with driving fatigue detection under noise conditions in both simulated and real-field driving environments. Specifically, the PFCN includes three subnetworks. The first uses a fuzzy neural network (FNN) with feedback and a product layer, effectively capturing the particularity and temporal variation of high-dimensional EEG signals and reducing the time-space complexity. The second subnetwork uses a 1-D convolution to convert the ECG data into feature sequences, providing high accuracy and low computational complexity in ECG data classification. The third subnetwork proposes a fusion-separation mechanism to effectively fuse the extracted ECG and EEG features, suppressing the noise interference and ensuring higher detection accuracy. To evaluate the performance of PFCN, a series of experiments has been set up in both simulated and real-field driving environments. The results indicate that the proposed PFCN model has better robustness and detection accuracy compared with several mainstream fatigue detection models.},

  abstract     = {Blood pressure (BP) is one of the most important indicators of health. BP that is too high or too low causes varying degrees of diseases, such as renal impairment, cerebrovascular incidents, and cardiovascular diseases. Since traditional cuff-based BP measurement techniques have the drawbacks of patient discomfort and the impossibility of continuous BP monitoring, noninvasive cuffless continuous BP measurement has become a popular topic. The common noninvasive approach uses machine-learning (ML) algorithms to estimate BP by using the features extracted from simultaneous photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, such as the pulse transit time and pulse wave velocity. This study investigates the BP estimation performance of the novel dendritic neural regression (DNR) method proposed by us. Unlike conventional neural networks, DNR utilizes the multiplication operator as the excitation function in each dendritic branch, inspired by biological neuron phenomena, and can effectively capture nonlinear relationships between distinct input features. In addition, AMSGrad is used as the optimization algorithm to further enhance the dendritic neural model’s performance. The experimental results show that by being fed a combination of the raw features extracted from the ECG and PPG signals and the components of the BP mathematical models, DNR can increase the accuracy of systolic BP, diastolic BP, and mean arterial pressure estimation significantly, which are superior to the state-of-the-art ML techniques. According to the British Hypertension Society protocol, DNR achieves a grade of A for the long-term BP estimation. Considering its architectural simplicity and powerful performance, the proposed method can be regarded as a reliable tool for estimating long-term continuous BP in a noninvasive cuffless way.},

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral image super-resolution (HISR) is about fusing a low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) and a high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) to generate a high-resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI). Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based techniques have been extensively investigated for HISR yielding competitive outcomes. However, existing CNN-based methods often require a huge amount of network parameters leading to a heavy computational burden, thus, limiting the generalization ability. In this article, we fully consider the characteristic of the HISR, proposing a general CNN fusion framework with high-resolution guidance, called GuidedNet. This framework consists of two branches, including 1) the high-resolution guidance branch (HGB) that can decompose the high-resolution guidance image into several scales and 2) the feature reconstruction branch (FRB) that takes the low-resolution image and the multiscaled high-resolution guidance images from the HGB to reconstruct the high-resolution fused image. GuidedNet can effectively predict the high-resolution residual details that are added to the upsampled HSI to simultaneously improve spatial quality and preserve spectral information. The proposed framework is implemented using recursive and progressive strategies, which can promote high performance with a significant network parameter reduction, even ensuring network stability by supervising several intermediate outputs. Additionally, the proposed approach is also suitable for other resolution enhancement tasks, such as remote sensing pansharpening and single-image super-resolution (SISR). Extensive experiments on simulated and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework generates state-of-the-art outcomes for several applications (i.e., HISR, pansharpening, and SISR). Finally, an ablation study and more discussions assessing, for example, the network generalization, the low computational cost, and the fewer network parameters, are provided to the readers.

In this article, we are dedicated to disclosing the natural evolution process of social influence, and further to discussing the consensus reaching issue in SNGDM. First, we establish the social influence evolution model, where the individual’s social influence is obtained by combining his/her intrinsic influence and network influence. Afterward, we design the consensus reaching process based on social influence evolution (CRP-SIE) to assist the individuals to reach a consensus. Furthermore, we use a hypothetical application to show the applicability of the proposed CRP-SIE. Finally, simulation analysis is adopted to investigate the effects of social influence evolution on consensus reaching in SNGDM, and comparative analysis is conducted to demonstrate the advantages of our proposal.},

  abstract     = {Since the last three decades, numerous search strategies have been introduced within the framework of different evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Most of the popular search strategies operate on the hypercube (HC) search model, and search models based on other hypershapes, such as hyper-spherical (HS), are not investigated well yet. The recently developed spherical search (SS) algorithm utilizing the HS search model has been shown to perform very well for the bound-constrained and constrained optimization problems compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms. Nevertheless, the computational burdens for generating an HS locus are higher than that for an HC locus. We propose an efficient technique to construct an HS locus by approximating the orthogonal projection matrix to resolve this issue. As per our empirical experiments, this technique significantly improves the performance of the original SS with less computational effort. Moreover, to enhance SS’s search capability, we put forth a self-adaptation technique for choosing the effective values of the control parameters dynamically during the optimization process. We validate the proposed algorithm’s performance on a plethora of real-world and benchmark optimization problems with and without constraints. Experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithm remains better than or at least comparable to the best-known state-of-the-art algorithms on a wide spectrum of problems.},

  abstract     = {The ability to reconstruct the kinematic parameters of hand movement using noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) is essential for strength and endurance augmentation using exoskeleton/exosuit. For system development, the conventional classification-based brain-computer interface (BCI) controls external devices by providing discrete control signals to the actuator. A continuous kinematic reconstruction from EEG signal is better suited for practical BCI applications. The state-of-the-art multivariable linear regression (mLR) method provides a continuous estimate of hand kinematics, achieving a maximum correlation of up to 0.67 between the measured and the estimated hand trajectory. In this work, three novel source aware deep learning models are proposed for motion trajectory prediction (MTP). In particular, multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM), and wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) for CNN-LSTM are presented. In addition, novelty in the work includes the utilization of brain source localization (BSL) [using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA)] for the reliable decoding of motor intention. The information is utilized for channel selection and accurate EEG time segment selection. The performance of the proposed models is compared with the traditionally utilized mLR technique on the reach, grasp, and lift (GAL) dataset. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is established using the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and trajectory analysis. A significant improvement in the correlation coefficient is observed when compared with the state-of-the-art mLR model. Our work bridges the gap between the control and the actuator block, enabling real-time BCI implementation.},

Besides the conventional objective regarding penalty costs, we have also considered minimizing the total starting times of rolling operations in order to reduce the energy consumption for slab reheating. The problem is complicated by the inevitable uncertainty in rolling processing times, which means deterministic scheduling models will be ineffective. To obtain robust production schedules with satisfactory performance under all possible conditions, we apply the robust optimization (RO) approach to model and solve the scheduling problem. First, an RO model and an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming model are constructed to describe the HSM scheduling problem with uncertainty. Then, we devise an improved Benders’ decomposition algorithm to solve the RO model and obtain exactly optimal solutions. Next, for coping with large-sized instances, a multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm with an embedded local search strategy is proposed to handle the biobjective scheduling problem and find the set of Pareto-optimal solutions. Finally, we conduct extensive computational tests to verify the proposed algorithms. Results show that the exact algorithm is effective for relatively small instances and the metaheuristic algorithm can achieve satisfactory solution quality for both small- and large-sized instances of the problem.},

Our approach is based on a two-level description of the multiagent network. The first level corresponds to the probability density function of the agents’ locations over a given region, in which the multiagent network is treated as one unit (macroscopic description), whereas in the second level, the network is described in terms of the collection of all individual positions of its agents (microscopic description). The goal of the multiagent network is to attain a spatial distribution that (approximately) matches the reference coverage density function (high-level coverage control problem) through local interactions of the agents of the network at the individual level (low-level coverage control problem). We address the high-level control problem by associating it with an interpolation problem in the class of Gaussian mixtures. Furthermore, we address the low-level control problem by utilizing a variation of Lloyd’s algorithm with a time-varying coverage density function, which is updated at each step based on the distribution of the agents’ locations. Because the high-level and the low-level coverage control problems are inherently coupled to each other, we propose an iterative scheme that combines their solutions in order to address the deployment problem in a holistic way.

Due to the integration of wind turbine (WT) with nonlinearity, the T–S fuzzy model of WPS is established for stability analysis and controller design. To mitigate the network burden, a new sampled memory-event-triggered mechanism (SMETM) related to historical system information is presented. It has the following two merits: 1) the utilization of continuous memory outputs over a given interval is useful to reduce the information loss in the period of samples and the redundant triggering events induced by disturbances and noises and 2) an extra upper constraint is added in the triggering condition to generate a new event only when the error signal belongs to a bounded range, thus, the false events caused by measurement outliers can be differentiated out and then be dropped. By representing the memory signal with transmission delay as a time-varying distributed delay term, a T–S fuzzy time-varying distributed delay system is built up to model the $H_{\infty }$ LFC WPS. With the help of the Lyapunov method and the integral inequality relying on distributed delay, some criteria are derived to solve the triggering matrix and fuzzy controllers. Finally, the merits of the proposed SMETM are tested by simulation results.},

To address this concern, in this article we propose a self-paced BLS (SPBLS) model by incorporating the novel self-paced learning (SPL) strategy into the network for noisy data regression. With the assistance of the SPL criterion, the model output is used as feedback to learn appropriate priority weight to readjust the importance of each sample. Such a reweighting strategy can help SPBLS to distinguish samples from “easy” to “difficult” in model training, equipping the model robust to noise and outliers while maintaining the characteristics of the original system. Moreover, two incremental learning algorithms associated to SPBLS have also been developed, with which the system can be updated quickly and flexibly without retraining the entire model when new training samples are added or the network needs to be expanded. Experiments conducted on various datasets demonstrate that the proposed SPBLS can achieve satisfying performance for noisy data regression.},

  abstract     = {Robot learning through kinesthetic teaching is a promising way of cloning human behaviors, but it has its limits in the performance of complex tasks with small amounts of data, due to compounding errors. In order to improve the robustness and adaptability of imitation learning, a hierarchical learning strategy is proposed: low-level learning comprises only behavioral cloning with supervised learning, and high-level learning constitutes policy improvement. First, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based dynamical system is formulated to encode a motion from the demonstration. We then derive the sufficient conditions of the GMM parameters that guarantee the global stability of the dynamical system from any initial state, using the Lyapunov stability theorem. Generally, imitation learning should reason about the motion well into the future for a wide range of tasks; it is significant to improve the adaptability of the learning method by policy improvement. Finally, a method based on exponential natural evolution strategies is proposed to optimize the parameters of the dynamical system associated with the stiffness of variable impedance control, in which the exploration noise is subject to stability conditions of the dynamical system in the exploration space, thus guaranteeing the global stability. Empirical evaluations are conducted on manipulators for different scenarios, including motion planning with obstacle avoidance and stiffness learning.},

  abstract     = {The existing multiattribute decision-making (MADM) methods on multiscale information systems (MSISs) are generally studied from the utility point of view, which may cause two problems: 1) the objects are strictly classified into good or bad, which may lead to misclassification and 2) the risk attitude and psychological behaviors of decision makers are difficult to be reflected. In light of this, this article proposes a wide three-way decision (3WD) model on an MSIS, which combines 3WD theory and regret theory and can precisely make up for these two shortcomings. First, by virtue of regret theory, an outranking relation on the comprehensive MSIS is constructed according to the regret-rejoicing index. Second, objects in the outranking relation are classified into three different domains by a clustering method. In each domain, the ranking of objects can be calculated by using the relative closeness coefficient. Finally, we use the cases in the database to simulate the experiment to verify the decision-making effect of the proposed model. Comparative analysis and experimental analysis also show the effectiveness, superiority, and stability of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {In real industrial processes, factors, such as the change in manufacturing strategy and production technology lead to the creation of multimode industrial processes and the continuous emergence of new modes. Although the industrial SCADA system has accumulated a large amount of historical data, which can be used for modeling and monitoring multimode processes to a certain extent, it is difficult for the model learned from historical data to adapt to emerging modes, resulting in the model mismatch. On the other hand, updating the model with data from new modes allows the model to continuously match the new modes, but it may cause the model to lose the ability to represent the historical modes, resulting in “catastrophic forgetting.” To address these problems, this article proposed a jointly mode-matching and similarity-preserving dictionary learning (JMSDL) method, which updated the model by learning the data of new modes, so that the model can adaptively match the newly emerged modes. At the same time, a similarity metric was put forward to guarantee the representation ability of the proposed method for historical data. A numerical simulation experiment, the CSTH process experiment, and an industrial roasting process experiment indicated that the proposed JMSDL method can match new modes while maintaining its performance on the historical modes accurately. In addition, the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of fault detection and false alarm rate.},

Different from the existing methods, which require complete information of the time-varying reference velocity, in this article, only the time-varying reference orientation information is known by part of the followers and the amplitude of the reference velocity is unknown. To solve the problem, this article proposes a velocity-estimation-based control scheme, which consists of an estimator for estimating the varying rate of the reference orientation, an adaptation law for estimating the amplitude of the reference velocity, and bearing-based control inputs for tracking the leader and achieving the bearing-based formation based on the estimations. Moreover, the scaling formation maneuver can be achieved by using an auxiliary distance measurement. It shows that both the estimation errors and control errors converge to zero under the connectivity of the topology and properties of bearing rigidity. The closed-loop system is analyzed to be semiglobally uniformly asymptotically stable based on the cascaded system theory.

It is shown that if the fractional power in the nonsmooth term becomes −1/2, the GSTA will reduce to the conventional STA. Under the GSTA, it will be rigorously verified by taking advantage of strict Lyapunov analysis that the sliding variables can finite-time converge to an arbitrarily small region in a neighborhood of the origin by tuning the gains and the fractional power.

However, these risers are susceptible to vibrations, which can lead to system performance degradation and fatigue damage. Therefore, effective vibration control strategies are required to address this issue. In this study, a novel adaptive fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategy is adopted to suppress the vibrations of a 3-D riser-vessel system against the effects of actuator failures, backlash-like hysteresis, and external disturbances. A barrier-based Lyapunov function is merged to eliminate the time-varying output constraints of the system. Adaptive FTC laws with projection mapping operators are designed to compensate for parameter uncertainties and consider input nonlinearities to improve system robustness. Finally, a rigorous Lyapunov analysis and numerical simulations are performed to verify the validity of the proposed controller and guarantee uniformly bounded stability of the system.},

Different from the existing event-triggered mechanisms (ETMs), the superiority of DMETM is that not only the past transmitted packets can be utilized but also the amount of utilized packets can be adjusted according to the state error of the power system. Then, the general LFC model of the power system is reconstructed as a switched system on account of the existence of DoS attacks and deception attacks. Based on the reconstructed switched model, an exponentially mean-square stability criterion with an $H_{\infty }$ performance index is derived by constructing appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals (LKFs). Furthermore, the DMETM controllers and event-triggered weighting matrices can be obtained by solving the relevant linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

This article attempts to explore and utilize the relationship between constrained Pareto front (CPF) and unconstrained Pareto front (UPF) to solve CMOPs. Especially, for a given CMOP, the evolutionary process is divided into the learning stage and the evolving stage. The purpose of the learning stage is to measure the relationship between CPF and UPF. To this end, we first create two populations and evolve them by specific learning strategies to approach the CPF and UPF, respectively. Then, the feasibility information and dominance relationship of the two populations are used to determine the relationship. Based on the learned relationship, specific evolving strategies are designed in the evolving stage to improve the utilization efficiency of objective information, so as to better solve this CMOP. By the above process, a new constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (CMOEA) is presented. Comprehensive experimental results on 65 benchmark functions and ten real-world CMOPs show that the proposed method has a better or very competitive performance in comparison with several state-of-the-art CMOEAs. Moreover, this article demonstrates that using the relationship between CPF and UPF to guide the utilization of objective information is promising in solving CMOPs.},

Determining these demands timely and accurately is critically important for the prevention and control of the pandemic. However, even if the infection rate has been estimated, the demands of many medical materials are still difficult to estimate due to their complex relationships with the infection rate and insufficient historical data. To alleviate the difficulties, we propose a co-evolutionary transfer learning (CETL) method for predicting the demands of a set of medical materials, which is important in COVID-19 prevention and control. CETL reuses material demand knowledge not only from other epidemics, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bird flu but also from natural and manmade disasters. The knowledge or data of these related tasks can also be relatively few and imbalanced. In CETL, each prediction task is implemented by a fuzzy deep contractive autoencoder (CAE), and all prediction networks are cooperatively evolved, simultaneously using intrapopulation evolution to learn task-specific knowledge in each domain and using interpopulation evolution to learn common knowledge shared across the domains. Experimental results show that CETL achieves high prediction accuracies compared to selected state-of-the-art transfer learning and multitask learning models on datasets during two stages of COVID-19 spreading in China.},

Then, two novel observer-based approaches are developed for the augmented descriptor system to cope with the FE problem. The first one is a reduced-order FE observer, where the actuator failures can be estimated by the algebraic input reconstruction strategy. The second one refers to an iterative learning observer (ILO) design method, which can obtain the accurate FE result by integrating the estimations in the iterative processes. The two proposed FE observer design methods can avoid the sliding surface switching problem produced by sliding-mode observers in the area of MJSs.

Second, we extend the constructed model via the IVIFSs of loss functions and we discuss the relations between these loss functions based on a similarity measure function-based ranking method and a multiple score function-based ranking method for IVIFSs. Third, we develop our extended models via two ranking methods and we prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal solution of the model. The optimization-based method, along with its algorithm for three-way decisions, is designed in an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Compared to the latest existing methods, our method has three advantages (see Advantages 1–3). Finally, an illustrative example is considered, and the advantages of our approach are demonstrated by this example.},

The Nawaz–Enscore–Ham (NEH) initializing rule, a job-factory assignment strategy, the improved strategies for makespan and energy efficiency are designed based on the problem’s characteristic to improve the Jaya’s performance. Finally, experiments are carried out on 120 instances of 12 scales. The performance of the improved strategies is verified. Comparisons and discussions show that the Jaya algorithm improved by the designed strategies is highly competitive for solving the considered problem with makespan and total energy consumption criteria.},

  abstract     = {Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to classify unseen samples based on the relationship between the learned visual features and semantic features. Traditional ZSL methods typically capture the underlying multimodal data structures by learning an embedding function between the visual space and the semantic space with the Euclidean metric. However, these models suffer from the hubness problem and domain bias problem, which leads to unsatisfactory performance, especially in the generalized ZSL (GZSL) task. To tackle such a problem, we formulate a discriminative cross-aligned variational autoencoder (DCA-VAE) for ZSL. The proposed model effectively utilizes a modified cross-modal-alignment variational autoencoder (VAE) to transform both visual features and semantic features obtained by the discriminative cosine metric into latent features. The key to our method is that we collect principal discriminative information from visual and semantic features to construct latent features which contain the discriminative multimodal information associated with unseen samples. Finally, the proposed model DCA-VAE is validated on six benchmarks including the large dataset ImageNet, and several experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DCA-VAE over most existing embedding or generative ZSL models on the standard ZSL and the more realistic GZSL tasks.},

Up to now, there are few effective control strategies to achieve the above control target. In this article, we propose an effective control method based on the trajectory optimization to realize the system control target, and the main steps of this article are: 1) a continuous trajectory that consists of two segments with design parameters is planned for the actuated link, along which the actuated link can be swung up from the initial states to the final states; 2) the design parameters are optimized by using the intelligent optimization algorithm to guarantee that the states of the underactuated links are continuous at the junction. In this way, the underactuated links are also moved to their final states with the actuated link simultaneously; 3) a tracking controller is designed by using the sliding-mode method to track the trajectory with optimized design parameters, so the endpoint is swung up from the SDEP to the SUEP directly; and 4) a stabilizing controller is further devised through the LQR method to keep the endpoint being stable at the SUEP. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed control method achieves the swing-up and stable control target of the system, and the control performance of the proposed method is superior than that of the existing control methods through the comparisons.},

An event-triggering weight try-once-discard (ET-WTOD) protocol is formulated via two thresholds to determine the transmission of the state signal. The proposed ET-WTOD protocol can dynamically adjust the transmitted nodes and permits only partial components with larger error to be sent at each triggering instant, which is just the key distinction from the existing protocols. Under the imperfect premise matching framework, the controller’s membership functions are reconstructed via the received state and the known upper and lower bounds, and then, a new scheduling signal set is established to design the scheduling-signal-dependent fuzzy sliding-mode controller. With the aid of the membership-function-dependent approach, the mismatching premise variables of the fuzzy model and the controller are effectively handled by introducing some slack matrices, while the relaxed stability conditions are derived to ensure the stability of the closed-loop system and the reachability of the specified sliding surface. Moreover, an optimized sliding domain is further obtained via the genetic algorithm (GA). Finally, the proposed control strategy is verified via the mass-spring-damper system.},

When the consensus level is not high enough, it becomes necessary to adjust the original opinions of decision makers (DMs). To offer the adjustment reference for DMs, we build the programming models to determine the minimum modification to be carried out from the individual and global perspectives. Meanwhile, all DMs are divided into two subgroups: DMs with acceptable and unacceptable consensus levels. If some DMs with unacceptable consensus level do not accept the relevant modifications, the Nash bargaining game-based programming model is built for the fairness and efficiency of modifications. When some DMs refuse to make any modifications or tend to modify the opinions in their way, with respect to different group consensus situations, we make the minimum hybrid penalty mechanism by the Nash bargaining game-based programming models. For each case, we determine the corresponding optimal modification mechanism in view of the fixed individual total modification and the maximum consensus level. Furthermore, we study the arrangements of weights of DMs according to their cardinal and ordinal consensus contributions. Based on these results, we present a new algorithm and illustrate its application by a numerical example. Moreover, we carry out the sensitivity and comparison analysis. We summarize the conclusions and future research directions in the end. The main originality of the new method includes: the fairness and efficiency of modifications, and the determination of the hybrid penalty mechanism.},

To accomplish the control task, an active reconfigurable control scheme is proposed using the local information between agents, as well as the fault values of individuals provided by fault estimation observers. Combining with the Lyapunov stability theorem and the property of the Laplacian matrix, the control gains are calculated using the adaptive technique with a formation tracking feasibility condition. The original reconfigurable protocol is modified by utilizing anti-windup compensators to against saturation phenomenons (both magnitude and rate) in actuators. The simulation results validate that the presented scheme can address the faults as well as the actuator saturation.},

In this study, two periodic sampled-data consensus protocols and an event-triggered consensus protocol are developed. Here, we first propose a new periodic sampled-data consensus protocol that involves the local objective trajectory interaction among agents. The protocol is then improved by applying the finite-time control and sliding-mode control techniques. Notably, the improved protocol can be implemented without the transmission of constructed auxiliary dynamical variables, which is a major feature of the present study. It is shown that complete consensus of the underlying MASs can be achieved by the two proposed protocols with only sampled-data measurements. To further reduce the communication load, we introduce an event-triggered mechanism to obtain a new protocol.

  abstract     = {Multiobjectivization has emerged as a new promising paradigm to solve single-objective optimization problems (SOPs) in evolutionary computation, where an SOP is transformed into a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) and solved by an evolutionary algorithm to find the optimal solutions of the original SOP. The transformation of an SOP into an MOP can be done by adding helper-objective(s) into the original objective, decomposing the original objective into multiple subobjectives, or aggregating subobjectives of the original objective into multiple scalar objectives. Multiobjectivization bridges the gap between SOPs and MOPs by transforming an SOP into the counterpart MOP, through which multiobjective optimization methods manage to attain superior solutions of the original SOP. Particularly, using multiobjectivization to solve SOPs can reduce the number of local optima, create new search paths from local optima to global optima, attain more incomparability solutions, and/or improve solution diversity. Since the term “multiobjectivization” was coined by Knowles et al. in 2001, this subject has accumulated plenty of works in the last two decades, yet there is a lack of systematic and comprehensive survey of these efforts. This article presents a comprehensive multifacet survey of the state-of-the-art multiobjectivization methods.

  abstract     = {Reversible data hiding in ciphertext has potential applications for privacy protection and transmitting extra data in a cloud environment. For instance, an original plain-text image can be recovered from the encrypted image generated after data embedding, while the embedded data can be extracted before or after decryption. However, homomorphic processing can hardly be applied to an encrypted image with hidden data to generate the desired image. This is partly due to that the image content may be changed by preprocessing or/and data embedding. Even if the corresponding plain-text pixel values are kept unchanged by lossless data hiding, the hidden data will be destroyed by outer processing. To address this issue, a lossless data hiding method called random element substitution (RES) is proposed for the Paillier cryptosystem by substituting the to-be-hidden bits for the random element of a cipher value. Moreover, the RES method is combined with another preprocessing-free algorithm to generate two schemes for lossless data hiding in encrypted images. With either scheme, a processed image will be obtained after the encrypted image undergoes processing in the homomorphic encrypted domain. Besides retrieving a part of the hidden data without image decryption, the data hidden with the RES method can be extracted after decryption, even after some processing has been conducted on encrypted images. The experimental results show the efficacy and superior performance of the proposed schemes.},

To achieve the goal of NE seeking within such a context, two estimates are constructed for each agent, namely, an estimate of partial derivatives of the cost function and an estimate of global state values, based on which, an iterative state updating law is elaborately designed. Linear convergence of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated. It is shown that the consistency-constrained multicoalition games investigated in this article put the well-studied networked games among individual players and distributed optimization in a unified framework, and the proposed algorithm can easily degenerate into solutions to these problems.},

  abstract     = {For the existing adaptive constrained robotic control algorithms, the demanding “feasibility conditions” on virtual controller is normally inevitable and the extra limits on constraining functions have to be imposed, making the corresponding approaches more demanding and less user friendly in control development. Here, we develop a new neuroadaptive constrained control strategy for uncertain robotic manipulators in the presence of position and velocity constraints. First, a novel unified mapping function (UMF) is constructed so that the restriction on constraining boundaries is removed and more kinds of constraining forms can be handled. Second, by integrating the UMF-based coordinate transformation with the “universal” approximation characteristic of neural networks over some compact set, the developed neuroadaptive control completely obviates the complicated yet undesired “feasibility conditions.” Furthermore, it is proven that all closed-loop signals are semiglobally bounded and the constraints are not violated. The effectiveness of the proposed control is validated via a two-link rigid robotic manipulator.},

  abstract     = {Existing no-reference (NR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics are still not convincing for evaluating the quality of the camera-captured images. Toward tackling this issue, we, in this article, establish a novel NR quality metric for quantifying the quality of the camera-captured images reliably. Since the image quality is hierarchically perceived from the low-level preliminary visual perception to the high-level semantic comprehension in the human brain, in our proposed metric, we characterize the image quality by exploiting both the low-level image properties and the high-level semantics of the image. Specifically, we extract a series of low-level features to characterize the fundamental image properties, including the brightness, saturation, contrast, noiseness, sharpness, and naturalness, which are highly indicative of the camera-captured image quality. Correspondingly, the high-level features are designed to characterize the semantics of the image. The low-level and high-level perceptual features play complementary roles in measuring the image quality. To infer the image quality, we employ the support vector regression (SVR) to map all the informative features to a single quality score. Thorough tests conducted on two standard camera-captured image databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed quality metric in assessing the image quality and its superiority over the state-of-the-art NR quality metrics. The source code of the proposed metric for camera-captured images is released at https://github.com/YT2015?tab=repositories .},

For the issue, this article investigates an intermittent optimal learning control scheme that considers the partially available information for the learning processing. The performance index is to minimize the summation of the quadratic timewise tracking error and the amplified adjacent-iteration timewise inputs drift while the argument is assigned as the iteration-time-varying learning gain. By adopting the latest captured historical timewise input and the tracking error, the optimal learning gain is achieved. Theoretical analysis conveys that the timewise tracking error is asymptotically convergent along the iteration direction. In particular, the tracking error may vanish at some finite iteration if the amplifier is null. Numerical simulations for a permanent magnet linear motor model testify the validity and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative coevolution (CC) algorithms based on variable decomposition methods are efficient in solving large-scale optimization problems (LSOPs). However, many decomposition methods, such as the differential grouping (DG) method and its variants, are based on the theorem of function additively separable, which may not work well on problems that are not additively separable and will result in a bottleneck for CC to solve various LSOPs. This deficiency motivates us to study how the decomposition method can decompose more kinds of separable functions, such as the multiplicatively separable function, to improve the general problem-solving ability of CC on LSOPs. With this concern, this article makes the first attempt to decompose multiplicatively separable functions and proposes a novel method called dual DG (DDG) for better LSOP decomposition and optimization. The novelty and advantage of DDG are that it can be suitable for not only additively separable functions but also multiplicatively separable functions, which can considerably expand the application scope of CC. In this article, we will first define the multiplicatively separable function, and then mathematically show its relationship to the additively separable function and how they can be transformed into each other. Based on this, the DDG can use two kinds of differences to detect the separable structure of both additively and multiplicatively separable functions. In addition, the time complexity of DDG is analyzed and a DDG-based CC algorithm framework is developed for solving LSOPs. To verify the superiority of DDG, experiments and comparisons with some state-of-the-art and champion algorithms are conducted not only on 30 LSOPs based on the test suite of the IEEE CEC large-scale global optimization competition, but also on a case study of the parameter optimization for a neural network-based application.},

Nevertheless, existing GCN-based methods for graph representation learning mainly focus on static graphs. Although some methods consider the dynamic characteristics of networks, the global structure information, which helps a node to gain worthy features from distant but valuable nodes, has not received enough attention. Moreover, these methods generally update the features of the nodes by averaging the features of neighboring nodes, which may not effectively consider the importance of different neighboring nodes during the aggregation. In this article, we propose a novel representation learning for dynamic graphs based on the GCNs, called DGCN. More specifically, the long short-term memory (LSTM) is utilized to update the weight parameters of GCN for capturing the global structure information across all time steps of dynamic graphs. Besides, a new Dice similarity is proposed to overcome the problem that the influence of directed neighbors is unnoticeable, which is further used to guide the aggregation. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in the field of node clustering and link prediction, and the experimental results show a generally better performance of our proposed DGCN than baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) aims to find a low-dimensional space in which data points in the same class are to be close to each other while keeping data points from different classes apart. To improve the robustness of LDA to non-Gaussian distribution data, most existing discriminant analysis methods extend LDA by approximating the underlying manifold of data. However, these methods suffer from the following problems: 1) local affinity or reconstruction coefficients are learned on the basis of the relationships of all data pairs, which would lead to a sharp increase in the amount of computation and 2) they learn the manifold information in the original space, ignoring the interference of the noise and redundant features. Motivated by these challenges, this article represents a novel discriminant analysis model, called fast and adaptive locality discriminant analysis (FALDA), to improve the efficiency and robustness. First, with the anchor-based strategy, a bipartite graph of each class is constructed to characterize the local structure of data. Since the number of anchor points is far less than that of data points, learning of fuzzy membership relationships between data points and anchor points within each class can save training time. Second, a maximum entropy regularization is introduced to control the uniformity of the weights of graphs and avoid the trivial solution. Third, the above relationships are updated adaptively in the process of dimensionality reduction, which can suppress the interference of the noise and redundant features. Fourth, the whitening constraint is imposed on the projection matrix to remove the relevance between features and restrict the total scatter of data in the subspace. Last but not the least, data with complex distribution can be explicitly divided into sub-blocks according to the learned anchor points (or subclass center points). We test our proposed method on synthetic data, benchmark datasets, and imbalanced datasets. Promising experimental results demonstrate the success of this novel model.},

Based on the Bregman projection-based mirror descent scheme, we present a non-Euclidean method and investigate their convergence behavior. This method is the distributed stochastic composite mirror descent type method (DSCMD-N), which provides a more general algorithm framework. Some new error bounds for DSCMD-N are obtained. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to analyze and derive convergence rates of optimization algorithm in noisy network optimization. We also show that an optimal rate of $O(1/\sqrt {T})$ in nonsmooth convex optimization can be obtained for the proposed method under appropriate communication noise condition. Moveover, novel convergence results are comprehensively derived in expectation convergence, high probability convergence, and almost surely sense.},

To be specific, a boundary-aware landmark intensity (BALI) field is proposed to model more effective facial shape constraints by fusing boundary and landmark intensity field information. Moreover, a self-calibrated pose attention (SCPA) model is designed to provide a self-learned objective function that enforces intermediate supervision without label information by introducing a self-calibrated mechanism and a pose attention mask. We show that by integrating the BALI fields and SCPA model into a novel SCPAN, more facial prior knowledge can be learned and the detection accuracy and robustness of our method for faces with large poses and heavy occlusions have been improved.

  abstract     = {Motion estimation is a fundamental step in dynamic medical image processing for the assessment of target organ anatomy and function. However, existing image-based motion estimation methods, which optimize the motion field by evaluating the local image similarity, are prone to produce implausible estimation, especially in the presence of large motion. In addition, the correct anatomical topology is difficult to be preserved as the image global context is not well incorporated into motion estimation. In this study, we provide a novel motion estimation framework of dense-sparse-dense (DSD), which comprises two stages. In the first stage, we process the raw dense image to extract sparse landmarks to represent the target organ’s anatomical topology, and discard the redundant information that is unnecessary for motion estimation. For this purpose, we introduce an unsupervised 3-D landmark detection network to extract spatially sparse but representative landmarks for the target organ’s motion estimation. In the second stage, we derive the sparse motion displacement from the extracted sparse landmarks of two images of different time points. Then, we present a motion reconstruction network to construct the motion field by projecting the sparse landmarks’ displacement back into the dense image domain. Furthermore, we employ the estimated motion field from our two-stage DSD framework as initialization and boost the motion estimation quality in light-weight yet effective iterative optimization. We evaluate our method on two dynamic medical imaging tasks to model cardiac motion and lung respiratory motion, respectively. Our method has produced superior motion estimation accuracy compared to the existing comparative methods. Besides, the extensive experimental results demonstrate that our solution can extract well-representative anatomical landmarks without any requirement of manual annotation.

Yet, it is still challenging to solve large-scale scheduling problems based on an RL method since learning complexity grows fast as the size of shop floor increases. This challenge becomes more apparent when solving the scheduling problems with a diverse number of job types, which leads to the difficulties in exploration and function approximation in RL. This article presents a scheduling method for semiconductor packaging facilities using deep RL in which an agent allocates a job to one of machines in a centralized manner. Specifically, a novel state representation is introduced to effectively accommodate the variations in the number of available machines and the production requirements. Furthermore, we propose a continuous representation of an action to maintain the size of the action space even when the numbers of jobs, machines, and operation types are subject to change. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate that the proposed method mostly outperforms the metaheuristics and rule-based methods, as well as the other RL approaches considered in terms of makespan while requiring much less computation time than the metaheuristics.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a higher order indirect adaptive iterative learning control (HO-iAILC) scheme is developed for nonlinear nonaffine systems. The inner loop adopts a $P$ -type controller whose set-point is updated iteratively by learning from the iterations. To this end, an ideal nonlinear learning control law is designed in the outer loop. It is then transferred to a linear parametric-learning controller with a corresponding parameter estimation law by introducing an iterative dynamic linearization (IDL) method. This IDL method is also used to gain an iterative linear data model of the nonlinear system. A parameter iterative updating algorithm is utilized for estimating the unknown parameters of the obtained linear data model. Finally, the HO-iAILC is presented that utilizes additional error information to improve the control performance and employs two iterative adaptive mechanisms to deal with uncertainties. The convergence of the proposed HO-iAILC scheme is proved by using two basic mathematical tools, namely: 1) contraction mapping and 2) mathematical induction. Simulation studies are conducted for the verification of the theoretical results.},

The dual asynchronizations characterized by asynchronous modes and mismatched premise variables are tackled simultaneously. Under the PETM, Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy state estimators are first constructed based on the imperfect measurements subject to mixed cyber attacks and exogenous disturbances. Less conservative criteria relying on both fuzzy rules and jumping modes are established to achieve the strictly $(\mathcal {Q},\mathcal {S},\mathcal {R})$ - $\vartheta $ -dissipative finite-time state estimation performance. Furthermore, a synthesis algorithm is derived to calculate the fuzzy state estimator gains by virtue of an improved matrix decoupling technique.

  abstract     = {Localized incomplete multiple kernel $k$ -means (LI-MKKM) is recently put forward to boost the clustering accuracy via optimally utilizing a quantity of prespecified incomplete base kernel matrices. Despite achieving significant achievement in a variety of applications, we find out that LI-MKKM does not sufficiently consider the diversity and the complementary of the base kernels. This could make the imputation of incomplete kernels less effective, and vice versa degrades on the subsequent clustering. To tackle these problems, an improved LI-MKKM, called LI-MKKM with matrix-induced regularization (LI-MKKM-MR), is proposed by incorporating a matrix-induced regularization term to handle the correlation among base kernels. The incorporated regularization term is beneficial to decrease the probability of simultaneously selecting two similar kernels and increase the probability of selecting two kernels with moderate differences. After that, we establish a three-step iterative algorithm to solve the corresponding optimization objective and analyze its convergence. Moreover, we theoretically show that the local kernel alignment is a special case of its global one with normalizing each base kernel matrices. Based on the above observation, the generalization error bound of the proposed algorithm is derived to theoretically justify its effectiveness. Finally, extensive experiments on several public datasets have been conducted to evaluate the clustering performance of the LI-MKKM-MR. As indicated, the experimental results have demonstrated that our algorithm consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ones, verifying the superior performance of the proposed algorithm.},

Nevertheless, in the current literature, word sequences are basically modeled as a classical mixture of word states, which cannot fully exploit the potential of a quantum probabilistic description. A quantum-inspired neural network (NN) module is yet to be developed to explicitly capture the nonclassical correlations within the word sequences. We propose a NN model with a novel entanglement embedding (EE) module, whose function is to transform the word sequence into an entangled pure state representation. Strong quantum entanglement, which is the central concept of quantum information and an indication of parallelized correlations among the words, is observed within the word sequences. The proposed QLM with EE (QLM-EE) is proposed to implement on classical computing devices with a quantum-inspired NN structure, and numerical experiments show that QLM-EE achieves superior performance compared with the classical deep NN models and other QLMs on question answering (QA) datasets. In addition, the post-hoc interpretability of the model can be improved by quantifying the degree of entanglement among the word states.},

  abstract     = {Video-to-speech is the process of reconstructing the audio speech from a video of a spoken utterance. Previous approaches to this task have relied on a two-step process where an intermediate representation is inferred from the video and is then decoded into waveform audio using a vocoder or a waveform reconstruction algorithm. In this work, we propose a new end-to-end video-to-speech model based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) which translates spoken video to waveform end-to-end without using any intermediate representation or separate waveform synthesis algorithm. Our model consists of an encoder–decoder architecture that receives raw video as input and generates speech, which is then fed to a waveform critic and a power critic. The use of an adversarial loss based on these two critics enables the direct synthesis of the raw audio waveform and ensures its realism. In addition, the use of our three comparative losses helps establish direct correspondence between the generated audio and the input video. We show that this model is able to reconstruct speech with remarkable realism for constrained datasets such as GRID, and that it is the first end-to-end model to produce intelligible speech for Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW), featuring hundreds of speakers recorded entirely “in the wild.” We evaluate the generated samples in two different scenarios—seen and unseen speakers—using four objective metrics which measure the quality and intelligibility of artificial speech. We demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms all previous works in most metrics on GRID and LRW.},

This article presents a novel method that controls the gradient descent process of the model parameters in a neural network, by limiting the model parameters within a low-dimensional latent space. The main challenge for implementing this idea is that a decoder with many parameters may be required. To tackle this problem, the article provides an alternative design of the decoder with a structure that shares certain weights, thereby reducing the number of required parameters. In addition, this work combines ensemble learning with the proposed approach to improve the overall learning performance.

The graphs are constructed from the motion groups obtained using an active Langevin framework. These graphs are processed using a deep graph convolutional neural network for crowd characterization. For experimentation, we have prepared a dataset comprising of videos from popular publicly available datasets and our own recorded videos. The proposed framework has been compared with the latest deep learning-based frameworks in terms of accuracy and area under the curve (AUC).

This article mainly focuses on two scenarios: 1) state estimation from partially measured state and 2) state estimation from output data, meaning observer design. The resulting optimization problems are solved using efficient algorithms based on dynamic programming. Concurrently, Dijkstra-type algorithms, which solve equivalent shortest path problems, are also proposed using best-first search. Furthermore, both the proposed algorithms derive novel observer design methods for PBCNs. The proposed algorithms are evaluated with practical estimation problems aiming to the sensor reduction and applied to gene regulatory networks of apoptosis and Lac operon.},

Decision-making may be affected by the absence of sufficient or reasonable trust or to the opposite, an unconditional, excessive, or blind trust, which is called trust risks. The conflict-eliminating process (CEP) aims to facilitate satisfactory consensus by decision makers (DMs) through continuous reconciliation between their opinion differences on the subject matter. This article addresses trust risks in CEP of social network group decision making (SNGDM) through third-party monitoring. A trust risk analysis-based conflict-eliminating model for SNGDM is developed. It is assumed that a third-party agency monitors the DMs’ credibility and performance, which is recorded in an objective evaluation matrix and multi-attribute trust assessment matrix (MTAM). A trust risk measurement methodology is proposed to classify the DMs’ different trust risk types and to measure the trust risk index (TRI) of a group of DMs. When TRI is unacceptable, a trust risk management mechanism that controls TRI is activated. Different management policies are applicable to DMs’ different trust risk types. There are two main methods: 1) dynamically update the MTAM based on DMs’ performance and 2) provide suggestions for modifying the DM’s information with high TRI. Besides, as part of the integrated CEP, this model includes an optimization approach to dynamically derive DMs’ reliable aggregation weights from their MTAM. Simulation experiments and an illustrative example support the feasibility and validity of the proposed model for managing trust risks in CEP of SNGDM.},

  abstract     = {Backpropagation has been successfully generalized to optimize deep spiking neural networks (SNNs), where, nevertheless, gradients need to be propagated back through all layers, resulting in a massive consumption of computing resources and an obstacle to the parallelization of training. A biologically motivated scheme of local learning provides an alternative to efficiently train deep networks but often suffers a low performance of accuracy on practical tasks. Thus, how to train deep SNNs with the local learning scheme to achieve both efficient and accurate performance still remains an important challenge. In this study, we focus on a supervised local learning scheme where each layer is independently optimized with an auxiliary classifier. Accordingly, we first propose a spike-based efficient local learning rule by only considering the direct dependencies in the current time. We then propose two variants that additionally incorporate temporal dependencies through a backward and forward process, respectively. The effectiveness and performance of our proposed methods are extensively evaluated with six mainstream datasets. Experimental results show that our methods can successfully scale up to large networks and substantially outperform the spike-based local learning baselines on all studied benchmarks. Our results also reveal that gradients with temporal dependencies are essential for high performance on temporal tasks, while they have negligible effects on rate-based tasks. Our work is significant as it brings the performance of spike-based local learning to a new level with the computational benefits being retained.},

In this study, the energy consumption is considered in the distributed blocking flow shop scheduling problem (DBFSP). A hyperheuristic with $Q$ -learning (HHQL) is presented to address the energy-efficient DBFSP (EEDBFSP). $Q$ -learning is employed to select an appropriate low-level heuristic (LLH) from a predesigned LLH set according to historical information fed back by LLH. An initialization method, which considers both total tardiness (TTD) and total energy consumption (TEC), is proposed to construct the initial population. The $\varepsilon $ -greedy strategy is introduced to utilize the learned knowledge while retaining a certain degree of exploration in the process of selecting LLH. The acceleration operation of the job on the critical path is designed to optimize TTD. The deceleration operation of the job on the noncritical path is designed to optimize TEC. The statistical and computational experimentation in an extensive benchmark testified that the HHQL outperforms the other comparison algorithm regarding efficiency and significance in solving EEDBFSP.},

Then, based on logarithmic quantized output feedback, the quasisynchronization issue of the NNs was investigated via devising a neoteric dynamic event-triggered controller. In virtue of the classical Lyapunov method and a generalized Halanay inequality, not only corresponding synchronization criteria were obtained to realize the quasisynchronization of master–slave NNs but also a precise upper bound was provided. Moreover, Zeno behavior can be eliminated under the presented scheme in this article. The accuracy of the theoretical outcomes was demonstrated by means of Chua’s circuit. Ultimately, some experimental results of pragmatic application in image encryption/decryption were exposed to substantiate the feasibility and efficacy of the current algorithm for the proposed quaternion-valued NNs.},

The data transmission between neighboring nodes is dependent on the energy level of each sensor, and the internode communication is deemed as a failure when the current energy level is inadequate to guarantee the normal data transmission. Considering the intermittent information exchange over WSNs, a novel distributed state estimator is first constructed via introducing a set of indicator functions, and then the evolution of the probability distribution of energy level and its steady-state distribution is systematically discussed by resorting to the eigenvalue analysis approach and the mathematical induction. Furthermore, the optimal estimator gain is derived by minimizing the trace of the estimation error covariance under known communication sequences. In addition, the convergence of the minimized upper bound of the expected estimation error covariance is analyzed under any initial condition. Finally, an illustrative example regarding the target tracking problem is provided to verify the validity of the obtained theoretical results.},

The proposed framework consists of four steps: 1) controller design; 2) residual generation; 3) performance evaluation; and 4) gain tuning. First, a controller with undetermined gains is constructed, and a fault detection observer is designed to generate residuals that can indicate the fault. Then, the performance of fault detection is evaluated. Finally, suboptimal controller gains are obtained by solving an optimization problem. Within the framework of the collaborative design, the occurring faults can be detected faster and more accurately, and the performance of FTC can be guaranteed at the same time.

  abstract     = {Traditional sequential pattern mining methods were designed for symbolic sequence. As a collection of measurements in chronological order, a time series needs to be discretized into symbolic sequences, and then users can apply sequential pattern mining methods to discover interesting patterns in time series. The discretization will not only cause the loss of some important information, which partially destroys the continuity of time series, but also ignore the order relations between time-series values. Inspired by order-preserving matching, this article explores a new method called order-preserving sequential pattern (OPP) mining, which does not need to discretize time series into symbolic sequences and represents patterns based on the order relations of time series. An inherent advantage of such representation is that the trend of a time series can be represented by the relative order of the values underneath time series. We propose an OPP-Miner algorithm to mine frequent patterns in time series with the same relative order. OPP-Miner employs the filtration and verification strategies to calculate the support and uses the pattern fusion strategy to generate candidate patterns. To compress the result set, we also study to find the maximal OPPs. Experimental results validate that OPP-Miner is not only efficient but can also discover similar subsequences in time series. In addition, case studies show that our algorithms have high utility in analyzing the COVID-19 epidemic by identifying critical trends and improve the clustering performance.

For more general delay without these restrictions, how to design proper adaptive controller and prove rigorously the convergence of error system is still a challenging problem. This article gives a positive answer for this problem. By means of the stability result of unbounded delayed system and some analytical techniques, we prove that the traditional centralized adaptive algorithms can achieve global asymptotical synchronization even if the network delays are unbounded without any derivative constraints. To describe the convergence speed of the synchronization error, adaptive designs depending on a flexible $\omega $ -type function are also provided to control the synchronization error, which can lead exponential synchronization, polynomial synchronization, and logarithmically synchronization. Numerical examples on delayed neural networks and chaotic Ikeda-like oscillator are presented to verify the adaptive designs, and we find that in the case of unbounded delay, the intervention of $\omega $ -type function can promote the realization of synchronization but may destroy the convergence of control gain, and this however will not happen in the case of bounded delay.},

Then, note that a priori bounded uncertainty may impose a priori constraint on the system state before obtaining closed-loop stability. To remove this assumption, an ASMDO with a nested adaptive structure is introduced to effectively estimate and compensate the external disturbances and state-dependent uncertainties in finite time without the information of the upper bound of the uncertainties and disturbances and their derivatives. Furthermore, based on the proposed ASMDO, the finite-time control scheme with the prescribed performance is presented to ensure finite-time convergence and implement the specified transient and steady-state performance. The Lyapunov tools are utilized to analyze the stability of the proposed controller. Finally, the correctness and performance of the proposed controller are illustrated through numerical simulation comparisons and outdoor experimental comparisons.},

A specific class of nonsmooth sign-preserving functions is defined and analyzed for ensuring FT stability. Particularly, the matrix of linear equations is not required to have a full-row rank and the cost function is not necessary to be strictly convex. By introducing auxiliary variables for general linear inequality constraints, reduced sufficient conditions are further derived for the optimization with linear equality and inequality constraints after transformation. In addition, by the nonsmooth analysis, the switching dynamics evolved in both primal and dual variables are carefully investigated and the upper bound on the convergence time is explicitly provided. Moreover, as applications of FT-PDGD, several FT convergent distributed algorithms are designed to solve distributed optimization with separated and coupled linear equations, respectively.

First, 2-D Roesser nonlinear systems are approximated by a kind of 2-D fuzzy affine models with norm-bounded uncertainties. Then, the premise variable space of the 2-D fuzzy affine systems is partitioned into two classes of subspaces, that is: 1) crisp regions and 2) fuzzy regions. For each region, boundary continuity matrices and characterizing matrices are constructed by utilizing the space partition information and 2-D structure. After that, novel piecewise Lyapunov functions are constructed, based on which together with $S$ -procedure, the asymptotic stability with $\mathcal H_{\infty }$ performance is guaranteed for the filtering error system. By the projection lemma and some elegant convexification techniques, the PWA $\mathcal H_{\infty }$ filtering design conditions are obtained.

The automated design of the routing policy by hyperheuristic methods is an effective technique to handle the uncertainty and to achieve online routing for dynamic or stochastic routing problems. Currently, the tree representation routing policy evolved by genetic programming is commonly adopted because of the remarkable flexibility. However, numeric representations have never been used. Considering the practicability of the numeric representations and the capability of the numeric optimization methods, in this article, we investigate two numeric representations on a representative stochastic routing problem and uncertain capacitated arc routing problem. Specifically, a linear representation and an artificial neural-network (ANN) representation are implemented and compared with the tree representation to reveal the potential of the numeric representations and the characteristics of their optimization. Experimental results show that the tree representation is the best choice, but on a majority of the test instances, the numeric representations, especially the ANN representation, can provide competitive performance. Further analyses also show that training a good ANN representation policy requires more training data than the tree representation. Finally, a guideline of representation selection is given.},

  abstract     = {Highly constrained multiobjective optimization problems (HCMOPs) refer to constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs) with complex constraints and small feasible regions, which are commonly encountered in many real-world applications. Current constraint-handling techniques will face two difficulties when dealing with HCMOPs: 1) feasible solution is hard to be found and too much search effort is spent in locating the feasible region and 2) since the total feasible region of an HCMOP can consist of several disconnected subregions, the search process might be stuck in the comparatively larger feasible subregion, which does not contain the whole Pareto front (PF). To address these two issues, an evolutionary algorithm with constraint relaxation strategy based on differential evolution algorithm, that is, CRS-DE, is proposed in this article. In each generation, the CRS-DE relaxes the constraints by dividing the infeasible solutions into two subpopulations based on total constraint violation, that is, the “semifeasible” subpopulation (SF) and “infeasible” subpopulation (IF), respectively. The SF provides information on the promising regions of finding the feasible solution and is the driving force for convergence toward the PF, while the IF focuses on global exploration for new promising regions. Corresponding reproduction and selection strategies are devised for the SF, IF, and feasible subpopulations, which create a clear division of labor with cooperation to facilitate the search for feasible solutions. To leverage the influence of CRS and prevent the population from premature convergence, a mobility restriction mechanism is developed to restrict the individuals in the SF and IF from entering the feasible subpopulation and enhance the diversity of the whole population. Comprehensive experiments on a series of benchmark test problems and a real-world CMOP demonstrate the competitiveness of our method compared with other representative algorithms in terms of effectiveness and reliability in finding a set of well-distributed optimal solutions for HCMOPs.},

As the resultant dynamic model is complicated and uncertain, any model-based control is too costly and seldom practical. Here, we explore a nonmodel-based low-complexity proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control. Unlike traditional PID with fixed gains, the proposed one is embedded with neural-network (NN)-based self-tuning adaptive gains, where the tuning strategy is analytically built upon system stability and performance specifications, such that transient behavior and steady-state performance are ensured. Both square and nonsquare systems are addressed by using the matrix decomposition technique. The benefits and feasibility of the proposed control method are also validated and confirmed by the simulations.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a novel filter pruning method for deep learning networks by calculating the learned representation median (RM) in frequency domain (LRMF). In contrast to the existing filter pruning methods that remove relatively unimportant filters in the spatial domain, our newly proposed approach emphasizes the removal of absolutely unimportant filters in the frequency domain. Through extensive experiments, we observed that the criterion for “relative unimportance” cannot be generalized well and that the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain can eliminate redundancy and emphasize low-frequency representation, which is consistent with the human visual system. Based on these important observations, our LRMF calculates the learned RM in the frequency domain and removes its corresponding filter, since it is absolutely unimportant at each layer. Thanks to this, the time-consuming fine-tuning process is not required in LRMF. The results show that LRMF outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods. For example, with ResNet110 on CIFAR-10, it achieves a 52.3\% FLOPs reduction with an improvement of 0.04\% in Top-1 accuracy. With VGG16 on CIFAR-100, it reduces FLOPs by 35.9\% while increasing accuracy by 0.5\%. On ImageNet, ResNet18 and ResNet50 are accelerated by 53.3\% and 52.7\% with only 1.76\% and 0.8\% accuracy loss, respectively. The code is based on PyTorch and is available at https://github.com/zhangxin-xd/LRMF .},

  abstract     = {With the development of the sensor technology, complementary data of different sources can be easily obtained for various applications. Despite the availability of adequate multisource observation data, for example, hyperspectral image (HSI) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, existing methods may lack effective processing on structural information transmission and physical properties alignment, weakening the complementary ability of multiple sources in the collaborative classification task. The complementary information collaboration manner and the redundancy exclusion operator need to be redesigned for strengthening the semantic relatedness of multisources. As a remedy, we propose a structural optimization transmission framework, namely, structural optimization transmission network (SOT-Net), for collaborative land-cover classification of HSI and LiDAR data. Specifically, the SOT-Net is developed with three key modules: 1) cross-attention module; 2) dual-modes propagation module; and 3) dynamic structure optimization module. Based on above designs, SOT-Net can take full advantage of the reflectance-specific information of HSI and the detailed edge (structure) representations of multisource data. The inferred transmission plan, which integrates a self-alignment regularizer into the classification task, enhances the robustness of the feature extraction and classification process. Experiments show consistent outperformance of SOT-Net over baselines across three benchmark remote sensing datasets, and the results also demonstrate that the proposed framework can yield satisfying classification result even with small-size training samples.},

However, many DA models focus on matching the marginal distributions of two domains and cannot satisfy fault-diagnosed-task requirements. To enhance the ability of DA, a new DA mechanism, called deep joint distribution alignment (DJDA), is proposed to simultaneously reduce the discrepancy in marginal and conditional distributions between two domains. A new statistical metric that can align the means and covariances of two domains is designed to match the marginal distributions of the source and target domains. To align the class conditional distributions, a Gaussian mixture model is used to obtain the distribution of each category in the target domain. Then, the conditional distributions of the source domain are computed via maximum-likelihood estimation, and information entropy and Wasserstein distance are employed to reduce class conditional distribution discrepancy between the two domains. With joint distribution alignment, DJDA can achieve domain confusion to the highest degree. DJDA is applied to the fault transfer diagnosis of a wind turbine gearbox and cross-bearing with unlabeled target-domain samples. Experimental results verify that DJDA outperforms other typical DA models.},

The former equips TR decomposition with the ability to learn the parts-based representation by imposing non-negativity on the core tensors, and the latter additionally introduces a graph regularization to the NTR model to capture manifold geometry information from tensor data. Both of the proposed models extend TR decomposition and can be served as powerful representation learning tools for non-negative multiway data. The optimization algorithms based on an accelerated proximal gradient are derived for NTR and GNTR. We also empirically justified that the proposed methods can provide more interpretable and physically meaningful representations. For example, they are able to extract parts-based components with meaningful color and line patterns from objects.

First, an imperfect PM (IPM) model is established to determine the optimal maintenance plan for each machine, and the optimality is proven. Second, in order to jointly optimize the production scheduling and maintenance planning, a multiobjective optimization model is developed. Third, to deal with this model, an improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III with adaptive reference vector (NSGA-III/ARV) is proposed, in which a hybrid initialization method is designed to obtain a high-quality initial population and a critical-path-based local search (LS) mechanism is constructed to accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm. In the numerical simulation, the effect of parameter setting on the NSGA-III/ARV is investigated by the Taguchi experimental design. After that, the superiority of the improved operators and the overall performance of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated. Next, the comparison of two IPM models is carried out, which verifies the effectiveness of the designed IPM model.

Then, based on the estimations of leader’s system matrices, two adaptive algorithms are given to solve the regulator equations. Furthermore, the fully distributed fixed-time observer-based controllers associated with state feedback and output feedback are, respectively, proposed by employing the pull-based event-triggered mechanism (ETM) where each agent merely updates controller at its own triggering instants. Correspondingly, some sufficient criteria and the rigorous proofs are provided to ensure the implementation of bipartite output consensus in fixed time by using the Lyapunov stability theory and fixed-time stability theory. Moreover, the strictly positive lower bounds of intervals between two adjacent event-triggered times are derived, which means the Zeno behavior is ruled out.

  abstract     = {Community detection in multiview networks has drawn an increasing amount of attention in recent years. Many approaches have been developed from different perspectives. Despite the success, the problem of community detection in adversarial multiview networks remains largely unsolved. An adversarial multiview network is a multiview network that suffers an adversarial attack on community detection in which the attackers may deliberately remove some critical edges so as to hide the underlying community structure, leading to the performance degeneration of the existing approaches. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach, called higher order connection enhanced multiview modularity (HCEMM). The main idea lies in enhancing the intracommunity connection of each view by means of utilizing the higher order connection structure. The first step is to discover the view-specific higher order Microcommunities (VHM-communities) from the higher order connection structure. Then, for each view of the original multiview network, additional edges are added to make the nodes in each of its VHM-communities fully connected like a clique, by which the intracommunity connection of the multiview network can be enhanced. Therefore, the proposed approach is able to discover the underlying community structure in a multiview network while recovering the missing edges. Extensive experiments conducted on 16 real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

To address this issue, this work proposes a weighted BLS (WBLS) in which the weight assigned to each class depends on the number of samples in it. In order to further boost its classification performance, an improved differential evolution algorithm is proposed to automatically optimize its parameters, including the ones in BLS and newly generated weights. We first optimize the parameters with a training dataset, and then apply them to WBLS on a test dataset. The experiments on 20 imbalanced classification problems have shown that our proposed method can achieve higher classification accuracy than the other methods in terms of several widely used performance metrics.

However, existing methods are not effective for handling the case that multiple tasks are partially conflicting. Therefore, for the first time, this article proposes to solve a multitask feature learning problem as a multiobjective optimization problem by developing a genetic programming approach with a new representation to image classification. In the new approach, all the tasks share the same solution space and each solution is evaluated on multiple tasks so that the objectives of all the tasks can be optimized simultaneously using a single population. To learn effective features, a new and compact program representation is developed to allow the new approach to evolving solutions shared across tasks. The new approach can automatically find a diverse set of nondominated solutions that achieve good tradeoffs between different tasks. To further reduce the risk of overfitting, an ensemble is created by selecting nondominated solutions to solve each image classification task. The results show that the new approach significantly outperforms a large number of benchmark methods on six problems consisting of 15 image classification datasets of varying difficulty. Further analysis shows that these new designs are effective for improving the performance. The detailed analysis clearly reveals the benefits of solving multitask feature learning as multiobjective optimization in improving the generalization.},

  abstract     = {Sampling from large dataset is commonly used in the frequent patterns (FPs) mining. To tightly and theoretically guarantee the quality of the FPs obtained from samples, current methods theoretically stabilize the supports of all the patterns in random samples, despite only FPs do matter, so they always overestimate the sample size. We propose an algorithm called multiple sampling-based FPs mining (MSFP). The MSFP first generates the set of approximate frequent items ( $AFI$ ), and uses the $AFI$ to form the set of approximate FPs without supports ( ${\mathrm{ AFP}}^{*}$ ), where it does not stabilize the value of any item’s or pattern’s support, but only stabilizes the relationship $\ge $ or $AFI$ and ${\mathrm{ AFP}}^{*}$ , and can successively prune the patterns not contained by the $AFI$ and not in the ${\mathrm{ AFP}}^{*}$ . Then, the MSFP introduces the Bayesian statistics to only stabilize the values of supports of ${\mathrm{ AFP}}^{*}$ ’s patterns. If a pattern’s support in the original dataset is unknown, the MSFP regards it as random, and keeps updating its distribution by its approximations obtained from the samples taken in the progressive sampling, so the error probability can be bound better. Furthermore, to reduce the I/O processes in the progressive sampling, the MSFP stores a large enough random sample in memory in advance. The experiments show that the MSFP is reliable and efficient.},

  abstract     = {Most existing approaches of attributed network embedding often combine topology and attribute information based on the homophily assumption. In many real-world networks, such an assumption does not hold since the nodes are usually associated with many noisy or irrelevant attributes. To tackle this issue, we propose a noise-resistant graph embedding method, called NGE, by leveraging the subspace clustering information (i.e., the formation of communities is driven by different latent features in distinct subspaces). Specifically, we first construct a tensor to represent a given attributed network and then map it into different feature subspaces to capture community structure via tensor decomposition. For structure embedding, the link-level and community-level constraints are imposed. For attribute embedding, the feature-selection constraint is used to reinforce the relationship between topology and noise-removal attributes. By learning structure and attribute embedding with subspace clustering information, NGE can benefit both community detection, link prediction, and node classification. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated the superiority of NGE over many state-of-the-art approaches.},

Unknown nonlinear functions have been handled based on fuzzy-logic systems (FLSs) approximation, and the distributed virtual controllers together with their parameter adaptive laws are first designed by combining the adaptive backstepping algorithm and the bounded estimation algorithm. To compensate for the intermittent actuator faults, the novel adaptive fuzzy consensus fault-tolerant controllers are then developed by co-designing the last virtual controllers. On the basis of the Lyapunov theory, the stability analysis of the closed-loop system are given, in which the tracking errors converge to zero asymptotically under the directed communication topologies theory. Finally, the proposed FTC scheme is carried on a group of one-link robotic manipulator systems, and its practicability and effectiveness are verified.},

However, in reality, data usually reside in distributed parties such as different institutions and may not be directly gathered and integrated due to various data policy constraints. As a result, some parties may suffer from insufficient data available for training machine learning models. In this article, we propose a multiparty dual learning (MPDL) framework to alleviate the problem of limited data with poor quality in an isolated party. Since the knowledge-sharing processes for multiple parties always emerge in dual forms, we show that dual learning is naturally suitable to handle the challenge of missing data, and explicitly exploits the probabilistic correlation and structural relationship between dual tasks to regularize the training process. We introduce a feature-oriented differential privacy with mathematical proof, in order to avoid possible privacy leakage of raw features in the dual inference process. The approach requires minimal modifications to the existing multiparty learning structure, and each party can build flexible and powerful models separately, whose accuracy is no less than nondistributed self-learning approaches. The MPDL framework achieves significant improvement compared with state-of-the-art multiparty learning methods, as we demonstrated through simulations on real-world datasets.},

The switched signal is considered to follow a time-varying probability distribution, the switching of which is considered to have a random dwell time. The asynchronous state feedback control (SFC) is studied to achieve the control objective. This kind of control can avoid the failure of the control due to the inconsistency between the system mode and the control mode, so the results obtained are more general. Using the semitensor product of matrices, the algebraic form of the considered BCN is represented. Under this framework, sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure that the closed-loop system is stochastic stabilized with a prescribed $l_{1}$ -induced performance level $\gamma $ . Parameters can be solved by inequalities. In addition, when the dwell time converges to infinity, the probability distribution of the switched signal becomes fixed. Necessary and sufficient conditions are presented to ensure the stabilization of the closed system under asynchronous SFC as well as the design of the asynchronous SFC. Then, sufficient condition is obtained for the prescribed $l_{1}$ -induced performance level. Examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {When teleoperating a multirobot system (MRS) in outdoor environments, human operators can often detect obstacles that are not detected by robots and spot emergencies faster than robots do. However, the lack of efficient methods for operators to manipulate an MRS has limited the number of robots in a human–robot team. To handle this problem, a distributed hierarchical shared control scheme is proposed, aiming to provide a safe and flexible control interface for a few human operators to interact with a large MRS. The proposed hierarchical control scheme employs a two-layered structure. In the upper layer, intention field networks are designed to generate virtual human control signals. Two functionalities for human teleoperation, called: 1) group management and 2) motion intervention, are realized using intention fields, allowing the operators to split the robot formation into different groups and steer individual robots away from immediate danger. In parallel, a blending-based shared control algorithm is designed in the lower layer to resolve the conflict between human intervention inputs and autonomous formation control signals. The input-to-output stability (IOS) of the proposed distributed hierarchical shared control scheme is proved by exploiting the properties of weighting functions. Results from a usability testing experiment and a physical experiment are also presented to validate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method.},

The method is composed mainly of partition of input space, formation of input hyper-box information granules with confidence levels, and granulation of output data corresponding to input hyper-box information granules. Among them, the formation of input hyper-box information granules is realized through performing the hyper-box iteration granulation algorithm governed by information granularity on input space, and the granulation of out data corresponding to input hyper-box information granules is completed by the improved principle of justifiable granularity to produce triangular fuzzy information granules. Compared with the existing granular models, the resulting one can yield the more accurate numeric and preferable granular outcomes simultaneously. Experiments completed on the synthetic and publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of the granular model designed by the proposed method at granular and numeric levels.

It is shown that bipartite containment tracking is achieved for signed networks despite any topology conditions. To be specific, every leader group realizes modulus consensus and the leaders dominate the dynamic evolutions of signed networks such that all followers converge within the bounded zone spanned by the leaders’ converged states and their symmetric states. Furthermore, conditions on the zero convergence of dynamic control inputs are exploited, together with those on the (interval) bipartite consensus of signed networks.

However, due to the relatively less informative yet computationally heavy encoder, and considerably large action space inherent to the 3-D BPP, existing DRL methods are only able to handle up to 50 boxes. In this article, we propose to alleviate this issue via a DRL agent, which sequentially addresses three subtasks of sequence, orientation, and position, respectively. Specifically, we exploit a multimodal encoder, where a sparse attention subencoder embeds the box state to mitigate the computation while learning the packing policy, and a convolutional neural network subencoder embeds the view state to produce auxiliary spatial representation. We also leverage an action representation learning in the decoder to cope with the large action space of the position subtask. Besides, we integrate the proposed DRL agent into constraint programming (CP) to further improve the solution quality iteratively by exploiting the powerful search framework in CP. The experiments show that both the sole DRL and hybrid methods enable the agent to solve large-scale instances of 120 boxes or more. Moreover, they both could deliver superior performance against the baselines on instances of various scales.},

For the case that the communication network graph is undirected, a decentralized adaptive controller, which is based on the exchanged neighbors’ information from the same cluster, is designed such that all the agents reach PCCL consensus.

  abstract     = {Automated tuning can significantly improve productivity and save the costs of manual operation in the microwave filter manufacturing industry. This article proposes a mathematical model of scattering data optimization to find the accurate coupling matrix for multiple-version microwave filters, a core step of automated microwave filter tuning. For the large-scale problem of coupling coefficient combination, we propose a decision set decomposition strategy that evenly divides the entire frequency interval into several subintervals according to the correlation between scattering data. With this strategy, we design a microscale (small-size subsets of the decomposed decision set) searching algorithm, which solves each suboptimization problem by searching the decision subset instead of the entire decision set. To verify the validity of the proposed algorithm for multiple-version microwave filters, experiments are conducted on three versions of microwave filters from a real-world production line, including the two-port eighth-order, ninth-order, and tenth-order microwave filters. Experimental results show that the proposed model is feasible within the industrial error for the multiversion microwave filter tuning problem. Besides, the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art optimization algorithms in the coupling matrix optimization problem.},

Starting from the aspect of a class of distributed parameter systems described by highly dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs), an event-triggered optimal control (ETOC) method based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) for the roller kiln temperature field is proposed. First, we formulate the event-triggered control problem of the temperature field under the general framework of PDE systems. Then, an event-triggered condition is designed based on the stability of the closed-loop PDE system, which also guarantees the upper bound of the performance index. Subsequently, ADP technology is adopted to realize the ETOC, where the critic network is employed to approximate the optimal value function. Since the studied system can be regarded as an impulsive dynamic system with flow dynamics and jump dynamics simultaneously, the stability of the impulsive dynamic system combined with the ADP-based closed-loop PDE system is proved. Finally, simulation results on the temperature field verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Distributed differential evolution (DDE) is an efficient paradigm that adopts multiple populations for cooperatively solving complex optimization problems. However, how to allocate fitness evaluation (FE) budget resources among the distributed multiple populations can greatly influence the optimization ability of DDE. Therefore, this article proposes a novel three-layer DDE framework with adaptive resource allocation (DDE-ARA), including the algorithm layer for evolving various differential evolution (DE) populations, the dispatch layer for dispatching the individuals in the DE populations to different distributed machines, and the machine layer for accommodating distributed computers. In the DDE-ARA framework, three novel methods are further proposed. First, a general performance indicator (GPI) method is proposed to measure the performance of different DEs. Second, based on the GPI, a FE allocation (FEA) method is proposed to adaptively allocate the FE budget resources from poorly performing DEs to well-performing DEs for better search efficiency. This way, the GPI and FEA methods achieve the ARA in the algorithm layer. Third, a load balance strategy is proposed in the dispatch layer to balance the FE burden of different computers in the machine layer for improving load balance and algorithm speedup. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to show why the proposed DDE-ARA framework can be effective and to discuss the lower bound of its optimization error. Extensive experiments are conducted on all the 30 functions of CEC 2014 competitions at 10, 30, 50, and 100 dimensions, and some state-of-the-art DDE algorithms are adopted for comparisons. The results show the great effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework and the three novel methods.},

  abstract     = {This article attempts to realize zero-error constrained tracking for hypersonic flight vehicles (HFVs) subject to unknown control directions and asymmetric flight state constraints. The main challenges of reaching such goals consist in that addressing multiple unknown control directions requires novel conditional inequalities encompassing the summation of multiple Nussbaum integral terms, and in that the summation of conditional inequality may be bounded even when each term approaches infinity individually, but with opposite signs. To handle this challenge, novel Nussbaum functions that are designed in such a way that their signs keep the same on some periods of time are incorporated into the control design, which not only ensures the boundedness of multiple Nussbaum integral terms but preserves that velocity and altitude tracking errors eventually converge to zero. Fuzzy-logic systems (FLSs) are exploited to approximate model uncertainties. Asymmetric integral barrier Lyapunov functions (IBLFs) are adopted to handle the fact that the operating regions of flight state variables are asymmetric in practice, while ensuring the validity of fuzzy-logic approximators. Comparative simulations validate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology in guaranteeing convergence, smoothness, constraints satisfaction, and in handling unknown control directions.},

However, we note that it is infeasible to determine the precise cost values even with great domain knowledge for those cost-sensitive machine-learning methods. So in this method, due to the superiority of F-measure on evaluating the performance of imbalanced data classification, we employ F-measure to calculate the cost information and propose a cost-sensitive hypergraph learning method with F-measure optimization to solve the imbalanced issue. In this method, we employ the hypergraph structure to explore the high-order relationships among the imbalanced data. Based on the constructed hypergraph structure, we optimize the cost value with F-measure and further conduct cost-sensitive hypergraph learning with the optimized cost information.

Unfortunately, those methods usually analyze the prior structural information within different dimensions indiscriminately, ignoring the differences between modes, leaving substantial room for improvement. In this article, we first consider the low-rank properties in the subspace and prove that the structure correlation across the nonlocal self-similarity mode is much stronger than in the spatial sparsity and spectral correlation modes. On that basis, we introduce a new multidirectional low-rank regularization, in which each mode is assigned a different weight to characterize its contribution to estimating the tensor rank. After that, integrating the proposed regularization with the subspace-based tensor recovery framework, an optimization model for HSI mixed noise removal is developed. The proposed model can be addressed efficiently via the alternating minimization algorithm. Extensive experiments implemented with synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art HSI denoising methods, which clearly indicates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in HSI denoising.},

  abstract     = {Developing a computer-aided diagnostic system for detecting various skin malignancies from images has attracted many researchers. Unlike many machine-learning approaches, such as artificial neural networks, genetic programming (GP) automatically evolves models with flexible representation. GP successfully provides effective solutions using its intrinsic ability to select prominent features (i.e., feature selection) and build new features (i.e., feature construction). Existing approaches have utilized GP to construct new features from the complete set of original features and the set of operators. However, the complete set of features may contain redundant or irrelevant features that do not provide useful information for classification. This study aims to develop a two-stage GP method, where the first stage selects prominent features, and the second stage constructs new features from these selected features and operators, such as multiplication in a wrapper approach to improve the classification performance. To include local, global, texture, color, and multiscale image properties of skin images, GP selects and constructs features extracted from local binary patterns and pyramid-structured wavelet decomposition. The accuracy of this GP method is assessed using two real-world skin image datasets captured from the standard camera and specialized instruments, and compared with commonly used classification algorithms, three state of the art, and an existing embedded GP method. The results reveal that this new approach of feature selection and feature construction effectively helps improve the performance of the machine-learning classification algorithms. Unlike other black-box models, the evolved models by GP are interpretable; therefore, the proposed method can assist dermatologists to identify prominent features, which has been shown by further analysis on the evolved models.},

  abstract     = {Building a quality service-based system (SBS) is one of the most important research topics in software engineering. Many studies investigate intelligent methods to simplify the process of building SBSs. In particular, some keyword-based SBS building methods allow service users to automatically build an SBS by only providing a few of keywords. This type of work usually constructs a directed weighted graph of a service repository. A set of minimum-weight group Steiner trees (MSTs) is extracted from the graph to represent the service functions and their relations. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing keyword-based SBS building methods allow the relaxation of the function requirements for a user. A relaxed SBS may achieve a comparable functionality versus a complete SBS containing all the query functions. To fill in the above gap, we define a new problem: a bounded skyline SBS building problem, whose solution is more adaptive and less limited than the traditional keyword-based SBS building methods. To solve this problem, we propose two algorithms based on skyline query, dynamic programming, and lower bound pruning. In the experiments, we collect real-world datasets and label the nodes with keywords. We conduct a comprehensive study to demonstrate the time efficiency of our algorithms on automatically finding SBSs. We make the annotated real-world datasets and our source code open to peer researchers.},

A local Kriging model prefers to select points with good predicted fitness and great uncertainty, which can effectively prevent the search from getting trapped into local optima. When the local Kriging model finds the best solution so far, a reward search strategy is executed to further exploit the local Kriging model. The experiments on a set of benchmark functions with dimensions varying from 30 to 200 are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

  abstract     = {Planning a practical three-dimensional (3-D) flight path for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a key challenge for the follow-up management and decision making in disaster emergency response. The ideal flight path is expected to balance the total flight path length and the terrain threat, to shorten the flight time and reduce the possibility of collision. However, in the traditional methods, the tradeoff between these concerns is difficult to achieve, and practical constraints are lacking in the optimized objective functions, which leads to inaccurate modeling. In addition, the traditional methods based on gradient optimization lack an accurate optimization capability in the complex multimodal objective space, resulting in a nonoptimal path. Thus, in this article, an accurate UAV 3-D path planning approach in accordance with an enhanced multiobjective swarm intelligence algorithm is proposed (APPMS). In the APPMS method, the path planning mission is converted into a multiobjective optimization task with multiple constraints, and the objectives based on the total flight path length and degree of terrain threat are simultaneously optimized. In addition, to obtain the optimal UAV 3-D flight path, an accurate swarm intelligence search approach based on improved ant colony optimization is introduced, which can improve the global and local search capabilities by using the preferred search direction and random neighborhood search mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed APPMS method was demonstrated in three groups of simulated experiments with different degrees of terrain threat, and a real-data experiment with 3-D terrain data from an actual emergency situation.},

  abstract     = {This article studies an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided communication system under the time-varying channels and stochastic data arrivals. In this system, we jointly optimize the phase-shift coefficient and the transmit power in sequential time slots to maximize the long-term energy consumption for all mobile devices while ensuring queue stability. Due to the dynamic environment, it is challenging to ensure queue stability. In addition, making real-time decisions in each short time slot also needs to be considered. To this end, we propose a method (called LETO) that combines Lyapunov optimization with evolutionary transfer optimization (ETO) to solve the above optimization problem. LETO first adopts Lyapunov optimization to decouple the long-term stochastic optimization problem into deterministic optimization problems in sequential time slots. As a result, it can ensure queue stability since the deterministic optimization problem in each time slot does not involve future information. After that, LETO develops an evolutionary transfer method to solve the optimization problem in each time slot. Specifically, we first define a metric to identify the optimization problems in past time slots similar to that in the current time slot, and then transfer their optimal solutions to construct a high-quality initial population in the current time slot. Since ETO effectively accelerates the search, we can make real-time decisions in each short time slot. Experimental studies verify the effectiveness of LETO by comparison with other algorithms.},

Therein, the settling time is independent of initial conditions and can be defined in advance. Then, for first-order MASs, distributed adaptive fuzzy controllers are designed by combining neighboring consensus errors to drive all following agents to globally track the leader’s state within predefined time. For second-order MASs, by formulating filtered errors, the consensus errors between following agents and the leader are shown to be bounded if the filtered errors are bounded. Furthermore, with the distributed controllers designed based on filtered errors, second-order MASs achieve semiglobally uniformly predefined-time-bounded leader-following consensus. Finally, two numerical examples are simulated, including: 1) a first-order leader-following MAS and 2) a second-order Lagrangian system consisting of single-link manipulators, to demonstrate the performance of the proposed controllers.},

  abstract     = {Automatic polyp segmentation from colonoscopy videos is a prerequisite for the development of a computer-assisted colon cancer examination and diagnosis system. However, it remains a very challenging task owing to the large variation of polyps, the low contrast between polyps and background, and the blurring boundaries of polyps. More importantly, real-time performance is a necessity of this task, as it is anticipated that the segmented results can be immediately presented to the doctor during the colonoscopy intervention for his/her prompt decision and action. It is difficult to develop a model with powerful representation capability, yielding satisfactory segmentation results and, simultaneously, maintaining real-time performance. In this article, we present a novel lightweight context-aware network, namely, PolypSeg+, attempting to capture distinguishable features of polyps without increasing network complexity and sacrificing time performance. To achieve this, a set of novel lightweight techniques is developed and integrated into the proposed PolypSeg+, including an adaptive scale context (ASC) module equipped with a lightweight attention mechanism to tackle the large-scale variation of polyps, an efficient global context (EGC) module to promote the fusion of low-level and high-level features by excluding background noise and preserving boundary details, and a lightweight feature pyramid fusion (FPF) module to further refine the features extracted from the ASC and EGC. We extensively evaluate the proposed PolypSeg+ on two famous public available datasets for the polyp segmentation task: 1) Kvasir-SEG and 2) CVC-Endoscenestill. The experimental results demonstrate that our PolypSeg+ consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art networks by achieving better segmentation accuracy in much less running time.

  abstract     = {Multiview spectral clustering (MVSC) has achieved state-of-the-art clustering performance on multiview data. Most existing approaches first simply concatenate multiview features or combine multiple view-specific graphs to construct a unified fusion graph and then perform spectral embedding and cluster label discretization with $k$ -means to obtain the final clustering results. They suffer from an important drawback: all views are treated as fixed when fusing multiple graphs and equal when handling the out-of-sample extension. They cannot adaptively differentiate the discriminative capabilities of multiview features. To alleviate these problems, we propose a flexible MVSC with self-adaptation (FMSCS) method in this article. A self-adaptive learning scheme is designed for structured graph construction, multiview graph fusion, and out-of-sample extension. Specifically, we learn a fusion graph with a desirable clustering structure by adaptively exploiting the complementarity of different view features under the guidance of a proper rank constraint. Meanwhile, we flexibly learn multiple projection matrices to handle the out-of-sample extension by adaptively adjusting the view combination weights according to the specific contents of unseen data. Finally, we derive an alternate optimization strategy that guarantees desirable convergence to iteratively solve the formulated unified learning model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared with state-of-the-art MVSC approaches.

Moreover, it requires to address a high-dimensional optimization problem with extensive computational complexity for image reconstruction. In this article, we provide a deep learning (DL) strategy for BCS, called AutoBCS, which automatically takes the prior knowledge of images into account in the acquisition step and establishes a reconstruction model for performing fast image reconstruction. More precisely, we present a learning-based sensing matrix to accomplish image acquisition, thereby capturing and preserving more image characteristics than those captured by the existing methods. In addition, we build a noniterative reconstruction network, which provides an end-to-end BCS reconstruction framework to maximize image reconstruction efficiency. Furthermore, we investigate comprehensive comparison studies with both traditional BCS approaches and newly developed DL methods. Compared with these approaches, our proposed AutoBCS can not only provide superior performance in terms of image quality metrics (SSIM and PSNR) and visual perception but also automatically benefit reconstruction speed.},

For MMOPs, the algorithm is required both to enlarge population diversity for locating more global optima and to enhance refine ability for increasing the accuracy of the obtained solutions. Thus, numerous niching techniques have been proposed to divide the population into different niches, and each niche is responsible for searching on one or more peaks. However, it is often a challenge to distinguish proper individuals as niche centers in existing niching approaches, which has become a key issue for efficiently solving MMOPs. In this article, the niche center distinguish (NCD) problem is treated as an optimization problem and an NCD-based differential evolution (NCD-DE) algorithm is proposed. In NCD-DE, the niches are formed by using an internal genetic algorithm (GA) to online solve the NCD optimization problem. In the internal GA, a fitness-entropy measurement objective function is designed to evaluate whether a group of niche centers (i.e., encoded by a chromosome in the internal GA) is promising. Moreover, to enhance the exploration and exploitation abilities of NCD-DE in solving the MMOPs, a niching and global cooperative mutation strategy that uses both niche and population information is proposed to generate new individuals. The proposed NCD-DE is compared with some state-of-the-art and recent well-performing algorithms. The experimental results show that NCD-DE achieves better or competitive performance on both the accuracy and completeness of the solutions than the compared algorithms.},

Different optimization problems and different stages of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) generally require different types of surrogate models. To address this issue, in this article, we present a multisurrogate-assisted multitasking particle swarm optimization algorithm to seek multiple optimal solutions of EMMOPs at a low computational cost. The proposed algorithm first transforms an EMMOP into a multitasking optimization problem by integrating various surrogate models, and designs a multitasking niche particle swarm algorithm to solve it. Following that, a surrogate model management strategy based on the skill factor and clustering is developed to effectively balance the number of real function evaluations and the prediction accuracy of candidate optimal solutions. In addition, an adaptive local search strategy based on the trust region is proposed to enhance the capability of swarm in exploiting potential optimal modalities. We compare the proposed algorithm with five state-of-the-art SAEAs and seven multimodal EAs on 19 benchmark functions and the building energy conservation problem and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain multiple highly competitive optimal solutions.},

The common Lyapunov function method is used to restrain arbitrary switching problems in the system, and the actuator compensation technique is introduced to tackle the failure faults and bias faults in the actuators. By combining the backstepping DSC design technique and fractional-order stability theory, a novel NN adaptive switching FTC algorithm is proposed. Under the operation of the proposed algorithm, the stability and control performance of the fractional-order systems can be guaranteed. Finally, a simulation example of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) system reveals the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed scheme.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, ensemble methods have shown sterling performance and gained popularity in visual tasks. However, the performance of an ensemble is limited by the paucity of diversity among the models. Thus, to enrich the diversity of the ensemble, we present the distillation approach—learning from experts (LFEs). Such method involves a novel knowledge distillation (KD) method that we present, specific expert learning (SEL), which can reduce class selectivity and improve the performance on specific weaker classes and overall accuracy. Through SEL, models can acquire different knowledge from distinct networks with various areas of expertise, and a highly diverse ensemble can be obtained afterward. Our experimental results demonstrate that, on CIFAR-10, the accuracy of the ResNet-32 increases 0.91\% with SEL, and that the ensemble trained by SEL increases accuracy by 1.13\%. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, for example, DML only improves accuracy by 0.3\% and 1.02\% on single ResNet-32 and the ensemble, respectively. Furthermore, our proposed architecture also can be applied to ensemble distillation (ED), which applies KD on the ensemble model. In conclusion, our experimental results show that our proposed SEL not only improves the accuracy of a single classifier but also boosts the diversity of the ensemble model.},

However, this assumption may fail to hold when the number of objectives is large or when the shape of the Pareto front is complex. To address the above issues, we propose a knee-oriented solution augmentation (KSA) framework that converts the Pareto front into a multimodal auxiliary function whose basins correspond to the knee regions of the Pareto front. The auxiliary function is then approximated using a surrogate and its basins are identified by a peak detection method. Additional solutions are then generated in the detected basins in the objective space and mapped to the decision space with the help of an inverse model. These solutions are evaluated by the original objective functions and added to the given solution set. To assess the quality of the augmented solution set, a measurement is proposed for the verification of knee solutions when the true Pareto front is unknown. The effectiveness of KSA is verified on widely used benchmark problems and successfully applied to a hybrid electric vehicle controller design problem.},

  abstract     = {The usage of social media around the world is ever-increasing. Social media statistics from 2019 show that there are 3.5 billion social media users worldwide. However, the existence of community structure renders the network vulnerable to attacks and large-scale losses. How does one comprehensively consider the multiple information sources and effectively evaluate the vulnerability of the community? To answer this question, we design a gravity-based community vulnerability evaluation (GBCVE) model for multiple information considerations. Specifically, we construct the community network by the Jensen–Shannon divergence and log-sigmoid transition function to show the relationship between communities. The number of edges inside community and outside of each community, as well as the gravity index are the three important factors used in this model for evaluating the community vulnerability. These three factors correspond to the interior information of the community, small-scale interaction relationship, and large-scale interaction relationship, respectively. A fuzzy ranking algorithm is then used to describe the vulnerability relationship between different communities, and the sensitivity of different weighting parameters is then analyzed by Sobol’ indices. We validate and demonstrate the applicability of our proposed community vulnerability evaluation method via three real-world complex network test examples. Our proposed model can be applied to find vulnerable components in a network to mitigate the influence of public opinions or natural disasters in real time. The community vulnerability evaluation results from our proposed model are expected to shed light on other properties of communities within social networks and have real-world applications across network science.},

In this article, the nonstationarity of GPs in the tested functions is theoretically analyzed. In addition, this article constructs an NSGP where the SGP is a degenerate case. Performance comparisons of the NSGP with the SGP and the NSGP-assisted EA (NSGP-MAEA) with the SGP-assisted EA (SGP-MAEA) are carried out on a set of benchmark problems and an antenna design problem.

  abstract     = {Online users are typically active on multiple social media networks (SMNs), which constitute a multiplex social network. With improvements in cybersecurity awareness, users increasingly choose different usernames and provide different profiles on different SMNs. Thus, it is becoming increasingly challenging to determine whether given accounts on different SMNs belong to the same user; this can be expressed as an interlayer link prediction problem in a multiplex network. To address the challenge of predicting interlayer links, feature or structure information is leveraged. Existing methods that use network embedding techniques to address this problem focus on learning a mapping function to unify all nodes into a common latent representation space for prediction; positional relationships between unmatched nodes and their common matched neighbors (CMNs) are not utilized. Furthermore, the layers are often modeled as unweighted graphs, ignoring the strengths of the relationships between nodes. To address these limitations, we propose a framework based on multiple types of consistency between embedding vectors (MulCEVs). In MulCEV, the traditional embedding-based method is applied to obtain the degree of consistency between the vectors representing the unmatched nodes, and a proposed distance consistency index based on the positions of nodes in each latent space provides additional clues for prediction. By associating these two types of consistency, the effective information in the latent spaces is fully utilized. In addition, MulCEV models the layers as weighted graphs to obtain representation. In this way, the higher the strength of the relationship between nodes, the more similar their embedding vectors in the latent representation space will be. The results of our experiments on several real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed MulCEV framework markedly outperforms current embedding-based methods, especially when the number of training iterations is small.},

In this article, we thereby propose to transform the 2-D motion synthesis into a pose conditioned realistic motion image generation task considering the promising performance of pose estimation technology and generative adversarial nets (GANs). However, the problem is that GAN is only suitable to do the region-aligned image translation task while motion synthesis involves a large number of spatial deformations. To avoid this drawback, we design a two-step and multistream network architecture. First, we train a special GAN to generate the body segment images with given poses in step-I. Then in step-II, we input the body segment images as well as the poses into the multistream network so that it only needs to generate the textures in each aligned body region. Besides, we provide a real face as another input of the network to improve the face details of the generated motion image. The synthesized results with realism and sharp details on four training sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

However, most of the existing algorithms converge slowly in the later stage. This article proposes a novel two-stage data-driven evolutionary optimization (TS-DDEO) that meets the requirements of early exploration and later exploitation. In the first stage, a surrogate-assisted hierarchical particle swarm optimization method is used to find a promising area from the entire search space. In the second stage, we propose a best-data-driven optimization (BDDO) method with a strong exploitation ability to accelerate the optimization process. BDDO has a real-time update mechanism for the surrogate model and population and uses a predefined number of ranking-top solutions to update population and surrogates. BDDO combines three surrogate-assisted evolutionary sampling strategies: 1) surrogate-assisted differential evolution sampling; 2) surrogate-assisted local search; and 3) a surrogate-assisted full-crossover (FC) strategy which is proposed to integrate existing best genotypes in the population. Experiments and analysis have validated the effectiveness of the two-stage framework, the BDDO method, and the FC strategy. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is compared with five state-of-the-art SAEAs on high-dimensional benchmark functions. The result shows that TS-DDEO performs better both in effectiveness and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the private car aggregation effect is conducive to a broad range of applications, from intelligent transportation management to urban planning. However, this work is challenging, especially on weekends, due to the inefficient representations of spatiotemporal features for such aggregation effect and the considerable randomness of private car mobility on weekends. In this article, we propose a deep learning framework for a spatiotemporal attention network (STANet) with a neural algorithm logic unit (NALU), the so-called STANet-NALU, to understand the dynamic aggregation effect of private cars on weekends. Specifically: 1) we design an improved kernel density estimator (KDE) by defining a log-cosh loss function to calculate the spatial distribution of the aggregation effect with guaranteed robustness and 2) we utilize the stay time of private cars as a temporal feature to represent the nonlinear temporal correlation of the aggregation effect. Next, we propose a spatiotemporal attention module that separately captures the dynamic spatial correlation and nonlinear temporal correlation of the private car aggregation effect, and then we design a gate control unit to fuse spatiotemporal features adaptively. Further, we establish the STANet-NALU structure, which provides the model with numerical extrapolation ability to generate promising prediction results of the private car aggregation effect on weekends. We conduct extensive experiments based on real-world private car trajectories data. The results reveal that the proposed STANet-NALU outperforms the well-known existing methods in terms of various metrics, including the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL), and R2.},

  abstract     = {Crowd sequential annotations can be an efficient and cost-effective way to build large datasets for sequence labeling. Different from tagging independent instances, for crowd sequential annotations, the quality of label sequence relies on the expertise level of annotators in capturing internal dependencies for each token in the sequence. In this article, we propose modeling sequential annotation for sequence labeling with crowds (SA-SLC). First, a conditional probabilistic model is developed to jointly model sequential data and annotators’ expertise, in which categorical distribution is introduced to estimate the reliability of each annotator in capturing local and nonlocal label dependencies for sequential annotation. To accelerate the marginalization of the proposed model, a valid label sequence inference (VLSE) method is proposed to derive the valid ground-truth label sequences from crowd sequential annotations. VLSE derives possible ground-truth labels from the tokenwise level and further prunes subpaths in the forward inference for label sequence decoding. VLSE reduces the number of candidate label sequences and improves the quality of possible ground-truth label sequences. The experimental results on several sequence labeling tasks of Natural Language Processing show the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

To compensate this failure, a fault-tolerant controller is proposed. Moreover, each state needs to be kept within the constraints, so the tangent Barrier Lyapunov function is selected to solve the full-state constraint problem, and the unknown nonlinear function is approximated by fuzzy-logic systems (FLSs). We also proved that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded. Furthermore, the states can be kept within the predetermined range even if the actuator fails.

  abstract     = {In many domains of empirical sciences, discovering the causal structure within variables remains an indispensable task. Recently, to tackle unoriented edges or latent assumptions violation suffered by conventional methods, researchers formulated a reinforcement learning (RL) procedure for causal discovery and equipped a REINFORCE algorithm to search for the best rewarded directed acyclic graph. The two keys to the overall performance of the procedure are the robustness of RL methods and the efficient encoding of variables. However, on the one hand, REINFORCE is prone to local convergence and unstable performance during training. Neither trust region policy optimization, being computationally expensive, nor proximal policy optimization (PPO), suffering from aggregate constraint deviation, is a decent alternative for combinatory optimization problems with considerable individual subactions. We propose a trust region-navigated clipping policy optimization method for causal discovery that guarantees both better search efficiency and steadiness in policy optimization, in comparison with REINFORCE, PPO, and our prioritized sampling-guided REINFORCE implementation. On the other hand, to boost the efficient encoding of variables, we propose a refined graph attention encoder called SDGAT that can grasp more feature information without priori neighborhood information. With these improvements, the proposed method outperforms the former RL method in both synthetic and benchmark datasets in terms of output results and optimization robustness.},

By using the NNs to identify the unknown nonlinear functions, a neural-network-based state observer is designed to estimate the unmeasurable states of the SNSs. Based on the quartic Lyapunov function, the stability of stochastic closed-loop systems is analyzed.

The communication between the controller and sensors is implemented through a shared network, on which the signal transmissions are scheduled by the RR protocol. The considered ITOs are modeled by a sequence of impulsive signals whose amplitudes (i.e., the norms of all impulsive signals) and interval lengths (i.e., the duration between all adjacent impulsive signals) are greater than two known thresholds, respectively. The occurrence moment for each ITO is first examined by using a certain outlier detection approach, and then a novel parameter-dependent tracking controller is proposed to protect the tracking performance from ITOs by removing the “harmful” signals (i.e., the transmitted signals contaminated by ITOs). Sufficient conditions are presented to ensure the exponentially ultimate boundedness of the resulted tracking error, and the controller gain matrices are subsequently designed by solving a constrained optimization problem. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed outlier-resistant tracking control scheme.},

To this end, a distributed adaptive Nash equilibrium solution is proposed for the differential graphical games. This solution, in contrast to the existing ones, is not only Nash but also fully distributed in the sense that each agent only uses local information of its own and its immediate neighbors without using any global information of the communication graph. Moreover, the asymptotic stability and global Nash equilibrium properties are analyzed for the proposed distributed adaptive Nash equilibrium solution.

  abstract     = {Engineering design is traditionally performed by hand: an expert makes design proposals based on past experience, and these proposals are then tested for compliance with certain target specifications. Testing for compliance is performed first by computer simulation using what is called a discipline model. Such a model can be implemented by finite element analysis, multibody systems approach, etc. Designs passing this simulation are then considered for physical prototyping. The overall process may take months and is a significant cost in practice. We have developed a Bayesian optimization (BO) system for partially automating this process by directly optimizing compliance with the target specification with respect to the design parameters. The proposed method is a general framework for computing the generalized inverse of a high-dimensional nonlinear function that does not require, for example, gradient information, which is often unavailable from discipline models. We furthermore develop a three-tier convergence criterion based on: 1) convergence to a solution optimally satisfying all specified design criteria; 2) detection that a design satisfying all criteria is infeasible; or 3) convergence to a probably approximately correct (PAC) solution. We demonstrate the proposed approach on benchmark functions and a vehicle chassis design problem motivated by an industry setting using a state-of-the-art commercial discipline model. We show that the proposed approach is general, scalable, and efficient and that the novel convergence criteria can be implemented straightforwardly based on the existing concepts and subroutines in popular BO software packages.},

The objective is to ensure bounded tracking when only a portion of agents has access to the desired trajectory while agents interact with each other through a directed communication network. To achieve this goal, we propose a protocol consisting of a consensus-based trajectory estimator followed by a controller tracking the estimated trajectory for each agent. Though the agents involved in the mission are heterogeneous, the estimators of all the agents are designed as coupled single integrators to provide estimates of the acceleration, velocity, and position along the desired trajectory. The coupled single-integrator estimator followed by the tracking controller strategy leads to a decoupling whereby the allowable estimator gains for an agent depend only on its communication delays and its controller gains depend only on its input delay. The tracking errors remain bounded even if the desired acceleration is unknown to all the agents. Simulation results are carried out to validate the proposed consensus tracking algorithm.},

In PSD, a population update strategy is designed and the mean-shift clustering is employed to predict the promising subregions of EMMOP. In LSP, a local RBF surrogate model is constructed for each promising subregion and each local RBF surrogate model tracks a global optimum of EMMOP. In this way, an EMMOP is decomposed into many expensive global optimization subproblems. To handle these subproblems, a popular DE variant, JADE, acts as the search engine to deal with these subproblems.

  abstract     = {Task allocation is a crucial issue of mobile crowdsensing. The existing crowdsensing systems normally select the optimal participants giving no consideration to the sudden departure of mobile users, which significantly affects the sensing quality of tasks with a long sensing period. Furthermore, the ability of a mobile user to collect high-precision data is commonly treated as the same for different types of tasks, causing the unqualified data for some tasks provided by a competitive user. To address the issue, a dynamic task allocation model of crowdsensing is constructed by considering mobile user availability and tasks changing over time. Moreover, a novel indicator for comprehensively evaluating the sensing ability of mobile users collecting high-quality data for different types of tasks at the target area is proposed. A new $Q$ -learning-based hyperheuristic evolutionary algorithm is suggested to deal with the problem in a self-learning way. Specifically, a memory-based initialization strategy is developed to seed a promising population by reusing participants who are capable of completing a particular task with high quality in the historical optima. In addition, taking both sensing ability and cost of a mobile user into account, a novel comprehensive strength-based neighborhood search is introduced as a low-level heuristic (LLH) to select a substitute for a costly participant. Finally, based on a new definition of the state, a $Q$ -learning-based high-level strategy is designed to find a suitable LLH for each state. Empirical results of 30 static and 20 dynamic experiments expose that this hyperheuristic achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Based on the measure, a relative FRS model is introduced to remedy the mentioned imperfection of classical FRSs. Then, the positive region, negative region, and boundary region are defined to measure the uncertainty of data with the relative FRSs. Besides, a relative fuzzy dependency is defined to evaluate the importance of features to decision. With the proposed feature evaluation, we propose a feature selection algorithm and design a classifier based on the maximal positive region. The classification principle is that an unlabeled sample will be classified into the class corresponding to the maximal degree of the positive region. Experimental results show the relative fuzzy dependency is an effective and efficient measure for evaluating features, and the proposed feature selection algorithm presents better performance than some classical algorithms. Besides, it also shows the proposed classifier can achieve slightly better performance than the KNN classifier, which demonstrates that the maximal positive region-based classifier is effective and feasible.},

From prior studies, we know that comments that come directly from readers are full of emotions. Therefore, in this article, we propose a deep learning framework that first merges article and comment information to predict readers’ emotions. At the same time, in the prediction process, we design a pseudo comment representation for unpublished news articles by the comments of published news. In addition, a better model is required to encode articles that contain implicit emotions. To solve this problem, we propose a block emotion attention network (BEAN) to encode news articles better. It includes an emotion attention mechanism and a hierarchical structure to capture emotion words and generate structural information during encoding. Experiments performed on three public datasets show that BEAN achieves the state-of-the-art average Pearson (AP) and accuracy (Acc@1). Moreover, results on four self-collected datasets show that both the introduction of emotional comments and BEAN in our framework improve the ability to predict readers’ emotions.},

By using a new punishment mechanism-combined recurrent neural network (PMRNN) proposed in this article with reference to the varying-gain neural-dynamic design (VG-NDD) formula, the TVQP problem-based motion-planning scheme can be solved and the optimal angles and velocities of joints of RRMs can also be obtained in the working space. Then, the convergence performance of the PMRNN model in solving the TVQP problem is analyzed theoretically in detail. This novel method has been substantiated to have a faster calculation speed and better accuracy than the traditional method. In addition, the PMRNN model has also been successfully applied to an actual RRM to complete an end-effector trajectory tracking task.},

First, a new principle of finite-time convergence for absolutely continuous functions is developed if a fractional derivative inequality is satisfied. Next, in order to remove the assumption that the leader’s system matrix is known to all agents in previous studies, a distributed adaptive finite-time observer is designed, which can estimate not only the leader’s state but also the leader’s system matrix. Then, a novel finite-time event-triggered compensator with intermittent communication is constructed to estimate the leader’s state by introducing a dynamic threshold for a novel triggering function. In this case, the high frequency triggering is restrained and the triggering number is significantly reduced. The Zeno behavior does not exist by choosing parameters appropriately. In addition, two finite-time control strategies are constructed based on the above distributed observer and event-triggered compensator, respectively, to achieve output consensus in finite time. The feasibility of the proposed method is ensured by the comprehensive theoretical demonstration of the finite-time consensus stability and the analysis of the Zeno behavior. Finally, the examples are given to demonstrate the conclusion.},

  abstract     = {Pattern recognition is significantly challenging in real-world scenarios by the variability of visual statistics. Therefore, most existing algorithms relying on the independent identically distributed assumption of training and test data suffer from the poor generalization capability of inference on unseen testing datasets. Although numerous studies, including domain discriminator or domain-invariant feature learning, are proposed to alleviate this problem, the data-driven property and lack of interpretation of their principle throw researchers and developers off. Consequently, this dilemma incurs us to rethink the essence of networks’ generalization. An observation that visual patterns cannot be discriminative after style transfer inspires us to take careful consideration of the importance of style features and content features. Does the style information related to the domain bias? How to effectively disentangle content and style features across domains? In this article, we first investigate the effect of feature normalization on domain adaptation. Based on it, we propose a novel normalization module to adaptively leverage the propagated information through each channel and batch of features called disentangling batch instance normalization (D-BIN). In this module, we explicitly explore domain-specific and domaininvariant feature disentanglement. We maneuver contrastive learning to encourage images with the same semantics from different domains to have similar content representations while having dissimilar style representations. Furthermore, we construct both self-form and dual-form regularizers for preserving the mutual information (MI) between feature representations of the normalization layer in order to compensate for the loss of discriminative information and effectively match the distributions across domains. D-BIN and the constrained term can be simply plugged into state-of-the-art (SOTA) networks to improve their performance. In the end, experiments, including domain adaptation and generalization, conducted on different datasets have proven their effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the problem of uncovering complex network structure and dynamics from time series is prominent in many fields. Despite the recent progress in this area, reconstructing large-scale networks from limited data remains a tough problem. Existing works treat connections of nodes as continuous values, leaving a challenge of setting a proper cut-off value to distinguish whether the connections exist or not. Besides, their performances on large-scale networks are far from satisfactory. Considering the reconstruction error and sparsity as two objectives, this article proposes a subspace learning-based evolutionary multiobjective network reconstruction algorithm, called SLEMO-NR, to solve the aforementioned problems. In the evolutionary process, we assume that binary-coded individuals obey the Bernoulli distribution and can use the probability and natural parameter as alternative representations. Moreover, our approach utilizes the logistic principal component analysis (LPCA) to learn a subspace containing the features of the network structure. The offspring solutions are generated in the learned subspace and then can be mapped back to the original space via LPCA. Benefitting from the alternative representations, a preference-based local search operator (PLSO) is proposed to concentrate on finding solutions approximate to the true sparsity. The experimental results on synthetic networks and six real-world networks demonstrate that, due to the well-learned network structure subspace and the preference-based strategy, our approach is effective in reconstructing large-scale networks compared to six existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Electronic health records (EHRs) have been heavily used in modern healthcare systems for recording patients’ admission information to health facilities. Many data-driven approaches employ temporal features in EHR for predicting specific diseases, readmission times, and diagnoses of patients. However, most existing predictive models cannot fully utilize EHR data, due to an inherent lack of labels in supervised training for some temporal events. Moreover, it is hard for the existing methods to simultaneously provide generic and personalized interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose Sherbet, a self-supervised graph learning framework with hyperbolic embeddings for temporal health event prediction. We first propose a hyperbolic embedding method with information flow to pretrain medical code representations in a hierarchical structure. We incorporate these pretrained representations into a graph neural network (GNN) to detect disease complications and design a multilevel attention method to compute the contributions of particular diseases and admissions, thus enhancing personalized interpretability. We present a new hierarchy-enhanced historical prediction proxy task in our self-supervised learning framework to fully utilize EHR data and exploit medical domain knowledge. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on widely used publicly available EHR datasets to verify the effectiveness of our model. Our results demonstrate the proposed model’s strengths in both predictive tasks and interpretable abilities.},

  abstract     = {In nonstationary environments, data distributions can change over time. This phenomenon is known as concept drift, and the related models need to adapt if they are to remain accurate. With gradient boosting (GB) ensemble models, selecting which weak learners to keep/prune to maintain model accuracy under concept drift is nontrivial research. Unlike existing models such as AdaBoost, which can directly compare weak learners’ performance by their accuracy (a metric between [0, 1]), in GB, weak learners’ performance is measured with different scales. To address the performance measurement scaling issue, we propose a novel criterion to evaluate weak learners in GB models, called the loss improvement ratio (LIR). Based on LIR, we develop two pruning strategies: 1) naive pruning (NP), which simply deletes all learners with increasing loss and 2) statistical pruning (SP), which removes learners if their loss increase meets a significance threshold. We also devise a scheme to dynamically switch between NP and SP to achieve the best performance. We implement the scheme as a concept drift learning algorithm, called evolving gradient boost (LIR-eGB). On average, LIR-eGB delivered the best performance against state-of-the-art methods on both stationary and nonstationary data.},

An integral sliding-mode control protocol, which forces the system trajectory to move on to the defined sliding manifold at the initial moment, is proposed for solving the prescribed-time consensus tracking problem of leader-following MASs with disturbances. Furthermore, we propose a slightly different control law based on terminal sliding-mode control, and under such a controller, the trajectories of each follower reach the sliding manifold in an arbitrary assigned time $T_{1}$ , and then in a specified time $T_{2}$ , the position and velocity tracking errors for all followers converge to 0 at the same time instant. Based on the graph theory, state transformations, and Lyapunov theorem, we prove that the proposed solutions are feasible and, finally, three simulation examples are provided to verify the theoretical results.},

Moreover, the measurement data transmitted from the sensor to the estimator are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Especially, false data-injection (FDI) attacks are frequently encountered in the power system state estimation (PSSE) process. In the case of measurement delays, an FDI attack strategy is designed to interfere with the state estimator and evade detection by the chi-square detector. By utilizing the attacked estimated information and the uncorrupted measurement information, two measurement residual vectors are designed. According to these two residual vectors, a chi-square-based attack detection method is proposed, which has the ability to detect the attack without being affected by the delayed measurements. The proposed KF algorithm and attack detection method are implemented on an IEEE 14-bus system and they are confirmed to be effective and feasible.},

This work is concerned with optimizing the convergence rate of the consensus algorithm in such systems with time delays. Previous approaches optimize either the robustness to time delay or the convergence rate separately, while imposing a limit on the other. Eigenratio optimization is another method, which does not necessarily result in a unique set of weights. Here, the problem is treated in its general form as a multiobjective optimization problem. It is shown that the corresponding Pareto frontier depends solely on the optimal condition number of the Laplacian, and it includes the optimal answer of previously adopted approaches as special cases. A notion of optimal consensusability is then defined, which allows a particular point on the Pareto Frontier with special properties to be identified. The resulting optimization problem is shown to be convex, as is solved by reformulating it as a standard semidefinite programming problem. The optimal weights for individual topologies, clique lifted graphs, and different types of subgraphs are provided, where for the latter, the optimal weights have shown to be independent of the rest of topology. Through numerical simulations, the tradeoff between robustness and convergence rate is demonstrated.},

The system is divided into two subsystems for the design of controllers. The state-observer gain is designed for one subsystem using the concept of perfect regulation to ensure disturbance estimation performance. The state-feedback gains of the other subsystem are designed based on a stability condition in the form of a linear matrix inequality (LMI). A tracking specification is embedded in the LMI-based stability condition to ensure satisfactory tracking performance.

To assess how hand preference (or dominance) affects learned controllers, we extend, validate, and apply a nonparametric modeling method to estimate the concurrent feedback and feedforward controllers. We find that performance improves because feedback adapts, regardless of the hand used. We do not detect statistically significant differences in performance or learned controllers between hands.

  abstract     = {The problem of fault prognosis in the context of discrete event systems (DESs) is a crucial subject to study the security and maintenance of cyber–physical systems. In this article, the decentralized fault prognosis of partially observed DESs is analyzed with a universal state-estimate-based protocol. It follows $(M,K)$ as the performance bound of any expected decentralized prognosers, where any fault can be predicted $K$ steps before its occurrence and the fault is guaranteed to occur within $M$ steps once a corresponding fault alarm is issued. To determine whether expected decentralized prognosers exist, the notion of state-estimate-coprognosability (SE-coprognosability) under the case of one fault type is proposed. Compared with existing other kinds of coprognosability, SE-coprognosability is a more generalized concept. Meanwhile, combining the formal method and algebraic state space approach, a novel state estimation algorithm is presented and based on which, the verification of SE-coprognosability is also solved.},

  abstract     = {Logistics interfaces with manufacturing throughout the entire production process need synchronous operations. For achieving integrated organization and operations between manufacturing and logistics, this article introduces the concept of shop-floor logistics and manufacturing synchronization with four principles, including: 1) synchronization-oriented manufacturing system; 2) synchronized information sharing; 3) synchronized decision making; and 4) synchronized operations. The marriage of the principles rendered the development of an overall framework of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and digital twin-enabled graduation intelligent manufacturing system (GiMS). A mixed-integer programming-based synchronization mechanism is proposed under GiMS. To meet the requirement of fast decision making in real-life shop-floor logistics and manufacturing synchronization problems, an equivalent constraint programming model is developed and tested. The observation and analysis of the case company show the advantage of the proposed concept and approach with the best performance regarding key performance indicators. The concept of synchronization provides an insight for understanding the interaction of logistics and manufacturing at the operational level. This article potentially enables manufacturers to reevaluate and develop their manufacturing planning and control strategies in the IIoT and digital twin-based manufacturing environment.},

The attacks on the edges instead of nodes are considered, where we allow different attack intensities but at least one edge is connected in each attacking interval. Affected by output disturbance, the sensor feedback signal of every agent is inaccurate, which will reduce the approximation accuracy of the observer. Then, we design a signal to revise the sensor feedback signal subject to disturbance. Meanwhile, a prescribed performance function is used to ensure the transient and steady-state performance of error. Leveraging the Lyapunov stability theory and the backstepping technique, a distributed output-feedback control scheme subject to asymmetric saturation nonlinearity is designed. For the asymmetric input saturation, an auxiliary signal is designed to simplify the designed progress of controller input. To deal with the inherent problem of “explosion of complexity” emerging with backstepping, dynamic surface control is utilized. It is proved that the consensus errors converge to small neighborhoods of the origin, and all signals within the closed-loop system are bounded. Finally, simulation results are offered to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Existing DA diagnosis methods under the assumption of sharing identical label space across domains fail to work. What is more, labeled samples can be collected from different sources, where multisource information fusion is rarely considered. To handle this issue, a multisource open-set DA diagnosis approach is developed. Specifically, multisource domain data of different operation conditions sharing partial classes are adopted to take advantage of fault information. Then, an open-set DA network is constructed to mitigate the domain gap across domains. Finally, a weighting learning strategy is introduced to adaptively weigh the importance on feature distribution alignment between known class and unknown class samples. Extensive experiments suggest that the proposed approach can substantially boost the performance of open-set diagnosis issues and outperform existing diagnosis approaches.},

For the image collected by the multibeam forward-looking sonar image, this algorithm uses the YOLO v3 network to determine the target in a sonar image and obtain the position of the target. Then, a time profit Elman neural network (TPENN) is constructed to predict the trajectory information of the dynamic target.

Finally, underwater tracking of the dynamic target is realized using the model predictive controller (MPC), and the tracking result is stable and reliable.

  abstract     = {With the increasing accessibility of remote sensing videos, remote sensing tracking is gradually becoming a hot issue. However, accurately detecting and tracking in complex remote sensing scenes is still a challenge. In this article, we propose a collaborative learning tracking network for remote sensing videos, including a consistent receptive field parallel fusion module (CRFPF), dual-branch spatial-channel co-attention (DSCA) module, and geometric constraint retrack strategy (GCRT). Considering the small-size objects of remote sensing scenes are difficult for general forward networks to extract effective features, we propose a CRFPF-module to establish parallel branches with consistent receptive fields to separately extract from shallow to deep features and then fuse hierarchical features adaptively. Since the objects and their background are difficult to distinguish, the proposed DSCA-module uses the spatial-channel co-attention mechanism to collaboratively learn the relevant information, which enhances the saliency of the objects and regresses to precise bounding boxes. Considering the interference of similar objects, we designed a GCRT-strategy to judge whether there is a false detection through the estimated motion trajectory and then recover the correct object by weakening the feature response of interference. The experimental results and theoretical analysis on multiple datasets demonstrate our proposed method’s feasibility and effectiveness.

Therefore, how to effectively extract interimage correspondence is crucial for the CoSOD task. In this article, we propose a global-and-local collaborative learning (GLNet) architecture, which includes a global correspondence modeling (GCM) and a local correspondence modeling (LCM) to capture the comprehensive interimage corresponding relationship among different images from the global and local perspectives. First, we treat different images as different time slices and use 3-D convolution to integrate all intrafeatures intuitively, which can more fully extract the global group semantics. Second, we design a pairwise correlation transformation (PCT) to explore similarity correspondence between pairwise images and combine the multiple local pairwise correspondences to generate the local interimage relationship. Third, the interimage relationships of the GCM and LCM are integrated through a global-and-local correspondence aggregation (GLA) module to explore more comprehensive interimage collaboration cues. Finally, the intra and inter features are adaptively integrated by an intra-and-inter weighting fusion (AEWF) module to learn co-saliency features and predict the co-saliency map. The proposed GLNet is evaluated on three prevailing CoSOD benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our model trained on a small dataset (about 3k images) still outperforms 11 state-of-the-art competitors trained on some large datasets (about 8k–200k images).},

To measure the consensus degree, a consensus index that considers the information granules of linguistic terms (LTs) is defined. On this basis, a suitable optimization model is established to realize the group consensus adaptively by optimizing the allocation of information granules of LTs with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. With an objective to reduce the information loss during aggregation phases, the process of generating comprehensive assessments of alternatives with the evidential reasoning (ER) algorithm is presented.

First, to achieve parallel control, an augmented nonlinear system (ANS) with an augmented performance index (API) is proposed to introduce the control input into the feedback system. The control stability relationship between the ANS and the original system is analyzed, and it is shown that, by choosing a proper API, optimal control of the ANS with the API can be seen as near-optimal control of the original system with the original performance index (OPI). Second, based on parallel control, a novel event-triggered scheme is proposed, and then a novel ETNOC method is developed using the time-triggered optimal value function of the ANS with the API. The control stability is proved, and an upper bound, which is related to the design parameter, is provided for the actual performance index in advance. Then, to implement the developed ETNOC method for unknown DT nonlinear systems, a novel online learning algorithm is developed without reconstructing unknown systems, and neural network (NN) and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) techniques are employed in the developed algorithm. The convergence of the signals in the closed-loop system (CLS) is shown using the Lyapunov approach, and the assumption of boundedness of input dynamics is not required.

  abstract     = {This article studies the problem of event-triggered adaptive fault-tolerant fuzzy output feedback consensus tracking control for nonlinear fractional-order multiagent systems with actuator failures under a directed graph. Considering the fact that the actual system works near the equilibrium point most of the time, a novel dynamic event-triggering strategy with the reset mechanism is proposed, where the dynamic threshold can be actively adjusted according to the preset conditions, so that the resource utilization can be further reduced. Based on an improved event-based consensus error, the state estimator about the derivative of reference trajectory and the adaptive law about the information of graph are constructed, which makes distributed consensus tracking control achieved without obtaining global information. Then, by introducing two adaptive compensating terms to deal with actuator failures and event-triggered measurement errors, it is shown in the sense of fractional-order stability criterion that tracking errors can converge to a compact set even if the fault parameters and modes are completely unknown. Finally, the correctness of the presented method is verified by a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {In this article, an extended state observer (ESO) design problem is investigated for uncertain nonlinear systems subject to limited network bandwidth. First, for rational information exchange scheduling, a dynamic event-triggered (DET) communication protocol is proposed. Different from the traditional static event-triggered strategies with fixed thresholds, an internal dynamic variable is introduced to be adaptively adjusted by a dual-directional regulating mechanism. Thus, more desirable tradeoff between observation performance and communication resource efficiency is achieved. Second, inspired by our early work on Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy ESO (TSFESO), a novel paradigm of event-triggered TSFESO is initially proposed. Third, under the DET mechanism, the TSFESO design approach is derived to carry out exponential convergence for estimation error dynamics. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by numerical examples. The nonlinear estimating efficiency and linear numerical tractability are integrated in TSFESO. In addition, a generalized ESO formulation is developed to allow some nonadditive uncertainties incompatible with total disturbance, such as improved event-triggered strategy, and thus, the application sphere of ESO is further expanded.},

Due to the limited understanding of the process of interest, modeling uncertainties are generally inevitable, significantly reducing the convergence rate of the control systems. However, huge amounts of measured process data interacting with model uncertainties can easily be collected. Incorporating these data into the optimal controller design could unlock new opportunities to reduce the error of the current trail optimization. Based on several existing optimal ILC methods, we incorporate the online process data into the optimal and robust optimal ILC design, respectively. Our methodology, called CIM, utilizes the process data for the first time by applying the convex cone theory and maps the data into the design of control inputs. CIM-based optimal ILC and robust optimal ILC methods are developed for uncertain systems to achieve better control performance and a faster convergence rate. Next, rigorous theoretical analyses for the two methods have been presented, respectively.

For relieving communication burden and preventing possible data collisions, two types of scheduling protocols, namely: 1) the Round-Robin (RR) protocol and 2) weighted try-once-discard (WTOD) protocol, are applied, respectively, to coordinate the transmission sequence. In addition, considering that the communication channel may suffer from mode-dependent probabilistic deception attacks, a hidden Markov-like model is proposed to characterize the relationship between the malicious signal and system mode. Then, a novel adaptive neural state estimator is presented to reconstruct the system states. By taking the influence of deception attacks into performance analysis, sufficient conditions under two different scheduling protocols are derived, respectively, so as to ensure the ultimately boundedness of the estimate error.

  abstract     = {In the study of salient object detection, multiview features play an important role in identifying various underlying salient objects. As to current common patch-based methods, all different features are handled directly by stacking them into a high-dimensional vector to represent related image patches. These approaches ignore the correlations inhering in the original spatial structure, which may lead to the loss of certain underlying characterization such as view interaction. In this article, different from currently available approaches, a tensorial feature representation framework is developed for the salient object detection in order to better explore the complementary information of multiview features. Under the tensor framework, a tensor low-rank constraint is applied to the background to capture its intrinsic structure, a tensor group sparsity regularization is posed on the salient part, and a tensorial sliced Laplacian regularization is then introduced to enlarge the gap between the subspaces of the background and salient object. Moreover, a nonconvex tensor Log-determinant function, instead of the tensor nuclear norm, is adopted to approximate the tensor rank for effectively suppressing the confusing information resulted from underlying complex backgrounds. Further, we have deduced the closed-form solution of this nonconvex minimization problem and established a feasible algorithm whose convergence is mathematically proven. Experiments on five well-known public datasets are provided and the simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms the latest unsupervised handcrafted features-based methods in the literature. Furthermore, our model is flexible with various deep features and is competitive with the state-of-the-art approaches.},

Further automation, development, and activation of such systems require cooperation among heterogeneous robots. Classical control theory is inefficient in managing large-scale complex dynamic systems. Therefore, a discrete-event system based on the supervisory control theory must be introduced to overcome this limitation. In this article, we propose a hybrid system-based hierarchical control architecture using a supervisory control-based high-level controller and a traditional control-based low-level controller. The hybrid system and its dynamics are modeled through a formal method, called hybrid automata, and the behavior specifications are designed to express the control objectives for cooperation. In addition, modular supervisors that are more scalable and maintainable than a centralized supervisory controller were synthesized. The proposed hybrid system and hierarchical control architecture were implemented, validated, and evaluated for performance through a physics-based simulator and field tests. The experimental results confirmed that the robot team satisfied the given specifications and presented systematic results, validating the efficiency of the proposed control architecture.},

As a fundamental component of granular computing, information granules play a key role in human cognition. Therefore, it is of great interest to develop classifiers based on information granules such that highly interpretable human-centric models with higher accuracy can be constructed. In this study, we elaborate on a novel design methodology of granular classifiers in which information granules play a fundamental role. First, information granules are formed on the basis of labeled patterns following the principle of justifiable granularity. The diversity of samples embraced by each information granule is quantified and controlled in terms of the entropy criterion. This design implies that the information granules constructed in this way form sound homogeneous descriptors characterizing the structure and the diversity of available experimental data. Next, granular classifiers are built in the presence of formed information granules. The classification result for any input instance is determined by summing the contents of the related information granules weighted by membership degrees. The experiments concerning both synthetic data and publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed models exhibit better prediction abilities than some commonly encountered classifiers (namely, linear regression, support vector machine, Naïve Bayes, decision tree, and neural networks) and come with enhanced interpretability.},

  abstract     = {Collision-avoidance control for UAV swarm has recently drawn great attention due to its significant implications in many industrial and commercial applications. However, traditional collision-avoidance models for UAV swarm tend to focus on avoidance at individual UAV level, and no explicit strategy is designed for avoidance among multiple UAV groups. When directly applying these models for multigroup UAV scenarios, the deadlock situation may happen. A group of UAVs may be temporally blocked by other groups in a narrow space and cannot progress toward achieving its goal. To this end, this article proposes a modeling and optimization approach to multigroup UAV collision avoidance. Specifically, group level collision detection and adaption mechanism are introduced, efficiently detecting potential collisions among different UAV groups and restructuring a group into subgroups for better collision and deadlock avoidance. A two-level control model is then designed for realizing collision avoidance among UAV groups and of UAVs within each group. Finally, an evolutionary multitask optimization method is introduced to effectively calibrate the parameters that exist in different levels of our control model, and an adaptive fitness evaluation strategy is proposed to reduce computation overhead in simulation-based optimization. The simulation results show that our model has superior performances in deadlock resolution, motion stability, and distance maintenance in multigroup UAV scenarios compared to the state-of-the-art collision-avoidance models. The model optimization results also show that our model optimization method can largely reduce execution time for computationally-intensive optimization process that involves UAV swarm simulation.},

Those systems usually degrade when being deployed in new environments. A straightforward solution to solve this limitation is to collect and annotate data samples from different environments with advanced learning strategies. Although workable as reported, those methods are often privacy sensitive because the training algorithms need to access the data from different environments, which may be owned by different organizations. We present a practical method for the WiFi-based privacy-preserving cross-environment human activity recognition (HAR). It collects and shares information from different environments, while maintaining the privacy of individual person being involved. At the core of our approach is the utilization of the Johnson–Lindenstrauss transform, which is theoretically shown to be differentially private. Based on that, we further design an adversarial learning strategy to generate environment-invariant representations for HAR. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with different data modalities from two real-life environments. More specifically, on the raw CSI dataset, it shows 2.18\% and 1.24\% improvements over challenging baselines for two environments, respectively. Moreover, with the discrete wavelet transform features, it further yields 5.71\% and 1.55\% improvements, respectively.},

Evolutionary algorithms based on encoding and heuristic decoding approaches are shown effective in solving the HFSP. However, frequently used encoding and decoding strategies can only search a limited area of the solution space, thus leading to unsatisfactory performance during the later period. In this article, a hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA) using two solution representations is proposed to solve the HFSP for makespan minimization. First, the proposed HEA searches the solution space by a permutation-based encoding representation and two heuristic decoding methods to find some promising areas. Afterward, a Tabu search (TS) procedure based on a disjunctive graph representation is introduced to expand the searching space for further optimization. Two classical neighborhood structures focusing on critical paths are extended to the problem-specific backward schedules to generate candidate solutions for the TS. The proposed HEA is tested on three public HFSP benchmark sets from the existing literature, including 567 instances in total, and is compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms. Extensive experimental results indicate that the proposed HEA performs much better than the other algorithms. Moreover, the proposed method finds new best solutions for 285 hard instances.},

To analyze the stability of the closed-loop system, a time-dependent two-side looped functional, which fully utilizes the state information on the entire sampling interval as well as at the dynamic partitioning point, is constructed. It relaxes the positive definiteness of traditional Lyapunov functional inside the sampling interval and therefore, provides the possibility to derive less conservative stability results. Besides, an auxiliary system is established to describe the dynamics at the partitioning point. On the basis of the constructed looped functional, the discrete-time Lyapunov theorem, and some estimation approaches, a linear matrix inequalities-based stability criterion is developed, and then, the sampled-data saturated controller is designed to ensure the local asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. Thereafter, two optimization problems are developed to seek the desired feedback gain and to expand the estimation of the region of attraction or to enlarge the upper bound of the sampling interval. Eventually, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed results.},

Some sufficient conditions are derived under the condition that the multiple fault topology contains a directed spanning tree and cycle edge, and these conditions guarantee that the multiple fault isolation problem can be solved under randomized learning techniques. Then, single-integrator agents are employed to capture the time-varying topology of multiple fault modeling, in which edge agreement and persistence condition are used to guarantee asymptotic consensus. After that, a novel robust fault estimation design along with the switched Lyapunov function and average dwell time is proposed for the possible power actuator faults subject to asynchronous switching and electromagnetic interferences. In addition, switched estimators are designed such that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable. A multiple fault isolation and estimation case is investigated to validate the application of this methodology.},

  abstract     = {Some researchers have introduced transfer learning mechanisms to multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, the existing works devoted to cross-task transfer for multiagent systems were designed just for homogeneous agents or similar domains. This work proposes an all-purpose cross-transfer method, called multiagent lateral transfer (MALT), assisting MARL with alleviating the training burden. We discuss several challenges in developing an all-purpose multiagent cross-task transfer learning method and provide a feasible way of reusing knowledge for MARL. In the developed method, we take features as the transfer object rather than policies or experiences, inspired by the progressive network. To achieve more efficient transfer, we assign pretrained policy networks for agents based on clustering, while an attention module is introduced to enhance the transfer framework. The proposed method has no strict requirements for the source task and target task. Compared with the existing works, our method can transfer knowledge among heterogeneous agents and also avoid negative transfer in the case of fully different tasks. As far as we know, this article is the first work denoted to all-purpose cross-task transfer for MARL. Several experiments in various scenarios have been conducted to compare the performance of the proposed method with baselines. The results demonstrate that the method is sufficiently flexible for most settings, including cooperative, competitive, homogeneous, and heterogeneous configurations.},

  abstract     = {Robot manipulation, for example, pick-and-place manipulation, is broadly used for intelligent manufacturing with industrial robots, ocean engineering with underwater robots, service robots, or even healthcare with medical robots. Most traditional robot manipulations adopt 2-D vision systems with plane hypotheses and can only generate 3-DOF (degrees of freedom) pose accordingly. To mimic human intelligence and endow the robot with more flexible working capabilities, 3-D vision-based robot manipulation has been studied. However, this task is still challenging in the open world especially for general object recognition and pose estimation with occlusion in cluttered backgrounds and human-like flexible manipulation. In this article, we propose a comprehensive analysis of recent progress about the 3-D vision for robot manipulation, including 3-D data acquisition and representation, robot-vision calibration, 3-D object detection/recognition, 6-DOF pose estimation, grasping estimation, and motion planning. We then present some public datasets, evaluation criteria, comparisons, and challenges. Finally, the related application domains of robot manipulation are given, and some future directions and open problems are studied as well.},

However, due to the city expansion, the network scale grows at a fast speed so that the efficacy of many current EC algorithms degrades rapidly. To solve the large-scale WDN optimization problem effectively, a two-stage swarm optimizer with local search (TSOL) is proposed in this article. To address the issues caused by the large-scale and multimodal characteristics of the problem, the proposed algorithm divides the optimization process into an exploration stage and an exploitation stage. It first finds a promising region of the search space in the exploration stage. Then, it searches thoroughly in the promising region to obtain the final solution in the exploitation stage. To search effectively the huge search space, we propose an improved level-based learning optimizer and use it in both the exploration and exploitation stages. Two new local search algorithms are proposed to further improve the quality of the solution. Experiments on both synthetic benchmark networks and a real-world network show that the proposed algorithm has outperformed the state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Temporal networks are ubiquitous in nature and society, and tracking the dynamics of networks is fundamental for investigating the mechanisms of systems. Dynamic communities in temporal networks simultaneously reflect the topology of the current snapshot (clustering accuracy) and historical ones (clustering drift). Current algorithms are criticized for their inability to characterize the dynamics of networks at the vertex level, independence of feature extraction and clustering, and high time complexity. In this study, we solve these problems by proposing a novel joint learning model for dynamic community detection in temporal networks (also known as jLMDC) via joining feature extraction and clustering. This model is formulated as a constrained optimization problem. Vertices are classified into dynamic and static groups by exploring the topological structure of temporal networks to fully exploit their dynamics at each time step. Then, jLMDC updates the features of dynamic vertices by preserving features of static ones during optimization. The advantage of jLMDC is that features are extracted under the guidance of clustering, promoting performance, and saving the running time of the algorithm. Finally, we extend jLMDC to detect the overlapping dynamic community in temporal networks. The experimental results on 11 temporal networks demonstrate that jLMDC improves accuracy up to 8.23\% and saves 24.89\% of running time on average compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Human parsing is a fine-grained semantic segmentation task, which needs to understand human semantic parts. Most existing methods model human parsing as a general semantic segmentation, which ignores the inherent relationship among hierarchical human parts. In this work, we propose a pose-guided hierarchical semantic decomposition and composition framework for human parsing. Specifically, our method includes a semantic maintained decomposition and composition (SMDC) module and a pose distillation (PC) module. SMDC progressively disassembles the human body to focus on the more concise regions of interest in the decomposition stage and then gradually assembles human parts under the guidance of pose information in the composition stage. Notably, SMDC maintains the atomic semantic labels during both stages to avoid the error propagation issue of the hierarchical structure. To further take advantage of the relationship of human parts, we introduce pose information as explicit guidance for the composition. However, the discrete structure prediction in pose estimation is against the requirement of the continuous region in human parsing. To this end, we design a PC module to broadcast the maximum responses of pose estimation to form the continuous structure in the way of knowledge distillation. The experimental results on the look-into-person (LIP) and PASCAL-Person-Part datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with the state-of-the-art methods, that is, 55.21\% mean Intersection of Union (mIoU) on LIP and 69.88\% mIoU on PASCAL-Person-Part.},

In terms of the single-objection $H_{\infty }$ control problem, necessary and sufficient conditions for designing the $H_{\infty }$ suboptimal controller were presented, and the $H_{\infty }$ performance index optimized by the developed data-driven method was shown to be consistent with that of the model-based method. In addition, by introducing additional slack variables into the controller design conditions, the conservatism of solving the multiobjective optimization problem was reduced. Furthermore, contrary to the existing data-driven controller design methods, the initial stable controller was not required, and the controller gain was directly parameterized by the collected state and input data in this work.

  abstract     = {Partial multilabel learning (PML) aims to learn from training data, where each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels, among which only a part is correct. The common strategy to deal with such a problem is disambiguation, that is, identifying the ground-truth labels from the given candidate labels. However, the existing PML approaches always focus on leveraging the instance relationship to disambiguate the given noisy label space, while the potentially useful information in label space is not effectively explored. Meanwhile, the existence of noise and outliers in training data also makes the disambiguation operation less reliable, which inevitably decreases the robustness of the learned model. In this article, we propose a prior label knowledge regularized self-representation PML approach, called PAKS, where the self-representation scheme and prior label knowledge are jointly incorporated into a unified framework. Specifically, we introduce a self-representation model with a low-rank constraint, which aims to learn the subspace representations of distinct instances and explore the high-order underlying correlation among different instances. Meanwhile, we incorporate prior label knowledge into the above self-representation model, where the prior label knowledge is regarded as the complement of features to obtain an accurate self-representation matrix. The core of PAKS is to take advantage of the data membership preference, which is derived from the prior label knowledge, to purify the discovered membership of the data and accordingly obtain more representative feature subspace for model induction. Enormous experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our proposed approach can achieve superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches.},

The real-time status of the operating point for the considered nonlinear plant is characterized by using these available normalized fuzzy weighting functions at both the current and the past instants of time. To achieve this, the developed fuzzy real-time gain-scheduling mechanism produces different switching modes by introducing key tunable parameters. Thus, a pair of exclusive FE gain matrices is designed for each switching mode on the strength of time-varying balanced matrices developed in this study, respectively. Since the implementation of more FE gain matrices can be scheduled according to the real-time status of the operating point at each sampling instant, the robust performance of nonlinear FE will be enhanced over the previous methods to a great extent. Finally, considerable numerical comparisons are implemented in order to illustrate that the proposed method is much superior to those existing ones reported in the literature.},

Despite deep learning approaches have achieved certain results in performing feature learning and long-term temporal dependencies modeling, the motion prediction is still not desirable enough, which unavoidably compromises the accomplishment of tasks. Therefore, a hybrid recurrent neural network architecture is proposed for intention recognition to conduct the assembly tasks cooperatively. Specifically, the improved LSTM (ILSTM) and improved Bi-LSTM (IBi-LSTM) networks are first explored with state activation function and gate activation function to improve the network performance. The employment of the IBi-LSTM unit in the first layers of the hybrid architecture helps to learn the features effectively and fully from complex sequential data, and the LSTM-based cell in the last layer contributes to capturing the forward dependency. This hybrid network architecture can improve the prediction performance of intention recognition effectively. One experimental platform with the UR5 collaborative robot and human motion capture device is set up to test the performance of the proposed method. One filter, that is, the quartile-based amplitude limiting algorithm in sliding window, is designed to deal with the abnormal data of the spatiotemporal data, and thus, to improve the accuracy of network training and testing. The experimental results show that the hybrid network can predict the motion of human operator more precisely in collaborative workspace, compared with some representative deep learning methods.},

Nevertheless, the normal risk priority number (RPN) method has been extensively criticized for many deficiencies in practical applications. To overcome the drawbacks of traditional FMEA, plenty of methods have been suggested in previous studies. But majority of them evaluated the risk factors of each failure mode directly and cannot take group and individual risk attitudes into account. In this article, we put forward a new FMEA approach integrating probabilistic linguistic preference relations (PLPRs) and gained and lost dominance score (GLDS) method. The PLPRs are adopted to describe the risk evaluations of experts by pairwise comparison of failure modes. An extended GLDS method is introduced to derive the risk ranking of failure modes considering both group and individual risk attitudes. Moreover, a two-step optimization model is proposed to determine the weights of risk factors when their weighing information is unknown. Finally, a load-haul-dumper machine risk analysis case is presented to demonstrate the proposed FMEA. It is shown that the approach being proposed in this study provides a practical and effective way for risk evaluation in FMEA.},

This article introduces a generic computational relaxation for the unscented transformation (UT) that is the key operation of the Unscented Kalman filter-based applications. The central idea behind the relaxation is to pull out the linear part of the filtering model and avoid the calculations for the kernel of the nonlinear part. The practical merit of the proposed relaxation is demonstrated through a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) implementation that underpins the superior performance of the algorithm in the practically relevant cases, where the nonlinear dependencies influence only an affine subspace of the image space. The numerical examples show that the computational demand can be mitigated below 50\% without decreasing the accuracy of the approximation.

  abstract     = {For nonlinear delayed distributed parameter systems (DDPSs), this article considers a fuzzy boundary control (FBC) under boundary measurements (BMs). Initially, we accurately describe the nonlinear DDPS through a Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy partial differential-difference equation (PDDE). Then, in accordance with the T–S fuzzy PDDE model, an FBC design under BMs ensuring the exponential stability for closed-loop DDPS is subsequently presented by spatial linear matrix inequalities (SLMIs) via using Wirtinger’s inequality, Halanay’s inequality, and the Lyapunov direct method, which respects the fast-varying and slow-varying delays. Moreover, we formulate SLMIs as LMIs for solving the fuzzy boundary controller design of nonlinear DDPSs under BMs. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed FBC strategy is presented via simulation examples.},

The threshold parameter in the event-triggered mechanism is designed as a diagonal matrix in which all elements can be adjusted according to system performance requirements. The hidden Markov model is introduced to characterize the asynchronization between the controller and controlled system. The effect of randomly occurring gain fluctuations is taken into account during the controller design. For the purpose of guaranteeing that the closed-loop system is stochastically stable and satisfies the strictly $(\mathcal {D}_{1},\mathcal {D}_{2},\mathcal {D}_{3})-\gamma -$ dissipative performance, sufficient conditions are constructed by employing the Lyapunov function and stochastic analysis. After linearization, the proposed controller gains are obtained by solving the linear matrix inequalities.

  abstract     = {Inaccurate-supervised learning (ISL) is a weakly supervised learning framework for imprecise annotation, which is derived from some specific popular learning frameworks, mainly including partial label learning (PLL), partial multilabel learning (PML), and multiview PML (MVPML). While PLL, PML, and MVPML are each solved as independent models through different methods and no general framework can currently be applied to these frameworks, most existing methods for solving them were designed based on traditional machine-learning techniques, such as logistic regression, KNN, SVM, decision tree. Prior to this study, there was no single general framework that used adversarial networks to solve ISL problems. To narrow this gap, this study proposed an adversarial network structure to solve ISL problems, called ISL with generative adversarial nets (ISL-GANs). In ISL-GAN, fake samples, which are quite similar to real samples, gradually promote the Discriminator to disambiguate the noise labels of real samples. We also provide theoretical analyses for ISL-GAN in effectively handling ISL data. In this article, we propose a general framework to solve PLL, PML, and MVPML, while in the published conference version, we adopt the specific framework, which is a special case of the general one, to solve the PLL problem. Finally, the effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments on various imprecise annotation learning tasks, including PLL, PML, and MVPML.},

A decentralized control law using only onboard sensors is designed for the connected vehicle platoon. A novel switching-type delay-adaptive predictor is proposed to estimate the unknown input delays. By using the estimated unknown input delays, the control law can guarantee the stability of the successive vehicles. The platoon control adopts a one-vehicle look-ahead topology structure and a constant time headway (CTH) policy, which makes the desired spacing between vehicles vary with time. In this framework, the stability of the connected vehicles can be derived through the analysis of each pair of two successive vehicles in the platoon.

  abstract     = {Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms based on entropy regularized have achieved good performance in control tasks. Those algorithms consider using the entropy-regularized term for the policy to learn a stochastic policy. This work provides a new perspective that aims to explicitly learn a representation of intrinsic information in state transition to obtain a multimodal stochastic policy, for dealing with the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. We study a class of Markov decision processes (MDPs) with divergence maximization, called divergence MDPs. The goal of the divergence MDPs is to find an optimal stochastic policy that maximizes the sum of both the expected discounted total rewards and a divergence term, where the divergence function learns the implicit information of state transition. Thus, it can provide better-off stochastic policies to improve both in robustness and performance in a high-dimension continuous setting. Under this framework, the optimality equations can be obtained, and then a divergence actor–critic algorithm is developed based on the divergence policy iteration method to address large-scale continuous problems. The experimental results, compared to other methods, show that our approach achieved better performance and robustness in the complex environment particularly.

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the exponential synchronization of coupled memristive neural networks (CMNNs) with multiple mismatched parameters and topology-based probability impulsive mechanism (TPIM) on time scales. To begin with, a novel model is designed by taking into account three types of mismatched parameters, including: 1) mismatched dimensions; 2) mismatched connection weights; and 3) mismatched time-varying delays. Then, the method of auxiliary-state variables is adopted to deal with the novel model, which implies that the presented novel model can not only use any isolated system (regard as a node) in the coupled system to synchronize the states of CMNNs but also can use an external node, that is, not affiliated to the coupled system to synchronize the states of CMNNs. Moreover, the TPIM is first proposed to efficiently schedule information transmission over the network, possibly subject to a series of nonideal factors. The novel control protocol is more robust against these nonideal factors than the traditional impulsive control mechanism. By means of the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, robust analysis approach, and some inequality processing techniques, exponential synchronization conditions unifying the continuous-time and discrete-time systems are derived on the framework of time scales. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the main results.},

  abstract     = {The job-shop scheduling problem (JSSP) is a challenging scheduling and optimization problem in the industry and engineering, which relates to the work efficiency and operational costs of factories. The completion time of all jobs is the most commonly considered optimization objective in the existing work. However, factories focus on both time and cost objectives, including completion time, total tardiness, advance time, production cost, and machine loss. Therefore, this article first time proposes a many-objective JSSP that considers all these five objectives to make the model more practical to reflect the various demands of factories. To optimize these five objectives simultaneously, a novel multiple populations for multiple objectives (MPMO) framework-based genetic algorithm (GA) approach, called MPMOGA, is proposed. First, MPMOGA employs five populations to optimize the five objectives, respectively. Second, to avoid each population only focusing on its corresponding single objective, an archive sharing technique (AST) is proposed to store the elite solutions collected from the five populations so that the populations can obtain optimization information about the other objectives from the archive. This way, MPMOGA can approximate different parts of the entire Pareto front (PF). Third, an archive update strategy (AUS) is proposed to further improve the quality of the solutions in the archive. The test instances in the widely used test sets are adopted to evaluate the performance of MPMOGA. The experimental results show that MPMOGA outperforms the compared state-of-the-art algorithms on most of the test instances.},

The measured output is sent to the designed observer over a wireless communication network subject to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Due to the energy constraints of the attackers, the attack duration is upper bounded. Under DoS attacks, the transmission is prevented, which worsens the estimation accuracy of the existing nonlinear observers significantly. To maintain the estimation performance, a novel multiobserver scheme and a switched algorithm are proposed by introducing the hold-input mechanism and the cascade observer technique. In comparison to the existing results, where the estimation error systems may be unstable during the attack time interval, the estimation error of the designed observer converges exponentially, such that the estimation performance is improved effectively.

The goal is to obtain a static output-feedback controller while the design criterion is formulated with an exponential term, divergent or convergent, depending on the designer’s choice. Two offline policy-iteration algorithms are presented first, which form the foundations for a family of online off-policy designs. These algorithms cover all different cases of partial or complete model knowledge and provide the designer with a collection of design alternatives. It is shown that such a design for partial model knowledge can reduce the number of unknown matrices to be solved online. In particular, if the disturbance input matrix of the model is given, off-policy learning can be done with no disturbance excitation. This alternative is useful in situations where a measurable disturbance is not available in the learning phase. The utility of these design procedures is demonstrated for the case of an optimal lane tracking controller of an automated car.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a graph regularized algorithm for early expression detection (EED), called GraphEED, is proposed. EED is aimed at detecting the specified expression in the early stage of a video. Existing EED detectors fail to explicitly exploit the local geometrical structure of the data distribution, which may affect the prediction performance significantly. According to manifold learning, the data in real-world applications are likely to reside on a low-dimensional submanifold embedded in the high-dimensional ambient space. The proposed graph Laplacian consists of two parts: 1) a $k$ -nearest neighbor graph is first constructed to encode the geometrical information under the manifold assumption and 2) the entire expressions are regarded as the must-link constraints since they all contain the complete duration information and it is shown that this can also be formulated as a graph regularization. GraphEED is to have a detection function representing these graph structures. Even with the inclusion of the graph Laplacian, the proposed GraphEED has the same computational complexity as that of the max-margin EED, which is a well-known learning-based EED, but the detection performance has been largely improved. To further make the model appropriate in large-scale applications, with the technique of online learning, the proposed GraphEED is extended to the so-called online GraphEED (OGraphEED). In OGraphEED, the buffering technique is employed to make the optimization practical by reducing the computation and storage cost. Extensive experiments on three video-based datasets have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.},

In other words, the numerous prior experiences have no influence in predicting vehicular movements for the next time step. In this research, we propose a machine-learning-based data-driven methodology that is able to take advantage of the high-resolution historical traffic data in the current data-rich era, to predict vehicular movements in an accurate manner with high computational efficiency. The proposed car-following model has a simple model structure based on a fixed-radius near neighbors (FRNN) search algorithm and it can be applied to high-resolution, real-time vehicle movement prediction, modeling, and control. A comprehensive performance comparison is also conducted among the proposed car-following model, another similar data-driven model, and two conventional formula-based models. The results indicate that the FRNN algorithm-based car-following model is superior to all other three models in terms of prediction accuracy and is more computationally efficient compared to its data-driven-based counterpart. Some extensive applications of the proposed car-following model are also discussed at the end of this article.},

  abstract     = {While autonomous systems can be used for a variety of beneficial applications, they can also be used for malicious intentions and it is mandatory to disrupt them before they act. So, an accurate trajectory inference algorithm is required for monitoring purposes that allows to take appropriate countermeasures. This article presents a closed-loop output error approach for trajectory inference of a class of linear systems. The approach combines the main advantages of state estimation and parameter identification algorithms in a complementary fashion using online data and an estimated model, which is constructed by the state and parameter estimates, that inform about the physics of the system to infer the followed noise-free trajectory. Exact model matching and estimation error cases are analyzed. A composite update rule based on a least-squares rule is also proposed to improve robustness and parameter and state convergence. The stability and convergence of the proposed approaches are assessed via the Lyapunov stability theory under the fulfilment of a persistent excitation condition. Simulation studies are carried out to validate the proposed approaches.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the distributed fault-tolerant bipartite output synchronization problem of discrete-time linear multiagent systems (MASs) with process faults under a general directed signed graph. The reference signal is generated by an autonomous exosystem, which can also be seen as a leader. All followers are divided into two subgroups with antagonistic interactions, and the followers in each subgroup are cooperative. We aim to solve the bipartite fault-tolerant control (FTC) problem via the output regulation theory such that bipartite output synchronization can be achieved in the presence of process faults, that is, the outputs of followers with different subgroups can approach the output of exosystem with the same magnitude and the opposite sign regardless of process faults. To estimate the states and the faults of each follower, a simultaneous state and fault estimator based on the neighboring signed output estimation error and the standard discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation (ARE) is designed. Besides, a new exosystem observer with two classes of convergence conditions relying on the respective solutions of standard and modified AREs is provided. All eigenvalues of the exosystem matrix can lie completely outside the unit circle. Based on these estimations, we present a distributed fault-tolerant output feedback controller, which can overcome the no-loops constraint. Finally, simulation results are given to demonstrate the analytic results.},

Preprocessed input data feed the employed FCM. Map responses, after a postprocessing procedure, are used in the calculation of the final classification decision. The time-series data are staged using the moving-window technique to capture the time flow in the training procedure. We use a backward error propagation algorithm to compute the required model hyperparameters. Four model hyperparameters require tuning. Two are crucial for the model construction: 1) FCM size (number of concepts) and 2) window size (for the moving-window technique). Other two are important for training the model: 1) the number of epochs and 2) the learning rate (for training). Two distinguishing aspects of the proposed model are worth noting: 1) the separation of the classification engine from pre- and post-processing and 2) the time flow capture for data from concept space. The proposed classifier joins the key advantage of the FCM model, which is the interpretability of the model, with the superior classification performance attributed to the specially designed pre- and postprocessing stages. This article presents the experiments performed, demonstrating that the proposed model performs well against a wide range of state-of-the-art time-series classification algorithms.},

Furthermore, a novel design of the rotary platform is presented for multiple unmanned ground vehicles (m-UGVs) to load objects and provide better maneuverability in confined spaces during cooperative transportation. The number of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) is adjustable according to the object’s weight and size in the proposed framework because transportation is accomplished without physical grippers. Moreover, to minimize the complexity in dealing with the interactive force between the object and UGVs, no force/torque sensor is used in the design of the control algorithm. Instead, an adaptive sliding-mode controller is formulated to cope with the dynamic uncertainties and smoothly transport an object along a desired trajectory. Thus, three external force analyses—gradient projection method, adaptive force estimation, and radial basis function neural network force estimation—are proposed for m-UGVs. In addition, the stability and the performance tracking of the m-UGV system in the presence of dynamic uncertainties using the proposed force estimation are investigated by employing the Lyapunov theory. Finally, experiments on cooperative transportation are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the m-UGV system.},

  abstract     = {Applying the chaos theory for secure digital communications is promising and it is well acknowledged that in such applications the underlying chaotic systems should be carefully chosen. However, the requirements imposed on the chaotic systems are usually heuristic, without theoretic guarantee for the resultant communication scheme. Among all the primitives for secure communications, it is well accepted that (pseudo) random numbers are most essential. Taking the well-studied 2-D coupled map lattice (2D CML) as an example, this article performs a theoretical study toward pseudorandom number generation with the 2D CML. In so doing, an analytical expression of the Lyapunov exponent (LE) spectrum of the 2D CML is first derived. Using the LEs, one can configure system parameters to ensure the 2D CML only exhibits complex dynamic behavior, and then collect pseudorandom numbers from the system orbits. Moreover, based on the observation that least significant bit distributes more evenly in the (pseudo) random distribution, an extraction algorithm $\mathbf {E}$ is developed with the property that when applied to the orbits of the 2D CML, it can squeeze uniform bits. In implementation, if fixed-point arithmetic is used in binary format with a precision of $z$ bits after the radix point, $\mathbf {E}$ can ensure that the deviation of the squeezed bits is bounded by $2^{-z}$ . Further simulation results demonstrate that the new method not only guides the 2D CML model to exhibit complex dynamic behavior but also generates uniformly distributed independent bits with good efficiency. In particular, the squeezed pseudorandom bits can pass both NIST 800-22 and TestU01 test suites in various settings. This study thereby provides a theoretical basis for effectively applying the 2D CML to secure communications.},

In this way, the corresponding results from Corless and Tu (1998) are improved. Meanwhile, a reduced-order observer is designed for a constructed augmented system to estimate the system states and noises of each agent. Next, with the help of a traditional interval observer, a novel unknown disturbance reconstruction method is developed, and the reconstruction can converge to the unknown disturbance asymptotically and decouple from the control input. The subsequent asymptotic consensus is accomplished by utilizing an observer-based control scheme, with its design satisfying the so-called separation principle. Finally, two simulation examples are given to verify the effectiveness and show the advantages of the proposed methods.},

Due to model uncertainties and widespread external disturbances, a simple control strategy cannot match tracking accuracy with disturbance immunity, while a complex controller will consume excessive energy. For precise motion control with disturbance immunity and low energy consumption, a control method based on an enhanced reduced-order extended state observer (ERESOBC) is proposed to control the motor-wheels dynamic model of a differential driven mobile robot (DDMR). In this method, only unknown state error and negative disturbance are estimated by the enhanced reduced-order extended state observer (ERESO), which reduces the required energy of the observer. In addition, a simple state-feedback–feedforward controller is used to track the reference signal and compensate for negative disturbance. Through numerical simulation and application example, the tracking performance and disturbance rejection performance of DDMR are compared with the traditional control method based on enhanced extended state observer (EESOBC), and the results show the superiority of the ERESOBC method.},

  abstract     = {The localization and segmentation of the novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) lesions from computerized tomography (CT) scans are of great significance for developing an efficient computer-aided diagnosis system. Deep learning (DL) has emerged as one of the best choices for developing such a system. However, several challenges limit the efficiency of DL approaches, including data heterogeneity, considerable variety in the shape and size of the lesions, lesion imbalance, and scarce annotation. In this article, a novel multitask regression network for segmenting COVID-19 lesions is proposed to address these challenges. We name the framework MT-nCov-Net. We formulate lesion segmentation as a multitask shape regression problem that enables partaking the poor-, intermediate-, and high-quality features between various tasks. A multiscale feature learning (MFL) module is presented to capture the multiscale semantic information, which helps to efficiently learn small and large lesion features while reducing the semantic gap between different scale representations. In addition, a fine-grained lesion localization (FLL) module is introduced to detect infection lesions using an adaptive dual-attention mechanism. The generated location map and the fused multiscale representations are subsequently passed to the lesion regression (LR) module to segment the infection lesions. MT-nCov-Net enables learning complete lesion properties to accurately segment the COVID-19 lesion by regressing its shape. MT-nCov-Net is experimentally evaluated on two public multisource datasets, and the overall performance validates its superiority over the current cutting-edge approaches and demonstrates its effectiveness in tackling the problems facing the diagnosis of COVID-19.},

  abstract     = {In the field of data mining, how to deal with high-dimensional data is a fundamental problem. If they are used directly, it is not only computationally expensive but also difficult to obtain satisfactory results. Unsupervised feature selection is designed to reduce the dimension of data by finding a subset of features in the absence of labels. Many unsupervised methods perform feature selection by exploring spectral analysis and manifold learning, such that the intrinsic structure of data can be preserved. However, most of these methods ignore a fact: due to the existence of noise features, the intrinsic structure directly built from original data may be unreliable. To solve this problem, a new unsupervised feature selection model is proposed. The graph structure, feature weights, and projection matrix are learned simultaneously, such that the intrinsic structure is constructed by the data that have been feature weighted and projected. For each data point, its nearest neighbors are acquired in the process of graph construction. Therefore, we call them adaptive neighbors. Besides, an additional constraint is added to the proposed model. It requires that a graph, corresponding to a similarity matrix, should contain exactly $c$ connected components. Then, we present an optimization algorithm to solve the proposed model. Next, we discuss the method of determining the regularization parameter $\gamma $ in our proposed method and analyze the computational complexity of the optimization algorithm. Finally, experiments are implemented on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In recent years, co-clustering methods have been developed greatly with many important applications, such as document clustering and gene expression analysis. Different from the traditional graph-based methods, co-clustering can utilize the bipartite graph to extract the duality relationship between samples and features. It means that the bipartite graph can obtain more information than other traditional graph methods. Therefore, we proposed a novel method to handle the subspace clustering problem by combining dictionary learning with a bipartite graph under the constraint of the (normalized) Laplacian rank. Besides, to avoid the effect of redundant information hiding in the data, the original data matrix is not used as the static dictionary in our model. By updating the dictionary matrix under the sparse constraint, we can obtain a better coefficient matrix to construct the bipartite graph. Based on Theorem 2 and Lemma 1 , we further speed up our algorithm. Experimental results on both synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and stability of our model.},

  abstract     = {This article mainly studies the projective quasisynchronization for an array of nonlinear heterogeneous-coupled neural networks with mixed time-varying delays and a cluster-tree topology structure. For the sake of the mismatched parameters and the mutual influence among distinct clusters, the exponential and global quasisynchronization within a prescribed error bound instead of complete synchronization for the coupled neural networks with clustering trees is investigated. A kind of pinning impulsive controllers is designed, which will be imposed on the selected neural networks with some largest norms of error states at each impulsive instant in different clusters. By employing the concept of the average impulsive interval, the matrix measure method, and the Lyapunov stability theorem, sufficient conditions for the realization of the cluster projective quasisynchronization are derived. Meanwhile, in terms of the formula of variation of parameters and the comparison principle for the impulsive systems with mixed time-varying delays, the convergence rate and the synchronization error bound are precisely estimated. Furthermore, the synchronization error bound is efficiently optimized based on different functions of the impulsive effects. Finally, a numerical experiment is given to prove the results of theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection has been studied by many researchers using information theory to select the most informative features. Up to now, however, little attention has been paid to the interactivity and complementarity between features and their relationships. In addition, most of the approaches do not cope well with fuzzy and uncertain data and are not adaptable to the distribution characteristics of data. Therefore, to make up for these two deficiencies, a novel interactive and complementary feature selection approach based on fuzzy multineighborhood rough set model (ICFS_FmNRS) is proposed. First, fuzzy multineighborhood granules are constructed to better adapt to the data distribution. Second, feature multicorrelations (i.e., relevancy, redundancy, interactivity, and complementarity) are considered and defined comprehensively using fuzzy multigranularity uncertainty measures. Next, the features with interactivity and complementarity are mined by the forward iterative selection strategy. Finally, compared with the benchmark approaches on several datasets, the experimental results show that ICFS_FmNRS effectively improves the classification performance of feature subsets while reducing the dimension of feature space.},

A novel method is proposed to solve the problem by integrating formation control with constrained optimization, which not only transports the object along a reference trajectory in a distributed manner but also obtains the dexterous joint postures and end-effector displacements under safety constraints for collision avoidance. For the constrained optimization, the cost function and safety constraints are designed to quantify the mobility and manipulability of mobile manipulators, and collision-free working ranges with the object and obstacles, respectively. A discontinuous projected primal-dual algorithm with damping terms is proposed to solve the constrained optimization problem, providing the joint postures and end-effector displacements, which minimize the cost function and satisfy safety constraints. For the formation control, a finite-time control law, guided by end-effector displacements from the primal-dual algorithm, is developed in order to transport the object by establishing a prescribed formation and moving its centroid to track the reference trajectory. The cooperative manipulation is therefore achieved by the proposed method, which is further validated through numerical simulations.},

The objective is to acquire the experience knowledge from the stable leader–follower adaptive formation control process and improve the control performance by reusing the experiential knowledge. First, a two-layer control scheme is proposed to solve the leader–follower formation control problem. In the first layer, by combining adaptive distributed observers and constructed $i_{n}$ -step predictors, the leader’s future state is predicted by the followers in a distributed manner. In the second layer, the adaptive neural network (NN) controllers are constructed for the followers to ensure that all the followers track the predicted output of the leader. In the stable formation control process, the NN weights are verified to exponentially converge to their optimal values by developing an extended stability corollary of linear time-varying (LTV) system. Second, by constructing some specific “learning rules,” the NN weights with convergent sequences are synthetically acquired and stored in the followers as experience knowledge. Then, the stored knowledge is reused to construct the FLC. The proposed FLC method not only solves the leader–follower formation problem but also improves the transient control performance. Finally, the validity of the presented FLC scheme is illustrated by simulations.},

On the basis of the switched model, a multiple Lyapunov function method is utilized and a set of sufficient conditions incorporating the event-triggering scheme (ETS) and restriction of DoS attacks are provided to preserve $\mathcal {L}_{\infty }$ performance. In particular, considering that ETS based on mathematical expectation is difficult to be implemented on a practical platform, a self-triggering scheme (STS) without mathematical expectation is presented. Meanwhile, to avoid the Zeno behavior resulted from general exogenous disturbance, a positive lower bound is fixed in STS in advance. In addition, the exponent parameters are designed in STS to reduce triggering frequency. Based on the STS, the mean-square asymptotical stability and almost sure exponential stability are both discussed when the system is in the absence of exogenous disturbance.

In the interest of the tradeoff between the resource cost and performance, we design the multiobjective reinforcement learning (RL)-based neural architecture search (NAS) scheme, which comprehensively balances the accuracy, parameters, FLOPs, and inference latency. Finally, under varying hyperparameter configurations, the search procedure emits a bunch of excellent objective-oriented architectures. The combination of two-stage training with precomputing and memory-resident feature maps effectively reduces the time consumption of the RL-based NAS method, so that we complete approximately 1000 search iterations in two GPU days. To accelerate the convergence of the lightweight candidate architecture, we incorporate knowledge distillation into the training of the search process. This also provides a reasonable evaluation signal to the RL controller that enables it to converge well. In the end, we conduct full training with outstanding Pareto-optimal architectures, so that a series of excellent portrait parsing models (with only approximately 0.3M parameters) is received. Furthermore, we directly transfer the architectures searched on CelebAMask-HQ (Portrait Parsing) to other portrait and face segmentation tasks. Finally, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance of 96.5\% MIOU on EG1800 (portrait segmentation) and 91.6\% overall $F1$ -score on HELEN (face labeling). That is, our models significantly surpass the artificial network on the accuracy, but with lower resource consumption and higher real-time performance.},

Robust ILCs intend to model the uncertainties in the predictor and to guarantee the convergence of the learning process subject to such model errors. Despite the vast literature in ILCs, parameterizing the uncertainties with the stochastic errors in the predictor parameters identified from system I/O data and thus robustifying the ILC have not yet been targeted. This work is devoted to solving such problems in a data-driven fashion. The main contributions are two-fold. First, a data-driven ILC method is developed for LTI systems. The relationship is established between the errors in the predictor matrix and the stochastic disturbances to the system. Its robust monotonic convergence (RMC) is then linked with the closed-loop learning gain matrix that contains the predictor uncertainties and is analyzed based on a closed-form expectation of this gain matrix multiplied with its own transpose, that is, in a mean-square sense (MS-RMC). Second, the data-driven ILC and MS-RMC analysis are extended to nonlinear Hammerstein–Wiener (H-W) systems. The advantages of the proposed methods are finally verified via extensive simulations in terms of their convergence and uncorrelated tracking performance with the stochastic parametric uncertainties.},

For comparison, three conventional discretization formulas are also utilized. Theoretical analyses are presented to show the performance of ELLR5S formulas and DZNN models.

  abstract     = {Genetic programming (GP) has been applied to feature learning for image classification and achieved promising results. However, many GP-based feature learning algorithms are computationally expensive due to a large number of expensive fitness evaluations, especially when using a large number of training instances/images. Instance selection aims to select a small subset of training instances, which can reduce the computational cost. Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms often replace expensive fitness evaluations by building surrogate models. This article proposes an instance selection-based surrogate-assisted GP for fast feature learning in image classification. The instance selection method selects multiple small subsets of images from the original training set to form surrogate training sets of different sizes. The proposed approach gradually uses these surrogate training sets to reduce the overall computational cost using a static or dynamic strategy. At each generation, the proposed approach evaluates the entire population on the small surrogate training sets and only evaluates ten current best individuals on the entire training set. The features learned by the proposed approach are fed into linear support vector machines for classification. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach can not only significantly reduce the computational cost but also improve the generalisation performance over the baseline method, which uses the entire training set for fitness evaluations, on 11 different image datasets. The comparisons with other state-of-the-art GP and non-GP methods further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Further analysis shows that using multiple surrogate training sets in the proposed approach achieves better performance than using a single surrogate training set and using a random instance selection method.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been proposed to tackle the problem of covariate shift by minimizing the distribution discrepancy between the feature embeddings of source domain and target domain. However, the standard evaluation protocols assume that the conditional label distributions of the two domains are invariant, which is usually not consistent with the real-world scenarios such as long-tailed distribution of visual categories. In this article, the imbalanced domain adaptation (IDA) is formulated for a more realistic scenario where both label shift and covariate shift occur between the two domains. Theoretically, when label shift exists, aligning the marginal distributions may result in negative transfer. Therefore, a novel cluster-level discrepancy minimization (CDM) is developed. CDM proposes cross-domain similarity learning to learn tight and discriminative clusters, which are utilized for both feature-level and distribution-level discrepancy minimization, palliating the negative effect of label shift during domain transfer. Theoretical justifications further demonstrate that CDM minimizes the target risk in a progressive manner. To corroborate the effectiveness of CDM, we propose two evaluation protocols according to the real-world situation and benchmark existing domain adaptation approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that negative transfer does occur due to label shift, while our approach achieves significant improvement on imbalanced datasets, including Office-31, Image-CLEF, and Office-Home.},

NMF concentrates the features of each sample into a vector and approximates it by the linear combination of basis vectors, such that the low-dimensional representations are achieved. However, in real-world applications, the features usually have different importance. To exploit the discriminative features, some methods project the samples into the subspace with a transformation matrix, which disturbs the original feature attributes and neglects the diversity of samples. To alleviate the above problems, we propose the feature weighted NMF (FNMF) in this article. The salient properties of FNMF can be summarized as three-fold: 1) it learns the weights of features adaptively according to their importance; 2) it utilizes multiple feature weighting components to preserve the diversity; and 3) it can be solved efficiently with the suggested optimization algorithm. The performance on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that the proposed method obtains the state-of-the-art performance.},

The distributed algorithm is motivated by the alternating direction method of multipliers, but the agents can only share quantization information through an undirected graph. To reduce the tracking error due to information loss in quantization, we apply the dynamic quantization scheme with a decaying scaling function. The tracking error is explicitly characterized with respect to the limit of the decaying scaling function in quantization. Furthermore, we are able to show that the algorithm could asymptotically track the optimal solution when time-varying functions converge, even with quantization information loss.

In this article, we propose a pixel-based adaptive weighted cross-entropy (WCE) loss in conjunction with Jaccard distance to facilitate high-quality pixel-level road crack detection. Our work profoundly demonstrates the influence of loss functions on detection outcomes and sheds light on the sophisticated consecutive improvements in the realm of crack detection. Specifically, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed loss, we conduct extensive experiments on four public databases, that is, CrackForest, AigleRN, Crack360, and BJN260. Compared to the vanilla WCE, the proposed loss significantly speeds up the training process while retaining the performance.},

  abstract     = {Achieving reliable intervehicle positioning is one of the most fundamental elements for many vehicular applications, including collision avoidance and autonomous driving. Vehicle position is generally provided by a global navigation satellite system (GNSS), which unfortunately suffers from inaccuracy to varying degrees in challenging environments, for example, GNSS outages. In this article, a reliable fusion technique, called non-Gaussian Redheffer weighted least squares ( $n$ GRWLSs), is proposed. This new approach highlights the intervehicle positioning estimation in multi-GNSS outage environments, such as complete, partial, and free GNSS pseudorange outages. The proposed method combines, on the one hand, the benefits of the Gaussian dynamical matrix principle and the Redheffer distribution function for the sparse property in complete GNSS pseudorange outages and, on the other hand, the use of the optimal window size to regulate the data flow generated by both the inertial navigation systems (INSs) and GNSS during a partial GNSS pseudorange outage. During the free GNSS pseudorange outage, the process ignores data from the INS, and instead, GNSS pseudorange information alone will be considered to compute the intervehicle positioning information. Consequently, weighted least squares is used as an intervehicle positioning estimator. To address the pseudorange uncommon and INS measurement noises, the generalized error distribution (GED) is used to estimate the non-Gaussian densities. Finally, road-test experiments are implemented to evaluate the consistency of the proposed approach. The experimental results show that the proposed $n$ GRWLS can accurately estimate the intervehicle positioning under various conditions (free, partial, and complete GNSS pseudorange outages).},

One of the key advantages of the proposed event-triggering mechanism is that the information transmissions induced by event triggerings and topology switchings are independent, and data transmissions among agents are thus reduced. Furthermore, an explicit minimum interevent time is provided for all the agents so that the Zeno-behavior is excluded strictly.

  abstract     = {Supervised salient object detection (SOD) methods achieve state-of-the-art performance by relying on human-annotated saliency maps, while unsupervised methods attempt to achieve SOD by not using any annotations. In unsupervised SOD, how to obtain saliency in a completely unsupervised manner is a huge challenge. Existing unsupervised methods usually gain saliency by introducing other handcrafted feature-based saliency methods. In general, the location information of salient objects is included in the feature maps. If the features belonging to salient objects are called salient features and the features that do not belong to salient objects, such as background, are called nonsalient features, by dividing the feature maps into salient features and nonsalient features in an unsupervised way, then the object at the location of the salient feature is the salient object. Based on the above motivation, a novel method called learning salient feature (LSF) is proposed, which achieves unsupervised SOD by LSF from the data itself. This method takes enhancing salient feature and suppressing nonsalient features as the objective. Furthermore, a salient object localization method is proposed to roughly locate objects where the salient feature is located, so as to obtain the salient activation map. Usually, the object in the salient activation map is incomplete and contains a lot of noise. To address this issue, a saliency map update strategy is introduced to gradually remove noise and strengthen boundaries. The visualization of images and their salient activation maps show that our method can effectively learn salient visual objects. Experiments show that we achieve superior unsupervised performance on a series of datasets.},

  abstract     = {Although cooperative coevolutionary algorithms are developed for large-scale dynamic optimization via subspace decomposition, they still face difficulties in reacting to environmental changes, in the presence of multiple peaks in the fitness functions and unevenness of subproblems. The resource allocation mechanisms among subproblems in the existing algorithms rely mainly on the fitness improvements already made but not potential ones. On the one hand, there is a lack of sufficient computing resources to achieve potential fitness improvements for some hard subproblems. On the other hand, the existing algorithms waste computing resources aiming to find most of the local optima of problems. In this article, we propose a cooperative particle swarm optimization algorithm to address these issues by introducing a bilevel balanceable resource allocation mechanism. A search strategy in the lower level is introduced to select some promising solutions from an archive based on solution diversity and quality to identify new peaks in every subproblem. A resource allocation strategy in the upper level is introduced to balance the coevolution of multiple subproblems by referring to their historical improvements and more computing resources are allocated for solving the subproblems that perform poorly but are expected to make great fitness improvements. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is competitive with the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of objective function values and response efficiency with respect to environmental changes.},

A novel switched command filter-based dynamic event-triggered adaptive NN control approach is set up by exploiting the backstepping and command filter and the common Lyapunov function method. Since adaptive controllers of subsystems are event triggered, then if the switching happens between any two consecutive triggering instants, asynchronous switching will arise between candidate controllers of subsystems and subsystems. Unlike the existing literature, where maximum asynchronous time is restricted, without any strict limitations on maximum asynchronous time being needed in this article, the asynchronous switching problem is directly handled by proposing a novel switching dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) and event-triggered adaptive controllers of subsystems. Moreover, a piecewise constant variable is introduced into the switching DETM, which overcomes the difficulty of switched measurement error being discontinuous. Also, a strictly positive lower bound of interevent times is obtained. Finally, a continuous stirred tank reactor system and a numerical example are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach.},

To be independent of the topology information, the adaptive compensator with an edge-based event-triggered mechanism is then established. And the observer is proposed to recover the unmeasurable system states. Then, the distributed control scheme based on the compensator and the observer is designed to address the bipartite output tracking problem.

  abstract     = {3-D object detection is a fundamental task in the context of autonomous driving. In the literature, cheap monocular image-based methods show a significant performance drop compared to the expensive LiDAR and stereo-images-based algorithms. In this article, we aim to close this performance gap by bridging the representation capability between 2-D and 3-D domains. We propose a novel monocular 3-D object detection model using self-supervised learning and auxiliary learning, resorting to mimicking the representations over 3-D point clouds. Specifically, given a 2-D region proposal and the corresponding instance point cloud, we supervise the feature activation from our image-based convolution network to mimic the latent feature of a point-based neural network at the training stage. While state-of-the-art (SOTA) monocular 3-D detection algorithms typically convert images to pseudo-LiDAR with depth estimation and regress 3-D detection with LiDAR-based methods, our approach seeks the power of the 2-D neural network straightforwardly and essentially enhances the 2-D module capability with latent spatial-aware representations by contrastive learning. We empirically validate the performance improvement from the feature mimicking the KITTI and ApolloScape datasets and achieve the SOTA performance on the KITTI and ApolloScape leaderboard.},

In this scheme, the users and the operator form a Stackelberg game. The users send ESS orders to the operator and apply their own ESS dispatching strategies for their own purposes. Meanwhile, the operator maximizes its profit through optimal ESS sizing and scheduling, as well as pricing for the users’ ESS orders. The feasibility and economic performance of OaaC are further analyzed by solving a bilevel joint optimization problem of ESS pricing, sizing, and scheduling. To make the analysis tractable, the bilevel model is first transformed into its single-level mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) formulation and is then linearized into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem using multiple linearization methods. Case studies with actual data are utilized to demonstrate the profitability for the operator and simultaneously the ability of bill saving for the users under the proposed OaaC scheme.},

For this reason, a novel synchronous estimation is proposed to construct a composite observer for hypersonic vehicles, which consists of a neural-network (NN)-based Luenberger-type observer and a synchronous disturbance observer. This solves the identification problem of nonlinear dynamics in the reference control and realizes the estimation of the system state when unknown nonlinear dynamics and unknown disturbance exist at the same time. By synthesizing the information from the composite observer, an RL tracking controller is developed to solve the optimal attitude-tracking control problem. To improve the convergence performance of critic network weights, concurrent learning is employed to replace the traditional persistent excitation condition with a historical experience replay manner. In addition, this article proves that the weight estimation error is bounded when the learning rate satisfies the given sufficient condition.

With the utilization of the Lyapunov stability theorem, comparison method, and the definition of average impulsive interval, sufficient conditions for realizing the synchronization within a specific bound are derived. Moreover, with the definition of average impulsive gain, the parameter variation scheme is extended from the fixed impulsive effects case to the time-varying impulsive effects case. Finally, three numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness and the superiority of proposed mathematical deduction.},

  abstract     = {Image-to-image (I2I) translation has become a key asset for generative adversarial networks. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), despite having a significant performance, are not able to capture the spatial relationships among different parts of an object and, thus, do not qualify as the ideal representative model for image translation tasks. As a remedy to this problem, capsule networks have been proposed to represent patterns for a visual object in such a way that preserves hierarchical spatial relationships. The training of capsules is constrained by learning all pairwise relationships between capsules of consecutive layers. This design would be prohibitively expensive both in time and memory. In this article, we present a new framework for capsule networks to provide a full description of the input components at various levels of semantics, which can successfully be applied to the generator-discriminator architectures without incurring computational overhead compared to the CNNs. To successfully apply the proposed capsules in the generative adversarial network, we put forth a novel Gromov–Wasserstein (GW) distance as a differentiable loss function that compares the dissimilarity between two distributions and then guides the learned distribution toward target properties, using optimal transport (OT) discrepancy. The proposed method—which is called generative equivariant network (GEN)—is an alternative architecture for GANs with equivariance capsule layers. The proposed model is evaluated through a comprehensive set of experiments on I2I translation and image generation tasks and compared with several state-of-the-art models. Results indicate that there is a principled connection between generative and capsule models that allows extracting discriminant and invariant information from image data},

  abstract     = {Decision and control are core functionalities of high-level automated vehicles. Current mainstream methods, such as functional decomposition and end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL), suffer high time complexity or poor interpretability and adaptability on real-world autonomous driving tasks. In this article, we present an interpretable and computationally efficient framework called integrated decision and control (IDC) for automated vehicles, which decomposes the driving task into static path planning and dynamic optimal tracking that are structured hierarchically. First, the static path planning generates several candidate paths only considering static traffic elements. Then, the dynamic optimal tracking is designed to track the optimal path while considering the dynamic obstacles. To that end, we formulate a constrained optimal control problem (OCP) for each candidate path, optimize them separately, and follow the one with the best tracking performance. To unload the heavy online computation, we propose a model-based RL algorithm that can be served as an approximate-constrained OCP solver. Specifically, the OCPs for all paths are considered together to construct a single complete RL problem and then solved offline in the form of value and policy networks for real-time online path selecting and tracking, respectively. We verify our framework in both simulations and the real world. Results show that compared with baseline methods, IDC has an order of magnitude higher online computing efficiency, as well as better driving performance, including traffic efficiency and safety. In addition, it yields great interpretability and adaptability among different driving scenarios and tasks.},

  abstract     = {Multiview clustering has received great attention and numerous subspace clustering algorithms for multiview data have been presented. However, most of these algorithms do not effectively handle high-dimensional data and fail to exploit consistency for the number of the connected components in similarity matrices for different views. In this article, we propose a novel consistency-induced multiview subspace clustering (CiMSC) to tackle these issues, which is mainly composed of structural consistency (SC) and sample assignment consistency (SAC). To be specific, SC aims to learn a similarity matrix for each single view wherein the number of connected components equals to the cluster number of the dataset. SAC aims to minimize the discrepancy for the number of connected components in similarity matrices from different views based on the SAC assumption, that is, different views should produce the same number of connected components in similarity matrices. CiMSC also formulates cluster indicator matrices for different views, and shared similarity matrices simultaneously in an optimization framework. Since each column of similarity matrix can be used as a new representation of the data point, CiMSC can learn an effective subspace representation for the high-dimensional data, which is encoded into the latent representation by reconstruction in a nonlinear manner. We employ an alternating optimization scheme to solve the optimization problem. Experiments validate the advantage of CiMSC over 12 state-of-the-art multiview clustering approaches, for example, the accuracy of CiMSC is 98.06\% on the BBCSport dataset.},

However, when assigning a node to a community, similarity functions are sometimes used, which only use node information, while ignoring connection information within the community. These algorithms sometimes fail to find influential nodes, which eventually leads to the failure to find a complete local community. To address these problems, a new local community detection algorithm is proposed in this article. Two strategies, of strong fusion followed by weak fusion, are used alternately to fuse nodes. Compared with using two fusion strategies alone, the alternating loop method can improve the solution of the algorithm in each stage. In strong fusion, we propose a new membership function that considers both node information and connection information in the local community. This improves the quality of the fused node while preserving the structure of the current community. In weak fusion, we propose a parameter-based similarity measure, which can detect influential nodes for a local community. We also propose a local community evaluation metric, which does not require true division to determine the optimal local community under different parameters. Experiments, compared to six state-of-the-art algorithms, show that the proposed algorithm improves accuracy and stability, and also demonstrate the effectiveness of the new local community evaluation metrics in parameter selection.},

First, a model-based feedback controller is designed, which utilizes estimated states, and thus can compensate the error between plant states and the feedback data. Then, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) is proposed by introducing an internal dynamic variable and a timer variable with jump dynamics. The proposed (DETM) can exclude Zeno behavior by regularizing a prescribed strictly positive triggering interval. Incorporated in the ETC scheme, a novel hybrid model is established to describe the flow and jump dynamics of the power system in the presence of DoS attacks. Based on the hybrid dynamic ETC scheme, the power system stability can be preserved if the attacks frequency and duration sustain within an explicit range. In addition, the explicit range is further maximized based on the measurement trigger-resetting property. Finally, a numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness of our results.},

To address the above issues, this article proposes a heterogeneous sample enhancement network with lifelong learning (HSELL-Net). First, a heterogeneous DA subnet (HDA-subnet) is presented, in which the designed heterogeneous supporting domain ensures dimension alignment and the designed distribution jointly matching improves the performance of distribution matching; thus, fault samples from other working conditions can be employed to reliably enhance small samples. Second, a lifelong learning subnet (LL-subnet) is designed, in which the proposed Admixup and shared knowledge repository enable incremental samples to further enhance small samples without retraining the network. The two subnets are mutually embedded and reinforced to enhance the number and types of small samples; thus, the accuracy and generalization of fault diagnosis under industrial small samples are improved. Finally, benchmark simulated experiments and real-world application experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method.

However, the process of acquiring representations in DRL is easily affected by interference from models, and moreover leaves unnecessary parameters, leading to control performance reduction. In this article, we propose a double sparse DRL via multilayer sparse coding and nonconvex regularized pruning. To alleviate interference in DRL, we propose a multilayer sparse-coding-structural network to obtain deep sparse representation for control in reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we employ a nonconvex log regularizer to promote strong sparsity, efficiently removing the unnecessary weights with a regularizer-based pruning scheme. Hence, a double sparse DRL algorithm is developed, which can not only learn deep sparse representation to reduce the interference but also remove redundant weights while keeping the robust performance. The experimental results in five benchmark environments of the deep $q$ network (DQN) architecture demonstrate that the proposed method with deep sparse representations from the multilayer sparse-coding structure can outperform existing sparse-coding-based DRL in control, for example, completing Mountain Car with 140.81 steps, achieving near 10\% reward increase from the single-layer sparse-coding DRL algorithm, and obtaining 286.08 scores in Catcher, which are over two times the rewards of the other algorithms. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can reduce over 80\% parameters while keeping performance improvements from deep sparse representations.},

Domain adaptation (DA) techniques can transfer the knowledge from the source domain with massive labeled patterns to the target domain for learning a classification model. In practice, some objects in the target domain are easily classified by this classification model, and these objects usually can provide more or less useful information for classifying the other objects in the target domain. So a new method called distribution adaptation based on evidence theory (DAET) is proposed to improve the classification accuracy by combining the complementary information derived from both the source and target domains. In DAET, the objects that are easy to classify are first selected as easy-target objects, and the other objects are regarded as hard-target objects. For each hard-target object, we can obtain one classification result with the assistance of massive labeled patterns in the source domain, and another classification result can be acquired based on the easy-target objects with confidently predicted (pseudo) labels. However, the weights of these classification results may vary because the reliabilities of the used information sources are different. The weights are estimated by mean difference reflecting the information source quality. Then, we discount the classification results with the corresponding weights under the framework of the evidence theory, which is expert at dealing with uncertain information. These discounted classification results are combined by an evidential combination rule for making the final class decision. The effectiveness of DAET for cross-domain pattern classification is evaluated with respect to some advanced DA methods, and the experiment results show DAET can significantly improve the classification accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) for classification is crucial for large-scale images and bio-microarray data using machine learning. It is challenging to select informative features from high-dimensional data which generally contains many irrelevant and redundant features. These features often impede classifier performance and misdirect classification tasks. In this article, we present an efficient FS algorithm to improve classification accuracy by taking into account both the relevance of the features and the pairwise features correlation in regard to class labels. Based on conditional mutual information and entropy, a new supervised similarity measure is proposed. The supervised similarity measure is connected with feature redundancy minimization evaluation and then combined with feature relevance maximization evaluation. A new criterion max-relevance and min-supervised-redundancy (MRMSR) is introduced and theoretically proved for FS. The proposed MRMSR-based method is compared to seven existing FS approaches on several frequently studied public benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposal is more effective at selecting informative features and results in better competitive classification performance.},

  abstract     = {Missing values are ubiquitous in industrial data sets because of multisampling rates, sensor faults, and transmission failures. The incomplete data obstruct the effective use of data and degrade the performance of data-driven models. Numerous imputation algorithms have been proposed to deal with missing values, primarily based on supervised learning, that is, imputing the missing values by constructing a prediction model with the remaining complete data. They have limited performance when the amount of incomplete data is overwhelming. Moreover, many methods have not considered the autocorrelation of time-series data. Thus, an adaptive-learned median-filled deep autoencoder (AM-DAE) is proposed in this study, aiming to impute missing values of industrial time-series data in an unsupervised manner. It continuously replaces the missing values by the median of the input data and its reconstruction, which allows the imputation information to be transmitted with the training process. In addition, an adaptive learning strategy is adopted to guide the AM-DAE paying more attention to the reconstruction learning of nonmissing values or missing values in different iteration periods. Finally, two industrial examples are used to verify the superior performance of the proposed method compared with other advanced techniques.},

  abstract     = {Recently, low-rank representation (LRR) methods have been widely applied for hyperspectral anomaly detection, due to their potentials in separating the backgrounds and anomalies. However, existing LRR models generally convert 3-D hyperspectral images (HSIs) into 2-D matrices, inevitably leading to the destruction of intrinsic 3-D structure properties in HSIs. To this end, we propose a novel tensor low-rank and sparse representation (TLRSR) method for hyperspectral anomaly detection. A 3-D TLR model is expanded to separate the LR background part represented by a tensorial background dictionary and corresponding coefficients. This representation characterizes the multiple subspace property of the complex LR background. Based on the weighted tensor nuclear norm and the $L_{F,1}$ sparse norm, a dictionary is designed to make its atoms more relevant to the background. Moreover, a principal component analysis (PCA) method can be assigned as one preprocessing step to exact a subset of HSI bands, retaining enough the HSI object information and reducing computational time of the postprocessing tensorial operations. The proposed model is efficiently solved by the well-designed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs). A comparison with the existing algorithms via experiments establishes the competitiveness of the proposed method with the state-of-the-art competitors in the hyperspectral anomaly detection task.},

In the three consensus algorithms, the sampled data control method is utilized in the continuous-time subsystem to analyze the convergence of different dynamic agents in the matrix-weighted interaction mode. For the symmetric matrix-weighted fixed and switched multiagent networks, when the sampling period meets certain conditions, the consensus criteria are established via the matrix theory, Lyapunov stability theory, and analysis theory. Moreover, asymmetric matrix-weighted fixed multiagent networks which can be applied to some scenarios with scaled and rotated updates constraints are considered, and consensus criteria are also obtained when the sampling period meets certain conditions.

Then, the DMETP is proposed for the first time, which can not only relieve the bandwidth pressure but also obtain the key released packets at the crest or trough of the curve. By augmenting the states of the original system and the asynchronous attacks detection filter, the issue of attacks detection is converted into an auxiliary dissipative filtering for the CPS. Moreover, sufficient conditions for the existence of the attacks detection filter are obtained.

Existing approaches have limited coordination between robots when generating team plans or do not consider user location probability within these plans. This results in long searches and robots potentially revisiting the same locations in succession. In this article, we present a novel multirobot person search system to generate search plans for multirobot teams to find multiple dynamic users before a deadline. Our approach is unique in that it simultaneously considers the search actions of all robots and user location probabilities when generating team plans, where user location probabilities are represented as conditional spatial-temporal probability density functions. We model this multirobot person search problem as a two-stage optimization problem to maximize the expected number of users found before the deadline. Stage 1 solves the action selection problem to determine a set of team actions, and the second stage solves the action allocation problem to distribute these actions amongst the robots. Namely, in stage 1, a novel conditional multiperiod multiknapsack problem is modeled as a min-flow graph solved sequentially by the Bellman–Ford shortest path algorithm. Stage 2 is a variant of the min-max multitraveling salesperson problem which models the environment topology as a search region network and search times selected by the previous stage. This stage is solved by a novel fuzzy clustering method. Numerous experiments comparing our proposed method to other existing approaches with varying environment sizes, search durations, and the number of users showed that our approach was able to find more target users before a defined deadline.},

The most existing ML-based methods will take a long time to learn new malware families in the latest malware family landscape. Existing ML-based Android malware detection and classification methods struggle with the fast evolution of the malware landscape, particularly in terms of the emergence of zero-day malware families and limited representation of single-view features. In this article, a new multiview feature intelligence (MFI) framework is developed to learn the representation of a targeted capability from known malware families for recognizing unknown and evolving malware with the same capability. The new framework performs reverse engineering to extract multiview heterogeneous features, including semantic string features, API call graph features, and smali opcode sequential features. It can learn the representation of a targeted capability from known malware families through a series of processes of feature analysis, selection, aggregation, and encoding, to detect unknown Android malware with shared target capability. We create a new dataset with ground-truth information regarding capability. Many experiments are conducted on the new dataset to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the new method. The results demonstrate that the new method outperforms three state-of-the-art methods, including: 1) Drebin; 2) MaMaDroid; and 3) $N$ -opcode, when detecting unknown Android malware with targeted capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Capsule network (CapsNet) acts as a promising alternative to the typical convolutional neural network, which is the dominant network to develop the remaining useful life (RUL) estimation models for mechanical equipment. Although CapsNet comes with an impressive ability to represent entities’ hierarchical relationships through a high-dimensional vector embedding, it fails to capture the long-term temporal correlation of run-to-failure time series measured from degraded mechanical equipment. On the other hand, the slow-varying dynamics, which reveals the low-frequency information hidden in mechanical dynamical behavior, is overlooked in the existing RUL estimation models (including CapsNet), limiting the utmost ability of advanced networks. To address the aforementioned concerns, we propose a slow-varying dynamics-assisted temporal CapsNet (SD-TemCapsNet) to simultaneously learn the slow-varying dynamics and temporal dynamics from measurements for accurate RUL estimation. First, in light of the sensitivity of fault evolution, slow-varying features are decomposed from normal raw data to convey the low-frequency components corresponding to the system dynamics. Next, the long short-term memory (LSTM) mechanism is introduced into CapsNet to capture the temporal correlation of time series. To this end, experiments conducted on an aircraft engine and a milling machine verify that the proposed SD-TemCapsNet outperforms the mainstream methods. In comparison with CapsNet, the estimation accuracy of the aircraft engine with four different scenarios has been improved by 10.17\%, 24.97\%, 3.25\%, and 13.03\% about the index root mean squared error, respectively. Similarly, the estimation accuracy of the milling machine has been improved by 23.57\% compared to LSTM and 19.54\% compared to CapsNet.},

Specifically, a novel fluid micelle network is devised for image SR based on the theory of FD that follows the residual learning scheme but learns the residual structure by solving the finite difference equation in FD. The pixel motion equation in the SR process is derived from the Navier–Stokes (N-S) FD equation, establishing a guided branch that is aware of edge information. Thus, the second-order residual drives the network for feature extraction, and the guided branch corrects the direction of the pixel stream to supplement the details. Experiments on popular benchmarks and a real-world microscope chip image dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other modern methods in terms of both objective metrics and visual quality. The proposed method can also reconstruct clear geometric structures, offering the potential for real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Intrusion detection (ID) on the cloud environment has received paramount interest over the last few years. Among the latest approaches, machine learning-based ID methods allow us to discover unknown attacks. However, due to the lack of malicious samples and the rapid evolution of diverse attacks, constructing a cloud ID system (IDS) that is robust to a wide range of unknown attacks remains challenging. In this article, we propose a novel solution to enable robust cloud IDSs using deep neural networks. Specifically, we develop two deep generative models to synthesize malicious samples on the cloud systems. The first model, conditional denoising adversarial autoencoder (CDAAE), is used to generate specific types of malicious samples. The second model (CDAEE-KNN) is a hybrid of CDAAE and the $K$ -nearest neighbor algorithm to generate malicious borderline samples that further improve the accuracy of a cloud IDS. The synthesized samples are merged with the original samples to form the augmented datasets. Three machine learning algorithms are trained on the augmented datasets and their effectiveness is analyzed. The experiments conducted on four popular IDS datasets show that our proposed techniques significantly improve the accuracy of the cloud IDSs compared with the baseline technique and the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, our models also enhance the accuracy of machine learning algorithms in detecting some currently challenging distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, including low-rate DDoS attacks and application layer DDoS attacks.},

  abstract     = {This work presents FG-Net, a general deep learning framework for large-scale point cloud understanding without voxelizations, which achieves accurate and real-time performance with a single NVIDIA GTX 1080 8G GPU and an i7 CPU. First, a novel noise and outlier filtering method is designed to facilitate the subsequent high-level understanding tasks. For effective understanding purpose, we propose a novel plug-and-play module consisting of correlated feature mining and deformable convolution-based geometric-aware modeling, in which the local feature relationships and point cloud geometric structures can be fully extracted and exploited. For the efficiency issue, we put forward a new composite inverse density sampling (IDS)-based and learning-based operation and a feature pyramid-based residual learning strategy to save the computational cost and memory consumption, respectively. Compared with current methods which are only validated on limited datasets, we have done extensive experiments on eight real-world challenging benchmarks, which demonstrates that our approaches outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of accuracy, speed, and memory efficiency. Moreover, weakly supervised transfer learning is also conducted to demonstrate the generalization capacity of our method.},

  abstract     = {Optical remote sensing images (RSIs) have been widely used in many applications, and one of the interesting issues about optical RSIs is the salient object detection (SOD). However, due to diverse object types, various object scales, numerous object orientations, and cluttered backgrounds in optical RSIs, the performance of the existing SOD models often degrade largely. Meanwhile, cutting-edge SOD models targeting optical RSIs typically focus on suppressing cluttered backgrounds, while they neglect the importance of edge information which is crucial for obtaining precise saliency maps. To address this dilemma, this article proposes an edge-guided recurrent positioning network (ERPNet) to pop-out salient objects in optical RSIs, where the key point lies in the edge-aware position attention unit (EPAU). First, the encoder is used to give salient objects a good representation, that is, multilevel deep features, which are then delivered into two parallel decoders, including: 1) an edge extraction part and 2) a feature fusion part. The edge extraction module and the encoder form a U-shape architecture, which not only provides accurate salient edge clues but also ensures the integrality of edge information by extra deploying the intraconnection. That is to say, edge features can be generated and reinforced by incorporating object features from the encoder. Meanwhile, each decoding step of the feature fusion module provides the position attention about salient objects, where position cues are sharpened by the effective edge information and are used to recurrently calibrate the misaligned decoding process. After that, we can obtain the final saliency map by fusing all position attention cues. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public optical RSIs datasets, and the results show that the proposed ERPNet can accurately and completely pop-out salient objects, which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art SOD models.},

  abstract     = {Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (RSIs), or RSI-SOD, is an emerging topic in understanding optical RSIs. However, due to the difference between optical RSIs and natural scene images (NSIs), directly applying NSI-SOD methods to optical RSIs fails to achieve satisfactory results. In this article, we propose a novel adjacent context coordination network (ACCoNet) to explore the coordination of adjacent features in an encoder–decoder architecture for RSI-SOD. Specifically, ACCoNet consists of three parts: 1) an encoder; 2) adjacent context coordination modules (ACCoMs); and 3) a decoder. As the key component of ACCoNet, ACCoM activates the salient regions of output features of the encoder and transmits them to the decoder. ACCoM contains a local branch and two adjacent branches to coordinate the multilevel features simultaneously. The local branch highlights the salient regions in an adaptive way, while the adjacent branches introduce global information of adjacent levels to enhance salient regions. In addition, to extend the capabilities of the classic decoder block (i.e., several cascaded convolutional layers), we extend it with two bifurcations and propose a bifurcation-aggregation block (BAB) to capture the contextual information in the decoder. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed ACCoNet outperforms 22 state-of-the-art methods under nine evaluation metrics, and runs up to 81 fps on a single NVIDIA Titan X GPU.

  abstract     = {Within the last few years, great efforts have been made to study few-shot learning. Although general object detection is advancing at a rapid pace, few-shot detection remains a very challenging problem. In this work, we propose a novel decoupled metric network (DMNet) for single-stage few-shot object detection. We design a decoupled representation transformation (DRT) and an image-level distance metric learning (IDML) to solve the few-shot detection problem. The DRT can eliminate the adverse effect of handcrafted prior knowledge by predicting objectness and anchor shape. Meanwhile, to alleviate the problem of representation disagreement between classification and location (i.e., translational invariance versus translational variance), the DRT adopts a decoupled manner to generate adaptive representations so that the model is easier to learn from only a few training data. As for a few-shot classification in the detection task, we design an IDML tailored to enhance the generalization ability. This module can perform metric learning for the whole visual feature, so it can be more efficient than traditional DML due to the merit of parallel inference for multiobjects. Based on the DRT and IDML, our DMNet efficiently realizes a novel paradigm for few-shot detection, called single-stage metric detection. Experiments are conducted on the PASCAL VOC dataset and the MS COCO dataset. As a result, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot object detection.

The analysis in this article aims at creating a common conceptual design framework to enforce development efforts in gesture-based human–machine interaction (HMI).

  abstract     = {In dealing with the expensive multiobjective optimization problem, some algorithms convert it into a number of single-objective subproblems for optimization. At each iteration, these algorithms conduct surrogate-assisted optimization on one or multiple subproblems. However, these subproblems may be unnecessary or resolved. Operating on such subproblems can cause server inefficiencies, especially in the case of expensive optimization. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose an adaptive subproblem selection (ASS) strategy to identify the most promising subproblems for further modeling. To better leverage the cross information between the subproblems, we use the collaborative multioutput Gaussian process surrogate to model them jointly. Moreover, the commonly used acquisition functions (also known as infill criteria) are investigated in this article. Our analysis reveals that these acquisition functions may cause severe imbalances between exploitation and exploration in multiobjective optimization scenarios. Consequently, we develop a new acquisition function, namely, adaptive lower confidence bound (ALCB), to cope with it. The experimental results on three different sets of benchmark problems indicate that our proposed algorithm is competitive. Beyond that, we also quantitatively validate the effectiveness of the ASS strategy, the CoMOGP model, and the ALCB acquisition function.},

To surmount the influence of the dead-zone input, the dead-zone model is transformed into a linear term and a disturbance term. Meanwhile, the prescribed tracking performance is realized by developing a speed function, which means that all tracking errors of MASs can converge to a predefined set in a given finite time. Moreover, the unknown nonlinear dynamics are approximated by fuzzy-logic systems. By combining the dynamic surface approach and the Lyapunov stability theory, we design an adaptive event-triggered control algorithm, such that the bipartite consensus problem of stochastic nonlinear MASs can be achieved, and all signals are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded in probability of the closed-loop systems. Finally, simulation examples are proposed to verify the feasibility of the algorithm.},

We propose a semantic-aware dehazing network (SDNet) in which the semantic prior is taken as a color constraint for dehazing, benefiting the acquisition of a reasonable scene configuration. In addition, we design a densely connected block to capture global and local information for dehazing and semantic prior estimation.

Specifically, the vibration signals from the gearbox are decomposed using WPD and the decomposed signal components are fed into a hierarchical convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract multiscale features adaptively and classify faults effectively. The presented method combines the multiscale characteristic of WPD with the strong classification capacity of CNNs, and it does not need complex manual feature extraction steps as usually adopted in existing results. The presented CNN with multiple characteristic scales based on WPD (WPD-MSCNN) has three advantages: 1) the added WPD layer can legitimately process the nonstationary vibration data to obtain components at multiple characteristic scales adaptively, it takes full advantage of WPD and, thus, enables the CNN to extract multiscale features; 2) the WPD layer directly sends multiscale components to the hierarchical CNN to extract rich fault information effectively, and it avoids the loss of useful information due to hand-crafted feature extraction; and 3) even if the scale changes, the lengths of components remain the same, which shows that the proposed method is robust to scale uncertainties in the vibration signals. Experiments with vibration data from a production wind farm provided by a company using condition monitoring system (CMS) show that the presented WPD-MSCNN method is superior to traditional CNN and multiscale CNN (MSCNN) for fault diagnosis.},

Specifically, sparse denoising autoencoder (SDAE) is established by integrating a sparse AE (SAE) with a denoising AE (DAE) for the low-dimensional but intrinsic feature representation of the CIP monitoring data (CIPMD) with possible noise contamination. SSDAE-Softmax is established by stacking multiple SDAEs with a layerwise pretraining procedure, and a Softmax classifier with a global fine-tuning strategy. Furthermore, SSDAE-Softmax hyperparameters are optimized by a relatively new global optimization algorithm, referred to as the state transition algorithm (STA). Benefiting from the deep learning-based feature representation scheme with the STA-based hyperparameter optimization, the underlying intrinsic characteristics of CIPMD can be learned automatically and adaptively for accurate fault identification. A numeric simulation system, the benchmark Tennessee Eastman process (TEP), and a real industrial process, that is, the continuous casting process (CCP) from a top steel plant of China, are used to validate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed SSDAE-Softmax model can effectively identify various process faults, and has stronger robustness and adaptability against the noise interference in CIPMD for the process monitoring of CIPs.},

With the purpose of relieving the communication burden as well as enhancing the transmission security, a logarithmic-type encoding–decoding mechanism is introduced for each sensor node so as to encode the transmitted data with a finite number of bits. A distributed set-membership filter is designed to determine the local ellipsoidal set that contains the system state by only utilizing the data from the local sensor node and its neighbors, where the proposed filter scheme is truly distributed with desirable scalability. Then, a new ellipsoid-based fusion rule is developed for the designed set-membership filters in order to form the fused ellipsoidal set that has a globally smaller volume than all local ellipsoidal sets. With the aid of the mathematical induction technique, the set theory, and the convex optimization approach, sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of the desired distributed set-membership filters and the fusion weights. Then, the filter parameters and the fusion weights are acquired by solving a set of constrained optimization problems. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fusion filtering algorithm.},

More specifically, we show that using hindsight goals changes such a likelihood and results in a biased learning objective for multigoal RL. We analyze the hindsight bias due to this use of hindsight goals and propose the bias-corrected HER (BHER), an efficient algorithm that corrects the hindsight bias in training. We further show that BHER outperforms several state-of-the-art multigoal RL approaches in challenging robotics tasks.},

  abstract     = {Most existing light field saliency detection methods have achieved great success by exploiting unique light field data-focus information in focal slices. However, they process light field data in a slicewise way, leading to suboptimal results because the relative contribution of different regions in focal slices is ignored. How we can comprehensively explore and integrate focused saliency regions that would positively contribute to accurate saliency detection. Answering this question inspires us to develop a new insight. In this article, we propose a patch-aware network to explore light field data in a regionwise way. First, we excavate focused salient regions with a proposed multisource learning module (MSLM), which generates a filtering strategy for integration followed by three guidances based on saliency, boundary, and position. Second, we design a sharpness recognition module (SRM) to refine and update this strategy and perform feature integration. With our proposed MSLM and SRM, we can obtain more accurate and complete saliency maps. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets prove that our proposed method achieves competitive performance over 2-D, 3-D, and 4-D salient object detection methods. The code and results of our method are available at https://github.com/OIPLab-DUT/IEEE-TCYB-PANet .},

  abstract     = {Recently, network embedding (NE) is an amazing research point in complex networks and devoted to a variety of tasks. Nearly, all the methods and models of NE are based on the local, high-order, or global similarity of the networks, and few studies have focused on the role discovery or structural similarity, which is of great significance in spreading dynamics and network theory. Meanwhile, existing NE models for role discovery suffer from two limitations, that is: 1) they fail to model the varying dependencies between each node and its neighbor nodes and 2) they cannot capture the effective node features which are helpful to role discovery, which makes these methods ineffective when applied to the role discovery task. To solve the above problems of NE for role discovery or structural similarity, we propose a unified deep learning framework, called RDAA, which can effectively represent features of nodes and benefit the Role Discovery-guided NE with a deep autoencoder, while modeling the local links with an Attention mechanism. In addition, we design an elaborately binding technique to combine both parts and optimize the framework in a unified way. We conduct different experiments, including visualization, role classification, role discovery, and running time compared to popular NE methods for both proximity and structural similarity. The RDAA has better performance on all the datasets and achieves good tradeoffs.},

  abstract     = {The recommender system is a popular research topic in the past decades, and various models have been proposed. Among them, collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most effective approaches. The underlying philosophy of CF is to capture and utilize two types of relationships among users/items, that is, the user–item preferences and the similarities among users/items, to make recommendations. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity in many research fields, and in the recommendation field, GNN-based CF models have also been proposed, which are shown to have impressive performance. However, in our research, we observe a crucial drawback of these models, that is, while they can explicitly model and utilize the user–item preferences, the other necessary type of relationship, that is, the similarities among users/items, can only be implied and then utilized, which seems to hinder the performance of these models. Motivated by this, in this article, we first propose a novel dual-message propagation mechanism (DPM). The DPM can explicitly model and utilize both preferences and similarities to make recommendations; thus, it seems to be a better realization of CF’s philosophy. Then, a dual-message graph CF (DGCF) model is proposed. Different from the existing models, in the DGCF, each user’s/item’s embedding is processed by two GNNs, with one handling the preferences and the other handling the similarities. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DGCF substantially outperforms state-of-the-art CF models, and the small amount of sacrifice of time efficiency is tolerable considering the substantial improvement of model performance.},

This hypothesis, however, results in difficulties of developing theoretic analysis methods and promoting practical applications for ILC, especially in the presence of continuous-time systems, which is the motivation of the current paper to cope with robust tracking problems of continuous-time ILC systems subject to nonrepetitive (i.e., iteration-dependent) uncertainties. Based on integrating an iterative rectifying mechanism, continuous-time ILC can effectively address the ill effects of the multiple nonrepetitive uncertainties that arise from the system models, initial states, load and measurement disturbances, and desired references. Furthermore, a robust convergence analysis method is presented for continuous-time ILC by combining a contraction mapping-based method and a system equivalence transformation method. It is disclosed that regardless of continuous-time ILC systems with zero or nonzero system relative degrees, the robust tracking tasks in the presence of nonrepetitive uncertainties can be accomplished, together with the boundedness of all the system trajectories being ensured. Two examples are included to verify the validity of our robust tracking results for nonrepetitive continuous-time ILC systems.},

Therefore, the developed model-free algorithm continues exploration by adjusting its unknown parameters until the desired learning and control are accomplished. Second, we provide an utterly model-free adaptive law enriched with the exploration-exploitation policy and derived step-by-step using the exact analogy of the model-based solution. The obtained adaptive control law considers the control signal saturation and the control signal (input) delay. Performed Lyapunov stability analysis ensures the convergence of the adaptive law that can also be used for intelligent control approaches. Third, we implement the adaptive algorithm in real time on a challenging benchmark system: a fourth-order, coupled dynamics, input saturated, and time-delayed underactuated manipulator. The results show that the proposed adaptive algorithm explores larger state-action spaces and treats the vanishing gradient problem in both learning and control. Also, we notice from the results that the learning and control properties of the adaptive algorithm are optimized as required.},

  abstract     = {Estimating 3-D hand pose estimation from a single depth image is important for human–computer interaction. Although depth-based 3-D hand pose estimation has made great progress in recent years, it is still difficult to deal with some complex scenes, especially the issues of serious self-occlusion and high self-similarity of fingers. Inspired by the fact that multipart context is critical to alleviate ambiguity, and constraint relations contained in the hand structure are important for the robust estimation, we attempt to explicitly model the correlations between different hand parts. In this article, we propose a pose-guided hierarchical graph convolution (PHG) module, which is embedded into the pixelwise regression framework to enhance the convolutional feature maps by exploring the complex dependencies between different hand parts. Specifically, the PHG module first extracts hierarchical fine-grained node features under the guidance of hand pose and then uses graph convolution to perform hierarchical message passing between nodes according to the hand structure. Finally, the enhanced node features are used to generate dynamic convolution kernels to generate hierarchical structure-aware feature maps. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance or comparable performance with the state-of-the-art methods on five 3-D hand pose datasets: 1) HANDS 2019; 2) HANDS 2017; 3) NYU; 4) ICVL; and 5) MSRA.},

First, some interesting properties of PCMs with w-consistency and w-transitivity are studied. Second, novel methods are proposed to construct the quantification indices of w-consistency and w-transitivity of PCMs, respectively. Some comparisons with the existing methods are offered to illustrate the novelty of the proposed ones. Third, an optimization model is put forward to modify a PCM without any transitivity property to a new one with w-consistency and w-transitivity, respectively. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is adopted to solve the nonlinear optimization problems. A novel decision-making model is established by considering the w-transitivity as the minimum requirement. Some numerical examples are carried out to illustrate the developed methods and models. It is observed that the proposed indices can be computed efficiently and reflect the inherent relations of the entries in a PCM with w-consistency and w-transitivity, respectively.},

This robust phase is then followed by an optimal phase. There are design parameters in the control, which can be fine-tuned. We proposed multiple performance objectives. The goal of the choice of the control design parameters is to minimize the performance objectives. However, since these objectives are nonconciliating (meaning one’s minimum is not the other one’s minimum), we invoke the Stackelberg strategy for the optimal parameters. The game strategy mimics two players: one is the leader and one is the follower. Through the interplay between the two players, we show how to select the design parameters.

In this article, based on the evaluator set, a mission planning framework for the underlying energy-efficient passive UAV radar imaging system is proposed to achieve optimized mission performance for a given remote sensing task. First, the mission planning problem is defined in the context of the proposed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system and a general framework is outlined, including mission specification, illuminator selection, and path planning. It is found that the performance of the system is highly dependent upon the flight path adopted by the UAV platform in a 3-D terrain environment, which offers the potential of optimizing the mission performance by adjusting the UAV path. Then, the path planning problem is modeled as a single-objective optimization problem with multiple constraints. Path planning can be divided into two substages based on different mission orientations and low mutual correlation. Based on this property, a path planning method, called substage division collaborative search (Sub-DiCoS), is proposed. The problem is divided into two subproblems with the corresponding decision space and subpopulation, which significantly relax the constraints for each subproblem and facilitates the search for feasible solutions. Then, differential evolution and the whole-stage best guidance technique are devised to cooperatively lead the subpopulations to search for the best solution. Finally, simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Sub-DiCoS method. The result of the mission planning method can be used to guide the UAV platform to safely travel through a 3-D rough terrain in an energy-efficient manner and achieve optimized SAR imaging and communication performance during the flight.},

Indeed, as big data and artificial intelligence continue to evolve, the traffic control strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been proven to be a promising method to improve the efficiency of intersections and save people’s travel time. However, the existing algorithms ignore the temporal and spatial characteristics of intersections. In this article, we propose a multiagent RL based on the deep spatiotemporal attentive neural network (MARL-DSTAN) to determine the traffic signal timing in a large-scale road network. In this model, the state information captures the spatial dependency of the entire road network by leveraging the graph convolutional network (GCN) and integrates the information based on the importance of intersections via the attention mechanism. Meanwhile, to accumulate more valuable samples and enhance the learning efficiency, the recurrent neural network (RNN) is introduced in the exploration stage to constrain the action search space instead of fully random exploration. MARL-DSTAN decomposes the large-scale area into multiple base environments, and the agents in each base environment use the idea of “centralized training and decentralized execution” to learn to accelerate the algorithm convergence. The simulation results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the fixed timing scheme and several other state-of-the-art baseline RL algorithms.},

In general, although it is less laborious and more efficient to collect CLs compared with ordinary labels, the less informative signal in the complementary supervision is less helpful to learn competent feature representation. Consequently, the final classifier’s performance greatly deteriorates. In this article, we leverage generative adversarial networks (GANs) to derive an algorithm GAN-CL to effectively learn from CLs. In addition to the role in original GAN, the discriminator also serves as a normal classifier in GAN-CL, with the objective constructed partly with the complementary information. To further prove the effectiveness of our schema, we study the global optimality of both generator and discriminator for the GAN-CL under mild assumptions.

  abstract     = {In this work, a bionic memristive circuit with the functions of emotional learning and generation is proposed, which can perform brain-like emotional learning and generation based on various types of input information. The proposed circuit is designed based on the brain emotional learning theory in the limbic system, which mainly includes three layers of design: 1) the bottom layer is the design of the basic unit modules, such as neuron and synapse; 2) the middle layer is the design of the functional modules related to emotional learning in the limbic system, such as the amygdala, thalamus, and so on; and 3) the top layer is the design of the overall circuit, which is used to realize the function of the emotional generation. A 2-D emotional space composed of valence and arousal signals is adopted. According to the above bottom-up circuit design method, the valence and arousal signals can be generated, respectively, by designing corresponding emotional learning circuits, so as to form continuous emotions. The volatile and nonvolatile memristors are mainly used to mimic the functions of the neuron and synapse at the bottom layer of the circuit to achieve the core emotional learning function of the middle layer, thereby constructing a brain-like information processing architecture to realize the function of the emotional generation in the top layer. The simulation results in PSPICE show that the proposed circuit can learn and generate emotions like humans. If the proposed circuit is applied to a humanoid robot platform through further research, the robot may have the ability of personalized emotional interaction with humans, so that it can be effectively used in emotional companionship and other aspects.},

With estimated information of neighbors, a novel distributed reference generator is designed. To compensate the unmeasured state variables of each agent, a reduced-order dynamic gain filter is constructed. Based on the generator and filter, and using the recursive design method, a distributed adaptive protocol is designed, where the adaptive technique is used to compensate the actuator failures. The proposed scheme can significantly relax conditions on the communication graph, which allows the graph to be disconnected at any time instant. The number of introduced variables in the filter and its dimension is greatly reduced and, thus, reduces the numerical challenge. The output-feedback consensus for nonlinear MASs with actuator failures and possible unmatched actuator redundancy is addressed for the first time. The consensus error can converge to an arbitrarily small set not affected by actuator failures, and the resulting closed-loop system is semiglobally stable. Finally, simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

We consider the process and terminal errors simultaneously, and explicitly discuss how different values of parameters affect the optimality. Moreover, we extend our conclusions to the multihop case.

Next, a new distributed Zeno-free ETC strategy is proposed based on the dynamic quantizer. Then, two different situations, that is, the quantizer is designed with/without the network topology information, are, respectively, discussed.

In the experiments, we focus on high-dimensional, low-sample-size data since they represent the main challenge for FS.

The asynchronous control method is employed to overcome the nonsynchronous phenomenon between the system mode and controller mode. On the other hand, to reduce the frequency of data transmission, a resilient asynchronous event-triggered control scheme taking deception attacks into account is designed to save communication resources, and the proposed controller can cover some existing ones as special examples. Moreover, different triggering conditions corresponding to different jumping modes are developed to decide whether state signals should be transferred. A new stability criterion is derived to ensure the passivity of the resultant system although there exist deception attacks.

It has been validated that estimating how many 1’s in a multidimensional label vector is easier than directly predicting which elements are 1 and estimating cardinality as a prior step will improve the classification performance. Hence, in this article, we incorporate cardinality constraint into the unsupervised image hashing problem. The proposed model is divided into two steps: 1) estimating the cardinalities of hashing codes and 2) then estimating which bits are 1. Unlike multidimensional labels that are known and fixed in the training phase, the hashing codes are generally learned through an iterative method and, therefore, their cardinalities are unknown and not fixed during the learning procedure. We use a neural network as a cardinality predictor and its parameters are jointly learned with the hashing code generator, which is an autoencoder in our model.

Thereafter, by imposing reasonable restrictions on the transmission protocol and the occurrence of attacks, the boundedness of coding intervals can be obtained. Since the precision of data is generally limited, it may lead to the situation that the signal to be encoded overflows the coding interval such that it results in the unavailability of the developed coding scheme. To cope with this problem, a dynamic variable is introduced to the design of the protocol. Subsequently, based on the Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions for ensuring the input-to-state stability of the synchronization error systems under the communication-constrained condition and malicious attacks are presented.

  abstract     = {Constrained multiobjective optimization problems widely exist in real-world applications. To handle them, the balance between constraints and objectives is crucial, but remains challenging due to non-negligible impacts of problem types. In our context, the problem types refer particularly to those determined by the relationship between the constrained Pareto-optimal front (PF) and the unconstrained PF. Unfortunately, there has been little awareness on how to achieve this balance when faced with different types of problems. In this article, we propose a new constraint handling technique (CHT) by taking into account potential problem types. Specifically, inspired by the prior work, problems are classified into three primary types: 1) I; 2) II; and 3) III, with the constrained PF being made up of the entire, part and none of the unconstrained counterpart, respectively. Clearly, any problem must be one of the three types. For each possible type, there exists a tailored mechanism being used to handle the relationships between constraints and objectives (i.e., constraint priority, objective priority, or the switch between them). It is worth mentioning that exact problem types are not required because we just consider their possibilities in the new CHT. Conceptually, we show that the new CHT can make a tradeoff among different types of problems. This argument is confirmed by experimental studies performed on 38 benchmark problems, whose types are known, and a real-world problem (with unknown types) in search-based software engineering. Results demonstrate that within both decomposition-based and nondecomposition-based frameworks, the new CHT can indeed achieve a good tradeoff among different problem types, being better than several state-of-the-art CHTs.},

To alleviate the communication load and improve the reliability of signal transmission, a novel stochastic communication protocol (SCP) is proposed. In particular, the SCP is scheduled based on a nonhomogeneous Markov chain, where the time-varying transition probability matrix is characterized by a polytope-structure-based set. Different from the existing homogeneous Markov SCP, a nonhomogeneous Markov SCP depicts the data transmission in a more reasonable manner. To detect the actual network mode, a hidden Markov process observer is addressed. By virtue of the hidden Markov model with partly unidentified detection probabilities, an asynchronous OFC law is formulated. By establishing a novel Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional with a singular perturbation parameter and a nonhomogeneous Markov process, a sufficient condition is exploited to guarantee the stochastic stability of the resulting system, and the solution for the asynchronous controller is portrayed. Eventually, the validity of the attained methodology is expressed through a practical example.},

  abstract     = {Clinical evidence began to accumulate, suggesting that circRNAs can be novel therapeutic targets for various diseases and play a critical role in human health. However, limited by the complex mechanism of circRNA, it is difficult to quickly and large-scale explore the relationship between disease and circRNA in the wet-lab experiment. In this work, we design a new computational model MGRCDA on account of the metagraph recommendation theory to predict the potential circRNA–disease associations. Specifically, we first regard the circRNA–disease association prediction problem as the system recommendation problem, and design a series of metagraphs according to the heterogeneous biological networks; then extract the semantic information of the disease and the Gaussian interaction profile kernel (GIPK) similarity of circRNA and disease as network attributes; finally, the iterative search of the metagraph recommendation algorithm is used to calculate the scores of the circRNA–disease pair. On the gold standard dataset circR2Disease, MGRCDA achieved a prediction accuracy of 92.49\% with an area under the ROC curve of 0.9298, which is significantly higher than other state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, among the top 30 disease-related circRNAs recommended by the model, 25 have been verified by the latest published literature. The experimental results prove that MGRCDA is feasible and efficient, and it can recommend reliable candidates to further wet-lab experiment and reduce the scope of the experiment.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the group consensus problem is addressed for a network of multiagent systems (MASs). Unlike in existing literature, where a relative-state feedback-based distributed control input is used to achieve group consensus, this work aims at designing a relative-output-based distributed control law to achieve the same goal. To that effect, the Lyapunov stability theory is used to formulate the sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of such a feedback controller and then separate conditions have been included for its design. In addition to that, a new linear matrix inequality is explored to choose the intracluster coupling strengths to ensure group consensus. In this article, the relative-output-based control approach is investigated for both the leaderless and the leader-following frameworks of the group consensus problem, and the theoretical findings presented are validated using numerical examples and simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Almost all event-triggered control (ETC) strategies were designed for discrete-time or continuous-time systems. In order to unify these existing theoretical results of ETC and develop ETC strategies for nonlinear systems, whose state variables evolve steadily at one time and change intermittently at another time, this article investigates quasisynchronization of delayed neural networks (NNs) on time scales with discontinuous activation functions via ETC approaches. First, the existence of the Filippov solutions is proved for discontinuous NNs with finite discontinuities. Second, two static event-triggered conditions and two dynamic event-triggered conditions are established to avoid continuous communication between the master–slave systems under algebraic/matrix inequality criteria. Third, under static/dynamic event-triggered conditions, a positive lower bound of event-triggered intervals is demonstrated to be greater than a positive number for each event-based controller, which shows that the Zeno behavior will not occur. Finally, two numerical simulations are carried out to show the effectiveness of the presented theoretical results in this article.},

  abstract     = {Implantable devices represent the future of remote medical monitoring and administration of both chemical and physical therapies to the patients. Although some of these devices are already in the market, the security mechanisms deployed inside them to withstand deliberate external influence are still decades away from the robust digital data security schemes employed in modern distributed networks these days. Medical data theft, spoofing, and disclosure pose serious threats that can ultimately lead to individual and social stigmas or even death. In this article, we present a small-form and batteryless implantable device with acquisition channels for biopotential (30-dB gain and 16-Hz bandwidth), arterial pulse oximetry, and temperature (0.12°C accuracy) recordings, suitable for cardiovascular, neuronal, and endocrine parameters assessment. The proposed device is powered by the near-field communication (NFC) interface with an external mobile phone, with a power consumption of 0.9 mW and achieving the full operation for distances close to 1 cm under the skin. In situ encryption of the acquired physiological signals is performed by a lightweight and short-term symmetric-key distribution scheme with data stream hopping, in order to ensure secure data transference over the air between the patient and trusted entities only, complemented by data storage, processing, and recovery through a medical blockchain type of network that involves the main stakeholders inside a medical community.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a new constraint-handling technique (CHT), called shift-based penalty (ShiP), for solving constrained multiobjective optimization problems. In ShiP, infeasible solutions are first shifted according to the distributions of their neighboring feasible solutions. The degree of shift is adaptively controlled by the proportion of feasible solutions in the current parent and offspring populations. Then, the shifted infeasible solutions are penalized based on their constraint violations. This two-step process can encourage infeasible solutions to approach/enter the feasible region from diverse directions in the early stage of evolution, and guide diverse feasible solutions toward the Pareto optimal solutions in the later stage of evolution. Moreover, ShiP can achieve an adaptive transition from both diversity and feasibility in the early stage of evolution to both diversity and convergence in the later stage of evolution. ShiP is flexible and can be embedded into three well-known multiobjective optimization frameworks. Experiments on benchmark test problems demonstrate that ShiP is highly competitive with other representative CHTs. Further, based on ShiP, we propose an archive-assisted constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (CMOEA), called ShiP+, which outperforms two other state-of-the-art CMOEAs. Finally, ShiP is applied to the vehicle scheduling of the urban bus line successfully.},

  abstract     = {The problem of classifying gas–liquid two-phase flow regimes from ultrasonic signals is considered. A new method, belt-shaped features (BSFs), is proposed for performing feature extraction on the preprocessed data. A convolutional neural network (CNN/ConvNet)-based classifier is then applied to categorize into one of the four flow regimes: 1) annular; 2) churn; 3) slug; or 4) bubbly. The proposed ConvNet classifier includes multiple stages of convolution and pooling layers, which both decrease the dimension and learn the classification features. Using experimental data collected from an industrial-scale multiphase flow facility, the proposed ConvNet classifier achieved 97.40\%, 94.57\%, and 94.94\% accuracy, respectively, for the training set, testing set, and validation set. These results demonstrate the applicability of the BSF features and the ConvNet classifier for flow regime classification in industrial applications.},
