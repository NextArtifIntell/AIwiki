  abstract     = {Obtaining accurate solutions in an acceptable computation time for the problem of distribution systems reconfiguration is very important because the topology of real distribution systems needs to be changed several times a day in online applications. In this way, the processing time of reconfiguration models must be short enough for quick response to power demand changes and performing the next switching action. One of the most important parts of the reconfiguration problem that significantly affects the computation time is the radiality constraints, in which the best radial topology must be determined quickly without the appearance of loops or isolated buses in reconfigured networks. However, this issue does not happen easily because if the radiality constraints are not defined well, the reconfiguration algorithm finds wrong solutions (non-radial configurations) or acquires the optimal topologies after intensive computations (high CPU time). Therefore, the method of modeling the radiality constraints to find proper solutions in a short computational time is so important. To address this challenge, various formulations of radiality constraints are reviewed in the current study, and their efficiencies are compared in several distribution systems according to the results presented in specialized literature. The investigations done in this paper allow the researchers and operators to better understand the importance of formulating radiality constraints for reconfiguration problems. The results analysis indicates that the adoption of the radiality constraints (64)–(68) for analytical reconfiguration methods is more appropriate while considering the constraint (76) and the fundamental loops are more suitable for metaheuristic reconfiguration algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The digitization and decentralization of the electric power grid are key thrusts for an economically and environmentally sustainable future. Toward this goal, distributed energy resources (DER), including rooftop solar panels, battery storage, electric vehicles, etc., are becoming ubiquitous in power systems. Power utilities benefit from DERs as they minimize operational costs; at the same time, DERs grant users and aggregators control over the power they produce and consume. DERs are interconnected, interoperable, and support remotely controllable features; thus, their cybersecurity is of cardinal importance. DER communication dependencies and the diversity of DER architectures widen the threat surface and aggravate the cybersecurity posture of power systems. In this work, we focus on security oversights that reside in the cyber and physical layers of DERs and can jeopardize grid operations. The existing works have underlined the impact of cyberattacks targeting DER assets; however, they either focus on specific system components (e.g., communication protocols), do not consider the mission-critical objectives of DERs, or neglect the adversarial perspective (e.g., adversary/attack models) altogether. To address these omissions, we comprehensively analyze adversarial capabilities and objectives when manipulating DER assets, and then present how protocol and device-level vulnerabilities can materialize into cyberattacks impacting power system operations. Finally, we provide mitigation strategies to thwart adversaries and directions for future DER cybersecurity research.},

  abstract     = {Insufficient recognition precision and high complexity are two main challenges of human activity recognition using WiFi channel state information (CSI), which has attracted more attention due to its low cost and easy realization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework based on Gramian angular fields (GAFs). This framework includes two transformation methods, Gramian angular sum field (GASF) and Gramian angular difference field (GADF), which effectively extract information from CSI and convert it into a CSI-GAF image. Subsequently, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to analyze these images and obtain activity information. By incorporating a transformation module that preserves and expands the original CSI information, the proposed framework utilizes the powerful feature extraction capabilities of the CNN in image processing. Test results on public CSI datasets (Wiar, SAR, and Widar3.0) demonstrate that the recognition accuracy based on the GADF outperforms that of GASF, reaching 99.4\% and 99.0\%, respectively, when the CNN has only four convolutional layers. Moreover, the proposed framework exhibits low complexity, which outperforms three classical models (ResNet, VGG19, and ShufflenetV2) in terms of both parameters and required floating-point computations.},

Unlike existing studies where the exosystem matrix is known to all followers, in this approach, only some followers have access to the exosystem matrix. Adaptive event-triggered observers are proposed to estimate the exosystem matrices and states, ensuring resilience to communication link faults. Besides, to overcome the difficulty in the controller design caused by the lack of higher order derivatives of the exosystem state estimates, a novel dynamic surface control (DSC) technique is introduced. In contrast to existing linear DSC techniques, where the presence of boundary layer errors prevents the system from being asymptotically stable, nonlinear compensation terms are employed in the introduced DSC to eliminate the effects of boundary layer errors, thereby ensuring the system&#39;s asymptotic stability. Then, based on the distributed observers and improved DSC techniques, a reliable control scheme is established, which realizes the COR of the considered MASs. Moreover, the proposed event-triggered mechanisms guarantee that the minimum event-triggered intervals are larger than positive constants. No Zeno behavior occurs. Finally, a practical example verifies the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {For the implementation of distributed storage frameworks in the context of mobile crowd sensing (MCS), compressed sensing (CS) theory provides significant support, mainly because of the essential characteristic that CS theory will contain global information when encoding any measurements. Therefore, with limited measurement resources, the rational allocation of measurement resources becomes the most critical factor affecting recovery accuracy when using CS to recover the data. Unfortunately, the latest distributed storage frameworks do not take into account the importance of measurement resource allocation, which directly leads to a significant loss of data recovery accuracy. Therefore, to address this issue, this article proposes a volatility-based allocation strategy for the measurement resource. First, we process the target monitoring region in blocks. Next, we calculate the magnitude of fluctuations between adjacent reconstructed data by volatility, which is used to assess the importance of the different areas. Finally, a volatility-based measurement allocation scheme is proposed by fully considering the importance of different areas. It is important to note that the introduction of the concept of “volatility” in the context of MCS makes it feasible to correctly differentiate the importance of individual parts of the target monitoring region without any prior knowledge by employing extremely fuzzy recovery data. In addition, extensive experiments show that our measurement allocation scheme improves data recovery accuracy by 44\% for uneven data distribution scenarios and 25\% for even data distribution scenarios, compared with the random measurement allocation used in the state-of-the-art MCS distributed storage framework.},

In this environment, community-based markets (CBMs) and peer-to-peer (P2P) trading are two innovative designs developed for LEMs. However, each has significant drawbacks, such as slow rate convergence and unpredictable system behavior for P2P architecture, as well as obtaining and optimizing large-scale data in CBM. This research proposes a novel architecture for LEM based on cooperative energy trading and a reserve market, which can overcome the shortcomings of existing designs. Two-stage modeling is proposed, and the consensus alternate direction method of multipliers is utilized to clear the market in a decentralized manner to demonstrate the players&#39; preferences, preserve privacy, and distribute the computation burden. Moreover, the model analyzes Tokyo&#39;s Japan Electric Power Exchange market. To highlight its benefits, the proposed structure is compared to other structures. According to the findings, CBM and P2P transaction volumes are 12.78\% and 71.9\% less than the proposed architecture, respectively. The proposed design&#39;s imports and exports are 35.1\% and 38.2\% lower than CBMs, and overall imports and exports are 77.88\% and 74.24\% less than P2P.},

The proposed protocol is designed to overcome these challenges by using lattice-based cryptography, edge computing, and blockchain technology. Edge computing is used to reduce computation overhead on IoT devices, and blockchain is used to maintain public keys to simplify key revocation and interdomain authentication. We have analyzed thoroughly the security of the proposed protocol using both the informal and formal security methods. The proposed protocol is resilient to several known classical attacks, such as the ephemeral secret leakage attack and public-key quantum attack. We have also conducted a thorough performance analysis and compared it to several existing approaches. The results show that the proposed protocol decreases the device-side computation overhead by approximately 58\% as compared to other approaches. In addition, the proposed protocol shows approximately 2\% decrease in the communication overhead compared to just post-quantum protocols.},

However, GPS signals in complex environments, such as tunnels and forests, often experience signal degradation or loss, reducing vehicle positioning accuracy. Furthermore, the effectiveness of multisensor fusion strategies based on filtering declines sharply in the presence of non-Gaussian noise. This article proposes a multisensor fusion positioning method that combines visual/INS and INS/GNSS technologies to overcome these challenges. The GPS/inertial measurement unit (IMU)/visual sensor data are preprocessed using the adaptive maximum correntropy criterion extended Kalman filter to obtain a fusion result as a benchmark. Specific data are then extracted from the output position and posture of the GPS/IMU and visual/IMU and fused twice using the Bernoulli formula to obtain the vehicle&#39;s position and posture information. We use classic navigation data from Canada and Katwijk to validate our method. When encountering both non-Gaussian noise and GPS signal anomalies, our method significantly reduces longitude and latitude errors by 22\% and 40\%, respectively, compared to the GPS/IMU/visual method, enabling precise positioning in urban environments.},

  abstract     = {Generally, the normal displacement-based formation control of multiagent systems has a sensing mode that requires the agent not only to have certain knowledge of its direction, but also to gather its local information characterized by nonnegative coupling coefficients. However, the direction may be unknown, and the coupling coefficients may also involve negative ones. In this article, these phenomena are introduced into a class of displacement-based formation control for multiagent system, which have nonconvexity that inevitably leads to difficulties of analysis. Then, a geometric approach has been employed to overcome the difficulties. The purpose of this approach is to construct some convex polytopes for containing the effects caused by the above-mentioned phenomena, and maintain the invariance of these polytopes in view of the contractive set method. It further means that the convergence of formation shape can be guaranteed. The considered formation control problem can admit the unknown direction and negative coupling coefficients in a certain range, which are a major improvement compared to the normal displacement-based formation control. Subsequently, the applicability of this formation control problem is examined through a simulation. This simulation indicates that the direction of agents and the negative coupling coefficients do not affect the convergency of the formation shape.},

  abstract     = {Design of protection schemes in multiple interlinked microgrids is a difficult task, owing to changes in operating topology of the system. A microgrid can function in island mode, or can operate in conjunction with another autonomous microgrid, or get connected to another grid interfaced microgrid or operate directly with the main grid. Such changes in operating philosophy can vary the short circuit currents widely depending on the status of point of common coupling (PCC) in a system of multi-microgrids environments. A non-standard tripping characteristic (NSTC) of directional overcurrent relays (DOCRs) with four controllable parameters viz. TMS, PS, Beta, and Alpha is proposed for networked microgrids (NMG), which reduces the relay operating time and improves coordination among the relay pairs. The relay settings are optimally found using a new hybrid combination of wild horse optimizer and nonlinear programming (WHO-NLP) approach. All the possible operating modes of network microgrids are identified and a unique relay setting are designed. The proposed protection coordination scheme (PPCS) is validated on two 15-bus microgrid, forming as network microgrid, and on real time digital simulator (RTDS) platform using NSTC feature of DOCRs, in a software in loop (SIL) environment. Extensive test cases are validated, considering operational and topological changes of NMG for several grid connected and islanded events, variations in DG power output, DG outage contingencies, performances under high resistance fault, and bolted faults conditions due to various fault types to ensure the robustness of the proposed method in providing secure and reliable protection of NMG.},

For this purpose, this article addresses a robust coordinated target encircling control problem of networked quadrotors without the reliance on target speed and acceleration information. Two event-triggered extended state observers (ETESOs) are, respectively, constructed to allow for accurate observations toward unknown relative kinematics and lumped disturbances imposed on the rotational loop, wherein a simple event-triggered criterion is integrated to specify the sampling intervals to reduce the transmission expenditure. By resorting to the estimated items, a cooperative encirclement guidance protocol capable of achieving relative distance keeping and phase regulation is devised based on a directed graph, such that all quadrotors can cooperatively evolve along a circular orbit with a desired angular spacing, and a robust attitude controller including a compensation item of ETESO is designed to assure a precise tracking. Finally, all error variables are proved to be bounded, while the efficacy of presented algorithms is certified by simulations and experiments.},

The optimal control inputs for minimizing performance indicators are normally obtained by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. Nonetheless, the nonlinear MASs have nonlinear and coupling properties such that the analytical solution is hard to obtain by solving HJB equation. To address this difficulty, the neural networks are adopted to identify the unknown nonlinear dynamics, and an identifier is constructed to ensure the identification state errors converge asymptotically. Moreover, reinforcement learning with a critic–actor structure is employed to approximate the optimal performance indicators and optimal control inputs. Then, the practical optimal FCT control algorithm is presented to design the protocol parameters.

  abstract     = {The demand for indoor localization is increasing with ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) emergence. Location awareness is crucial to intelligent systems in large-scale indoor environments, such as smart airports, train stations, hospitals, malls, and smart cities. Hence, indoor localization has been researched for the last decades. However, most site survey based WiFi fingerprint based indoor localization methods involve independent or one by one online localization methods, that are costly, and inefficient regarding computation time, memory, and energy consumption to implement in large-scale indoor environments. We propose an Online Batch Localization (OBLoc) for large-scale indoor environments scheme to address these challenges. The basic idea of OBLoc is that the indoor localization users close to each other have similar WiFi fingerprinting and can be clustered to form batches. Every batch&#39;s search space could be reduced using a batch representative. We propose a search space-slicing algorithm that slices part of the large-scale database using the appointed representative to minimize searching overhead. Furthermore, we designed a neighborhood consistency algorithm to identify erroneous location annotations in the sliced search space. We conduct experiments on three field-measured datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The experiment results show the improvement over the peer schemes of 21.34\%, 17.38\%, and 27.24\% localization accuracy in the three datasets.},

  abstract     = {Network-assisted full-duplex (NAFD) cell-free (CF) networks use half-duplex access points (APs) to enable the network-level in-band full-duplex. By dynamically allocating each AP to perform either uplink reception or downlink transmission at each time slot, the AP duplex mode optimization algorithm (ADMOA) plays a crucial role in improving the performance of the NAFD CF systems. However, most existing ADMOAs focus on maximizing spectral efficiency (SE) and overlook the issue of decreasing system resource utilization in massive Internet-of-Things (mIoT) scenarios. Aiming at making better use of system resources in the NAFD CF networks with time-varying active user equipment (UE), this article proposes a “preallocation—optimization” mechanism. First, in the preallocation part, we establish an index that directly reflects the service satisfaction of the active UEs and propose a network load prediction algorithm, which can accurately predict the network load and preallocate enough resource blocks. Then, in the optimization part, the multiobjective optimization problem for getting the tradeoff between the sum of SE and resource utilization is established. We design a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based-ADMOA, which determines a clever policy to solve it in a dynamic environment. In addition, we further design a hierarchical reinforcement learning-based-ADMOA by decomposing the policy into two level, which successfully simplifies the network structure and addresses the sparse reward problem in DRL. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed schemes achieve the performance similar to that of the exhaustion method with very low complexity, and are more suitable for dynamic mIoT scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a coordination-based power management strategy based on the concept of consensus algorithm and consensus index for hybrid ac/dc microgrid is proposed for achieving three objectives: 1) accurate and precise active/reactive power sharing between all ac distributed generations (DGs) in the ac subgrid, ac voltage regulation, and ac frequency restoration; 2) accurate and precise power/current sharing between all dc DGs in dc subgrid and dc voltage regulation; 3) accurate power sharing among all the participating ac/dc DGs in the hybrid ac/dc microgrid. The distributed secondary control within the ac/dc subgrids generates the consensus index, and the power management inside the two subgrids is achieved via the distributed control and the consensus index. Moreover, the bidirectional interlinking converter (BIC) control effectively operates with solely two consensus indexes, one from each ac/dc subgrid. Using these two consensus indexes, BIC establishes a dynamic interconnection between all participating DGs within the respective ac/dc subgrids, facilitating seamless power management among them. Compared to the existing strategies, the proposed strategy achieves accurate and proportional power sharing between all the participating ac and dc DGs in the system, rather than only achieving accurate and proportionate power sharing inside the two subgrids. Finally, the proposed power management strategy can considerably reduce communication data, complexity, and bandwidth.},

However, two problems remain to be solved. First, most schemes allowing aggregate signature are vulnerable to forgery attacks. Second, the revocation solutions may not prevent damage from the signed message of an invalid user. In this article, secure aggregation techniques and an efficient revocation tool are proposed for elliptic curve-based certificateless signature scheme. By using secure aggregate authentication, two more types of aggregation attacks are considered. Complete revocation and synchronization of revocation list are presented as two new indicators of efficient revocation. In terms of both, our scheme achieves satisfactory results by pruning the modular exponentiation of the RSA accumulator. Besides, this scheme not only ensures data integrity, user anonymity, and traceability of malicious users in authentication. By comparison with other schemes, our scheme not only outperforms others in terms of efficiency but also can withstand more attacks in terms of security},

Moreover, we propose a gradient-based distributed protocol to guarantee that the states of all agents remain in their respective constraint sets. The analysis tool developed in this article is based on matrix analysis and Lyapunov stability theory. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

  abstract     = {This article studies an adaptive formation tracking problem with trajectory protection. The adaptive formation tracking problem for each sampling tracking point is transformed into a distributed constrained optimization problem. A distributed-optimization-based strategy is proposed to search for the optimal formation configuration. Considering the trajectory protection, some auxiliary variables are transmitted directly in the communication process of the multiagent system rather than the sensitive information, i.e., the sampling tracking point. Interestingly, before the achievement of the optimal formation configuration, the information of the sampling tracking point will not be disclosed, even though the eavesdropper is omnipotent, and meanwhile, the accuracy of tracking is not influenced. Then, a sampling-optimization-based adaptive formation tracking with trajectory protection (SOAFT-TP) algorithm is proposed to achieve adaptive formation tracking in the obstacle-existence environment with trajectory protection. It modifies the formation configuration adaptively to respond to the real-time environment by updating the constraint parameters online. Finally, the theoretical results of the SOAFT-TP algorithm are verified by a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology is considered one of the leading technologies for sixth-generation wireless communication, and it has also been revealed to be effective in enhancing secure and reliable communications. This article investigates using RIS to improve physical layer security and data transmission in underlay cognitive radio networks (CRNs). Because of its capability to control the wireless environment, RIS can enhance the security of the primary network (PN) and increase the reliability of the secondary network (SN) data transmission. This approach is practical and beneficial for both the PN and SN in terms of reliability and security. The study focuses on a scenario where the eavesdropper is passive and uses either selection or maximal ratio combining to combine the signals from the PN. Analytical expressions for the secrecy outage probability and the probability of nonzero secrecy capacity of the PN are derived. Additionally, an expression for the SN outage probability is also provided. The results from simulations and the numerical analysis confirm the benefits of the proposed system model and validate the accuracy of the derived expressions. This work provides valuable insights into the integration of RIS with CRNs and highlights the potential role of RIS in the future of wireless communication systems.},

  abstract     = {Smart grid (SG) achieves more convenient and efficient power transmission through the rapid development of the information and communication technology. In addition to the transmission of electrical energy, the SG system also involves privacy and control information of service providers, which is closely related to people&#39;s livelihood. However, at present, the data in the SG system are transmitted in the form of plaintext, which does not have complete protection measures for entity privacy and communication data security. Focusing on preserving entity privacy and data security, this article proposes an anonymous secure authentication protocol (ASAP-SG) for the SG environment. Based on elliptic curve cryptography and physical unclonable function, ASAP-SG can realize authentication and key agreement between smart meters and service providers. The security of ASAP-SG has been verified with proverif tool and proven strictly under the real-or-random model. Furthermore, heuristic analysis manifests that ASAP-SG can successfully resist known security attacks. Finally, a fully comparison with the other five most advanced schemes reveals that ASAP-SG consumes the optimal computation cost on both smart meters and service providers and reduces the communication overhead by 33.3\%–45.8\%, on the basis of satisfying ten security objectives. These features make ASAP-SG more suitable for resource-constrained SG environment.},

However, privacy concerns come into being along with the online taxi-hailing service. Most of the existing privacy-preserving online taxi-hailing systems rely on a central third party to manage the whole system. This construction has three drawbacks. First, the online taxi-hailing platforms and the drivers can view the passenger&#39;s entire ride trajectory freely. Second, the platforms tend to prioritize matching orders with longer distances. Third, the platforms are vulnerable to a single point of failure attack. This article proposes a privacy-preserving ride-matching scheme without a trusted third-party server. In this article, we construct an efficient driver-passenger matching algorithm by using the public key encryption with equality test and blockchain with smart contracts, which efficiently match the ride request and ride offer in the encrypted form.

  abstract     = {A livestock sensor network (LSN) is widely used for livestock monitoring, which can improve the intelligence level of livestock farming. Facing the mobility of sensor nodes in LSNs, better clustering schemes and routing are considered as a solution to provide high quality of service for the system. However, finding routing and clustering schemes is proved to be an NP-hard problem in the study. Therefore, a groundbreaking approach has been introduced, known as Chaos Adaptive Sparrow Swarm Optimization Algorithm and Multiobjective Elite Ant Colony Search (CASSA-MEACS). It effectively addresses the routing and clustering challenges associated with the LSN. The innovative methodology of CASSA-MEACS intelligently reduces the energy consumption of sensor nodes, leading to a substantial extension of the system&#39;s lifespan. Moreover, it enhances the data transmission capacity and greatly reduces data packet loss in the LSN. In the scenario of simulation experiments of the LSN, CASSA-MEACS is compared with the current state-of-the-art well-known solutions, namely energy-efficient hybrid clustering and hierarchical routing (EEHCHR), seagull-optimization-algorithm-based energy-aware cluster routing protocol, and PSOLB-EGT. Among them, the CASSA-MEACS proposed in this article outperforms the above three state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of system lifetime by 30\%, 22\%, and 14\%, respectively. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that, when compared to the existing algorithms, CASSA-MEACS achieves remarkable reductions in system energy consumption, significant extensions in system lifespan, improved throughput, and lower packet loss rates.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty in renewable energy generation and energy demand reduces generation flexibility, which should be compensated by increasing flexibility on the supply grid and demand sides. Dynamic line rating (DLR) forecasting, in which the maximum current carrying capacity of overhead transmission lines is accurately forecasted, is important to enable secure grid-side flexibility. This article introduces a novel model for DLR forecasting using a federated learning (FL) approach. By generating a global model, the FL can accurately forecast the DLR values without the need for data from regions that are not available. In addition, data security protection and data protection from various types of cyberattacks are prominent features of the FL technique. In this article, the proposed federated network is trained based on data from nine different regions of Iran that have different geographical and meteorological features. The process of training and recognizing patterns in each local client from FL is based on convolutional neural networks using deep learning techniques. Based on the features extracted from each client, the federated network generates a supermodel that is able to forecast the DLR values for new and unknown regions. Generating the supermodel is performed using geographical and meteorological data from three new regions, namely Boroujen, Nahavand, and Rafsanjan, which had no effect on the construction of the supermodel. The results of the forecasts are analyzed using various performance evaluation metrics. The evaluations show that the generated global supermodel is able to forecast DLR values for the regions of Boroujen, Nahavand, and Rafsanjan, with correlation coefficients of 96\%, 94\%, and 97\%, respectively.},

The protocol is designed by adopting a power integrator technique and the super-twisting algorithm with saturation constraint. Despite the presence of disturbances, the proposed protocol enables the states of all agents to track the states of the leader and the tracking errors converge to zero in finite time. Besides, the input signal is bounded and its upper bound can be calculated. Some sufficient conditions on realizing the consensus of multiagent systems in finite time are deduced by employing the inductive analysis and the Lyapunov-based technology.

The efficient use of the flexibility of demand-side energy sources as well as the elasticity of energy demands increases the tendency for the development of IDR. This article proposes a bilevel optimization framework that allows a large multi-energy consumer (LMEC) equipped with self-provided energy resources to manipulate electricity market prices using optimum execution of the IDR to fulfill electricity, heating, and cooling needs, simultaneously. At the upper level, the LMEC operator seeks to minimize energy procurement costs associated with electricity, heating, and cooling, whereas at the lower level, the aim is to maximize social welfare from the market operator&#39;s perspective in order to establish the market-clearing price. The Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions and strong duality theory are utilized to convert the model into a single-level mixed-integer linear programming framework. In addition, a developed information gap decision theory technique is adopted to cope with the uncertainty of power generation from wind turbines owned by the LMEC operator under a risk-averse scheme. The numerical findings demonstrate the potential of IDR in influencing power market prices to the benefit of LMEC and lowering its energy procurement costs.},

Trust is widely regarded as one of the top obstacles to the adoption and growth of DCS. Nonetheless, the existing works did not take the storage resource capacity of cloud service providers (CSPs) into the reputation evaluation, and most rely on a centralized reputation management framework. We bridge this gap by proposing a blockchain-assisted reputation mechanism for DCS. First, a blockchain-assisted DCS model is proposed to ensure the traceability and tamper proof of reputation-related data. Second, we propose a service credibility quantification method based on rating screening to mitigate the impact of outliers. Third, we design a stochastic process to characterize the storage resource change to quantify CSPs survival probability. Finally, we derive a reputation calculation algorithm based on the above two metrics that protects the authenticity of CSPs&#39; reputations in the presence of attacks. The security analysis and simulation results show that the proposed mechanism is reliable and effective in promoting the service success rate and improving the efficiency and security of the service of DCS.},

These techniques become even more critical when incorporating nonorthogonal multiple access to enhance spectral efficiency and user fairness. Prior research in this area has primarily focused on channel correlation for user pairing. This article presents a novel approach for user pairing and subband allocation in a crowded downlink system that utilizes a criterion based on minimizing the condition number (CN) of channel matrices. A benchmark resource allocation technique, which is based on a rate maximization criterion and has a higher complexity but quasi-optimal performance, is also introduced. To evaluate the performance of the proposed technique in a realistic setting, experimental massive MIMO channel measurements in a dense user deployment scenario are used. Results indicate that the CN criterion leads to significantly higher throughput and fairness levels compared with the channel correlation criterion and achieves performance that is close to that obtained with rate maximization. The study is further extended to the case of multiantenna reception, where interference cancellation techniques are proposed to increase the throughput of users with low channel gains. The proposed methods outperform a well-referenced technique in the literature.},

Since every agent contains the multiple state variables having differential relation, sliding-mode control (SMC) mechanism is employed for reaching the high-order consensus. Then, reinforcement learning (RL) under identifier–critic–actor architecture is performed for optimizing this consensus control. As a result, RL strategy and SMC mechanism are combined to achieve the optimized high-order consensus control. Compared with the traditional optimal control, on the one hand, the actor and critic RL updating laws are significantly simple and can also make the sufficient training for the adaptive parameters so that the condition of persistence excitation is released; on the other hand, the optimized consensus scheme does not require the complete dynamic acknowledge because the adaptive identifier strategy is integrated into the RL design for compensating the unknown dynamic. As a consequence, this proposed optimized control can smoothly steer the high-order MAS to achieve the consensus of multiple system states. Eventually, both theory and simulation certify feasibility of this control method.},

  abstract     = {The power sector is a major source of carbon emissions. To realize emission reduction, distributed energy resources (DERs), such as rooftop photovoltaics (PVs), are developing rapidly. To accommodate numerous emerging DERs, local energy systems (LES) and peer-to-peer (P2P) trading have aroused more and more attention. In this article, a P2P energy trading model is proposed to enable LESs to accommodate numerous emerging DERs and to reduce carbon emissions from the power sector by considering the emission obligation on the demand side. In the proposed distributed transaction framework, it is pointed out that demands are the underlying driver of carbon emissions. Therefore, a double taxation mechanism is considered. Free quotas are allocated to the prosumers on the demand side. If the indirect emission of the consumer exceeds the allocated free quotas, it has to purchase additional carbon emission rights (CERs) in a local integrated carbon and electricity market. First, an energy dispatch model in the distribution system is proposed to solve the power flow. Second, based on the power flow, the carbon emission flow model is utilized to track the emission from the generation side to the demand side. Third, CER trading is then integrated into the P2P trading model to encourage local transactions between prosumers. The formulated problem is solved through a distributed optimization algorithm to enhance the computation efficiency and protect the private information of prosumers. The proposed framework and methodology are verified in case studies.},

In this article, a transmit/passive beamforming strategy for multi-IRS assisted cell-free multi-input–multi-output network is proposed to maximize the weighted sum-rate (WSR). Specifically, for passive beamforming of IRS, an elementwise block coordinate descent framework is applied to efficiently solve the unit-modulus constraints and reduce computation complexity greatly. Note that, every variable in our proposed algorithm can be updated with closed-form solutions and our algorithm can be applied with distributed implementation. Both analytical and simulation results demonstrate that, while guaranteeing superiority in WSR performance and information interaction cost, the proposed scheme outperforms the benchmark algorithms with closed-form solutions significantly in terms of complexity cost.},

  abstract     = {Distance relay based pilot protection schemes are commonly employed in industrial relays to provide fast tripping of the faulty transmission lines. However, the probable communication link failure or interruption can make these schemes ineffective. Therefore, some non-pilot methods are addressed in the technical literature which cannot offer an appropriate performance in the presence of inverter-based resources (IBRs) owing to the unconventional fault behavior of IBRs as compared with that of synchronous generators. Thus, an analytical non-pilot method is established for the accelerated tripping (AT) of the second zone of distance relay in the presence of IBRs. At the first place with the proposed method, the faulted phase is identified through a fault classification scheme. Within the second phase, using the strength of the variations existing in the negative and zero sequence components of both voltage and current signals, the remote breaker status is realized. Finally, according to the remote breaker status, the AT or delayed tripping decision is decided. Performance of the established methodology is examined for different simulation scenarios, such as different fault locations as well as fault resistances, employing the PSCAD/EMTDC software. The obtained promising results obviously approve the efficiency of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Distributed transmit beamforming (DTB) enhances the transmit diversity and energy efficiency in wireless sensor networks. To implement DTB, one key issue is that the fusion center should feed back each sensor the estimated channel phase information (CPI), based on which each sensor can accordingly preprocess the transmit signal phase to coordinate in transmitting a common message to the fusion center. Because of feedback overhead and link rate constraint, codebook-based quantization methods are usually exploited to provide such CPI. However, how to effectively construct the optimal codebook over the general Rician fading channel model is not well understood in the current literature, not to mention its related performance analysis. Motivated by this research gap, in this article, 1) we first develop a low-complexity iterative algorithm to construct the optimal codebook; 2) we then reveal that in the designed codebook, the codewords are not uniformly distributed. More specifically, as the absolute value of the codeword increases, the distance between adjacent codewords increases gradually; 3) based on 1) and 2), we further derive the exact probability density function (PDF) of the residual phase error resulting from feedback quantization; 4) finally, we exploit this PDF and also the Laguerre series approximation to characterize, in closed form, the very tight approximation for the receiving signal-to-noise ratio distribution at the fusion center, which is then exploited for performance analysis of outage probability, diversity order, and ergodic capacity. Numerical results show that our designed codebook can achieve higher performance gains compared with the widely used equidistance phase-shift-keying-based codebook.},

Traditionally, the deployment of relays is based on 2-D planar information, rather than 3-D spatial information of the real environment, so the relays cannot be effectively used to achieve the best system performance. Fortunately, with the rapid development of the geographic information system (GIS), the 3-D spatial information of the real environment can be integrated to assist in the network planning of relays, so as to obtain the best performance of the network. In this article, we propose a GIS-assisted 3-D decision mode to suggest the suitable relay network planning for an actual multicell mobile communication network. The proposed method can use the 3-D spatial information of the real environment, and combine with the genetic algorithm to obtain the optimal deployment positions of relays, so as to achieve the maximum spectrum efficiency and system coverage. The simulation results show that the GIS-assisted 3-D decision mode can, respectively, achieve 23.8\% more average spectrum efficiency and 5.4\% more average coverage than the traditional 2-D decision mode when three relays are deployed in the network.},

Open-pit mine is a typical unstructured road environment with dynamic and varying terrain, posing huge challenges to the environmental mapping. This study proposes an HD map construction and update system for autonomous driving in open-pit mines. First, we analyze the map elements of autonomous driving and the environmental characteristics of open-pit mines. According to the types, uses, and update frequency of map elements, we establish a multimodal and multilevel map structure to realize the all-round unified map description. Second, in order to construct and update various map elements in the map structure, we propose a map construction method by the fusion of localization and perception and a multiscene map update method by analyzing the updated scenes of open-pit mines. Then, based on the proposed map structure and method, we integrate the software and hardware of the map platform to design an HD map construction and update system for open-pit mines. Finally, tests are performed on the unstructured road scenes to verify the performance of the proposed scheme by comparing the traditional road network map and the point cloud map. Field tests demonstrate that in the same site, compared with the point cloud map, the proposed method reduces the map data storage space by 98\% and achieves the accuracy and real-time performance of map update with a lower delay within the error range of 0.15 m.},

The proposed method can identify both intra- and interarea transmission lines. Using the proposed method, linearization of the system&#39;s equations is performed to estimate the behavior of SGOs after a line outage. Using the developed state-space-based technique, critical lines are determined without requiring to solve the differential equations of the system and to perform time domain simulation studies. To do this, a novel dynamic index is introduced which is strongly correlated with both generator&#39;s oscillations overshoot and settling time indices. The proposed method can determine both critical intra- and interarea lines for each generator and area, respectively.

Image data are used as input to the PCNN, and after feature extraction, the presence or absence of FDIA in the grid is determined from the output of the PCNN. A small power system is simulated, and a 1-D CNN model, a 2-D CNN model, and the proposed 2-D PCNN are applied for FDIA detection.

Moreover, an adaptive sliding mode controller is constructed to assure the stability of such dc microgrid systems. First, the dynamical equations of dc microgrid systems are proposed, which consider Lévy noises and Markovian jumping parameters. Meanwhile, the impact of FDI attacks is taken into account in dc microgrid systems. Next, the sliding mode motion dynamic of dc microgrid systems can be attained by designing a sliding mode surface (SMS) in the form of integral. Several sufficient conditions are proposed to guarantee the asymptotic stability for dc microgrid systems. Then, a novel sliding mode control (SMC) law is put forward to drive systems to reach and maintain a given sliding mode surface. In addition, the solution of linear matrix inequalities can determine undetermined parameters in the SMC and SMS. Ultimately, a practical example is demonstrated to prove that the proposed adaptive sliding mode controller can ensure the stability of the dc microgrid system under FDI attacks.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at the high-performance requirements of Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios, a cognitive radio-inspired nonorthogonal multiple access (CR-NOMA) scheme in short packet communication is investigated. Primary and secondary users share the same nonorthogonal communication resource block to achieve high spectral efficiency. A priority selection combination method is designed and employed by the primary user considering the nonnegligible decoding error rate in short packet communication. We focus on the transmission performance of the secondary users while ensuring the reliable communication of the primary user as a priority. To characterize the performance of the CR-NOMA network, approximate closed-form expressions of the average block error rate (BLER) for primary and secondary users are derived and analyzed. The results show that the communication reliability and throughput of the primary user with the CR-NOMA scheme are enhanced compared with the no-CR scheme. Meanwhile, the secondary users can also achieve reliable communication on the premise of improving the performance of the primary user through spectrum sharing. A performance tradeoff between primary and secondary users can be achieved through power allocation. Furthermore, there is a tradeoff between BLER and throughput, and the maximum throughput can be achieved by choosing an optimal blocklength.},

  abstract     = {In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), the vehicle constantly collects traffic condition messages and uploads them to the traffic management department (TMD) for traffic analysis. Traffic condition messages usually consist of vehicle-related information as well as safety-related messages. Vehicle-related information usually contains vehicles&#39; privacy, which cannot be broadcasted. At the same time, the safety-related message does not contain the privacy of vehicles and can be broadcasted in VANETs to ease traffic congestion. However, transmitting two types of messages separately consumes numerous computation and communication costs, which is not realistic for resource-limited vehicles. In this article, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving traffic condition monitoring (L-TCM) scheme, where the sanitizable signature is used to enable the vehicle to broadcast safety-related messages and upload traffic condition messages by sending one message. In addition, searchable encryption is used to help the TMD retrieve traffic condition messages stored in the cloud server. Security analysis demonstrates that L-TCM satisfies security goals in VANETs. Besides, the performance of L-TCM concerning computation and communication costs makes it appropriate for traffic condition monitoring.},

Different from the existing work with multiuser noncompletely overlapping NOMA that adopted the delay-based successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding order, we adopt the channel gain-based SIC decoding order, which is widely used and has been proved to be more energy-efficient. We formulate the problem as a joint transmit power, transmission time, and computing resource optimization problem with multiple deeply coupled variables. To ensure the real-time decision-making, the considered problem is characterized as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) problem by introducing penalty mechanism into the immediate reward function when the constraints are violated, and we propose a soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm to solve it. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the system&#39;s performance, and, compared with the noncompletely overlapping NOMA mechanism with delay-based SIC decoding order, the completely overlapping NOMA mechanism and time division multiple access (TDMA) mechanism, the noncompletely overlapping NOMA mechanism with channel gain-based SIC decoding order can achieve an average energy consumption reduction of 32.4\%, 49.9\%, and 74.4\%, respectively.},

The EMR data are verified by the creating group to form a transaction in Healthchain, and the transaction data are verified by the system-maintaining nodes group to achieve network consensus. Then, a lattice-based group signature scheme (GSS) is proposed to strengthen the quantum security of the EMR group verification model. This scheme can provide secure verification for the EMR validation and support group members with free joining and revoking. Moreover, correctness analyses explain that this scheme is correct; security proofs prove that it satisfies anonymity, traceability, and nonframeability; the performance analyses show that the proposed model and the GSS scheme are at least 35\% time consumption saving, with low key generation time costs and verification complexity than similar work.},

Finally, the validity of the proposed method is verified through a DCN case study. The results indicate that the CSoS reconstructed according to the optimal policy function restores an average of 20.2\% of the lost operational capability under four attack scenarios.

The hyperparameters (time series, time lag, dropout rate, and learning rate) and the structure parameter of the residual LSTM are tuned by PSO. To improve the accuracy of the proposed model, a quantum embedding layer is added to the optimized residual-LSTM neural network.

A key step is to develop an updating method for the neural network (NN) weights of ADP in response to the triggered events and experienced attacks. The consideration of lowering computational cost and mitigating attack influences is integrated into the design of the system switching law for which a cost function is utilized to reduce unnecessary switching. In fact, the optimal control policy and optimal switching policy can be obtained as the outcome of the converging ADP iterative process. Furthermore, the uniformly ultimately boundedness of system state and NN weights is proven; more importantly, we illustrate in the dynamical processes, how the event-triggering, system switching, and DoS attacks affect one another.

Aiming to navigate the challenge of minimizing information exchange for weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization, which inherently places substantial demands on signaling overheads, we begin by reformulating the original problem as a BS-specific format. Inspired by such a rewritten form, we propose a virtual WSR as the objective function to derive an approximation of this reformulated problem. For a specific BS, the calculation of this virtual WSR is solely contingent upon the precoders within its own cell and low-dimensional virtual covariance matrices as initial values. Through an iterative approach facilitated by the minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm, we attain a stationary point for the maximization of nonconcave virtual WSR. With the locally generated virtual covariance matrices exchanged as initial values, the precoding matrix within each cell can be optimized independently and concurrently. This method eliminates the need for additional external exchanges throughout the iterative process. The simulation indicates the efficacy of our proposed approach in achieving a favorable WSR.},

Meanwhile, these distributed resources are also available to some local energy transactions based on internal pricing mechanism in energy communities. However, the local energy trading of distributed resources requires considerable computational capacity and professional knowledge for end-users, which makes it difficult to guarantee the trading willingness. Therefore, this article proposes an intelligent home energy management strategy for residential customers based on deep reinforcement learning techniques with consideration of internal pricing mechanism. Technically, the end-user sequential decision-making process in energy management and trading can be modeled as a Markov decision process using encapsulated resource physical status information and pricing preference information. In particular, this article considers the interactive relationship between different customers or decision-makers, capturing features of group intelligent decision that evolves as energy status change and internal price signal change. The simulation and demonstration of such an intelligent home energy management problem are provided with multiagent setup based on a quite new concept of artificial intelligence-of-things that could showcase the software and hardware implementation features at the same time. By sufficient cosimulation experimental studies, this article found that residential customers can achieve a significant improvement in their economic benefit and decision-making efficiency.},

The asymptotic consensus can be achieved by using the Lyapunov method and PDE theory. It should be emphasized that all three types of cases-those without a leader, those with a leader, and those with multiple leaders-are looked into.

  abstract     = {In this article, the bipartite output consensus problem is investigated for heterogeneous multi-agent systems with event-triggered transmission under a signed digraph. It is allowed that part of the followers have no knowledge of the leader generated by the exosystem. Two novel distributed adaptive bipartite observers are first constructed together with event-triggered mechanisms for each follower. Specifically, these two observers are effective to realize the asymptotic estimations of exosystem matrices and state without Zeno behavior. Based on the obtained observers, a distributed controller is further designed, where the solution pair of regulator equations is calculated adaptively by an improved approach. As a prominent feature, the proposed control strategy successfully eliminates the dependence on global information related to a signed digraph, while guaranteeing event-triggered bipartite output consensus. At last, an example is conducted to demonstrate the validity of control strategy.},

  abstract     = {In edge-fog computing networks, it is very crucial to ensure that group keys are secure and reliable. In recent years, there has been much interest in group key updating schemes based on Chinese remainder theorem (CRT). It is mostly necessary to utilize the extended Euclidean algorithm to compute the inverse element in conventional schemes. But it does not always exist an inverse element. It leads to the computation being complicated and infeasible. Thus, we propose a scheme for updating group keys and batch verification based on Euler function and Chinese remainder theorem (EF-CRT). Group keys can be constructed directly using Euler function without requiring inverse elements. In addition, we design a batch verification scheme using the updated group key. The proposed EF-CRT scheme accomplishes dynamic group key updates, message integrity authentication, forward and backward security, and conditional privacy protection. Simultaneously, we prove that the security of EF-CRT is existentially unforgeable under the chosen message attack. In experiments with the java pairing-based cryptography library, the proposed scheme shows efficiency both in computational and communication overhead.},

The control strategy for the BESS has been developed to stabilize the dc-link voltage of the BBPC unit during grid faults and to ensure continuous operation of the test unit. The size of BESS is analyzed based on grid regulations and compliance with the existing BBPC protection devices (dc-link braking choppers and crowbar protection circuits). Through time domain simulation studies, the effectiveness of the proposed method is investigated in a 250-MW variable speed hydropower unit under various grid fault scenarios.

  abstract     = {File caching and replications for mobile social networks (MSNs) play a critical role in accessible and faster file sharing for mobile cloud, where copies of an original file are duplicated and stored in caching nodes with high network centrality. However, the existing solutions are not disease- and infection-resilient, i.e., the caching performance in terms of file availability and query delivery rates will decrease in the case of a disease outbreak. In such contexts, the nodes with high centrality as well as their direct neighbors in a social network are likely to go offline due to some reasons, such as disease infection. As a result, caching nodes with the same cached files can be accidentally removed from an MSN at the same time. To tackle this issue, in this article, we first introduce the concept of rendezvous avoidance, in which not only the connectivity among nodes but also the distances among caching nodes are incorporated into the centrality design. Then, we propose the rendezvous avoidance file caching (RAFC) algorithm for MSNs, where some nodes may accidentally go offline. In RAFC, the scores of nodes are iteratively computed by the proposed rendezvous avoidance centrality, and then, caching nodes are selected. The performance of our proposed scheme is evaluated by simulations using real mobility traces, and the simulation results demonstrate that it achieves its design goals.},

We apply vector orthogonal frequency division multiplexing integrated signals into the proposed cell-free JCR systems, which can achieve well-behaved performances, e.g., high spectral efficiency, superior detection resolution, and accurate latency/Doppler estimation results. Moreover, a low-complexity alternative grid searching method is designed, and the latency and Doppler estimation rates of the proposed system are derived, which gives the lower bounds of estimation performance. The beamforming weights and power allocation results are calculated by using the alternative Lagrange multiplier algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms the classical centralized JCR case in terms of ambiguity function, bit error rate, false alarm, and detection probabilities, verifying the efficiency of the proposed system.},

  abstract     = {The joint operation and coordination of power and water infrastructures have made them more vulnerable than before to cyber-physical attacks. This is because each system relies on the other to provide its services. Such a mutual dependence increases the risk of large-scale cascading failures. Therefore, it becomes of utmost importance to analyze the vulnerability of interdependent power–water infrastructures. To accurately quantify the overall damage due to cascading failure propagation, the vulnerability assessment should consider not only the topological features but also the power dynamics and the hydraulic features. Existing works fail to identify the combination of nodes that present the greatest damage. To fill up this gap, this article proposes and examines a low-complexity vulnerability assessment strategy based on the most critical nodes, which maximizes the overall damage. Experiments are conducted on two different power–water systems. It is shown that the proposed strategy identifies the most vulnerable nodes that cause a high damage impact from either or both systems, but with a much lower computational time compared to the one that selects the target nodes based on how much damage they inflict upon the system. A visual assessment of the physical disturbances under the most vulnerable nodes is presented.},

  abstract     = {Distribution systems are most vulnerable to high-impedance faults (HIFs). These types of faults occur when the primary electrical conductor fails or comes into contact with high-impedance substances, such as asphalt, grass, sand, concrete, etc. The magnitude of fault current is particularly low for certain grounding materials due to the nonlinear and high impedance of resistive surfaces. As a result, traditional overcurrent relays usually fail to operate, which may lead to fire hazards. Also, they are unable to detect the characteristics of HIF accurately, leading to maloperation. The motive of this work is to overcome the above-mentioned challenges of conventional relays. This article proposes a linear time–frequency wavelet-based tool called synchro-squeezing transform (SST) for the distortion detection of HIF in power distribution networks. This study uses wavelet SST to redistribute signal energy in the frequency domain. The wavelet SST is applied to the measured phase current signal for maximum time–frequency ridge extraction. Then, the inverse SST operation is performed to reconstruct the signal from the time–frequency domain. The reconstruction error is calculated between the original signal and the reconstructed signal. The reconstruction error value is compared with the base value to discriminate HIF from other non-HIF events. The impact of distributed generation on HIF features are further explored by EV penetration in the RSCAD distribution system and validated on the IEEE-13 node test feeder using RTDS. The main contributions of the proposed method are viz., it can correctly distinguish HIF from severe faults, switching events, energization scenarios, and noisy environments. The algorithm has been compared with the previously reported HIF detection techniques, and the efficacy of SST is presented through real-time simulation results. SST has a fast detection time and less computation burden.},

First, a piecewise resilient consensus protocol is proposed to ensure that the MAS can achieve consensus under switching topology and DoS attacks. Then, by considering the different convergence rates caused by the switching topology in each sleep period of DoS attacks, a piecewise Lyapunov–Krasovskii function is established. The sufficient conditions on the global convergence of the system are obtained under switching topology and DoS attacks. In the meantime, the lower bound of average dwell time of the switching topology is determined under DoS attacks. The relationship between average dwell time and the parameters of DoS attacks is discussed. Finally, the simulation example is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The proposed method distinguishes islanding events from normal/non-islanding conditions by utilizing superimposed harmonic spectra extracted through a full-cycle discrete Fourier transform. Our solution utilizes a machine-learning-based one-class classifier to define and adjust thresholds for full harmonic spectra. Unlike other methods, our approach does not require data synchronization or communication infrastructure, nor does it suffer from common errors that often arise in current transformers. Moreover, our design is compatible with distributed and decentralized control strategies, as it relies solely on local voltage measurements at the PoC. Another advantage of this method is its low sampling frequency requirement, in the range of 1 kHz, making it cost-effective and implementable in most existing systems. In a comprehensive evaluation of a typical MG test system that included synchronous and inverter-based DERs, the proposed scheme demonstrated exceptional performance. Specifically, the scheme was able to detect 99.06\% of different islanding events within the training range, with a detection time of just 10 to 21 ms. Additionally, the scheme remained 100\% stable during various normal conditions, short-circuit faults, load changes, voltage changes, capacitor switching, and frequency changes.},

To this end, this article proposes a mixed-integer linear programming model to synergistically dispatch RCs in power distribution systems and transportation systems. Geographical interdependency is modeled to guarantee feasible and practical routing schedules. A novel linear traffic flow transmission model is proposed to improve computational efficiency.

  abstract     = {For the purpose of video caching and low-delay video delivery to the end-users, multiaccess edge computing (MEC) servers are commonly grouped into clusters to efficiently exploit the limited storage resources of the MEC servers. In this article, we first introduce a methodology for analysis of the video delivery delay using the queuing theory. Our analysis shows that the video delivery delay is mainly affected by the arrival rate of the video requests. Furthermore, we show a tradeoff between the ratio of videos found in the MEC servers within the same cluster and the transmission delay of video contents. To reduce the video delivery delay, we propose a dynamic MEC server clustering (DyMECC) algorithm that determines the cluster size at each time interval by solving analytically derived equations considering the actual arrival rate of video requests. It also acts as a congestion avoidance mechanism for the communication interfaces among the MEC servers. Via simulations, we show that the DyMECC reduces the video delivery delay about 15\% in light load conditions and by more than five times in heavy load conditions compared to state-of-the-art works while also reduces the load of the communication interfaces among the MEC servers by more than 45\%.},

This article presents a method for simultaneous allocation and sizing of DGs into medium-voltage (MV) and low-voltage (LV) networks and CBs into LV side of MV/LV transformers to reduce losses and improve voltage profile in LV nodes without the increase in investment costs. The proposed method was performed with a modified genetic algorithm and demonstrated on IEEE 33 bus radial distribution system that was MV/LV transformers and LV line models. The ordinary model that consists only of MV nodes was extended for the purpose of monitoring the impact of DGs and CBs allocation on both the MV distribution network and on the LV networks that are fed from MV/LV substations. The simulations showed that better results in the coordinated allocation of DGs and CBs can be achieved by using a more detailed model with included elements of two voltage levels of the distribution network, and by considering the allocation of DGs on two voltage levels and the impact of the allocation of DGs and CBs on the MV network and the LV network.},

These spectrum-sharing satellites may generate the cofrequency interference (CFI) imposed on each other, resulting in a significant transmission-capacity decrement. To mitigate the CFI, we propose a beamforming and power control-aided interference mitigation (BFPC-IM) scheme for both the uplink and downlink scenarios. In the uplink scenario, the beamforming vectors and the transmit power are optimized iteratively to maximize the sum rate of the LEO satellite with DBF, while meeting the transmission requirements of the LEO satellite using FMB. By contrast, the inversion property is exploited to assist the proposed BFPC-IM scheme in the downlink scenario. Moreover, the complexity of the proposed BFPC-IM scheme is also analyzed for both scenarios. Numerical results show that the proposed BFPC-IM scheme can achieve a higher transmission capacity than the conventional fixed seven-color frequency reuse scheme, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of mitigating CFI.},

  abstract     = {To overcome high propagation loss, base stations (BSs) in a fifth-generation (5G) millimeter wave (mmWave) network can utilize directional beams to transmit downlink data to user equipments (UEs). In the network, UEs may not always be located directly beneath the scheduled beams. Thus, UEs can adopt discontinuous reception technology to enter sleep mode. Besides, to increase network capacity, UEs can enable dual connectivity to simultaneously receive downlink data from two BSs. We observe that in such a network scenario, the scheduling of BSs&#39; beams significantly impacts network performance. To tackle this challenge, a beam-aware scheduling method, named D-BAS, is designed for the network with discontinuous reception and dual connectivity UEs. The proposed D-BAS contains two phases. First, the beam deciding phase determines beam schedules for BSs in the network. The schedule decisions aim to consume UEs&#39; downlink data quickly. Second, the beam exchanging phase carefully exchanges the beam schedules of nearby BSs to facilitate energy conservation and data reception of UEs. The effectiveness of our design is validated through simulation programs and prototyping experiments. The results indicate that the proposed D-BAS can effectively improve network performance.},

  abstract     = {Data security has remained a challenging problem in cloud storage, especially in multiowner data sharing scenarios. As one of the most effective solutions for secure data sharing, multikeyword ranked searchable encryption (MRSE) has been widely used. However, most of the existing MRSE schemes have some shortcomings in multiowner data sharing, such as index trees generated by data owners, relevance scores in plaintext form, and lack of verification function. In this article, we propose a verifiable and efficient secure sharing scheme in multiowner multiuser settings, where the index tree is generated by the trusted authority. To achieve verifiable functionality, the blockchain-based smart contract is adopted to execute the search algorithm. Based on a distributed two-trapdoor public-key cryptosystem, the data uploaded and used are in ciphertext form, and the proposed algorithms are secure in our scheme. For improving efficiency, the encrypted data are aggregated according to the category and the Category ID-based index tree is generated. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that it can reduce the time cost of index construction by 75\% and the time cost of search by 53\%, approximately. Moreover, multithreaded optimization is introduced in our scheme, which can reduce the time cost of index construction by 76\% and the time cost of search by 67\%, approximately (with 16 threads).},

Next, to encourage roles in Blockchain Twin to actively and honestly participate in consensus phase, we design a multileader multifollower Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanism. Additionally, we prove that a unique Stackelberg equilibrium exists in the game and propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm to obtain the optimal solution. Finally, we evaluate the performance of twin-chain interactions regarding average delay and throughput. We also conduct numerical simulation on the proposed incentive mechanism, and the results show that our mechanism can jointly maximize the reward of every participant roles in Blockchain Twin.},

The loading factor considers the impact of the EV load on the line failure. The results of the simulation show that the BE station can improve the power system&#39;s reliability, and the satisfaction level of the EV demand can be optimized with strategic BE operation. The study also finds that the level of power system reliability and the satisfaction of EV demand are inversely related.

  abstract     = {High penetration of photovoltaic (PV) plants in power systems may reduce the damping of electromechanical (EM) oscillatory modes. Implementing auxiliary controllers in the PV plant control system is a well-known technique that can improve the damping of these oscillations. Active power modulation (APM) is an effective auxiliary-control-based method that requires an energy source. Previous works have proposed employing an external energy storage system (ESS) as the energy source of the APM or deloading the PV plant by moving away from its maximum power point (MPP) characteristic. However, installing ESSs is expensive, and distancing from the MPP is not economical. By focusing on the dc-side components of large-scale PV plants, this study proposes an APM method that does not need any ESSs or deloading. Instead, this article first evaluates the available amount of stored energy in the dc-link capacitors of large-scale PV plant inverters and then proposes a novel controller to employ this energy for the APM. Furthermore, impacts of large-scale PV plant penetration levels with and without the proposed controller as well as the PV unit numbers and the power system parameters and operating point on the damping ratio of EM modes and the performance of the proposed controller with various feedback signal types and measurement delays are investigated.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a total harmonic distortions (THD)-based passive islanding detection technique (IDT) to overcome the challenges in droop-controlled grid-forming inverters (GFMI). The conventional IDTs are ineffective in GFMI due to the impact of power control droop parameters on the nondetection zone (NDZ). Also, the active IDTs may cause disturbances in the working operation of the GFMI due to their opposite functionality. Thus, there is a need to develop adequate IDTs which can perform robustly even with unconventional droop parameters and helps in maintaining the GFMI functions. In this work, THD from the rms voltage and current at the point of common coupling are extracted using the fast Fourier transform analysis. Then, a novel islanding detection factor (IDF) with adaptive weights is calculated. Finally, the statistical feature extracted from the IDF is compared with the threshold value to detect islanding. The performance of the proposed IDT (P-IDT) is analyzed with an real-time digital simulator (RTDS) simulator in a developed RSCAD distribution system. The real-time (RT) performance validation of the P-IDT is executed with the RSCAD (Real-Time) software IEEE-13 node system and RT-LAB (Real-Time) software. The RT results for different islanding and nonislanding scenarios show the efficacy of P-IDT.The proposed method is superior in accuracy and detection time as compared to the other conventional techniques.},

  abstract     = {The uncertainty and unpredictable power generation and usage of resources at demand as well as supply side causes the mismatch problem. Therefore, the power demand and supply management of regional smart meters have become an essential and challenging research issue in the current era. The existing solutions have inadequately explored the relationship between forecasted load and power demand supply management of smart meters, which imposes a huge impact on the performance of power services to the regional customers. In this context, a novel quantum machine learning-driven power distribution and supply management (QPD-SM) model is proposed, which estimates the power demand of regional smart meters proactively by utilizing the load forecasting values and managing power supply efficiently. The model deploys a newly developed “quantum controlled-NOT gate induced feed-forward neural network” (QCNN) which is optimized using the quantum adaptive differential evolutionary (QuADE) learning algorithm to forecast regional load with precise accuracy. Further, a demand–supply management approach is designed to analyze and estimate the over-/under-supply of power units relative to different regions and govern the power generation and supply management accordingly. Experimental results from the Irish Commission for Energy Regulation and the Australian Smart Grid Smart City show the improvement of root-mean-squared error up to 77.02\% and 78.92\%, respectively, by the proposed model as compared to the existing state-of-the-art works.},

  abstract     = {Time-varying output formation tracking (TVOFT) issue for general linear multiagent systems (MASs) with a nonautonomous leader under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks is investigated. The DoS attacks refer to attacks on communication between agents launched by intelligent adversaries. Based on relative information between neighboring agents, we develop an independent asynchronous resilient fully distributed event-triggered control (ETC) strategy. With the developed ETC strategy, the MASs can achieve TVOFT in such an insecure environment, and do not exhibit the Zeno behavior. The advantages of the developed ETC strategy are mainly in the following three aspects: 1) the strategy can tolerate the continuous attacks from the adversaries; 2) the strategy is applicable to more general scenarios, such as when only relative information is available; and 3) the strategy can be implemented in a fully distributed manner. Moreover, considering that the developed ETC strategy needs to continuously monitor the estimate errors, we further formulate a novel self-triggered control (STC) strategy to overcome the shortcoming. Different from the existing works, different STC strategies are formulated for different types of followers in this article, which enlarges the interevent interval time.},

  abstract     = {Hardware impairments in wireless transceivers can cause severe performance degradation, particularly for high-rate communication networks. Few studies have explored the impact of these frameworks on recent wireless networks, such as uplink nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with imperfect channel estimation. In this article, we investigate the effect of two practical and malignant imperfections on the performance of coordinated direct and relay transmission (CDRT) using uplink NOMA. Based on these imperfections, we derive an exact closed-form expression for the ergodic sum capacity and outage probability of an uplink NOMA CDRT network. Our model accounts for all the hardware distortions caused by nonideal transceiver nodes as well as residual interference from imperfect channel estimates and imperfect successive interference cancellations. Furthermore, in order to establish a benchmark, we provide analytical expressions and numerical results that demonstrate the superiority of the CDRT-assisted uplink NOMA system with respect to an orthogonal multiple access system. To verify the accuracy of the derived analytical expressions, Monte Carlo simulations are performed.},

We propose a multiagent optimization approach to study the multistage decentralized distributed generation (DG) and CS planning process considering the decision makings of the DG investors, CS aggregator, and distribution system operator (DSO). Furthermore, we develop an exact convex reformulation of the proposed multiagent optimization problem to significantly improve the computational efficiency. Through numerical examples, we found that with the increase of EV adoption, CS investors expand the CS capacities significantly towards the later years of the planning horizon, whereas the DG owners expand their generation capacities in response to both load and charging demand (CD). The model is able to describe the close coupling between stakeholders and efficiently identify the equilibrium investment patterns of DGs and CSs over space and time to satisfy the growing EV, CD, and other existing power loads. In addition, the modeling framework can allow DSO and government agencies to evaluate viable system evolvement paths and better understand the system needs of energy generation and charging infrastructure in order to achieve a higher level of EV penetration.},

In this article, we jointly optimize power splitting (PS) for SWIPT and power allocation for NOMA signaling in SWIPT-enabled NOMA helped by the DAS for two different following goals: 1) sum-rate maximization; and 2) achieving max–min fairness. Also, we analyze the impact of imperfect channel state information (CSI) on power splitting and power allocation of SWIPT-NOMA with the DAS in both problems. Due to the nonconvexity of the joint optimization problem, we first obtain the optimal PS ratios and use them to convert the problem to a single-variable problem. The joint optimal solution is then obtained in the closed-form by finding and comparing all local extrema of the objective function using the first-order derivative. Numerical results were used to validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that the proposed framework of using SWIPT-enabled NOMA in DAS achieves higher data rates than the existing SWIPT-enabled NOMA while guaranteeing minimum harvested energy and data rate requirements.},

  abstract     = {Network function virtualization (NFV) is a novel network architecture yielding many optimization choices to Internet service providers due to its flexibility. Based on this technique, a network service is constructed from a chain of virtual network functions (VNFs). Although many studies deeply investigate the NFV and propose approaches to address the problem of deploying services in physical networks under different perspectives, they do not consider the importance of services. This issue becomes more critical once the number of network services ever-increasing while the network resources are limited. Here, each service is assigned a weight representing its importance. From this aspect, maximizing the total weight of services accepted to deploy over the physical network is a critical problem and poses many challenges, particularly for networks with limited resources. Therefore, we call this issue the VNF placement for weighted services (VPWS) problem. We then propose three algorithms termed first-fit server algorithm (FSA), best-fit server algorithm (BSA), and service segment-based algorithm (SSBA), respectively, to address the VPWS problem. Eventually, we perform simulations to evaluate the proposed algorithms and factors that affect the VNF placement. The experiment indicates that the total weight yielded by the SSBA outperforms those of the FSA and BSA.},

To ensure that the nodes within IoT can interact securely, a certificateless signature (CLS) can be used to protect message authentication in the IoT. Recently, some concrete constructions of CLS schemes have been proposed in the literature, but through our analyses, we demonstrate that some existing CLS schemes cannot keep their claimed security because of various security flaws. For example, a valid signature can be forged by any Type I adversary by replacing the corresponding user&#39;s public key. In this article, we describe the security flaws that need to be addressed and introduce a novel CLS scheme without using bilinear mapping. The existential unforgeability in our proposed scheme can be proved based on the hardness of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem in the random oracle model. The comparison with existing CLS schemes shows that our scheme not only enjoys more security features but also is more efficient in computation. Moreover, we introduce an identity authentication protocol as the application of our proposed CLS scheme, which achieves mutual authentication and anonymity in communications.},

As part of the methodology, we introduce the reliability set covering (RSC) model, which extends the classical set covering optimization model to consider reliability in addition to cost. The proposed methodology embeds the RSC model in a simulation framework that varies factors such as the anticipated duration of the mission, the number of redundant systems of each type available, and the age/condition of each available system. The simulation is guided by a statistical design of experiments, and an analysis of variation is applied to the results. This allows the decision maker to identify scenarios where a significant increase in redundant systems or the use of more expensive systems is required, and “mission critical” systems that are selected in a relatively large number of simulation runs. The process provides the decision maker with cost and mission reliability estimates for each candidate SoS. We demonstrate the practicality of the process for a notional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission with three required capabilities and five candidate system types, and randomly generated missions with up to eight required capabilities.},

However, this type of device not only has the characteristics of constrained resources and limited battery power, but is also mobile and fast-moving. Therefore, secure and efficient communication in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks demands additional properties such as real-time, low latency, privacy preservation, and so on. Attempting to solve the aforementioned problems, Xu et al. proposed an anonymous authenticated key agreement scheme, which was proved to be secure under the random oracle security model. Unfortunately, in this article, we will point out that their scheme does not satisfy forward security. A certificateless authenticated key agreement protocol is further designed and proved secure by means of theorems and Scyther tool. The performance of the improved protocol is also evaluated from the aspects of security properties, storage, communication, and computation costs. Compared to several related schemes, it can be concluded that our protocol achieves a good balance between security and efficiency.},

The problem is very challenging because the MILP requires an exhaustive collection of topologies, which increases exponentially with the number of UAVs and potential UAVs placement locations. To this end, this article outlines two novel methods. The first is a heuristic centralized method called distance-based location selection (DBLS) that generates a subset of topologies to reduce the search space of the said MILP. The second method is a distributed Gibbs-sampling-based protocol (DGSP) that allows each UAV to determine its location iteratively and independently.

In this article, we set up a unified rate-splitting framework to guarantee the safe spectrum sharing through multiple multiaccess strategies, without the knowledge of wiretap channels. The precoding vectors at the transmitter are conjointly designed to boost the transmission of common stream, which is from both PU and SU. Besides, the private stream of the downlink CR system can be well secreted in the high-power common signal. As for NOMA and SDMA, when the message of SU is regarded as the friendly jamming signal, the security transmission requirement of PU can be similarly guaranteed via precoding design. Simulations validate that the rate-splitting framework we established can be effective in ensuring the spectrum sharing security for the secure users through RSMA, and the security for NOMA and SDMA is also able to be promoted through adjusting our designed framework.},

We optimize all the related variables comprehensively, including the partial offloading factor, the transmit power, the cognitive radio (CR) router selection, the offloading spectrum block selection, and the computing resource allocation in both SUs and CR routers. We formulate the considered problem as a mixed integer nonlinear programming. We theoretically show that when the selections of the offloading CR router and offloading spectrum block for SUs are given, the optimal computing frequency in SUs and CR routers can be determined by the transmit powers and partial offloading ratios. Based on this, the considered problem is decomposed into a transmit power and partial offloading ratio optimization subproblem, an offloading spectrum block selection subproblem, and a CR router selection subproblem. For the three subproblems, differential evolution, more complex task first, and coalition game algorithms are proposed to solve them, respectively.

  abstract     = {Ensuring safety is crucial for robots collaborating with humans in a shared workspace. Current human–robot interaction (HRI) safety strategies focus on either precollision motion replanning or postcollision force control, using unimodal perception. In this article, we present an active safety strategy that combines precollision and postcollision strategies using a hierarchical control architecture, making it possible to ensure safety throughout the entire HRI process. The inner loop utilizes a whole-body compliance controller to reduce multicontact forces throughout the robot&#39;s body. The outer loop involves velocity scaling that anticipates collisions based on visual perception and decelerates the robot&#39;s velocity before a collision occurs. This deceleration also simplifies the inner force control law to a computationally efficient linear model. Furthermore, to relieve the communication load of large-scale tactile systems and enable real-time control, we propose the vision assisted event-driven mechanism. It selectively transmits tactile information from potential collision areas. We have constructed a humanoid robotic platform called the visual–tactile humanoid robot and conducted four experiments. Our results demonstrate that our proposed strategy actively ensures safety in the whole process of HRI. The comparison study also confirms that the strategy can both reduce the impact forces at the beginning of the collisions and dissipate the subsequent continuous contact forces compared with existing works. This active strategy promises safety for various scenarios where humans and robots require close and frequent physical contacts.},

  abstract     = {At present, communication networks like the Internet of Things (IoT) are emerging with some of the latest technologies, such as artificial intelligence, big data, and cloud computing, to enable wireless edge infrastructures and seamless data migration. In particular, edge-based wireless communications help to gain new insights into the mitigation of potential communicable infections, e.g., COVID-19, via the use of IoT sensing devices. Of late, an evolving technology known as the cloud-assisted medical cyber-physical system (MCPS) has explored various key agreement protocols to examine security weaknesses between sensing devices and medical experts. Unfortunately, the existing schemes address vulnerabilities such as impersonation, privileged insider, and password guessing, whereby the behavior of the system becomes nondeterministic when guarding against malicious intent. Also, failures, faults, and attacks may vary in the characteristic forms of the IoT and the MCPS, causing unforeseen impairments in the system and for users. Thus, this article develops a privacy-preserving key agreement framework (PP-KAF) using the Chebyshev chaotic map mechanism to avoid privacy data disclosures and to protect session keys. The proposed PP-KAF exploits a strategy of two-way authentication not only to protect user identities but also to achieve untraceability from the remote server. Finally, a formal analytical model is applied to examine the properties of the key agreement protocol. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PP-KAF can offer better security efficiencies and can mitigate computation and communication overhead to guarantee improved quality metrics, namely, throughput rate and energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Data deduplication technology is a very important technology in cloud storage. It is widely applied in various fields, such as electronic health care. Data deduplication technology can significantly eliminate redundant data and save storage space. For protecting the security of user&#39;s data, secure deduplication schemes based on data popularity have been proposed. They use the convergent encryption to encrypt the data with high popularity and use double-layer encryption to encrypt the data with low popularity. However, these schemes have huge computational overhead because of the adopted double-layer encryption for the whole data and the complex symmetric key delivery. In order to address this problem, we design a lightweight secure deduplication scheme based on data popularity. We propose a new outer-layer encryption strategy, which encrypts two different parts of the inner-layer convergent ciphertext with different techniques. This strategy reduces the computational overhead of outer-layer encryption, while ensuring that unpopular data are still semantically secure. In addition, we use a new method to transfer the key of the outer-layer encryption. It not only reduces the computational overhead of the user to generate and encrypt the symmetric key but also reduces the computational overhead of the cloud server to decrypt the symmetric key when popularity transition arises. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that our scheme is more efficient than the existing schemes in aspects of encrypting unpopular data and transferring the symmetric key.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Internet of Things (IoT) users possess dynamic service requirements in a real IoT system and always try to get services from trusted entities, which we term as facility nodes. However, the trustworthiness of the facility nodes varies from location to location, depending upon the service quality and user feedback. Therefore, a service provider may have different trust scores for its deployed facility nodes in different locations. It is always crucial for an IoT user to ensure that service has been taken from trustworthy nodes. In this article, we consider an IoT service provisioning architecture, where an IoT user requests services from nearby trusted nodes that are deployed by service providers other than the user&#39;s own registered service provider. To serve the requests from these unregistered users, the facility nodes incur additional costs. Furthermore, due to heterogeneous service requirements, IoT users prefer composite microservices from a set of facility nodes. In such cases, it is difficult to design a pricing scheme to incentivize the facility nodes. Therefore, we propose a pricing mechanism based on a two-stage Stackelberg game and analyze the interactions between the IoT users and the facility nodes, while considering the trust scores and service charges. In the game model, the facility nodes act as the leaders, and the IoT users act as the followers. Using backward induction, we analyze the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium. Finally, the numerical results based on the mobility traces of a real map show that the proposed scheme incentivizes both the IoT users and the facility nodes, while ensuring trusted services.},

We provide closed-form lower bounds for the ESR when MIMO channels have no correlation or exhibit correlation at the receive side, transmit side, and both sides. These bounds are attained by representing the determinant function by simple polynomial expansions. They are appropriate for a general setup of the MIMO-NOMA network and do not constrain the number of antennas or uplink users to be unbounded. Moreover, we give simplified ESR formulas for the investigated correlation scenarios in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Numerical results corroborate accuracy of the derived expressions over different antenna configurations, number of users, channel conditions, and SNRs. The new ESR equations extend the state-of-the-art and enable an elegant and efficient performance evaluation of MIMO-NOMA for next-generation systems.},

The ambiguity set consisting of a family of distributions close to the reference probability distribution, is used to model the uncertainty, where the reference distribution is generated according to predictive information and historical seasonal prediction error, so it is helpful to implicitly reflect the seasonality of natural inflows. The conservatism of the solution can be adjusted by regulating the scale of the ambiguity set. The column and constraint generation algorithm is employed to decompose the proposed min–max–min problem into a master problem and subproblem, where the maintenance decision is determined in the master problem and the operation decisions are made to identify the worst-case probability distribution in the subproblem. The stochastic dual dynamic programming algorithm is applied to further decompose the multistage subproblem into several smaller stage problems. Case studies were conducted on a modified IEEE 30-bus system and real hydrothermal power systems in China to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

As a selfless auctioneer, the ETC leverages discriminatory price weights to regulate the behaviors of ESPs and LAs. It combines the individual benefits of each stakeholder with the overall SW, and closes the efficiency gap. Nash games are employed to describe the interactions between players with the same market role. Theoretically, we first prove the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium; then, considering the requirement of game players to preserve privacy, a distributed algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers is developed to implement distributed bidding and analytical target cascading algorithm is applied to reach the balance of demand and supply. We validated the proposed mechanism using case studies on a city-level distribution system. The results indicated that the achieved SW improved by 4\%–15\% compared with other mechanisms, and also verified the effectiveness of the distributed algorithm.},

According to the performance analysis, the ergodic rate of STAR-RIS-aided NOMA system is derived for theoretical evaluation and optimization, and resultant tightly approximate expression is attained. Also, an upper bound of ergodic rate is derived for simplifying the tight approximation and the rate optimization. Then, we formulate the joint optimization problem of PA and amplitude coefficients for ergodic rate maximization under the constraints of maximum power, minimal rate, and maximum sum amplitude. It is shown that this multidimensional optimization problem can be simplified as 2-D optimization problem, and thus, we present an optimal scheme based on 2-D search method to obtain the optimal solution. To simplify the optimal scheme, by maximizing the upper bound of ergodic rate, a suboptimal scheme and its improved scheme based on 1-D search method are, respectively, proposed, and they can obtain the performance close to the optimal scheme with lower complexity. Besides, three algorithms are presented for solving the design problems of optimal scheme, suboptimal scheme, and improved scheme, respectively. Simulation results show that the derived theoretical expressions match the simulations well.

Nonetheless, the limited D2D coverage and onboard energy pose a new need for establishing a hybrid D2D and D2V network. In this article, we jointly establish, optimize, and integrate D2D and D2V networks to support energy-efficient emergency communications. First, we establish a D2D network by optimally dividing ground devices (GDs) into separated clusters and identifying temporary data caching centers (TDCCs) from GDs in clusters. Accordingly, emergency data returned from GDs are cached in TDCCs. Second, given the distribution of TDCCs, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are dispatched to fetch data from TDCCs. Therefore, we establish a UAV-assisted D2V network through path planning and network configuration optimization. Specifically, optimal path planning is implemented using cascaded waypoint and motion planning, and optimal network configurations are determined by multiobjective optimization. Consequently, the best tradeoff between emergency response time and energy consumption is achieved, subject to a given set of constraints on signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios, the number of UAVs, transmit power, and energy. Simulation results show that our proposed approach outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of energy efficiency, contributing to large-scale postdisaster emergency response.},

Considering the potential eavesdropping risk of ERs, the beamforming and artificial noise of the BSs and phase shifts of RISs are jointly optimized to minimize power consumption under imperfect all-link channel state information. For the complex probability constraints in the nonconvex problem, the permutation matrix and the Bernstein-type inequality are introduced to transform the constraints into a convex form. Further, the problem is decomposed into two subproblems, and the optimal solution is obtained through an alternating algorithm where the subproblems are solved by semidefinite relaxation. In addition, the rank-1 constraints are handled by recursive construction and compensation function based on first-order Taylor expansion. The simulation results verify that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the required total power consumption while providing robust secure transmission and energy supplement in RISs-aided HetNet.},

  abstract     = {We present a framework for the optimization of networks across three perspectives of complexity. Two of these refer to structural properties of a system, termed objective and subjective complexity: the former sees an advantage in connectivity; the latter views complexity as creating opaqueness from within a subjective perspective. Here, the distance from a reference for simplicity network—, a tree, the quintessential management structure—models subjective complexity. The third property relates to the dynamics of a network for which we utilize the proxy of Kuramoto synchronization. Within this we propose a two-stage optimization process for effective synchronization within a constraint of load balance and minimum subjective and objective complexities. Separate objective functions for each of these views of complexity are presented. This builds on previous work on the optimization of Kuramoto synchronization. We demonstrate the computational approach within an illustrative framework for stakeholder engagement in the management of complexity in organizational decision making. We show how the different perspectives may be balanced to arrive at choices of an optimal network design.},

The resulting safety-related availability requirements aim to maintain a minimum level of functionality also in the presence of component failures. In addition to electrification and the evolution of cross-domain functionalities, they also increase overall design complexity. Therefore, automated design space exploration, embedding automated safety analysis, becomes crucial for optimal system design. This article proposes a framework for model-based optimization of safety-critical mechatronic systems facing two major challenges as follows. 1) Modeling and exploration of a large design space resulting from topology variants and associated safety measures. 2) Dynamic safety analysis of each variant considering all component failures and their effects on relevant functionalities. Due to the high computational complexity, a two-level modeling approach combining behavioral and logical modules is introduced to reduce the number of evaluation runs when automatically exploring the design space. Further, an algebraic approach is proposed to calculate relevant safety metrics with high accuracy and comparatively low calculation time. The framework is exemplified by optimizing an electric powertrain over a nested design space considering acquisition and operation cost as well as different safety-related availability requirements.},

Existing solutions are devoted to intelligent models based on operators&#39; experience, but ignore the dangers of too much residual aluminum to human health and plant cost. To solve this problem, we propose an edge–cloud collaborative intelligent (ECCI) coagulation system, WaterEdge, to minimize the residual aluminum, while ensuring water quality. To support this, a collaborative architecture of “multiPool-multiWTP-cloud” is developed for fast computation, continuous service maintenance, and upgradation of all WTPs. An ECCI dosage prediction algorithm based on double incremental learning is proposed to determine optimal dosage. To reduce the response time, an ECCI online scheduling algorithm is presented. Furthermore, we build an ECCI platform to provide lifecycle management of applications and verify the effectiveness of WaterEdge in real-world WTPs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WaterEdge can significantly outperform existing schemes.},

Product inspection uses multisourced information and intelligent algorithm to recognize anomalies. Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are fundamental parts of smart production and inspection. In surface inspection of industrial products, some defects, which are sensitive to the direction of light and viewer, are difficult to be recognized under fixed illumination and observation. This article presents a novel approach to solve the problem of general industrial surface inspection. The solution includes a lighting scheme, multichannel image capture, image splitting, and intelligent classification. Using a flexible and controllable hemispherical light source, we capture photometric images under illumination at specified elevations. Then, we conduct slice splitting and labeling on the images to build a dataset. Next, we build a classification network based on the ResNet backbone. To achieve better performance, we embed global squeeze and excitation module to aggregate features of multichannel images. Simultaneously add a feature pyramid network to yield feature fusion of multiscales. Comparative experiments are conducted and experimental results highlight the superiority of the proposed scheme combining multichannel photometric images and classification model. The CPSs can also be applied to other defect diagnostics’ scenarios.},

Adversarial attacks are cyber-related attacks that target the DL network&#39;s prediction by adding imperceptible perturbations to its input. Their deployment against critical artificial-intelligence-based systems, such as industrial cyber–physical systems (ICPSs), can result in substantial damage. Research on their scope and limitations can provide information that would help with their detection and prevention. In this article, the interconnection of adversarial attacks and interpretable semantic segmentation is investigated for potential applications in the ICPS in order to contribute to the safe use of future intelligent systems. We first explore gradient-based interpretability extensions to semantic segmentation on two industry-related cyber–physical system datasets. Then, two types of attacks on semantic segmentation networks are discussed. First, we apply the dense adversary generation attack on different segmentation outputs and evaluate its influence on the corresponding saliency maps. We then introduce a way to visualize the similarity of attacked saliency maps to the original with respect to the targeted attack&#39;s direction. Finally, we extend the application of adversarial attacks on saliency maps to semantic segmentation.},

It is unfortunate that none of the control engineering tools developed to support ICPMSMS have been able to satisfy all ICPS components, despite the tremendous effort expended. Consequently, selecting the best control engineering tool to support ICPMSMS is a challenging task. Although literature reviews have evaluated control engineering tools, informational ambiguity and uncertainty remain open issues. This study extends fuzzy weighted with zero inconsistency (FWZIC) with interval-valued spherical fuzzy rough sets (IvSFRSs) to weight the components of the ICPS. Then, the developed IvSFRS-FWZIC method is integrated with the PROMETHEE II method to uncertain the modeling of control engineering tools. Results of the IvSFRS-FWZIC revealed that cybersecurity was the most influential component, whereas the digital twin component was the least influential. According to PROMETHEE II results, tool_1, tool_3, and tool_2 achieved the first model among the ten tools. Finally, the robustness of the proposed methods is evaluated by conducting sensitivity and comparative analysis.},

As the cyberattacks are becoming more and more complicated, which might be composed by multiple steps, obtaining the attack strategies can help understand and better defend these attacks. However, there are many unknown cyberattacks every day, while attackers will not reveal the attack steps and tools normally, it is a persistent challenging problem to obtain attack strategies. Cyber range is a testbed that can simulate a networked system, which supports attack and defense activities to be conducted with no harm to the real system. As the cyber range can record process data within the activity, extracting cyberattack strategies based on the cyber range has become one effective approach. In this article, we propose an attack strategies extraction framework to obtain the attack strategies from the security alerts that are generated in the cyber range, which uses a model called attack strategies identifier to identify the attack sequence that has similar attack patterns to some known attack strategies. Through our experiments, the attack strategies identifier was able to judge unknown attack sequences with 98.26\% accuracy, 98.70\% recall, and 98.44\% F1-score. We implemented and tested our framework on two network attack and defense activities in the cyber range, and obtained 45 and 47 attack strategies, respectively. Through manual validation, our framework has the ability to extract novel attack strategies from security alerts.},

Meanwhile, the principal component analysis is used to extract text features from English texts. Finally, feature selection is performed using information gain technology to improve text classification performance. The simulation results show that compared with the comparison method, the proposed algorithm has ideal results in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, true positive rate, and false positive rate.

  abstract     = {Security and privacy are vital challenges in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems due to the inherent broadcast property of industrial wireless communication. Therefore, how to improve the security of smart devices in IIoT systems has attracted widespread attention. In this article, a novel security optimization scheme for space shift keying (SSK)-based IIoT systems is proposed by applying secrecy enhancing techniques in the physical layer. Specifically, two methods are adopted in the proposed optimization scheme. First, the sender transmits artificial noise (AN) to interfere with the eavesdropper, while the legitimate receiver can eliminate AN. Second, the sender can select optimal antennas based on the proposed minmax criteria to transmit AN and information, which further promotes the security of industrial wireless communication. The optimal antenna selection pattern increases the difference of the average mutual information between the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. In addition, the proposed minmax antenna selection approach only requires the channel state information of the legitimate receiver, which satisfies the application scenario of unknown eavesdropper attacks in IIoT. Finally, we adopt a deep learning-based maximum likelihood (ML) detection algorithm to detect the optimal antenna index and analyze the bit error rate (BER) and secrecy rate (SR) of the proposed optimization scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve similar SR improvements and superior BER performance compared with the state-of-the-art scheme, namely the signal-leakage-to-noise ratio (SLNR) scheme. The BER performance of the proposed scheme achieves a maximum of 100 times superior to that of the SLNR scheme when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 27 dB. Moreover, the proposed scheme outperforms the traditional antenna selection scheme (random selection) in terms of BER and SR.},

  abstract     = {Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition that affects the motor system and can result in tremors, limb rigidity, and gait and balance disorders. Currently, conventional tests consist of a series of spiral drawings, with the notion that the most prevalent PD symptoms directly impact the visual appearance of handwritten geometric dynamics. Current disease diagnosis methods rely heavily on a large amount of preexisting clinical data to train their models. However, the lack of sufficient labeled data samples in many diseases, including PD, makes it challenging to build robust predictive models, especially deep-learning ones. With measuring devices becoming more common and the continuous increase in processing power, industrial cyber-physical characterization is emerging as a key enabling technology for a wide range of fields. This article proposes an industrial cyber-physical deep meta-learning framework for diagnosing and monitoring PD patients based on metric learning that aims to train a reliable PD classifier with limited data. In particular, we present a component-based cyber-physical system architecture to combine contrastive learning with a CNN encoder to obtain unbiased feature embeddings and then use a Siamese network to finalize PD classification. Our technique outperforms pretrained models with few training instances on a publicly available PD dataset of hand-drawn spiral and wave images.},

This article proposes a model known as the relation-aggregated hypergraph neural network, which aims to better describe and apply complex structures and relationships in the physical world, thereby improving the management efficiency and service quality of service recommendation in CPS. First, explicit and implicit hyperedges are constructed based on the explicit and implicit relationships between nodes, respectively. Second, a global attention mechanism is adopted to calculate the importance between neighbor nodes that share implicit hyperedges with the current node, generating a relation-aggregated hypergraph. Finally, by weighting the generated hypergraph association matrix and passing the aggregated features through the hypergraph neural network, we obtain the embedding representation of nodes. Node classification experiments were conducted on three public network datasets, and the accuracy rates were 83.7\%, 88.8\%, and 84.9\%, respectively, which were higher than those of the baseline model.},

The low-density parity check (LDPC) code is an import information encryption format in computer networks. In this article, from the perspective of LDPC code decoding algorithm scheduling strategy, we design a dynamic check node scheduling (DCNS) strategy for extended min-sum LDPC decoding in cyber-physical systems. In this strategy, the reliability of the node is checked to determine whether to update. For the un-updated variable node, it is optimized according to the results of real-time scheduling. Compared with the flooding mechanism and LBP scheduling of the usual algorithms, this proposed scheduling strategy improves the error correction performance by selecting some nodes for decoding and performing message optimization, while not significantly increasing the decoding computation. Especially, compared with the LBP, the bit error rate and frame error rate of the proposed algorithm are reduced by 48.3\% and 53.2\% on average in the finite domain 64F range. Compared with BP, the bit error rate and frame error rate of the proposed algorithm are reduced by 11.3\% and 13.2\% on average in the finite domain 64F range.},

  abstract     = {Cyber-physical energy systems (CPES) are a crucial component of smart grids (SGs), and as such, they represent a specialized subset of cyber-physical systems. CPES provides essential services for pricing decisions and automatic generation control through short-term load forecasting (STLF), making the accuracy of STLF critical to optimizing their operation. However, due to the numerous communication devices installed within CPES, data collection is often subject to various factors that could negatively impact load forecasting accuracy. To improve the accuracy of STLF, this article proposes a reliable method that combines an adaptive denoising technique, a 2-D deep temporal convolutional network (TDeepTCN), and a multidimensional input structure bidirectional long short-term memory-attention (MBiLSTM-attention) network. First, an adaptive approach that combines Pearson correlation coefficient and complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise is utilized to effectively identify raw load series contaminated by noise and reconstruct them. Then, a TDeepTCN model is constructed using TCN to simultaneously capture and fuse both local and long-term temporal features from multiple load series. Finally, MBiLSTM-attention is employed for accurate forecasting to achieve feature processing for multidimensional depth features. Eventually, compared to existing models, our proposed model achieves the most accurate forecasting results with a mean absolute percentage error rate of only 3.98\% and 4.12\%, respectively, in both regions.},

  abstract     = {The huge number of electric vehicles (EVs) penetration resulted in the rapid deployment of charging stations as well as an increase in electricity demands. Due to this, there is a growing interest in the load balance in the power grid. In the power grid, whenever there is a decrease in the overall usable voltage and reactive power, harmonics will be injected, which affects the overall power quality of the grid. In addition to the abovementioned issues, most of the existing works face issues, such as an imbalance of load at the grid, inefficient utilization of resources, and nonoptimal power transactions cost. To reduce and avoid the abovementioned issues, we propose a real-time intelligent method-based energy utilization, conservation, and optimal price at the grid and charging stations using artificial intelligence (AI). We develop the IEEE 69 bus test system and analyze the grid and charging stations. Using the analyzed factors of the grid and charging station, designed an edge-computing enabled optimal charging price scheme using the game theoretic approach. The designed system provides efficient utilization, energy conservation, and adaptive optimal charging price for EVs at charging stations. Discrete-time event simulator is developed to test the proposed scheme with parameters, such as arrival rates, queue length, and reactive power.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of the Internet of Vehicles, the systematical cameras in vehicles can easily collect mass personal face data, which is very private on the Internet. This article focuses on solving the face protection problem caused by the Internet of Vehicles. Previous studies have proposed various face protection models based on obfuscation, neural networks, or adversarial techniques to prevent the disclosure of identity information. Even with existing face anonymization algorithms, there are several issues, including weak information protection ability, not maintaining the naturalness of a protected face, and not being suitable for various emerging face recognition systems. We propose an adversarial secret-identity generation model to protect personal identities from these problems. Concretely, our model&#39;s identity encryption generative adversarial module can generate brand new faces, which ensures naturalness while making other face identification models unable to recognize the identity. In addition, our PFS module extracts the identity set that is least relevant to the inputs and most conducive to model convergence from target data and promotes the generation of excellent faces from the perspective of data. Finally, the protected identities generated by our black-box face deidentification model can resist recognizing various advanced face identification approaches. Extensive experiments prove our model can achieve a 96.5\% protection success rate, achieving competitive performance with 98.1\% R1-T, 99.2\% R5-T, 98.5\% R1-U, and 97.1\% R5-U against ArcFace and beating out various superior face anonymization algorithms. Meanwhile, we introduce a model compression algorithm to reduce the network scale of this model, demonstrating the scalability of various intelligent vehicles.},

Using cyber-physical components in the power system such as smart grids can introduce vulnerabilities such as false data injection (FDI) that can cost millions. Deep learning (DL) is an emerging technology that mimics the human brain to process complex problems. In DL, relevant features are extracted automatically to make a meaningful decision out of the data. This article proposes an attack detection method that utilizes DL techniques for detecting FDI attacks. The proposed methodology assumed the problem of varying sparsity attacks in the system, in which attacks can occur at any subset of measurements, as well as the problem of imbalanced training data in real systems. Thus, a deep neural network with regularization techniques including dropout layers and adaptive optimization is proposed for superior generalization to varying sparsity in FDI attacks. An experimental environment is established on simulated power systems of varied sizes and compared with alternative state-of-the-art schemes. The proposed scheme outperforms all of them including robustness to data imbalance and also, it takes lesser time than neural networks of the similar architecture.},

Considering that the uncertainty of TL manufacturing and practical application will propagate to crosstalk, and it is difficult to obtain uncertain distribution types in practical engineering applications, this article adopts a data-driven method based on the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) to establish a PCE metamodel that conforms to any distribution. The coefficients of the PCE terms are calculated by orthogonal matching pursuit based on the compressive sensing, and the extension of probability driven to arbitrary distribution is in line with the category of artificial intelligence and more in line with practical engineering applications. Combined with the Sobol, the influence of each input variable on the multiconductor TL (MTLs) crosstalk is quantified so as to provide reasonable suggestions for the rectification and optimization of the MTLs crosstalk in the future.},

  abstract     = {A smart city is a kind of urban form that uses technology and data to integrate and optimize urban subsystems and resources to improve urban sustainability and livability. As an important product of the information age, digital smart city combining digital city and smart city has become a significant direction for urban development. In this context, it has become an important task to evaluate construction for digital smart cities. Cloud computing is an Internet-based method, which has excellent performance in Big Data computing and network storage. This article proposes a digital smart city construction evaluation network cloud-IPSO-DBN based on cloud computing and neural network. First, this article improves particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to build improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO). Then, IPSO is used to optimize the initial parameters of deep belief networks (DBN) to build IPSO-DBN for evaluating the construction of digital smart city. Second, this article builds a cloud computing platform to parallelize algorithms to build cloud-IPSO-DBN. This can promote the parallel implementation of the algorithm and improve the performance of the algorithm. Cloud-IPSO-DBN achieves 95.50\%/96.00\% accuracy, 95.55\%/96.11\% precision, 95.42\%/95.94\% recall, and 95.47\%/96.02 F1 score on two datasets.},

  abstract     = {Virtual reality (VR) is an important landing scenario for 5G and a key enabling technology for the digital economy, and the core challenge it faces is how to ensure real-time interaction and content distribution efficiency. Existing solutions rely on adaptive delivery, overall content edge caching, or asynchronous rendering in the cloud, with drawbacks such as high caching and computing costs and difficulty in ensuring real time. This article is oriented to content generation and synchronization of virtual reality, and aims at realizing intelligent transmission of VR content with high efficiency and low delay guarantee, and carries out research on cloud-edge-end collaborative mechanisms. First, for AI-aided VR content generation, a cloud-edge-end collaborative service architecture is constructed to support independent encoding and distribution of background and interactive content generation. Second, to address the issue that the MEC node with limited cache space cannot meet the dynamical demands of VR user, a cloud-edge collaborative caching strategy based on graph neural networks is proposed to achieve optimal caching and updating of background content, in which the background content is first cached MEC node according to the content request with node sharing scheme, then the content is updated according to a minimal cost update algorithm based on the graph neural networks (GNN)-aided request prediction. Finally, the proposed algorithm is simulated and tested, the simulation results show that the proposed caching and update algorithm achieve better quality of experiment (QoE) and higher cache hit ratio compared with comparison algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Owing to imaging equipment&#39;s environment and limitations, the images obtained in industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs) are degraded and available in various visual appearances. The process of highlighting the hidden contents in night-time contrast-distorted images is complex. Earlier approaches have solved this problem from a different perspective and achieved remarkable results that are generally unsatisfactory for images with diverse illumination distortions in ICPSs. Hence, an effective visibility enhancement model is proposed to eliminate inconsistent color casts while highlighting more hidden content for improved inspection, safety in large spaces, and monitoring of large systems. Our proposed model has four steps: 1) removal of the unnatural color cast via a white balance technique, 2) use of probability density and softplus functions to process the images with the actual color cast, 3) using an optimization algorithm to estimate the illumination and adjusting it using a nonlinear function, and 4) blending by multiscale fusion to obtain the most effective visual result. Evaluation of ten benchmark datasets using 14 quality metrics for 22 conventional and modern algorithms shows that our approach is robust, flexible, and applicable to numerous vision-based applications, such as ICPSs, autonomous vehicles, smart cameras, smart mobility, and transportation, especially in low-light environments.},

This work focuses on the real-world implementation of ITCPS, in which structure and elements in combination with advanced image processing methods increase safety and fluidity of road traffic at crossroads and railway crossings. In this work, we present a novel system called Artificial Intelligence-based Detection System for Road Security (ADEROS), which combines elements of CPS systems, object detection, and classification, computer vision (CV) which analyzes vehicle trajectory tracking, vehicle and pedestrian presence, light signaling systems, railway barriers at railway crossings, and railway warnings. The presented system is based on a camera module that is suitably positioned to capture the entire scene. The module uses graphics processing units (GPU) for accelerated image processing techniques and the YOLOv4 deep neural network model to detect traffic participants and then dangerous situations in various crossroads and railway crossings. Our improved unique detector can distinguish between individual types of road users and the status of several safety devices at crossroads and railway crossings (for example, the state of traffic lights (TL) or rail barriers). Furthermore, we present experimental implementation details of the ADEROS system, which includes a central server web interface for live traffic situation monitoring, various communication channels for the camera module, and a central server based on.NET core, Cassandra DB, and different security protocols. All data from risky situations are evaluated and transferred to the central server securely without human intervention. The central server aggregates and archives all risky situational data from connected cameras. Finally, we present our experimental results from a real-world pilot project that consists of a camera module prototype deployed in a real crossroad and an operational central web server.},

The generation costs associated with the distributed energy resources are optimized globally by observer-based controllers in a multilayered hierarchical control structure, equipped with privacy-preserving feature. Self-rearranging and event-based reconfiguration of graphs are also incorporated for obtaining feasible solution to the economic dispatch problem. This is an important aspect of the proposed work as, unlike previously reported research works, it equally prioritizes both voltage regulation and optimal operation. Moreover, continuity of supply to critical loads is a challenging criterion in autonomous systems in which the pinning or leader node plays a pivotal role. Therefore, the multifold benefits of choosing the highest generation unit as the leader in improving the power quality is highlighted for the first time, which remained undiscovered in previous works in literature. The feasibility of the proposed scheme is tested by time-domain simulations in MATLAB/Simulink. Moreover, the results obtained from the controller hardware in loop environment using a real-time digital simulator and field-programmable-gate-array-based WAVECT controller demonstrate the economical operation of the clusters with renewable energy sources.},

The specific problem of RISs&#39; orchestration and configuration is treated via the adoption of game theory and reinforcement learning (RL). Initially, a satisfaction game is formulated and solved among the targets, enabling them to autonomously determine the optimal number of RISs that will contribute to their PNT service, while the specific set of RISs to be used is determined by a novel RL algorithm. In order to further maximize the received signal strength at each target of the reflected signals from the specific set of RISs, the phase-shift optimization of the latter is performed. Based on the above, an iterative least squares algorithm is adopted, following the multilateration technique, in order for each target to estimate its position and timing. The performance evaluation of the proposed approach is achieved via modeling and simulation.},

However, edge servers cannot respond quickly to massive computing requests due to limited computing power, which may lead to long queuing delays, thus failing to meet low latency requirements of delay-sensitive Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Furthermore, the per-computing-unit energy consumption in edge computing is much higher than that in cloud computing. This article studies the edge–cloud collaborative computing for energy efficiency while meeting the delay requirements of IoT applications in mobile edge computing systems. We formulate the energy efficient computation offloading problem for mixed tasks, including divisible and indivisible tasks. We theoretically analyze the relationship between delay guarantee and energy consumption in edge–cloud collaborative environment. We further analyze the system stability based on Lyapunov stability theory. Then, an energy efficient and delay guaranteed edge–cloud collaborative computation offloading algorithm is proposed to provide delay guarantee for delay-sensitive IoT applications while minimizing the energy consumption of the edge–cloud computing system. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that, compared with the benchmark algorithms, our algorithm can provide strict delay guarantee for stringent-delay-sensitive IoT applications, and low delay for soft-delay-sensitive IoT applications, while consuming lower energy.},

The proposed controller addresses customer voltage violations, comfort constraints, and energy savings. The DR controller attempts to control the TCLs by relying on voltage and voltage-to-load sensitivity. By deploying an artificial-neural-network-based model, the proposed control scheme ensures that the SH loads connected at spatially distributed nodes in the power system participate fairly to mitigate the residential grid voltage violations. Simulation results verify the proposed controller&#39;s performance to revamp the system voltage profiles while maintaining the desired comfort of end users.

Vehicular fog computing (VFC) is a cost-efficient deployment option that complements stationary fog nodes with mobile ones carried by moving vehicles. To plan the deployment and manage the VFC resources in the real world, it is essential to consider the spatiotemporal variations in both demand and supply of fog computing capacity and the tradeoffs between achievable quality-of-services and potential deployment and operating costs. The existing edge/fog computing simulators, such as IFogSim, IoTSim, and EdgeCloudSim, cannot provide a realistic technoeconomic investigation to analyze the implications of VFC deployment options due to the simplified network models in use, the lack of support for fog node mobility, and limited testing scenarios. In this article, we propose an open-source simulator VFogSim that allows real-world data as input for simulating the supply and demand of VFC in urban areas. It follows a modular design to evaluate the performance and cost efficiency of deployment scenarios under various vehicular traffic models, and the effectiveness of the diverse network and computation schedulers and prioritization mechanisms under user-defined scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, our platform is the first one that supports the mobility of fog nodes and provides realistic modeling of vehicle-to-everything in 5G and beyond networks in the urban environment.

Under the requirement of MCS security, privacy-preserving truth discovery (PPTD) causes wide concern, which refers to discovering truthful information from these unreliable uploaded data while protecting users&#39; private information. Although many PPTD mechanisms have been proposed, they can either not guarantee low communication from users to the cloud, or fail to realize fully strong privacy protect including sensing data privacy, weight privacy, intermediate privacy, and estimated truth privacy. This study designs a collaborative cloud encryption architecture. In this framework, we propose a new system architecture that adapts a two-cloud peer model while leveraging garbled circuit (GC). Users only need to transfer data to two clouds once, which realizes low users workloads while supporting dynamic users. The two cloud terminals cooperate to complete the weight update through the GC but execute the truth discovery algorithm, respectively. In this way, the noninteractive comes true and the users&#39; workloads are transferred to the cloud server side. The weight update finish and weight privacy are fulfilled through GC, meanwhile the other intermediate values maintain strong privacy. At the same time, because the collaborative cloud architecture of the two clouds ensures the confidentiality of the truth value in the cloud and the homomorphism at the inquiry side, it ensures the strong privacy of the whole process from users to inquiries. The performance of this proposed method is verified through extensive evaluations.},

  abstract     = {Due to the limited computing power and energy resources of lightweight mobile user devices, offloading their tasks to fog nodes is a promising solution. Partial offloading is a more efficient way to allocate and use the whole system&#39;s resources than binary offloading. In this article, three algorithms are proposed to address the three issues of partial offloading in fog computing. Different from the strategy of minimizing task delay or minimizing power consumption adopted in the existing works of literature, the first algorithm considers both of these two strategies concurrently. The second is proposed to maximize task admission under the constraints of the user device power and system resource. The third is proposed to expand the system resource with the least cost to improve the admission when the system resource is insufficient. The above three are non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard problems, which will be solved by adopting the strategy of rounding algorithm in this article. Through theoretical analysis, a small gap exists between the solved solution and the optimal one of the problem. Additionally, a large number of simulations will be carried out to verify that their performance is better than that of the recent related works and close to the best performance.},

After analysis, we find that the constraint has implicit monotonicity, so we introduce a new vector to transform it into a monotonic optimization problem. Then, the equivalence of the problem before and after transformation is proved. To search global optimal energy conservation solution, we design a novel power allocation algorithm based on principle of reverse polyblock approximation and prove its convergence. It is demonstrated that our proposal is able to reduce power consumption in comparison to the most advanced alternatives.

Moreover, the ground-based 5G system cannot provide seamless service especially for hotspot and remote area. In order to deal with the mentioned issues, we first propose an air ground integrated heterogeneous networks model, which consists of multiple UAVs and GBSs equipped with edge servers. Then, by jointly taking into account terminal power control, computing resource allocation, and task offloading decision, an energy-minimization issue is formulated, which, however, is a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem due to the tight coupling between optimization variables. Therefore, we decompose it into two subproblems and design a deep actor-critic-based online offloading algorithm to solve the first offloading decision-making issue facing dimensionality curse. For the second power control and computing resource allocation subproblem, a difference-of-convex-based solution is presented. The proposed approach can achieve superior performance in terms of terminal energy consumption and convergence speed with lower complexity compared with other benchmark methods. Specifically, it outperforms DDQN, AC&amp;Greedy, and UCB algorithm by 7.62\%, 17.32\%, and 23.14\%, respectively.},

Aiming for maximizing the average sum secrecy rate (ASSR) of the UAV system, we jointly optimize the transmit precoding (TPC) matrices, IRS phase shift matrices, and UAV trajectory. To deal with the nonconvexity, we break down this problem into three subproblems and solve them using an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Specifically, the semidefinite programming method is used to solve the TPC and phase shift matrices, while the successive convex approximation method is used to obtain the UAV trajectory. In addition, a low complexity mathod on the basis of the Riemannian Manifold Gradient is proposed to solve the IRS phase shift matrix. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the algorithm. Our robust algorithm can improve ASSR by 22\% compared to that without IRS. Furthermore, the nonrobust design without considering HIs will cause a loss of secrecy performance.},

  abstract     = {In the high-voltage direct current transmission system, if converter blocking occurs at the sending-end converter station, a serious power imbalance takes place in the sending-end grid, which causes severe over-frequency and over-voltage problems. To address this issue, a double-layer coordinated optimal control strategy based on model predictive control (MPC) is proposed in this article. By cooperatively regulating the active and reactive power of the wind farm at the sending end, it achieves coordinated frequency and voltage control. On the basis of MPC and moving horizon estimation, the upper-layer controller computes the optimal active and reactive power references of the wind farm. Subsequently, the optimized power references are fed into the lower-layer wind farm local controller for execution. A key feature of this strategy lies in its handling of nonlinear power constraints. Specifically, for a wind farm, coordinated frequency and voltage regulation faces a critical challenge of coupled nonlinear power constraints, which are formed by the coupled relationship between the active and reactive power outputs of the power converters. To overcome this challenge, the double description method is introduced to approximate and linearize the coupled nonlinear power constraints. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

Meanwhile, aiming at the defect of local minima in DWA algorithm, a low-speed steering strategy is presented to help the robot escape the U-shaped trap. Especially, in the case of dynamic obstacle environment, a predictive scheme is carried out for the agents to reach the destination safely by fitting the trajectory of the dynamic obstacles to calculate their possible future positions, and then setting these positions as virtual obstacles.

In contrast to the existing methods, this article proposes a joint clock offset and range estimation with correlated arrival times based on the maximum likelihood estimator. The RN uses the molecules&#39; transmission and correlated arrival times to estimate the clock offset and range between the TN and RN.

First, a node interaction model based on the line outage distribution factors is presented. Then, the model is introduced into the PageRank algorithm to calculate the node importance based on the electrical network topology. Finally, considering the node importance based on both the electrical network topology and the actual power flow distribution by an adaptive coefficient, the critical nodes are identified effectively.

However, indoor positioning presents significant challenges due to multipath interference, which can cause large signal fluctuations and high positioning errors for signal-based approaches. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled researchers to estimate people&#39;s positions and locate them indoors using image recognition technology, but identification of individuals remains challenging. Therefore, we propose a highly accurate indoor positioning approach using Wi-Fi signals and images. This research employs smartphones to measure the signal strength of three Wi-Fi base stations&#39; 2.4 and 5 GHz frequency bands. We then use machine learning techniques to estimate individuals&#39; positions with coarse accuracy. Subsequently, we analyze the positions of individuals in surveillance camera images. We use OpenPose, an open-source multiperson pose estimation system, and propose a foot position extraction algorithm to extract the foot positions of individuals in the image. We obtain the coordinates of the people in the image through direct linear transformation and machine learning. Finally, we match the coordinates obtained from the two techniques to identify the user&#39;s device. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy, with an average error of 0.43 meters.},

  abstract     = {Compared with a single robot, a multirobot system exhibits better performance when dealing with different complex tasks. Recently, the application of multirobot systems to hunt targets has become a research hotspot, but it also faces many challenges such as excessive system communication, poor collaboration performance, and limited practical testing. Based on previous research on gene regulatory networks (GRNs), this study innovatively proposes an adaptive cooperative GRN (AC-GRN) optimized by an elastic deformation algorithm for multirobot hunting. It uses the protein concentration diffusion mechanism to integrate various situational information of the task environment; during the generation and construction of the hunting pattern, it can adaptively measure the weight of information from different sources in the environment to complete the hunting task more efficiently, accurately, and robustly. Finally, we conduct four sets of simulation experiments to validate the feasibility, efficiency, and stability of the proposed AC-GRN model. Simultaneously, the Kilobot robots are used for practical testing, which further proves the advantages and practicality of the model.},

In order to overcome this bottleneck, a novel spectrum sensing approach based on fusion features and online model is developed in this article. In the first step, a 3-D feature extraction method is proposed, which uses the complementarity of signals in time and frequency domains to construct the fusion features. Then the Gaussian mixture model is trained by fusion features. In the second step, in order to improve the sensing performance in time-varying scenarios, an online Gaussian mixture model is proposed, which enhances the spectrum sensing in the time-varying environment.

  abstract     = {This article presents a scalable approach for identifying system inputs and trajectories that lead to undesirable scenarios in a cyber-physical system (CPS). The proposed approach falls under the broad class of falsification methods. The objective in falsification is to find initial conditions and input signals resulting in trajectories that violate a system property expressed as a formal specification. The existing falsification methods are not suitable for handling systems where the input at a specific time depends on the state history of the system. Autonomous vehicle platoons and certain multi-agent systems that are required to maintain connectivity are some examples of such systems. In the first part of this article, we employ a graph-search-based motion planning algorithm to develop a falsification method capable of identifying falsifying inputs for the aforementioned class of systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach through a case study involving a vehicle platoon consisting of three autonomous vehicles, wherein one of the vehicles is tasked to execute a lane-change maneuver. In the second part, we extend the proposed approach to analyze a network of three unmanned underwater vehicles, wherein our objective is to identify system inputs resulting in trajectories that lead to a deadlock. The approach leverages the component-based structure inherent in the considered multi-agent system and employs a surrogate model in place of computationally demanding components present in the system. These modifications are shown to improve the scalability of the approach and reduce the computational time in finding falsifying trajectories.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL), collaboratively training a shared global model without exchanging and centralizing local data, provides a promising solution for privacy preserving. On the other hand, it is faced with two main challenges: First, high communication cost, and second, low model quality due to imbalanced or nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. In this article, we propose FedVAE, an FL framework based on variational autoencoder (VAE) for remote patient monitoring. FedVAE contains two lightweight VAEs: one for projecting data onto a lower dimensional space with similar distribution so as to alleviate the issues of excessive communication overhead and slow convergence rate caused by non-IID data, and the other for shunning training bias due to imbalanced data distribution through generating minority class samples. In general, the proposed FedVAE can improve the overall performance of FL models while consuming only a small amount of communication bandwidth. The experimental results show that the area under the curve (AUC) value of FedVAE can reach 0.9937, which is even higher than that of the traditional centralized model (0.9931). Besides, fine-tuning the global model with personalization can raise the average AUC to 0.9947. Moreover, compared with vanilla FL, FedVAE shows 0.87\% improvement in AUC while reducing communication traffic by at least 95\%.},

In contrast to periodic communication, sampled-data exchanges only occur when the triggering condition is satisfied. Therefore, communication instants and computation burdens will be reduced significantly. Compared with the existing event-triggered mechanism, this article investigates conditions for achieving consensus in the presence of both input saturation and time delay constraints. The Lyapunov synthesis is employed to derive the stability and convergence analysis of the proposed event-triggering condition and ensure the Zeno-free of the system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed controller is validated by simulating its performance under various scenarios in an islanded DC MG using the MATLAB/SimPowerSystems Toolbox.},

  abstract     = {Short-term frequency instability is one of the major concerns in power systems with high percentage of converter-interfaced renewable energy sources. Energy storage system (ESS) has proven to be a viable solution for the problem of short-term frequency instability by fast frequency response (FFR). However, the appropriate location, size, and operating strategy of ESS are the main challenges for FFR. Power injection at some buses in large grids may lead to angular separation and instability. In addition, oversizing ESS could lead to huge investments without appropriate returns and under sizing may jeopardizes grid stability. Capacity estimation of ESS for FFR considering the suitable location and overall deployment strategies are missing in the current literature for large power grids. Hence, this research proposes a technique to place and size ESS for better FFR in power grids. The proposed technique consists of two steps. In the first step, a methodology based on frequency dynamic signature (FDS) is developed to identify the most suitable location. In the second step, the required capacity of the ESS is estimated based on a step reduction iterative algorithm (SRIA). SRIA and FDS consider the complete dynamics of power system components that affect the frequency dynamics of the system. The proposed methodology is thoroughly verified for various operating conditions in IEEE 39-bus using DIgSILENT PowerFactory.},

We first set up an individualized DNN model to differentiate the voice signals of the target user from those of other speakers and environmental noise. The DNN models were trained using the recordings of each user reading a standard passage. These recordings were mixed with 20 types of noise for data augmentation, which were then used to train the individualized DNN model. Nine participants were invited to use the APM system while teaching a class. The study results show that the DNN model achieved over 92\% detection accuracy in the simulated noisy conditions, outperforming the baseline system (genetic algorithm model) in this system. Furthermore, we measured the phonation ratio, volume, and fundamental frequency, and all were compatible with the existing literature.

Despite the capital cost is significantly reduced, the degradation characteristics of retired batteries exhibits two-stage decline characteristics. The proposed framework first establishes the SL-BESSs model and estimates its remaining useful lifetime by identifying the “knee point” in the SL-BESSs capacity degradation curve; based on this, a two-level SL-BESS capacity determination model is formulated, which sizes the SL-BESS based on short-term home energy management under different scenarios. In particular, this article considers the dual-service modes of an SL-BESS in its capacity determination process: first, provide local energy supply to the household, and second, provide cloud energy storage service to external users.

Therefore, accurate estimation of the battery state of health (SOH) is essential for optimal planning of battery storage systems (BSS) in microgrids. Battery SOH is defined as the ratio between the battery capacity at a specific charge/discharge cycle and its initial rated capacity. To this end, this article proposes a novel comprehensive two-stage approach for optimal planning of BSS in a microgrid. In Stage I, the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimization problem is formulated to determine the battery&#39;s optimal size and degradation factor, which determines the battery capacity degradation per charging/discharging cycle. The novel degradation factor is developed to keep track of the battery capacity degradation over time and to swap the battery before the end of its lifecycle. In Stage II, the MILP management problem is formulated for optimal scheduling and swapping of the BSS during cycle life aging considering battery salvage value. The microgrid is assumed to have two BSS, one is lead-acid and the second is lithium-ion. The proposed approach is implemented for both islanded mode and grid-connected mode of microgrid operation. Simulation results have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Low latency, high reliability, and high data rate are three performance indicators of Ultra-reliable and low latency communication (URLLC) systems, but they are not able to be met simultaneously. Based on the determined latency and reliability requirements, this paper investigates the problem of the weighted sum rate (WSR) in cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system with multiple access points (APs). User-centric access point selection is considered to further reduce the computational complexity for AP used with acceptable performance loss. The transmitting beamforming is designed to mitigate inter-user interference so as to maximize the WSR under the backhaul and transmitting power constraints. Since the proposed problem is non-convex, two algorithms are proposed to solve the problem under the general SINR regime and the high SINR regime, respectively. For the former, we first approximate the objective function with the difference of convex (DC) programming and reformulate the problem into a semi-definite relaxation (SDR) form. Afterward, auxiliary variables are introduced in accordance with the successive convex approximation (SCA) method to further transform the nonconvex problem into a convex one. In the end, the sub-optimal WSR is obtained by iteratively solving a final convex problem. For the latter, the well-known WMMSE method is applied to address the WSR problem. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithm, e.g., the maximum performance gain of the proposed algorithm is about 25\% compared to the classical MMSE method. And the user-centric approach achieves 8 times computational complexity reduction with 4\% performance loss.},

The UAV acts as a moving RIS in the sky, which provides additional links to enhance the performance of the AF relay-based cooperation on the ground. Aiming to maximize the AAR of the proposed scheme, we jointly optimize the trajectory of UAV and the phase shift matrices of RIS over total time frames. At first, we decompose the original intractable problem into two subproblems of the phase shift matrices optimization and trajectory optimization. Subsequently, the optimal phase shift matrices are achieved by aligning the phases of received signals. Since the trajectory optimization subproblem is still complicated and nonconvex, we apply the successive convex approximation (SCA) method to reformulate it into a convex problem and further solve it by iterative method. Simulation results demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed scheme as compared with the benchmark schemes and also reveal the effects of various factors on its performance.},

  abstract     = {Similar to the dilemma encountered by terrestrial wireless networks, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks are also facing the problem of increasing pressure caused by the growth of wireless traffic. Wireless multicast technology is an effective technique on improving the spectrum efficiency by sending the same signal to multiple users who request the same service. In this article, the LEO satellite transmission system is considered and a maximum system capacity problem is formulated. To solve the original nonconvex problem efficiently, a joint user grouping and resource allocation scheme is proposed. There are two parts in the scheme: on the one hand, we propose an improved K-means++ algorithm for user grouping; on the other hand, we proposed a joint power and bandwidth allocation algorithm using the two stage iteration method. Compared with the baseline approach, our proposed scheme can improve the capacity 10\% higher at least.},

  abstract     = {This article studies a novel fixed-time consensus tracking strategy for a multimotor system (MMS) with input saturation, suitable for most practical applications requiring stringent convergence time but with limited control input capability. First, a modified practical fixed-time stable theorem is proposed to guarantee that the actual system can reach a certain control precision in a fixed time, regardless of the initial states of the system. Then, an input saturation compensation system is also constructed to compensate for the input saturation to ensure fast convergence of the controller. Next, we propose a new distributed fixed-time consensus control algorithm for the MMS, which can render the time costs in both the reaching and sliding phases fixed. Inspired by the L&#39;Hopital&#39;s rule, a hyperbolic tangent function is used to avoid the singularity of the controller. Besides, an experimental platform for verifying the algorithm is established. Finally, both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategy.},

By addressing the delay concern, a platoon control approach is proposed to achieve plant stability and string stability. The effects of the time headway, communication, and edge computing delays on the stability are quantified. The velocity and size of the stable platoon are calculated, which show the impacts of the radio parameters such as massive multiple-input–multiple-output antennas and frequency band on the platoon configuration. The handover performance between RSUs in the V2I-based platooning system is quantified by considering the effects of the RSU&#39;s coverage and platoon size, which demonstrates that the velocity of a stable platoon should be appropriately chosen, in order to meet the V2I&#39;s quality-of-service and handover constraints.},

As the key to achieving accurate load margin estimation using the LightGBM algorithm under operation variations, the weight parameters of the pre-trained model are updated online by IL technique through efficiently digesting synchrophasor measurements. The proposed method makes full use of the capability of LightGBM to handle massive measurements, while effectively improving the adaptability to large-scale operational variability. Case studies to evaluate the proposed approach are presented through the numerical simulations of the IEEE 39-bus test system and a larger IEEE 145-bus power system, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.},

Two scenarios are considered: the observer&#39;s switching signal is synchronous with the system&#39;s switching signal, and the switching signals among them are asynchronous, and frequent switching is allowed during interevent intervals. Average dwell time and linear matrix inequalities techniques are employed to guarantee the global uniform exponential convergence of the proposed observer.

Multidimensional data aggregation schemes are used to aggregate users’ electricity consumption data, which enable the control center to better develop demand response strategies, but cannot provide billing service because the aggregated data cannot correspond to individuals. Aiming at the problem that existing multidimensional data aggregation schemes usually cannot achieve both billing and fault tolerance, a multidimensional data aggregation scheme of SH in microgrid with fault tolerance and billing for demand response is proposed. First, a multidimensional data aggregation algorithm based on Elliptic Curve-ElGamal is designed, which can ensure the accuracy of aggregation results for any number of faulty smart meters. Second, a privacy-protected billing mechanism is designed through anonymous user identities, which can resist collusion attacks initiated by any two participants in the system. Finally, a batch anonymous authentication method is designed to improve the efficiency of the scheme. Theoretical analysis proves that the scheme can guarantee users’ privacy and security, and experiments show that the scheme has lower computation and communication costs.},

However, the cost of cloud-assisted health systems is skyrocketing. How to improve storage utilization and save resource cost for health systems has become urgent problems. Therefore, this study proposes a secure lossless redundancy elimination scheme with semantic awareness, called SLRE, to decrease storage overhead and improve the overall system performance. Compared with existing studies, when the locality of data is almost nonexistent or poor, SLRE can eliminate redundant data well by exploiting semantic properties of similarity and entropy rather than relying on the locality. Then, fine-grained post-deduplication delta compression based on proxy similarity discovers more similar blocks and improves storage efficiency. In addition, filtered Lempel–Ziv compression based on proxy entropy filters data with low redundancy to improve the overall performance. Importantly, in order to ensure the security of medical data after deredundancy, different auditing strategies for medical data with diverse characteristics are proposed to guarantee security and improve the auditing efficiency. The experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the overall compression ratio of SLRE is improved, and the system throughput and auditing efficiency are also improved.},

However, modernization of the power grid has an unintended consequence of increased vulnerability to cyber-attacks. Among the emerging cyber threats, in this article we focus on false data injection attacks against generators in IEC 61850 compliant systems since this subject is not yet intensively studied in literature. We conduct the study on attack vectors against automated control logic for parallel generators and their feasibility, and conduct simulation experiments to demonstrate the attack impact. Based on the identified attack vectors, we further propose an efficient message authentication scheme. We investigate real-world control logic taken from the state-of-the-art smart grid test-bed for enumerating attack vectors. We further create virtual test-bed that is fully compliant to IEC 61850 standards for simulation study. The proposed message authentication schemes are implemented and intensively evaluated to demonstrate advantages over the other schemes. While effectively countering the identified attack vectors, the proposed message authentication scheme improves the latency by 16\% compared to the scheme recommended in IEC 62351 standards.},

Compared with traditional machine learning with privacy leakage problems and the cloud model trained through federated learning (FL) fails in personalization, the FedPos framework aggregates nonclassification layer parameters of models trained from different environments to build a robust and versatile encoder on the cloud server while preserving user privacy. The global cloud encoder can aggregate different classifiers and then construct personalized models for new users through fine-tuning. The proposed framework can be updated incrementally and is highly extensible. Specifically, we exploit channel state information (CSI) as the positioning feature and assess the transferability of a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) in unfamiliar environments. We evaluate the performance of our proposed framework and position estimation method in different indoor environments. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed framework can achieve a mean localization error of 42.18 cm in a 64-position living room. They also confirm that FedPos can achieve a 5.22\% average localization performance boost and reduce the average model training time by about 34.78\% when compared with normal training. By reusing part of the feature extractor layers that are trained from other environments, at least 65\% of training data can be saved to achieve a localization performance that is similar to the base model. Overall, the proposed position estimation method can effectively improve localization accuracy as compared with seven other existing CSI-based methods.},

  abstract     = {The optimization of systemic redundancy by minimizing the sensor quantity can improve the efficiency of sensor networks and save costs. However, from the perspective of risk management, this redundancy reduction can also bring a significant loss in the overall network resilience because the less the systemic redundancy is, the fewer backup components in the network when shocks hit and, therefore, the less overall resilience. In this article, we investigate this intractable dilemma and attempt to pinpoint the tradeoff point for a city-scale automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system in Cambridge, U.K. By developing a two-stage graph deep learning model, we first optimize the layout of the ANPR system to reduce redundancy and find its efficiency profile. Next, we study what effects this redundancy reduction can bring to the overall resilience, as the overall observability drops with the reduction in the number of sensors and find an optimal balance. The results show that our approach can effectively optimize the system&#39;s redundancy by using only 47\% of the original sensors to reconstruct the full picture with a mean absolute error of only 11.18 and a root mean square error of 19.49; most importantly, the overall system resilience is maintained at 70\% in the meantime. This article provides an alternative perspective for dealing with the well-known “efficiency-resilience” dilemma and offers new evidence to enable better decision and policy making for city managers and planners in local authorities.},

  abstract     = {Global positioning system (GPS) plays an important role in the path planning of unmanned surface ships. As we know, the civil GPS signal is not encrypted, and its structure is open. Meanwhile, the power strength of GPS signals arriving at receivers is weak. All of these make GPS vulnerable to jamming. GPS jamming attacks adversely affect the accuracy of the received GPS signals, thus affecting the path planning results of unmanned surface ships and even causing collisions. This article presents a jamming aware artificial potential field (JA-APF) method. The JA-APF method first determines whether GPS jamming exists in unmanned surface ships&#39; surrounding environment by detecting the receivers&#39; received signal strength and calculating the packet error rate. Then, the JA-APF method calculates the position range of the jamming source. Finally, the JA-APF method replans the path according to the resultant force of the attraction around the goal, the repulsion around obstacles, and the repulsion around multiple GPS jammers. Through the simulation, we determine the value of the repulsive potential factor of the jammer to optimize the path planning results of the JA-APF method and analyze the influence of the jamming power on the path planning results. The simulation results show that the JA-APF method can effectively solve the impact of GPS jamming on the results in the path planning process and recover as soon as possible.},

The base station communicates directly and via a relay with the two NOMA users in two-time phases. In particular, the selective DF with synchronized direct and relay transmission relaying protocol is proposed for the considered downlink NOMA system to offer enhanced quality of service and improved data reliability compared with the conventional NOMA and DF NOMA systems. The closed-form of exact and asymptotic expressions of the average bit error rate (ABER) at both NOMA users are derived considering the impact of imperfect SIC and CEE. Furthermore, the outage probability is also obtained. Finally, the improvement in the system performance acquired by the proposed scheme over the existing methods is corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations.},

This article deals with the optimal energy management of microgrid comprising RERs and battery energy storage system. In addition to considering power flow constraints and uncertainties of RERs, the importance of retaining profits of microgrid operators and the needs for providing extra supports to the main grid are rising. To meet all the requirements, a novel Lagrange multipliers-based method is proposed to deal with equality and inequality constraints simultaneously to directly obtain the optimal economic dispatch solution analytically. Moreover, a microgrid built in Cimei Island of Penghu Archipelago, Taiwan, is investigated to examine the compliance with the requirements of equality and inequality constraints and the performance of the Lagrange multipliers-based method. Furthermore, the comparison of the proposed method with experience-based energy management system, Newton-particle swarm optimization, and deep Q-learning network is provided to evaluate the obtained solutions. Finally, through the hardware in the loop mechanism, which is built using OPAL-RT real-time simulator with floating-point digital signal processor, the effectiveness of proposed Lagrange multipliers-based method is verified and proven to be pragmatic.},

  abstract     = {Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a promising application of Internet of Things (IoT) in the industrial sector, which greatly improves the manufacturing efficiency and enables the intelligent production. Nowadays, cloud computing has been introduced to handle the data management problem in IIoT. Nevertheless, how to retrieve ciphertext data remains a challenging problem. Recently, certificateless searchable encryption (CLSE) was proposed to tackle with this problem. CLSE allows the receiver to search the ciphertext data directly, meanwhile it protects the data privacy. However, existing CLSE schemes do not achieve the trapdoor unlinkability since deterministic algorithms are used to generate the trapdoors. Additionally, they cannot support multiple keywords search in one-time test operation. To address these issues, we propose a certificateless searchable encryption scheme with trapdoor unlinkability (CLSETU) for IIoT. We then demonstrate the semantic security of our scheme against insider keyword guessing attacks (KGA). Finally, the performance evaluation shows its feasibility in the deployment of IIoT.},

It is of great military value to study the disintegration of the operational capability of HCNs for operational mission planning and improving the survivability of operational networks. Heterogeneous networks can effectively fuse more information than homogeneous networks can. The function implementation of heterogeneous networks is also more complex. Finding the key nodes and obtaining an efficient attack sequence is our focus. Most current research on network disintegration has difficulty achieving efficiency and timeliness. In this article, we specifically propose searching heterogeneous combat network attack sequences through network embedding and reinforcement learning (SHATTER) model, which uses the induction algorithm combined with the graph neural network and reinforcement learning to solve the network disintegration sequence problem. Through experiments with synthetic heterogeneous network datasets and real heterogeneous networks, we determined that SHATTER significantly outperformed existing technologies.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and timely prediction about the current and near-term future traffic conditions is one of the effective ways to relieve traffic congestion and improve the operation efficiency of road networks. However, the missing data problem is inevitable when collecting real-time traffic flow information due to lossy communication and detector malfunction, which significantly affects the accuracy of prediction. To address this problem, in this article, we propose an approach to exploit online traffic prediction considering missing data effects. Unlike most existing methods imputing all the missing data before traffic prediction, the proposed strategy takes the spatio-temporal relationships between missing data and observed data into account to optimize data imputation patterns, thereby improving the efficiency of online traffic prediction. Specifically, we first propose an analytical framework for online traffic prediction with missing data by extending the space-time autoregressive integrated moving average model to incorporate missing data effects. Then, based on the combined use of optimal cut and data imputation optimization, a graph-theoretic technique is presented to determine the imputed data with consideration of road network topology and missing data pattern. Finally, experiments are conducted based on two real-world datasets. Experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed approach in accuracy and efficiency compared with existing strategies of traffic flow prediction with missing data, particularly under the circumstance of high data missing ratios in urban road networks.},

  abstract     = {The high penetration of distributed energy resources and heavy flexible loads, such as electric vehicles, has changed the operating conditions of the distribution network. In particular, the adoption of green energy innovations has caused an increase in electricity consumption. Such an increase can result in thermal overloading due to power flow exceeding a network asset&#39;s transfer capability, possibly damaging devices such as distribution transformers and feeders. It is very challenging to design a congestion management scheme given the uncertainty of flexible loads consumption and electricity prices. Obtaining stochastic models for such loads may not be easily available in practice. In this article, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) reinforcement learning (RL) scheme is proposed to alleviate congestion. DDPG RL is a model free technique that does not require explicit probabilistic models of the controllable loads to determine the change in electricity prices needed, in the form of tariffs and/or subsidies. The DDPG RL technique is compared with the existing model-based congestion management scheme using an IEEE 33 bus system and the results obtained demonstrate the out performance of the proposed technique in terms of the electricity cost and peak-to-average ratio of the load profiles.},

This article proposes a federal learning-based authentication method with radio-frequency fingerprinting recognition under a distributed architecture, which is novel and different from the previous works since these works primarily focus on the network with a centralized node. We propose a distributed optimization problem in a hybrid local and edge computing scenario to minimize the network delay.

During operation, this strategy neither relies on the microgrid system model nor imposes any computational burden. First, this article introduces the microgrid hierarchical control structure and establishes a system model for primary control. Then, the proposed ILC-based secondary control strategy is elaborated, and the corresponding stability criterion is derived using the small-signal analysis method. Finally, the simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ILC-based strategy. Specifically, the proposed strategy can limit the transient time within 0.4 s when handling various disturbances, which is comparable to the existing strategies based on MPC and SMC. However, the proposed strategy is easier to implement compared with the MPC-based and SMC-based strategies, which rely on the system model. Furthermore, in plug-and-play and load change scenarios, the proposed control strategy can suppress voltage fluctuation within 1 V, which is better than existing strategies.},

In contrast to existing results, the problems are investigated from the perspective of aggregative games (AGs). An interesting discovery is that the desired formation can be constituted by the Nash equilibrium of a quadratic AG. To realize the desired formation for QUAVs, we design two distributed game-based formation algorithms. With the developed algorithms, the QUAVs do not need to measure the (relative) positions and (relative) velocities of neighboring QUAVs, which differs from existing algorithms. By constructing suitable Lyapunov functions, we rigorously analyze the two formation algorithms. The first formation algorithm converges exponentially to the desired formation for the QUAVs without parameter uncertainties. The other algorithm converges asymptotically to the desired formation, even if the QUAVs contain uncertain parameters. Finally, we provide illustrative examples.},

Since the strategy of each microgrid affects others’ costs through total generation cost, such interaction among microgrids is modeled as a noncooperative game. To reduce unnecessary signal transmission among the aggregators, an adaptive algorithm, where threshold parameters are adjusted based on the behavior of the estimated signals in the last two iterations, is proposed. It is observed that when false data is injected into an agent, its estimated signals begin to diverge from the equilibrium point, and as a result, the threshold value becomes increasing. Furthermore, the misbehaving agents are identified and isolated using a reputation-based mechanism and are allowed to rejoin the network when they behave normally again. To deal with arbitrary behavior of users, receding horizon scheme of predictive control is used. Finally, a set of simulation results is presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the suggested algorithm.},

  abstract     = {As modern distributed generators (DGs) always involve heterogeneous and unknown disturbances, a lack of accurate knowledge about the entire microgrid (MG) dynamics arises. Hence, an appropriate secondary control strategy is helpful to improve the voltage regulation process in an uncertain and unknown environment. To this aim, in this article, we suggest a novel distributed adaptive proportional–integral–derivative (PID)-like controller able to counteract unknown uncertainties arising from external disturbances and parameter mismatches, as well as unavoidable deviations induced by primary droop control while recovering the desired voltage reference value. By leveraging Lyapunov theory, an adaptive mechanism is provided to adjust control parameters for dealing with different operating conditions. The stability of the entire MG, analytically derived by also exploiting the Barbalat lemma, proves that all DGs within the electrical grid track the reference signal despite the presence of unknown uncertainties, with bounded adaptive control gains in steady-state phases. A detailed simulation analysis confirms the theoretical derivation and the effectiveness of the proposed controller in ensuring the voltage restoration in different troublesome scenarios, where both reference/loads variations and plug-and-play phenomena occur.},

A service function chain (SFC), which can deploy virtualized network functions (VNFs) and chain them with associated flows allocation, can be used to represent each network service owing to the introduction of the SDN/NFV technology. Co-hosted applications on multiple Internet of Things terminals have dynamic and time-varying service requirements, in order to allocate network resources optimally and meet the end-to-end delay requirements of services, sufficient strategies are required to satisfy the continuously changing service demands. In this article, a deep learning model that combines the multitask regression layer above the graph neural networks is first presented to predict the future resource requirements of each VNF instance. The SFC deployment problem is then solved using the integer nonlinear programming (INLP) approach, and a novel prediction-assisted Viterbi algorithm is presented to overcome the scalability problem of the INLP approach. According to the simulation findings, the proposed deep model provides a minimum of a 6.2\% improvement in prediction accuracy over baseline prediction models, and the proposed SFC deployment strategy has been demonstrated to deliver better performance in terms of acceptance ratio and revenue, compared to the current passive deployment algorithms.},

The resulting DeepGraphONet can then predict the dynamics within a given short/medium-term time horizon by observing a finite history of the graph state information. Furthermore, we design our DeepGraphONet to be resolution independent. That is, we do not require the finite history to be collected at the exact/same resolution. In addition, to disseminate the results from a trained DeepGraphONet, we design a zero-shot learning strategy that enables using it on a different subgraph. Finally, empirical results on the transient stability prediction problem of power grids and traffic flow forecasting problem of a vehicular system illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed DeepGraphONet.},

However, a huge amount of generated medical data causes great trouble to IoMT devices, owing to their power-constrained and computation-limited features. On the other hand, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can achieve a seamless wireless connection to IoMT devices. In this article, we leverage UAVs as the aerial fog nodes to provide computational resources to the IoMT devices. We aim to minimize the number of UAVs for covering the IoMT devices on the ground. This problem is modeled as a discrete nonlinear combinatory optimization problem with NP-hardness. A particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based strategy is put forward to solve this problem. In particular, we introduce greedy heuristic to speed up the searching process. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms GASM_a and GASM_b can achieve better performance compared to the greedy and random approaches in terms of optimal values. In addition, the enhanced algorithm GASM_b can obtain the better result than GASM_a. Meanwhile, the execution time is also averagely increased by 16.51\% compared to GASM_a. Increasingly, low hardware prices enable large-scale deployment of UAVs for IoMT in healthcare systems. Our study shows the advantages in wireless coverage for ground patients by UAVs in terms of efficiency, and cost that will contribute to the development of UAV assisted healthcare systems.},

Control centers try to optimally operate the system with the lowest probability of instability after a line outage contingency. Hence, this article proposes a novel framework to evaluate the PTC from the viewpoint of SSS, and for the violated cases, proper actions for power transfer reduction (PTR) are applied. The proposed methodology is based on a SSS optimal power flow problem. First, the proposed method identifies the stressful line by developing a novel index. Then, different dynamic parameters, which can be calculated quickly and reliably are introduced to evaluate the PTC of stressful line from the SSS viewpoint. Afterward, appropriate actions are enabled for the violated scenarios. These actions include generator redispatching and load shedding, which are exploited based on sensitivity analysis. The proposed framework not only can modify the power transfer of the understudy line, but also considers PTC constraints of other lines. The suggested scheme is evaluated on both IEEE 39 bus and 118 bus test systems. The obtained results confirm that the proposed scheme superiorly evaluates PTC and enhances SSS by applying the PTR action to preserve system security.},

  abstract     = {Asymmetric phase distributed generation, which is widely used in distribution systems, aggravates the severity of the intrinsic three-phase unbalanced condition of distribution systems. To overcome these problems, operation optimization formulas of the three-phase unbalanced active distribution network (ADN) are established considering soft open point (SOP) and belong to a nonconvex quadratic programming (NQP) problem. However, in conventional methods, either approximations that are not valid for an unbalanced distribution system are used or convex relaxation methods are applied to primitive nonlinear optimization models. However, these methods do not guarantee a feasible optimization solution. Therefore, determining the solution to the NQP problem is challenging. In this article, we propose a parametric linear relaxation algorithm to obtain the optimal feasible solution by solving the operation optimization problem of the three-phase unbalanced ADN with the SOP. The parametric linear relaxation technique is constructed based on the properties of quadratic functions and the mean value theorem, and the NQP is converted to a series of parametric linear relaxation programming problems. The results revealed that the proposed algorithm can achieve the optimal and feasible solution and considerably reduce the computation time compared with an equivalent NLP optimization model for the same distribution system.},

First, a novel access point (AP)–user equipment (UE) association scheme is proposed, which ensures both scalability and association for all the UEs in a CF mMIMO system. After that, a pilot assignment scheme is also proposed which has an iterative structure that utilizes the auction algorithm to solve symmetrical assignment problems for pilot allocation. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed AP–UE association scheme compared to the existing AP preference-based association scheme. Moreover, the proposed pilot assignment scheme provides up to 30\% average SE performance and up to 50\% reduction in the average interference to signal power ratio (ISR) over that of several competing alternatives. Numerical simulated results further reveal that the proposed pilot assignment scheme improves the average SE and ISR reduction performance regardless of the number of UEs, APs, and pilot sequences in the system. Finally, the proposed pilot assignment scheme manifests the best balance in the tradeoff among the considered performance criteria relative to its comparatives.},

In this article, we propose the concept of “operational motif,” a subgraph pattern composed of multiple connected equipment nodes in combat networks. On this basis, we propose a higher-order functional structure analysis framework for heterogeneous combat networks based on operational motif spectral clustering. It identifies higher-order functional clusters based on multiple operational motifs. Also, it can subdivide functional clusters into subclusters of specified size based on the different granularity requirements of decision makers. Experiments show that the framework is effective and efficient in finding higher-order functional clusters in large-scale combat networks.

Through planning charging path and designing data transmission policy, the proposed algorithm prolongs the network lifetime while guarantees the quality of service of heterogeneous traffics. As the differences in moving speed, charging rate, and the amount of responsible data, there is some spare time of the MV or the UAV in a cycle and a global charging. A collecting algorithm is proposed to further charge and collect data from the cluster out of the original path.

Each department sends data to the cloud and entrusts it to a third-party verifier (TPV) to conduct integrity checks on data. In 2018, He et al. put forward a certificateless provable data possession (CL-PDP) scheme for CB-SGMS and professed that their scheme is secure. Unfortunately, we pointed out that there are security flaws in the scheme by showing two concrete attacks. We then came up with an improved scheme to make up for the security flaws. We presented the security requirements and gave the security proofs based on the discrete logarithm problem. In the end, we execute a comparison on performance for the improved scheme and the other five schemes. The results show that the improved scheme is more secure and efficient than other ones, which makes it suitable for CB-SGMS.},

The time-varying topology is state-dependent as the relative distance between the agents changes during the movement. Therefore, the initial connectivity cannot be guaranteed throughout the evolution and the dynamical characteristics of MELSs is more complex which make the consensus problem more challenging. In addition, some of the followers are not within the leader&#39;s communication range. Firstly, to estimate the leader&#39;s velocity, we design a distributed observer.

We propose SoLiCiT, a wireless networking protocol that employs concurrent transmissions with specifically designed erasure coding to meet these demands without the need for retransmissions. Synchronous transmissions help to realize a simple protocol design while using helper nodes to transmit redundancy allows for lost packets to be recovered within fixed and tight latency bounds. We provide a range of coding solutions that can be tailored to the application and also present a case study with a battery storage management application in which battery cells report their status to a central management unit. Using a realistic ray tracing model of the actual battery storage container, we evaluate the radio environment and show the efficacy of SoLiCiT compared to benchmarking schemes, such as a low-power wireless bus.},

At first, we propose a secure HBF framework based on generalized eigenvalue decomposition and singular value decomposition. After that, considering the difficulty in directly solving the HBF optimization problem, an iterative algorithm based on successive convex approximation is developed for perfectly known channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, while CSI is imperfect, a neural network is constructed and trained to learn the statistical characteristics of wireless channels and complete the design of hybrid beamformer and combiner simultaneously. Performance validation and beampattern of the proposed HBF methods are given by extensive simulation results, which demonstrate the proposed secure HBF framework could considerably improve secrecy rate, and the deep learning-based HBF method possesses a positive average secrecy rate even with unknown eavesdropper&#39;s CSI.},

Meanwhile, the physical limitations of each joint are viewed as constraints. Second, this preliminary optimization equation is transformed into a constrained convex quadratic programming problem so that various solvers can solve the optimization equation and guarantee the optimality of the solution. Finally, we generalize the optimization strategy to dual-arm robots by solving the optimization equations of the two robotic arms in a unified framework.

Additionally, there is a deficiency of algorithms that can leverage the grid monitoring data, even if limited, to present a sufficiently useful overview of unbalance propagation which can lead to appropriate corrective measures. This article presents: a new unbalance index derived from feeder active power measurements, an algorithm for localization of unbalanced contributions, and an algorithm for root cause analysis that can distinguish whether the unbalance problem is loading, asymmetry, and/ or fault-oriented. The end goals of this work are twofold: to present a holistic view of the grid unbalanced situation using EN50160 type monitoring, and to assist the distribution system operators in unbalance reduction. The usability of the proposed algorithms and indices is shown using a hybrid European MV-LV model simulated in OpenDSS and on two actual LV distribution systems with real-time power quality monitoring.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a real-time, setting-free out-of-step (OOS) protection strategy for a single synchronous generator (SG) connected to a multimachine power system. To do so, the fundamental frequency phasor of the voltage at the generator terminal is measured. It will be shown that at the point of OOS, the imaginary part of the voltage crosses the zero point and becomes negative, whereas the real part of the voltage holds a negative value. On the other hand, it will be shown that during stable power swings, the imaginary part of the voltage behaves as per an OOS event, whereas the real part of the voltage becomes positive. Therefore, this principle can be used as the criterion to detect an SG OOS. Moreover, it will be shown that the proposed principle can count the number of SG pole slip occurrences so that it can trip the generator after a certain number of pole slips. The proposed scheme is a response-based algorithm and uses only locally measured voltage at the relay location. Furthermore, the network configuration and parameters do not affect the proposed scheme. Unlike the legacy impedance-based OOS detection method, which demands rigorous offline simulation studies to determine settings, the proposed scheme does not need any setting to operate. Rigorous mathematical analyses and illustrated simulation study results are presented to substantiate the efficiency of the proposed method. The performance of the proposed scheme and the polygonal relay and concentric blinder scheme are compared through comprehensive simulation studies. The results prove that the proposed scheme can be served as an efficient method for SGs OOS protection.},

However, due to the fast relative movement between the transmitter and receiver in LEO satellites, intersatellite link communication is facing serious Doppler shifts and delays, which makes it difficult to obtain the accurate channel state information (CSI). Therefore, this article proposes an improved channel prediction method, that is, spatial-delay domain-based Prony (SDD-Prony) prediction, which not only realizes the accurate CSI acquisition for massive MIMO-based LEO intersatellite link systems but also substantially reduces the computational complexity. In particular, it is shown that the prediction error of the proposed method can converge to zero with the increase in antenna number and bandwidth. In addition, we combine the SDD-Prony prediction method with the total least squares method to reduce the influence of the noise and error components on the prediction accuracy, which further improves the prediction performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a theoretical proof and simulation results.},

In this article, six different SSIs are calculated using time-domain current signals at both the ends of the protected line and the performance of SSI-based line protection philosophy is evaluated for various operating conditions. The relaying schemes are extensively tested on two different test systems. The test results are utilized to perform a comparative assessment of the SSI-based protection scheme.

Multiple possible fault position estimations are eliminated by applying an index-based methodology to find the exact fault position. Extensive simulations are performed for a benchmark distribution system with conventional and inverter-interfaced generation units, considering all types of common short-circuit faults, several fault resistance magnitudes, varying load levels, different distributed generation (DG) mixture, and the impact of line segment length.

To improve the secrecy capacity without degrading the detection performance, we add artificial noise (AN) into OFDM signals. We first calculate the Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the target parameters to be estimated when OFDM signals are used as the detection signals. Then, we investigate the transmission optimization scheme, which maximizes the secrecy capacity under the CRLB constraints. To solve the optimization problem, an effective algorithm based on the Lagrange duality method is proposed to obtain the optimal power and subcarrier allocation. The simulation results reveal the tradeoff between secrecy capacity and estimation performance, and the advantage of our scheme over existing schemes in terms of the estimation performance.},

A key metric that is heavily employed in designing efficient CR-based multicell spectrum-allocation mechanisms is the blocking rate. An efficient spectrum-allocation mechanism aims to adaptively allocate channels to the different cells such that the overall blocking rate is minimized. In this article, we use the theory of continuous-time Markov chains to derive a closed-form expression for the blocking rate in multicell CR-based 5G networks. In our derivations, we build two detailed mathematical models describing the frequency-spectrum usage of both primary and secondary users. We combine the two models in a hierarchical fashion. As opposed to related models in the literature which suffer high complexity, the proposed hierarchical structure yields simplicity and tractability. Furthermore, while existing research works overlook spectrum heterogeneity, the proposed model addresses this important factor. Simulation results demonstrate high accuracy in evaluating the blocking rate across the different cells in the network.},

  abstract     = {Network connectivity is a necessary prerequisite to realizing distributed formation control. However, it is challenging to maintain the global network connectivity of a formation with local information because the communications between topological agents may be disconnected as formation maneuvers due to the range-limited sensing capabilities of agents. In this article, we propose a novel connectivity-preserving formation strategy to address the challenge. The core idea is to decompose global connectivity constraint into the induced-subgraph-preserving problems of each agent. Different from the state-of-the-art methods, our strategy can acquire the local algebraic connectivity directly at the level of maximal cliques, instead of estimating the global algebraic connectivity by hundreds of iterations. Consequently, it yields more flexibility in formation maneuvers and requires lower computing costs. Moreover, we treat the entire formation as a single rigid body and employ a variant of the optimal reciprocal collision avoidance algorithm to optimize the overall movement of the formation so that agents can maintain the desired shape while avoiding obstacles. Here, the position and orientation of the desired formation are negotiated by the agents using only local peer-to-peer information. Simulation results verify that the proposed strategy can drive a group of agents to implement connectivity-preserving formations in obstacle-rich spaces.},

The dense deployment of base stations (BSs) makes the overlapping coverage of BS that induces the placement of services and routing the requests to the appropriate node is a challenging issue. Further, the limited resources at the edge node invite additional problems of allocating the existing limited edge resources cooperatively to fulfil the user demands. To address the problems mentioned above, we formulate the cooperative service placement and routing problem by placing the diversified latency critical services to maximize the time utility with the deadline and resource constraints. The problem is formulated as an integer linear programming problem for cooperative service placement in mobile edge networks. A greedy and randomized rounding technique is presented to solve the service caching and request routing problems decomposed from the proposed problem. Further, a heuristic algorithm based on the circular convex set is presented to solve the proposed NP-hard problem. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed cooperative service placement schemes significantly improve the delay, cache hit ratio, load on cloud, and time utility performance compared with existing mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) enables multiple devices to collaboratively accomplish a machine learning task by iteratively exchanging their model updates instead of raw data with a parameter server (PS), thus protecting users&#39; data privacy. Nevertheless, the communication efficiency and the nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data are remaining intractable challenges in FL. This article proposes a hybrid FL framework called FedSeq, based on user clustering and sequential in-cluster training, to improve the communication efficiency and the test accuracy, especially on non-IID data. The FedSeq first divides users into multiple clusters and selects a cluster head (CH) on behalf on each cluster to upload the model updates to the PS, thus drastically reducing the uplink communication overhead. Within each cluster, a sequential training method is designed, which enables the CHs&#39; models witness more categories of training data and go through more meta-updates per training epoch, thus promoting the test accuracy. Moreover, we also provide the convergence analysis of FedSeq on IID data with Random user clustering, with specific experiments validating our theoretical analysis from a simulation perspective. In the experiments, we compare our FedSeq with other baselines, including FedSGD, FedAVG, FedProx, FedCluster, and HierFAVG, of which the results demonstrate that FedSeq outperforms other FL paradigms in terms of model accuracy and training efficiency. We also test FedSeq with Random and Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy clustering strategies to demonstrate the robustness of FedSeq to different clustering strategies. The FedSeq offers a potential solution to cope with non-IID data and reduce uplink communication overhead in FL.},

  abstract     = {This article considers the massive access problem in an uplink cell-free multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) system where massive potential users communicate with a set of access points (APs), while all APs are connected to a central processing unit (CPU). By exploiting the sporadic traffic of users, we use expectation maximization-approximate message passing (EM-AMP) algorithm to implement channel estimation based on the aggregate received signal of all APs at the CPU. Then, the active user detection (AUD) can be accomplished with the corresponding posterior support probabilities. It should be noted that the a priori distribution of channel coefficients plays an important role in EM-AMP, which will make a significant difference to the system performance. Moreover, provided with different prior information about the users&#39; location, the CPU will obtain different a priori distribution of the channel coefficients. Inspired by this, instead of using a priori distribution with hypothesised parameters as the original EM-AMP does, we assume that the CPU has some prior information about the users&#39; location. Then, we propose a scheme that can efficiently obtain the a priori distribution of channel coefficients by fully exploiting this information. After that, we propose a modified algorithm based on the derived a priori distribution. Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm has a noticeable performance gain than the original EM-AMP when the pilot length is relatively small. More importantly, with our proposed scheme, given rough prior information, we can achieve almost the same system performance as when the users&#39; location is precisely known.},

  abstract     = {High-impedance fault (HIF) detection has always been difficult in distribution networks due to the lack of field data and the large difference between field and simulation waveforms. Based on the characteristics of zero-sequence currents, a novel HIF detection methodology is proposed, which combines time–frequency spectrum (TFS) and transfer convolutional neural network (TCNN). First, the TFSs are acquired by applying continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to the collected zero-sequence currents. Then, the TFSs of simulated zero-sequence currents are utilized for training source-domain convolutional neural network (SCNN). Next, the SCNN is transfer learned with very few TFSs of field zero-sequence currents to obtain TCNN. The performance of the proposed method is verified by simulation samples and field samples. The results show that the proposed method can effectively extract fault features from small-scale training samples under different fault circumstances. Besides, TCNN can adaptively extract the effective features of field HIF and detect field HIF more accurately than SCNN. Finally, this article provides a visualization scheme for interpretability of the neural network, which offers visual explanations for the decision-making basis of the neural network.},

  abstract     = {One of the significant properties of narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) devices is supporting a long battery life. In the NB-IoT, devices have different search-space periods based on channel qualities. However, because a subframe of 180 kHz is a basic unit in the downlink, a base station can generally only simultaneously schedule devices with the same search-space period and allocate radio resources at the start of the period. If scheduling does not consider search-space periods, a base station will miss the start of the search-space period of some devices or sacrifice some devices. Massive devices will attempt multiple periods for blind decoding (BD), resulting in huge energy consumption. This article investigates a new direction in reducing the energy consumption of devices by reducing the BD and idle time for the NB-IoT. The challenge of the target energy-efficient scheduling problem is how to schedule search-space periods to reduce each device&#39;s BD and idle time subject to the data requirements. We propose an algorithm to determine each device&#39;s search-space period and an energy-efficient scheduling algorithm to schedule the search-space periods. The simulation results show that, compared with two baselines, the proposed algorithms reduce the energy consumption by 77\%.},

To resolve this issue, a mixture density-based maximum likelihood (MDML) estimation was proposed to detect attack vectors. The algorithm was deployed at each monitoring node using a track-level fusion (TLF)-based architecture. A parallelized message passing interface (MPI)-based computing was processed to reduce its computational burden. This work adopted a mature application known as oscillation detection as an example of a monitoring candidate to demonstrate the proposed method. Two test cases were generated to examine the resilience and scalability of the proposed scheme. The tests were conducted in severe data-injection attacks and multiple system disturbances.

  abstract     = {This article proposes a new dynamic observer-based event-triggered integral sliding mode control incorporating disturbance observer (DO) for the load frequency control of a multiarea interconnected power system (IPS) considering load disturbances and uncertainties. To improve the system performance and reduce the cost implementation, first a dynamic observer is designed for the IPS to achieve the state estimation. Then, to reduce the chattering effect and improve the robust performance, a DO is designed to obtain the estimated of the unmatched disturbances. To further reduce the chattering effect and computational burden, based on the obtained state estimation and the estimated disturbances, two integral sliding surfaces are proposed. The periodic-time one that is proposed to ensure the robust performance from the initial-time and the time-triggered one that is proposed to obtain the event-triggered control law. Utilizing the Lyapunov theory, the ultimate boundedness stability of the controlled system is studied and sufficient conditions are derived by solving a set of offline linear matrix inequalities. During the system implementation, it is also verified that the controlled system is Zeno-free. Finally, the proposed control strategy is compared with some existing studies and the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and the superiority over the existing approaches.},

The standard path of single USV for obstacle avoidance between start point and destination can hence be planned. Then, based on the result of neural activity values from GBNN, the cost matrix of the Hungarian algorithm is built and modified for the task assignment among multi-USVs, and the unbalanced problem is well resolved. Consequently, the task points are allocated to USVs and prioritized effectively, and each USV just needs to visit the corresponding task points respectively along the standard paths by GBNN to accomplish the task.

  abstract     = {Virtual machine placement (VMP) is the process of selecting the most appropriate physical machine (PM) to place users&#39; requested virtual machine (VM) in large cloud data centers. Several methods have been framed to deal with this problem. However, the current solutions only consider limited resource types, resulting in an unbalanced load that activates unnecessary PMs inside the data center. In this article, we suggest a flower pollination-based nondominated sorting optimization (FP-NSO) algorithm that maximizes resource usage and minimizes energy consumption and carbon emission of the data center. Multiple resource-constraint metrics are associated with our algorithm that assists in finding the most suitable PMs for deploying VMs in a cloud environment. The VMP is carried out by employing the combined concept of flower pollination optimization and nondominated sorting technique-based genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The algorithm is evaluated using the Google cluster dataset. The performance metrics like resource utilization, power consumption, and carbon emission values are computed for static and dynamic scenarios. The obtained results are compared with existing approaches. There is a significant reduction in power consumption, carbon emission, and execution time up to 16.69\%, 48.60\%, and 75.87\%, respectively, and an improvement in resource utilization is up to 78.18\%.},

We study the global beam hopping and power allocation in the proposed network, where the conflict between cell priority and latency is balanced. Due to the beam power impacting both cochannel interference and capacity, the two multiobjective problems are coupled. The plural method is introduced to simplify the coupled problems, which obtains a better QoS than the fixed-weight method. As the dimensionality of the beam hopping pattern increases with the number of cells, global beam hopping design is a dimensional explosion problem. The demand-weighted power (DWP)-adaptive particle marching (APM) algorithm includes roulette, stochastic exploration, and nonlinear weights strategies. It is proposed to handle high-dimensional problems and converge fast to better optimal solutions. The simulation results show that the DWP-APM algorithm performs better with a few particles than the four baseline algorithms. Compared with baseline algorithms, the DWP-APM algorithm reduces the computation time by 57\% and improves the QoS level by 13.6\% at least.},

To contemplate such issues, a Gershgorin circle theorem inspired controller assimilated with the particle swarm optimization is proposed for multiarea power systems. The proposed method ensures system stability while abating the frequency variations in the operational areas and the power deviations in the interconnected tie-lines. The present analysis is substantiated through an interconnected photovoltaic (PV) integrated thermal power systems. Furthermore, the competence of the proposed method against increasing complexities is validated by considering an interconnected multimicrogrid systems consisting of renewable and nonrenewable energy sources. The performances of the proposed controller are demonstrated considering fixed and time-varying load disturbances, and fluctuations in renewable energy sources. Results corroborate that the proposed method is successful in maintaining the system stability while mitigating the frequency and the power deviations in all such operating conditions. A comparative analysis of the proposed method with prevalent control techniques (e.g., PI and PID-based controllers, tilt–integral–derivative, integral–tilt–derivative) and optimization algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithm, gravitational search algorithm, imperialist competitive algorithm) is presented to highlight the substantial performance improvements in the considered systems.},

In this study, an innovative malware propagation model [i.e., IoT-susceptible-latent-propagated-recovered (IoT-SLPR)] based on epidemiological theory is developed for malware propagation in multiple IoT heterogeneous devices. The proposed model incorporates the propagation mechanism of malware in real IoT networks, and considers heterogeneous devices with different infection rates and recovery rates. This study calculates and proves the basic reproductive rate of malware and the stability of equilibrium points for different types of devices. In addition, this study designs a dynamic recovery rate optimal defense strategy, which comprehensively considers the cost and the overall infection rate of the device. The experimental results show that the proposed propagation model can effectively reflect the propagation dynamics of malware in multiple heterogeneous devices, and the achieved dynamic recovery rate defense strategy performs better than the static strategy regarding the overall results.},

Nevertheless, the lack of confidentiality as well as traceability of the travel data, the reliance of most ride-sharing services on centralized storage structures, and the issue of trust between passengers and drivers are pressing problems to be addressed. To mitigate these problems, a perfect data protection, storage, and reputation management (DPSRM) scheme is proposed for ride-sharing services. First, a passenger utilizes the proposed ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) algorithm with partially hidden-policy, decryption test, and traceability, to encrypt her/his travel data. An authorized driver can successfully decrypt the ciphertext to acquire the passenger&#39;s travel data, then drive to the point of departure and wait for the passenger. Second, the data stored on the blockchain, such as the hash value of the ciphertext and the storage address of the ciphertext, can be used for digital forensics to achieve the distributed storage and traceability of data. Third, a reputation management based on the drivers&#39; past behavior is proposed, which is a quantitative method to forecast the reliability of the drivers&#39; future behavior and can be applied to settle the trust issue between passengers and drivers. Furthermore, the security analysis and performance comparisons manifest that the proposed DPSRM scheme is secure and efficient in ride-sharing services.},

Considering requirements for secure interactions and the limitation of resources in VANETs, protecting data authenticity while enhancing computational efficiency has become the main challenge. A certificateless aggregate signature (CLAS) can not only ensure data security, but also reduce communication costs, which is suitable for a resource-constrained environment. However, most existing CLAS schemes either own serious security vulnerabilities or result in tremendous computational overhead. In this article, we propose an efficient, privacy-preserving, and pairing-free CLAS scheme with enhanced security. We prove that it is existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen message attacks in the random oracle model.

A queue-length-based admission control mechanism is adopted in this article to regulate whether the cloud server is open to customers. When the cloud server cannot be accessed immediately, some customers send their jobs to the in-house subsystem, while others (called opportunists) try to send their jobs to the cloud server again. We derive the conditional equilibrium joining probability of entering the in-house subsystem when the cloud is not open. Based on the cooperative and noncooperative game-theoretic analyses, we determine the cooperatively optimal retrial rate and the noncooperatively optimal retrial rate for a given queue-length information. Numerical experiments show that the two optimal retrial rates are equivalent. Finally, it is found that the existence of the opportunists significantly harms social interests, regardless of whether these opportunists are cooperative or noncooperative.},

  abstract     = {Energy hubs, as the prospect of future energy systems, are efficient and reliable frameworks for the generation, conversion, storage, and consumption of energy in multicarrier energy systems. Existing urban facilities in smart cities (SCs) can be considered as micro energy hubs (MIEHs), whereas the SC itself can be regarded as a macro energy hub incorporating its MIEHs. Moreover, the interconnection of MIEHs is particularly important to achieve high-reliability and economical smart city energy systems (SCESs). This article presents a framework for reliability-oriented expansion planning of multicarrier energy systems in SCESs. The proposed framework tends to improve energy not supplied and customer interruption cost indices for both heat and electrical loads, as well as the energy index of reliability. The proposed multicarrier energy system facilitates interoperability between different energy carrier systems to supply electricity and heat demand simultaneously. The interconnection of MIEHs is modeled through linearized alternating current optimal power flow and natural gas network constraints, whereas full interaction of the electricity and gas networks is realized by the power-to-gas systems and combined heat and power systems. The effectiveness of the proposed mixed-integer linear programming planning model is demonstrated in the Dättwil district (Switzerland) through four scenarios, analyzing the effect of MIEH interconnection, as well as the gas and electricity interaction within an MIEH. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method due to a significant reduction in total investment cost and a considerable improvement in reliability indices.},

The proposed quasi-optimal PMU placement strategy enhances the performance of the SPD in FDIA detection. We further propose to enhance the SPD with the dynamic double threshold for high dynamic load profiles beyond a simple yet efficient static double threshold. Illustrative simulations based on the IEEE 118 bus test grid and the ERCOT dataset validate the superior performance of the proposed quasi-optimal PMU placement strategy along with the two double thresholds.},

  abstract     = {This work integrates concurrent team learning into a deep reinforcement learning model for collaborative multiagent problems to reach a common goal. RL trains each agent to decide its best actions, and then the joint decision is made to accomplish the assigned team task based on the collaborative platform. Each agent learns individually and shares the observed feature with others. The collaborative platform makes the decision based on these features provided by agents. The collaborative platform consists of two attention mechanisms—soft and self-attention. The self-attention module is applied to distinguish local environmental features sensed by an individual agent for concurrent learning. The platform integrates collective information locally from agents through a soft attention interface. A termination network is introduced to the collaborative model to determine the number of elapsed sequences in collecting sufficient information to support the joint decision instead of a fixed number of iterations. Experiments on limit-sighted agent deployment for static image classifications, video game playing, and aerial image object detection of multiple airborne sensors have evaluated the performance of the proposed model. The experimental results show that the proposed model provides a more efficient collaborative mechanism for multiagent systems than the state-of-the-art methods.},

The relationship between nodes within each cluster is cooperative, and nodes belonging to different clusters may compete with each other. For each case of leaderless and leader-following, we consider both fixed and switching topologies. The vector field at each node satisfies the one-sided Lipschitz condition. For situations where there is no leader and leader to follow, we do not need to use the in-degree balanced condition that is often required in most existing literature. Under the leaderless framework, the cluster synchronization (CS) problem is transformed into a stability problem through variable transformation. Under the leader-following framework, by equipping each cluster with a virtual leader, we design a new class of leader-following protocols that can be used to achieve CS of coupled nonlinear systems. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the validity of the obtained results.},

This article extends their proposed method to the case that the nonzero elements of sparse vectors are chosen from a discrete finite alphabet. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is called approximate message passing with finite alphabet. Based on this assumption, the passing messages have been derived and the scheduling of the algorithm has been proposed using a three-step strategy. As an application, direction of arrival (DoA) estimation of digitally modulated signals is examined using simulations. The obtained results revealed that the proposed method would improve the DoA estimation accuracy compared to the conventional methods.},

In this work, we propose a dual IRS-aided communication model for outdoor-to-indoor wireless communication. The scenario comprises an outdoor base station that communicates with the indoor users with the aid of two distinct IRSs. Specifically, we derived the closed-form expressions of the spectral efficiency (SE), energy efficiency (EE), and outage probability (OP) for the dual IRS-aided communication system. The results show that utilizing distributed IRSs, i.e., by dividing the large IRS into two smaller IRSs, significant performance gains in the SE and EE can be achieved over the single IRS scenario. Although the multiplicative pathloss effect impacts performance, it can be mitigated by increasing the number of reflecting elements. Initially, we evaluated the performance of a single-user scenario; later on, we generalized it to the multiuser scenario with nonorthogonal multiple access. Further, the performance is also compared with the baseline direct cellular transmission. The analytical derivations of the SE, EE, and OP are corroborated through simulations.},

This article presents a novel conformity-aware competitive independent cascade model to simulate the spread process of two items (e.g., truth and rumor). Two advanced algorithms named the rumor-aware betweenness first (RBF) and conformity-aware demand degree (CDD) are proposed to solve the corresponding influence minimization problem. Extensive experiments conducted on seven synthetic/real-world networks have demonstrated that first, the proposed CDD or RBF algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of rumor containment and efficiency in running speed; second, the time delay of rumor detection is entitled to be concerned about and costly measures are necessary if rumors have diffused chronically; and third, authoritative truth information plays a critical role in competing with rumors, relying on truth seeds will generate negative feedback when their credibility ratio is less than a specific threshold.},

The estimation algorithm reduces uncertainty on unmeasured grid states based on certain online state measurements and noisy “pseudomeasurements.” We analyze the convergence of the proposed algorithm and quantify the statistical estimation errors based on a weighted least-squares estimator. The numerical results on a 4521-node network demonstrate that this approach can scale to extremely large networks and provide robustness to both large pseudomeasurement variability and inherent sensor measurement noise.},

Accordingly, the controller provided an asynchronous event-triggered mechanism considering the finite availability of communication resources, which reduces communication burdens and avoids Zeno behaviors. The sufficient conditions are demonstrated using the Lyapunov function for maintaining the stability of the proposed control strategy. Several simulations are exhibited using the MATLAB/Simulink platform and the results are reviewed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy for enhancing the ac microgrid robustness and reducing communication burdens.},

However, existing research mainly focuses on terrestrial communication networks. In contrast, there is not much research on IRS-aided secure unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication problems, especially for ground-to-air (G2A) communication scenarios with air eavesdroppers that will bring greater security threats. In this article, we consider an IRS-assisted G2A communication network with an altitude-dependent Rician fading channel, where the ground base station (BS) transmits legitimate information to the UAV user in the presence of air eavesdroppers. The transmission power, active and passive beamforming, and UAV 3-D trajectory are jointly optimized to maximize the average secrecy rate. Due to the nonconvexity of the optimization problem, the block coordinate descent method is used to solve it. Specifically, the overall optimization problem is divided into four subproblems, and nonconvex subproblems are solved by successive convex approximation and semidefinite relaxation algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed alternating optimization algorithm has a good convergence performance and can increase the average secrecy rate by 28\% compared with the scenario without IRS assistance.},

A wiretap power line channel model is investigated by considering two different cases: 1) when all the channels are assumed to be independent and identically distributed (IID) following Log-normal distribution; and 2) the wiretap channels are considered to be identical but correlated Log-normally distributed and independent of the main channel. Contemporaneously, the Bernoulli-Gaussian random process models the PLC noise. Further, a comprehensive PLS study of the considered PLC system is characterized in terms of the average secrecy capacity, secure outage probability, and strictly positive secrecy capacity. We also propose an algorithm to maximize the secrecy throughput under security and reliability constraints. Moreover, to obtain essential insights, we reveal the impact of various crucial parameters onto the proposed system.},

Therefore, it is very meaningful to study how the ac/dc ADN aggregates flexibility and participates in the dispatching of the transmission network as a flexibility resource. To this end, this article aggregates the ac/dc ADN into a virtual generator with ramp and power parameters. In particular, the flexibility in the ac/dc ADN is subdivided into ramp and power flexibility and incorporated into the aggregation model. Then, an energy-based flexibility cost function is constructed for the aggregated distribution network. Therefore, without relying on the electricity market, the distribution network can be used as a flexible resource to participate in the flexible dispatching of the transmission network.

  abstract     = {The article presents a data-mining model-based enhanced differential relaying scheme for fault detection and classification task in the microgrids. The proposed research work aims to provide a fixed setting, fast, and reliable scheme for accurately detecting and classifying faults in the microgrid. The presented scheme fetches the three-phase current signals from both ends of the distribution lines and computes the differential current phasor, including the distributed generation (DG) in the fault model. The deep neural network (DNN)-based data-mining models for fault detection and classification are built using differential current phasor datasets generated by wide variations in fault and operating conditions of the microgrid, including different types of faults with the change in fault location, fault resistance, DG penetration in grid-connected and islanding mode of operation with types of DG units. The developed DNN models are validated for their ability to detect the faults in a low-voltage CERTS microgrid and subsequently for a medium-voltage IEEE-34 bus microgrid on a MATLAB/SIMULINK platform. Furthermore, the proposed intelligent scheme is also tested on the Typhoon hardware-in-loop platform for real-time performance evaluation. The accuracy and speed in detecting and classifying faults indicate that the proposed DNN-based intelligent differential relaying scheme can be a potential candidate for providing reliable protection measures for the microgrid.},

Products in supply chains are varied and may belong to several different owners. Ownership transfer requires the consent of a majority of owners. This article proposed a method suitable for simultaneously transferring the ownership of a large number of goods. The method does not require a trusted third party and can securely and efficiently transfer group ownership for multiple owners with multiple tags. The old and new owner groups can be classified as different authorities. This method can be used in mobile readers to transfer one, some, or all tags in a group. It includes mutual authentication between tags, readers, and backend servers, and can ensure that only assigned owners can obtain the tag ownership. The method proved can resist most known attacks, such as secret disclosure attacks and replay attacks. It can also prevent attacks from the dishonest original owners. Finally, through experiments, we compared the proposed method with other many-to-many ownership transfer methods and demonstrated that the proposed method has better security and fewer transmitted messages than other methods.},

In this article, we propose a class of time-varying gains to design the delay-dependent observer and control protocol, where a newly defined variable is used to cope with unknown noises. Under the output feedback control protocol, followers can asymptotically track the leader by assigned ratios. Different from existing works, the sampling period, communication delays, and noises are not restricted to a fixed upper bound. Two simulation examples are eventually presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control protocol.

However, their disadvantage is the excessive amount of computation required.

By leveraging these technologies, in this article, we propose a novel scheme to integrate public safety (PS) networks in CNs. This integration enhances the performance of PS users (PSUs) that rely on low-rate technologies. We formulate a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem for sum throughput maximization, to optimize the channel allocation and achieve the required rate of PSUs. This optimization takes into account power budget, users required rates, and successful interference cancellation constraints. Since the maximization problem is computationally challenging, we design a heuristic algorithm that selects the appropriate cellular users to share their resources with PS clusters. Then, given this selection, we compute the optimal power allocation in each PS cluster using the Lagrange multiplier method. Evaluation results demonstrate that our approach improves spectral efficiency and provides higher sum throughput compared to other works in the literature. We also conduct extensive simulations to compare our throughput maximization approach with the fairness maximization approach. Finally, we compute the outage probability to reassign PSUs groups to new resource blocks if necessary.},

Since human activity sensing is human oriented, human pose estimation has become one important infrastructure. In this article, we propose a Wi-Fi-based 2-D static human pose estimation (WiSPE), which acts like a camera to estimate human pose in skeletons. Specifically, in the device deployment, we design a vertical slide rail with receiving antennas to obtain channel state information (CSI) at different heights. Then, we utilize the multiple signal classification algorithm to compute angle of arrival (AoA) and time of flight (ToF) spectrum from the CSI. We process the AoA and ToF spectrums at different heights and construct one novel feature called 2-D AoA image, which captures multipath signal reflections caused by the human body. Furthermore, we propose the environment background filter (Env-Filter) algorithm to create one environment related noise filter from the static environment signals. The Env-Filter algorithm effectively filters out the environment background noise and enhances the human-pose-related information in the 2-D AoA image. Finally, we design a teacher–student Network to correlate skeletons with the 2-D AoA image. The experiment results show that the average accuracy of the WiSPE is up to 95.2\% in percentage of correct keypoints (PCK)@50, achieving the same effect as vision-based methods. When the evaluation criterion gets stricter to PCK@10, the average accuracy of the WiSPE still achieves 73.1\%, which is better than state-of-the-art Wi-Fi-based methods.},

Then, different from most of the existing results, the packets dropout is considered under the comprehensive influence of jamming attacks and network-induced factors, which makes the network communication environment more general. Moreover, a novel algorithm to calculate the packet dropout rate is presented with the help of the classical probability space technology. Next, an offline observer is designed to estimate system states, which can reduce online calculations. An online fuzzy MPC algorithm is constructed to optimize the controller gains and stabilize the CPS. By refreshing the bound of the estimation error, the recursive feasibility is guaranteed.

The optimization model is formulated with the aim of countering active oppressive interference by dynamically assigning tracking tasks and allocating transmit power to each node. The architecture of information fusion considered in this article is centralized so that the detection performance and the parameter estimation accuracy can be improved. Since the predicted conditional Cramer–Rao lower bound (PC-CRLB) can provide an accurate performance lower bound for target tracking accuracy, the objective function is designed to improve the sum of weighted PC-CRLBs of multiple targets. By introducing the relaxation technique and the sorting algorithm, this mixed integer nonlinear programming problem is converted into a two-stage nonconvex problem, and the efficient solutions are obtained through the modified Zoutendijk method of feasible directions algorithm.

  abstract     = {This article proposes an optimal distributed secondary voltage control method based on distributed coordinated reinforcement learning (DCRL) algorithm in the time-delayed microgrid. First, a distributed secondary voltage control protocol through a sparse communication network is designed using consensus-based algorithm and Lyapunov–Krasovskii theory. Then, by combining the consensus control method with reinforcement learning together, a novel DCRL algorithm is utilized to dynamically adjust the voltage controller gains. Since the DCRL method is an online intelligent algorithm, it can adaptively improve the voltage control performance in the presence of various external disturbances encountered in microgrid secondary control. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulations under different scenarios on a four inverter-based microgrid test system. Simulation results indicate that our method shows superior dynamic voltage regulation response over traditional methods.},

Here, analysis of the frequency dynamics of the droop-controlled grid-forming inverter and the synchronous generator illuminates the inverted active power-frequency relationship and the frequency response order reduction, forming the basis for novel, nonlinear frequency control approaches. Device-level electromagnetic transient domain simulations corroborate the order-reduction findings, establish that a properly designed dc-side system has a negligible impact on power transfer and will not impede frequency regulation, and confirm the primary frequency response improvement with nonlinear control. Simulations of the 9- and 39-bus test systems validate the order reduction and associated decoupling of the nadir and rate of change of frequency in larger networks. Oscillatory mode analysis confirms the grid-forming benefit of increased damping; decreased damping is observed at shares above 80\%, but not at 100\%. Finally, simulations on a validated Maui power system model with a 96\% of inverter-based resources model yield a trend toward a first-order response.},

Grid forming inverters (GFMIs) are a promising technology to address these challenges. Recently, the virtual oscillator based GFMI control is attracting more attention due to its superior performance over other control strategies. In this article, an adaptive control strategy is proposed to provide flexible operation and transition between grid-connected and islanded modes. The controller adapts the virtual oscillator&#39;s parameter values depending on the operation mode. It also provides a feedback signal using a measured frequency to account for any steady-state errors and to allow a seamless transition from grid-connected to islanded mode. To show the feasibility of the proposed controller, this article discusses the simulation results from the implementation of the controller on a single inverter system and on a group of inverters on a large practical utility feeder, the IEEE 13 node feeder, using the DIgSILENT simulation environment.},

  abstract     = {The high R/X ratio of typical distribution systems makes the system voltage vulnerable to the active power injection from distributed energy resources (DERs). Moreover, the intermittent and uncertain nature of the DER generation brings new challenges to the voltage control. This article proposes a two-stage stochastic optimization strategy to optimally place the photovoltaic (PV) smart inverters with Volt-VAr capability for distribution systems with high PV penetration to mitigate voltage violation issues. The proposed optimization strategy enables a planning-stage guide for upgrading the existing PV inverters while considering the operation-stage characteristics of the Volt-VAr control. One advantage of this planning strategy is that it utilizes the local control capability of the smart inverter that requires no communication, thus avoiding issues related to communication delays and failures. Another advantage is that the Volt-VAr control characteristic is internally integrated into the optimization model as a set of constraints, making placement decisions more accurate. The objective of the optimization is to minimize the upgrading cost and the number of the smart inverters required while maintaining the voltage profile within the acceptable range. Case studies on an actual 12.47 kV, 9-km-long Arizona utility feeder have been conducted using OpenDSS to validate the effectiveness of the proposed placement strategy in both static and dynamic simulations.},

With the growth of building-level photovoltaic (PV) panels and other inverter-based resource (IBR) deployments in recent years, market retailers and distribution operators have had to deal with the additional operational and management challenges posed by unobserved energy flow if its behind-the-meter (BTM) configuration. Also, the intermittent and stochastic nature of IBR-based solar power introduces uncertainty into the net load forecasting of electric distribution systems. Hence, management and control with high uncertainty in load prediction due to unobservable PV is a technical challenge. This article presents deep-learning-based algorithms for BTM PV power generation using a limited number of sensors in a given distribution system and extending to adjacent geographical areas. The proposed BTM PV forecasting method is based on geometric deep learning—a spatiotemporal graph neural network by processing the relationship between data in a non-Euclidean graph structure. The predictions of short-term BTM PV are aggregated with loss estimation at the data aggregation point with the net load forecasting to compute the true load forecasting with superior performance. The developed BTM PV forecasting method significantly improved true load forecasting results, which were validated and analyzed using a collection of actual BTM PV and load measurements in a test distribution feeder.},

The proposed heuristic relies on normalized squares of the line currents as a direct indicator of transmission line loading. The sensitivity of this measure with respect to breaker positions forms the basis of the proposed heuristic to select switching actions for a reconfigured network topology that reduces the congestion and overloads while holding generation dispatch essentially fixed. While many prior works have examined this class of problem for line switching actions (i.e., topology changes that insert or remove branches), bus-bar switching actions (topology changes that merge or split nodes/buses) have received less research focus. Here, both line switching and bus-bar switching are implemented using a detailed node-breaker representation of the network. The algorithm adopts a novel form of the AC power flow that allows sparse calculation and reduced computation time. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed approach efficiently reduces congestion and overloads in the base case and in contingency situations.},

The proposed voltage restoration strategy is derived from the quadratic relation between voltage and reactive power for inductive microgrids against their linear dependence, which has been conventionally used in designing voltage droop controllers. It has been illustrated that the proposed quadratic-droop-based control design strategy shows better performance as compared with the linear counterpart. We provide a rigorous Lyapunov stability analysis for the proposed controller and also obtain an upper bound on the convergence time, independent of the system&#39;s initial conditions. In addition, frequency restoration and proportional active power sharing among the generators are realized in the fixed time. Simulations are provided to verify the efficacy of the proposed controllers, including a comparative analysis with conventional droop control and finite-time control through a case study.},

The novel control strategy, called the “Phase Restoring Principle” (PRP), was recently introduced for converter operated power systems. This article provides further insights and confirmation of the PRP grid-forming capabilities based on the response requirements from the perspective of the power system. It describes the extension of the control by supplementing PRP with active power control allowing the control to cooperate with other sources. The generalized small-signal solution of the control is derived and evidenced. Analytical deductions supported by simulative evidence of the power dispatch based on PRP are displayed in single, double, and triple converter configurations. The development of steady-state operating point and, hence, drift frequency using the principle of PRP with active power control is examined and discussed based on reference values and weighted gain selection. The enhanced PRP control structure also displays controller stability for sufficiently small drift frequencies and achieves nominal frequency with dedicated parameters.},

The prosumers are equipped with flexible distributed energy resources that we model based on convex operation constraints. The optimal day-ahead peak shaving control of the portfolio is realized in a distributed way through an entirely parallel implementation of the distributed ADMM optimization algorithm. In this scenario, we evaluate the ADMM algorithm&#39;s overall speed of convergence and conduct multiple large-scale numerical simulation experiments on a compute cluster to compare and assess the algorithmic performance of ADMM against a centralized reference benchmark optimization. Our simulation results show that the distributed ADMM algorithm is superior compared to a purely centralized optimization. The findings are of particular use to commercial demand response aggregators that show interest in the deployment and improvement of distributed coordination and optimal control concepts for future slow-dynamics demand response applications and services.},

Hence, we suggest a distributional regression approach for ATD modeling in an optimal multimarket setup. Also, a modified machine learning approach is proposed to generate price scenarios for the mFRR energy market taking into account uncertain ATD parameters. To illustrate our proposed approach, various numerical experiments are performed. Our numerical results show how proper modeling of ATD parameters can lead to a more realistic multimarket offer-function for cascaded HPPs. Furthermore, the results show how the inclusion of FCR-N and mFRR capacity markets change the optimal day-ahead offer-function.},

  abstract     = {Time synchronization is crucial for various applications in wireless sensor networks. Consensus-based time synchronization is an essential distributed strategy for its high precision, robustness, and scalability. In practical networks, however, communication delays are not ignorable and make time messages received inaccurate, which is the fundamental limitation for time synchronization. It was pointed out that if a consensus-based time synchronization algorithm does not consider the influence of delays, it may be divergent under the scenario with delays. Making use of the knowledge of statistical signal processing to develop an efficient relative skew estimator is a viable method to restrain communication delays. In this article, we propose a relative skew estimator based on Bayesian estimation theory to counteract the impact of time delays, which improves the estimation accuracy while reducing the memory requirement. By applying the presented estimator to average consensus protocol, precise network-wide synchronization is achieved in the presence of delays. In addition, the proof of convergence of the proposed scheme is given by theoretical analysis. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and show that our algorithm outperforms other similar algorithms in terms of synchronization accuracy under random delays.},

Moreover, by introducing the extraction matrix, the nonuniform array can also fit polynomial root finding, from which the initial elevation and azimuth estimates can be obtained. Finally, to further improve the estimation accuracy, we compensate the estimation offsets via least square constructed from the first-order Taylor expansion of the direction matrix. The proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional algorithms in the aspect of computational complexity while achieves preferable estimation performance. Specifically, the complexity of the proposed method is reduced by several orders of magnitude, with RMSE reduced by up to 6 dB.},

Therefore, in microgrid electricity call auction trading, aiming at the problems, such as bidding messages may leak users’ privacy, they may also be eavesdropped or tampered with in the bidding process, and the balance between privacy protection and supervision cannot be achieved, a privacy protection scheme for bidding users of peer-to-peer electricity call auction trading in microgrids is proposed. It consists of a market layer and a blockchain layer. Based on the improved certificateless ring signcryption and timed-release encryption algorithms, the market layer is used to hide the user&#39;s real identity while encrypting the bidding message and track illegal users. The blockchain layer is used for trading settlement and trading record storage to ensure data storage security. The security is proved theoretically. Performance analysis and simulation results indicate that computational and communication costs are low.

  abstract     = {Nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted semi-grant-free (SGF) transmission is a powerful solution to significantly reduce the end-to-end latency of data transmission and improve spectrum utilization efficiency facing the future Internet of Everything (IoE). Moreover, the recently proposed hybrid successive interference cancellation (HSIC) scheme can avoid the user&#39;s outage probability error floor, which is unavoidable in traditional uplink NOMA. However, the existing NOMA assisted SGF transmission schemes using this HSIC scheme admit only one grant-free (GF) user into the grant-based (GB) user&#39;s channel at a time. In order to further improve the throughput and reduce the waiting delay of GF users, in this paper, we propose a NOMA assisted SGF scheme with a new HSIC scheme allowing a certain number of GF users to share GB user&#39;s channel. First, we propose a new HSIC scheme to decode the signals of multiple GF users and one GB user. Then based on the signal&#39;s decoding order at the BS and stochastic geometry, we provide a general mathematical framework to analyze the association success probability of GF users. Besides, in order to intuitively show the throughput improvement brought by multiple admitted GF users, we derive the analytical expressions of admitted GF users&#39; association success probability, outage probability, and throughput when two GF users are allowed to share simultaneously GB user&#39;s channel. Finally, the simulation results validate the throughput improvement brought by two GF users being served simultaneously and the accuracy of the theoretical analyses.},

It is widely acknowledged that the sequence of failure events of component overloading is determined by power flow redistribution. To understand the power flow redistribution process, we analyze the prefault power flow condition using network flow theory and by clustering the system into several regions with balanced local power flow. We observe that faults triggering local power imbalance would lead to remote power transfer and faults causing no local power imbalance would lead to local power redistribution. The improved understanding of the failure process permits us to develop effective mitigating strategies consisting of adaptive power balance restoration and selective edge protection for cascading failure propagation. In addition, we propose a set of indexes to measure the local and nonlocal propagation risks of cascading failures. Numerical simulations on the IEEE 118- and 300-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed mitigation strategies can significantly reduce the blackout sizes and are tolerant to incorrect transmission line tripping.},

  abstract     = {With the interconnection of asynchronous ac grids through a voltage source converter-based multiterminal direct current (AGs/VSC-MTDC) system and the large-scale integration of renewable energy, it is important to resolve the power flow calculation problems efficiently and robustly for secure and economic operation of such system under stochastic context. Therefore, an improved sequential algorithm for deterministic power flow (DPF) of AGs/VSC-MTDC system is proposed first. This enhances the conventional manner of updating power losses of VSCs, which leads to a one-shot DPF solution of the ac/dc grid, thus boosting the efficiency; while the coupling of ac/dc systems is considered to remain high accuracy. In combination with the efficient DPF method for each sample, probabilistic power flow (PPF) analysis of the AGs/VSC-MTDC system is performed by using Zhao&#39;s three-point estimate method (Z-3PEM) with much fewer samples, thus achieving a higher efficiency with good accuracy. In addition, the PPF analysis of AGs/VSC-MTDC systems being more prone to the poor robustness in stochastic scenarios is effectively addressed, benefitting from the decreased nonconvergence of improved DPF and fewer extreme samples of Z-3PEM. Finally, the effectiveness and performance of works are verified through the results on an 11-terminal VSC-MTDC system with three asynchronous ac grids modified from different IEEE test systems.},

The updates between iterations and updates of network feedback information for each iteration on the time scale are performed, reducing the iteration steps and network data transmission frequency within each iteration. In each iteration, the system output is transmitted via a network, which is assumed to be vulnerable to DoS attacks. An attack detection mechanism and buffer-based compensation mechanism are proposed.

A two-stage stochastic unit commitment (UC) problem is proposed to improve the operational efficiency of N-ac/dc-MGs under uncertain renewable energy generation output and loads. The nonlinear power losses of ac/dc converters and dc/dc converters under different operating modes are formulated as novel multivariate nonlinear functions of both power and voltage. These functions are approximated by linear surrogate models and adopted by the dynamic optimal power flow (OPF), where the voltage and power of the converters can be optimized considering the physical laws among voltages of converters. Embedding the dynamic OPF problem as mixed-integer recourse, a two-stage stochastic programming problem is formulated for the day-ahead operation of N-ac/dc-MGs. To reduce the computational cost, a finite iteration convergent Benders decomposition algorithm is proposed to solve the UC problem. Case studies are performed on hybrid ac/dc MGs and N-ac/dc-MGs. Simulation results reveal that using more accurate conversion loss models, the output commands, especially the dc bus voltage, from the energy management systems will lead to more efficient system operation, and thus, save energy.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the use of the Internet of Things has reached a commanding height in a new round of economic and technological upsurge. Its data transmission security has attracted much attention. It is well known that substitution permutation networks (SPNs) ciphers with high diffusion are not advantageous in unified encryption and decryption circuits with extremely resources constrained. Although some research has been carried out to address this issue, there are still insufficiencies. In this article, we propose a new 64-bit lightweight block cipher based on SPN named IVLBC, whose key allows 80 and 128 bits. The components of IVLBC are involutions. In particular, we propose a Feistel with tree structure to obtain a compact and involutive S-box. Also, the nibble-based involutive permutation is proposed to obtain the involutive permutation. Decryption can reuse encrypted code and circuitry in both software and hardware implementations. We prove that the costs of IVLBC are less than PRESENT, PRINCE, Midori, I-PRESENTTM, CRAFT, etc., in unified encryption and decryption circuits. In addition, we conduct other performance tests on IVLBC such as the differential attack, linear attack, integral attack, algebraic attack, invariant attacks, etc.},

However, channel estimation in IRS-assisted communication systems is more challenging than that in conventional systems. In this article, we propose a two-stage channel estimation approach using deep learning in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems with a hybrid passive/active IRS structure. In the first stage, the sparsity of the mmWave massive MIMO channel in the angular domain is exploited to estimate the amplitude of the sparse channel through a convolutional neural network. In this way, the indices of the nonzero entries of the sparse channel can be simultaneously obtained. In the second stage, the channel is reconstructed by solving a least squares problem with the acquired indices. The simulation results show that the proposed channel estimation scheme could achieve better performance with manageable complexity over the existing solutions.},

Among the complexity metrics developed to date, we considered entropy-based ones, which allowed us to objectively quantify the complexity while satisfying the criteria introduced by Weyuker. The notion of intrinsic descriptive complexity introduced by Kolmogorov, instead of the Shannon entropy, was used to analyze the structural complexity of engineered systems.

This article proposes a novel protection system based on the transfer learning technique and GoogleNet architecture to reduce this dependence. The proposed protection system uses a small amount of data to extend the knowledge of pretrained GoogleNet architecture to the HIF detection problem. In this system, a small amount of third harmonic angle data of the current at the measurement point are obtained from the understudy electrical distribution system. Then, the preprocessing phase is performed, and the extracted data are converted to image data using the Wigner–Ville distribution. Afterward, these converted images are fed to the GoogleNet architecture as an input dataset to update the GoogleNet pretrained knowledge. Finally, the process of fault detection and classification is accomplished only by transferring the GoogleNet pretrained knowledge. The simulation results of the modified IEEE 13-bus and 34-bus distribution systems in EMTP-RV and MATLAB indicate the high accuracy of the proposed protection system despite the use of a small amount of input training data.},

To address this issue, an adaptive distributed graph model (ADGM) is innovatively proposed for multiple-line outage identification to hedge limited measurement and noise in the large-scale power system. By integrating a novel Laplacian convolution (LC) operation, the proposed ADGM is forceful in capturing the non-Euclidian structure of nodal voltage phase angle measurement to tackle the real-time outage identification problem effectively with measurement noise. On top of this, a novel breadth walk (BW) operation is proposed to exclude redundant measurement so that enhanced outage identification accuracy can be achieved under measurement lost. BW is then incorporated with LC to release the ADGM from numerous parameters&#39; training burden to achieve the large-scale system outage identification. Numerical simulations are carried out based on the IEEE 30/118/300-node and Polish 2383-node testing systems, which verify the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed model.},

The studies are carried out based on an experimental setup comprising a centrifugal pump, running in turbine mode, coupled with a 3-kW induction generator. The speed control method is based on the rotor field-oriented control and is implemented on an experimental ac/dc converter. Various performance characteristics of the system, including constant-head and constant-speed curves, are extracted and investigated. Then, a modified perturb and observe algorithm is proposed to accurately track the maximum power point of the system.

The proposed mechanism uses the framework of semi-Markov decision making process and seeks for an optimal policy that efficiently allocates the virtual resources to secure and run the services across the cloudified infrastructure. Driven by a new latency-oriented cost structure, the optimal controller achieves a secure and latency compliant operation by optimally balancing the service requests between the edge and the cloud system taking into account the service profile, the workload, and the traffic load. A structural analysis of the optimal policy reveals its implementation friendliness, which is key for its deployment or derivation of suboptimal mechanisms. Numerical results unveil that the admission and placement decision making process does not adversely impact the performance of the admission decision making process. Finally, a cloudnomics analysis shows that the optimal cost can be further optimized by fine tuning the parameters of the proposed cost structure. In this respect, numerical results show a reduction of approximately 162\% for some cases of the scenario under analysis.},

To address such a challenging problem, we first study the special single-user scenario and propose an algorithm that can transform the optimization problem into a semidefinite program (SDP) or an integer linear program for the cases of continuous or discrete phase shifts, respectively. Then, in order to solve the optimization problem for the multiuser scenario with continuous phase shifts, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm, which can alternately transform the problem into a second-order-cone program and an SDP. Finally, for the multiuser scenario with discrete phase shifts, we design a zero-forcing-based successive refinement algorithm, which can find the suboptimal transmit beamforming and phase shifts by means of alternating optimization. Numerical results show that compared with the benchmark schemes of random phase shifts and without using the RIS, the proposed algorithms can significantly increase the minimum achievable rate. It is also demonstrated that, compared with the case of programming continuous phase shifts, using 2-bit discrete phase shifts can practically achieve the same performance.},

Due to limited storage in numeric relays, having one setting for each network scenario in the relays is infeasible. Also, schemes with one setting considering grid-connected mode (GCM) and islanded mode (IM) of operation with multiple scenarios may be infeasible for a microgrid with inverter-interfaced DGs due to low short-circuit level in IM. Thus, this article proposes an adaptive trip characteristics-based relay coordination scheme for a microgrid with different DGs, where two trip characteristics are assigned to each DOCR, one each for GCM and IM. Also, a novel framework for selecting the suitable trip characteristic is proposed. Hardware-in-loop simulations using Numerical Relay Development Environment for a meshed CIGRE microgrid, modified IEEE 34-bus distribution system, and comparison with previous works validate the proposed method&#39;s performance for various scenarios, such as the outage of a DG or line, variations in solar irradiation and wind speed, and network reconfiguration for different fault types during GCM and IM.},

Traditional human identification methods usually require dedicated collection equipment or user cooperation, which limits the application scope of human identification. Recent research works have shown that Wi-Fi signals can support fine-grained sensing for human respiration. In this article, we leverage Wi-Fi signals to collect and recognize a unique physiological feature of humans, i.e., the respiration, for device-free and nonintrusive human identification. We propose a respiration sensing-based human identification system, namely BreathID. BreathID explores the nature of the amplitude and phase data in the CSI ratio model through vector analysis. By jointly using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and fake peak removal method, we accurately calculate the respiration rate and extract the breathing feature. We also propose a weighted multidimensional dynamic time warping (WMD-DTW) algorithm to realize the human identification based on multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology. We implement the BreathID system on commercial Wi-Fi devices. The results show that BreathID can identify 11 users in three typical scenarios in daily life with an average accuracy of 97.52\%. In particular, the average absolute error of the respiration rate in BreathID is about 0.1 bpm, which is better than the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

In contrast to traditional consensus studies, this article considers the leader-following consensus control for MASs with Markovian switching topology and spatial distribution characteristic under replay and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The system is guaranteed to achieve asymptotical stability by the method of segmented Lyapunov functions with the requirement that all topologies have a directed spanning tree with the leader as the root. Additionally, to save communication resources in PDE-based MASs, an improved dynamic event-triggered mechanism is employed, and it can improve the dynamic performance of the system compared to the traditional ones. Finally, a numerical example and comparative analysis are provided to verify the work in this article.},

  abstract     = {Smart meters in advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) collect fine-grained, real-time power consumption data may result in user privacy leakage. Aiming at the problem that existing privacy protection schemes cannot resist quantum attacks, an antiquantum privacy protection scheme in AMI of smart grid based on consortium blockchain and ring learning with errors (RLWE) is proposed. The scheme has the following contributions. First, the RLWE-based secure communication scheme is designed in this article, which ensures the resistance of the scheme to quantum attacks. Second, all smart meters in AMI use anonymous identity to communicate with the control center, and the fine-grained power consumption data is also encrypted and digitally signed to prevent user privacy leakage and tampering of power consumption data. And the scheme does not use bilinear pairings and exponential operations and has efficient computational performance. Third, a two-tier consortium blockchain storage system consisted of regional gateways and data aggregators are designed to eliminate the single point of failure problems of the data aggregators. The practical byzantine fault tolerance consensus mechanism is improved to reduce the communication cost in the consensus process. The scheme&#39;s security is proven theoretically, and the experimental results show that the scheme has a low computational cost.},

In-neighboring USVs&#39; information is aperiodically sampled for broadcasting over interaction channels subject to constant transmission delay. A nonfragile control protocol is novelly constructed for seeking the desired formation with tolerating controller gain fluctuation. The introduction of a continuous switching signal with two values encouragingly governs the packet loss phenomenon. With the utilization of nonsingular transformation method, algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional technique, one proves that the desired formation is achieved if a coupling relationship can be feasibly characterized by some sufficient conditions. For the description of global formation movement, a formation reference function in the nature of an unforced dynamic system with determined initial condition is promisingly derived.

This article presents a distributed multiarea state estimation approach based on the quadratic and exponential functions for power systems to deal with the non-Gaussian measurement noise efficiently. The matrix splitting technique is utilized to implement a robust estimator in a fully distributed scheme. Based on the local measurements and the limited information exchanged between neighboring areas, each local area only estimates its local states and the computation time needed is further reduced. The effective and robust performance of the proposed distributed multiarea state estimation approach is demonstrated using the IEEE 30-, 118-, and 300-bus systems.},

  abstract     = {A fast, accurate, robust, and two-staged islanding detection technique (IDT) is proposed. It is the hybridization of second-order general integrator-frequency locked loop (SOGI-FLL), Lissajous pattern (LP), and active power absorption-cum-reactive power injection via dc-bus connected battery unit-based inverter. The LP is used to identify islanding condition on the basis of frequency variation of fundamental voltage. Here, the measured ac voltage signal is preprocessed by SOGI-FLL to obtain fundamental bus voltage under various power quality scenarios. This assures robust islanding detection by removing uncertainty, and thus, reliability is improved. The uncertainty effects due to the partial shading condition of the PV module (source-side disturbance) and weak grid-connected condition are avoided by dc-bus connected battery storage unit. Thus, it removes above-said limitations of the existing scheme. The LP-based detection within the nondetection zone is expedited due to active and reactive powers variation via controlling of the inverter and charging operation of the dc-bus connected battery unit. During the reactive power injection by solar inverter, active power is absorbed by dc-bus connected battery unit. In effect, an active power output of the inverter is reduced. Here, the reactive power injection at the reduced active power output condition of the inverter accelerates frequency variation allowing rapid islanding detection. The real-time experiments are carried out using Typhoon-HIL tools to compare the proposed method with other works reported in the literature. Improved performances under diversified scenarios are found in the proposed case.},

It may also happen that during the switching operation of any system, component like a transformer, capacitor bank, nonlinear load, and lines, the protection function may fail to maintain security. The secure operation of any detection algorithm depends on the proper selection of key parameters and threshold settings. To enhance the HIAF detection process, the residual current is preprocessed using OTET. The cumulative sum of the fault detection index from the energy coefficients of OTET is used to take a suitable decision. Optimal parameters of the basis function in OTET are obtained using particle swarm optimization algorithm with a wide variety of fault and no-fault datasets. Further, the optimal value of a drift parameter is designed using OTET investigations and utilized in the fault detection index calculation. The selection mechanism incorporated in the method increases both dependability and security. It can be used for grid-connected/islanded modes of the system, different switching events, and grounding connections.

A challenge in operating a VPP is to characterize the cost function over its feasible power transfer region under DERs&#39; uncertainties. To address this challenge, a characterization method is proposed for the intraday operation of a VPP with nonanticipativity and robustness considerations to DERs&#39; uncertainties. The characterization stems from designing operational requirements subject to nonanticipativity and robustness, by which a feasible power transfer region across all the time periods is constructed by boundary points at each time period and time-coupling constraints. Furthermore, a cost function over the feasible power transfer region is formulated as the combination of convex piecewise surfaces and a constant compensation cost. Finally, a perspective to analyze the impacts of DERs&#39; uncertainties on feasible power transfer regions is studied. Numerical experiments in the IEEE 33-bus and 136-bus systems show that 1) our feasible power transfer region fulfills nonanticipativity and robustness to face DERs&#39; uncertainties, 2) our cost function covers the true operational cost of a VPP, and 3) impacts of DERs&#39; uncertainties on feasible power transfer regions can be measured by the product of their fluctuation intervals and system parameters.},

Then, we apply the concept of the ISS algorithm to optimize the original beam set in line with channel sparsity, with the goal of effectively characterizing the large original beam set with a small beam subset, resulting in a much smaller search space for the optimized beam subset than for the original beam set. Furthermore, we adopt two linear search algorithms on our optimized beam subset to develop efficient multibeam training methods. As shown in the simulation results, the ISS scheme shines in terms of low training complexity but performs poorly in spectral efficiency. In comparison to individual linear search methods, beam-subset-optimization-based linear search schemes not only have a greater spectral efficiency, but also have a very low training complexity.},

  abstract     = {The operation of a microgrid (MG) is easily affected by the environment, which leads to the change of communication topology among distributed generations (DGs). Most of the existing results on secondary control of MG consider that the topology connection is fixed, or just simply switched by arbitrary form. In this article, a more general semi-Markov process is introduced to describe such switching, i.e., the switching of communication topology is regarded as a random change process of system mode under general probability distribution. Then, out of the comprehensive consideration of inevitable network constraints, this article proposes distributed resilient secondary control method for AC islanded MG. In our control strategy, the network security, communication burden, and transmission delay are all considered in the controller design. An event detection mechanism is used as the transmission protocol for information interaction among DGs, reducing the communication burden effectively. And a cyber-attack model is introduced to follow the Bernoulli distribution, and the neighbors&#39; information of each DG may be attacked with possible probability. Based on feedback linearization, the studied secondary control problem is cast into distributed tracking synchronization of first-order multiagent systems. The Lyapunov functional method is used to prove the proposed strategy theoretically, and its effectiveness is verified by a modified IEEE 34 bus test system. The result shows that the proposed method can reduce the communication numbers by over 80\% under the premise of realizing frequency restoration and accurate real power sharing of AC islanded MG, and the transmission rate is also reduced by about 40\% compared with the existing general method.},

The optimization accounts for the fact that the level of satisfaction of the society, the living standards, and the social well-being are depended on the supply of energy, including electricity. Evidently, the lack of electric energy resulting from load shedding has an impact on both the mental and the psychical quality of life, which in turn affects the community resilience. The developed constrained community resilience optimization method is applied to two case studies, including a two-area 6-buses system and a modified IEEE RTS 24-bus system.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a unique design method for an adaptive neural network based backstepping-like control (ANNBC) scheme. The technique is employed for synthesizing the primary controller for inverter interfaced distributed generators (IIDGs) integrated to an autonomous distribution network. Further, an optimal distributed secondary control framework is developed for a multiple IIDGs-based autonomous distribution network. The secondary controller facilitates optimal gain selection to regulate the frequency of the system and voltage of the critical bus to their desired set points. The framework also achieves accurate real and reactive power sharing among the IIDGs according to their power ratings. The novel design procedure of the proposed control framework takes into account the entire system dynamics of the IIDG including the uncertain terms (viz., load current and network dynamics) and is completely independent of the system parameters information. Suitable update laws are designed for estimating the unknown weights of the neural network and the uncertain system parameters. Lyapunov analysis is used to show that the tracking errors and parameter estimation errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, case studies are conducted on a typical autonomous distribution network having a single and multiple IIDGs modeled in MATLAB/Simulink platform.},

  abstract     = {Multicarrier modulation shows the advantages of improving bandwidth efficiency in underwater acoustic (UWA) communications, whereas the more spectrum-efficient nonorthogonal frequency division multiplexing (NOFDM) is seldom investigated in the underwater scenario. The main idea of the NOFDM is to use overlapped subcarriers for increasing spectral efficiency. However, the NOFDM suffers from severe distortions both in the time and frequency domains because of the UWA channel&#39;s multipath propagation and Doppler spread. Considering these problems, we propose a novel time-reversal convolutional neural network (TR-CNN) based sparse NOFDM (S-NOFDM) scheme for UWA communication. The S-NOFDM waveform is determined by solving the sparse representation of input symbols under a set of nonorthogonal subcarriers, which can allocate symbols sparser to subcarriers and reduce distortion caused by multipath propagation and Doppler spread. The proposed TR-CNN is constructed with a time-reversal (T-R) convolutional layer where the T-R process is used to deal with multipath propagation. After the received signal has passed through the T-R layer, the main path of the UWA channel strength is enhanced and the other paths are weakened. The TR-CNN is also used to learn the inherent information between S-NOFDM symbols, improving UWA channel adaptability. After the training, the proposed scheme can be applied in the real-time UWA communication implementation. The simulation and experimental results prove that the proposed scheme outperforms the traditional scheme in signal detection and recovery. It is also robust with general capabilities in various UWA channel environments.},

  abstract     = {Demands for higher data rates is an inevitable fact. Therefore, the effect of the frequency selectivity and time variation of communication channels will be more significant. One effective technique to combat the doubly dispersive channels is generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) scheme. Nevertheless, nonorthogonality of the used prototype filter can deteriorate the GFDM performance. On the other hand, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a new revolutionary technology for future wireless networks. IRS can smartly reconfigure the propagation environment in order to improve the efficiency of the communication systems. In this article, IRS is applied in a GFDM communication system to enhance the system&#39;s performance. In this way, an IRS-assisted GFDM communication system model is proposed. The goal is to design the reflecting coefficients of the IRS such that the total noise power at a GFDM block is minimized. In order to obtain an effective solution, the optimization problem is converted to a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). The developed QCQP problem is convex, which can be solved by using an iterative algorithm. An analytical derivation of the maximum achievable rate (MAR) and bit error rate (BER) of the proposed IRS-assisted GFDM system is provided. Also, in simulations, the performance of the proposed method is compared with the conventional GFDM system in terms of MAR and BER. Simulation results confirm that using IRS by employing the proposed method dramatically improves the performance of a GFDM system.},

Resources in disaster are insufficient and should be reserved for emergencies. This article proposed a resource-saving approach, resource-saving shelter selection approach (RSSA) in short, which determines shelters for people by considering their relationships and locations. In other words, people are gathered with whom they care to the same shelter to maximize the resource-saving for disaster relief. In addition, RSSA is designed standalone on mobile devices to cope with the inevitable network failures. The simulation results reveal that 23\% of traveling costs are saved by RSSA compared to other approaches.},

As a practical solution to the problem, we propose a highly acceptable pair decision (HAPD) algorithm.

The optimization problem is solved at each time step through a distributed optimization algorithm, which has three main advantages: 1) agents of the network require a small computational power; 2) local information is not shared among the network nodes, hence preserving a certain level of privacy; and 3) it is suitable for implementation in large-scale systems. The resilience property of the algorithm stems from additional constraints that are enforced in order to store in the system enough energy to sustain the microgrid in the case of utility grid or line fault. Simulation results show that the algorithm is suitable to schedule the operation of agents that are always connected to the microgrid (e.g., loads) as well as agents that may be connected and disconnected (e.g., electric vehicles).},

Such problems are predominantly solved by converting the lower level problem into a set of equivalent constraints using the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker optimality conditions at an expense of binary variables. Furthermore, in case the lower level problem is nonconvex, the strong duality does not hold rendering the single-level reduction techniques inapplicable. To overcome this, we propose an effective numerical scheme based on bypassing the lower level completely using an approximation function that replicates the relevant lower level effect on the upper level. The approximation function is constructed by training a deep convolutional neural network. The numerical procedure is run iteratively to enhance the accuracy. As a case study, the proposed method is applied to a price-maker energy storage optimal bidding problem that considers an ac power flow-based market clearing in the lower level. The results indicate that greater actual profits are achieved as compared to the less accurate dc market representation.},

There has been a consistent rise in Android malware recently, with new variants adopting sophisticated detection avoidance techniques, including various forms of obfuscation. Hence, there is a need to improve the effectiveness of Android malware detection as obfuscation becomes more prevalent in the wild. In this article, we present a novel approach for obfuscated malware detection in IoT Android applications based on the visualization of app executables with Markov images. The app images are trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect obfuscated malware and for the identification of the obfuscation type. We evaluate the performance of the proposed system by experimenting with four different classification models using 12000 Android applications. The CNN model created to distinguish between malware and benign apps obtained an accuracy of 99.41\%. The model for identifying obfuscated malware from benign applications obtained 99.65\% accuracy while the model created to identify obfuscated malware from non-obfuscated malware yielded an accuracy of 99.81\%. The model for classifying obfuscated malware into 14 different obfuscation categories obtained an accuracy of 99.67\%. These results show that CNN models trained from Markov images generated using application byte code can be highly effective for obfuscated malware detection and classification. Moreover, our proposed system provides a more sustainable and cost-effective method for obfuscated malware detection compared to the manual feature-engineering-based approaches that are more prevalent in the current literature.},

  abstract     = {Securing the Android gadgets from malware activities is a major concern in Internet of Things, and the drastic rise in adversarial attacks makes this problem more challenging. Existing Android adversarial techniques focus on the feature vector space manipulations through complex deep learning techniques, and the operational integrity is also not experimented. This work implements two evasion attack scenarios on the feature vector of Android apks and creates functionality preserved Android malware. The malware samples are injected with features that are absent in malicious samples, but found in legitimate applications. The sample thus formed will be identical in functionality, besides having statistical dissimilarity. One of the attack scenarios implemented is through feature similarity using Euclidean distance (ED), which measures between malware and benign samples. The other version of attack is by generating variants through particle swarm optimization (PSO). We find that our evasion algorithms are not highly biased nor complex, making them easier to train and understand compared to generative adversarial neural networks. The experiments were carried out on real-world Android applications from AndroZoo and AMD. We could successfully achieve the highest performance of 100\% evasion rate with the PSO algorithm and 89.6\% evasion rate with the ED algorithm with the lowest computational complexity compared to machine learning or deep learning mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {In this article, resilient optimal gain control is presented for a multimachine power system for mismatched uncertainty compensation and to damp out the interarea oscillations. The proposed control scheme is analyzed in two substeps. In the first step, a power rate reaching law-based virtual control is designed, whereas the main control input in the second step is formulated using optimally tuned gains. Thus, this method does not incorporate multiple differentiation, unlike existing backstepping methods, hence eliminating magnitude limiter, rate limiter, and command filter dependence. The controller is designed by separating power system nonlinearities to eliminate complex expression from the control input that reduces the control computation. The proposed method has two steps procedure in control designing that suppresses the recursive step error in multistep virtual control formulation of backstepping methods. Furthermore, a nonlinear observer is designed using continuous twisting law with the integral surface design to counter the mismatched uncertainties along with the disturbance rejection. The proposed scheme is validated in MATLAB/Simulink and in real-time digital simulator platform of IEEE Standard New England 39-bus, 10-machine power system and compared with the existing methods.},

Specifically, we investigate the impact of the hyperparameters of the HOMs on the designed ER-based PEM system. Simulations are carried out for multiple smart homes under varying weather conditions to evaluate the effectiveness of HOMs in terms of selected performance metrics.

In this case, the reliable operation of BESS has a significant impact on system stability. One of the tools that ensures the secure BESS operation is applying a digital twin to forecast the BESS state of charge (SOC). It allows to predict BESS behavior and identify potential failures or cyberattacks in BESS. In this article, we compare multiple data-driven approaches to forecast the SOC of a BESS based on realistic dataset and real battery operation. Recurrent neural networks, e.g., feedforward neural network, gated recurrent unit, long short-term memory, support vector regression, random forest, and AdaBoost methods are applied to evaluate each method&#39;s performance. We compare the methods based on the maximum and average forecast errors, the required computational capacity, as well as expected training speed. To validate the results, in addition to the data gathered from simulations, we used experimental setup with a BESS of 79 kWh providing containment reserve for normal operation, which is a BESS service with a high economical potential in Nordic Region. Furthermore, we provide recommendations for the methods that are suitable to be applied for modeling the digital twin of a utility-scale battery digital twin.},

  abstract     = {Malicious jamming in congested, contested, and constrained wireless environments has stimulated the demand of jamming-resistant communications. Nevertheless, classical anti-jamming techniques suffer from not only an extremely low data rate but also the risk of being interfered by the recently developed high-power jammers. As a promising solution, dynamic spectrum access (DSA) with software-defined platforms and cognitive functionality has been conceptualized, while systematic design remains an open issue. To this end, in this article, we propose a cognitive software-defined network (CSDN) architecture. Based on this, spectrum semantic extraction is developed to remove irrelevant spectrum features, such that learning a frequency preconfiguration policy (for DSA) can directly utilize the spectrum occupancy information. In order to learn the policy online, we propose a novel kernel-based distributed actor-critic algorithm, where the kernel method and online feature admission are exploited to make policy learning more adaptive. Numerical results show that semantics-driven reinforcement learning (RL) makes policy learning more efficient and accurate. Moreover, the proposed RL outperforms various baseline algorithms in terms of the strength in adapting to dynamic jamming patterns as well as the convergence speed of policy learning. Finally, a testbed is prototyped to validate the CSDN-based intelligent spectrum anti-jamming communication system.},

To capture the significant information from the multimodal data, we use the one-dimensional convolution neural network to extract the dissolved gas feature and deep residual squeeze-and-excitation neural network to extract the infrared images feature. And then, the multimodal mutual attention method extracts the significant information from dissolved gas feature and infrared images feature. Finally, the health assessment is output by Softmax. The dataset contains 41 power transformers with 1000 days operation. Through the experimental results, the presented method obtains a high classification accuracy and the accurate health assessment of the power transformer.

Therefore, dc–dc converters are needed to interconnect those VSC-HVDC grids and several technical issues on their control and operational systems must be adequately addressed. A dc–dc converter based on a modular-dual active bridge (M-DAB) converter is suggested to reach a desirable interconnection of the HVDC grids and regulate power flow (PF) between them. A dynamic averaged model is proposed for the M-DAB converter and its stability is analyzed using the Lyapunov function. Moreover, a new local controller based on nonlinear control theory is proposed for the M-DAB. The new M-DAB local controller is integrated with the energy management system (EMS), by updating the PF equations, to create a complete control structure. Considering the CIGRE DCS3 HVDC test system and the studied M-DAB, static, dynamic simulation, and experimental studies are conducted and the dc–dc converter and the performance of the designed controllers and the EMS are examined and validated.},

  abstract     = {Self-sustained microgrid (MG) carries the potential to replicate a conventional grid network with a smooth and robust control scheme to generate and disseminate power with the integration of diverse renewable sources by employing the voltage source inverter (VSI). The power generation capability is the primary function of VSI in an inverter-based distributed generation (DG). In addition, it is also operated to perform the task of demand-side management with the utilization of the conservation voltage reduction (CVR) strategy. In a conventional distribution network, the CVR strategy is exploited by voltage deduction within permissible range with the support of open-loop schemes, such as tap changers, capacitors, or close-loop schemes, such as supervisory control and data acquisition system. However, the CVR&#39;s applicability in a standalone MG is still a viable approach to be delved into and hence, this article intends to employ CVR by utilizing the conventional P-f droop and V-I droop principle in inverter-based DG. The proposed strategy produces voltage compensation according to the degree of voltage or frequency variation and therefore, the degree of voltage reduction is not fixed but it varies with the disturbance. The proposed control mechanism relies on the deviation of the voltage generated by the V-I droop and frequency output provided by the P-f droop during the overloading and peak demand condition. In addition to it, a control methodology is devised to check the coordination between CVR and load shedding strategy to shed load during overloading conditions. The performance testing of the proposed control methodology is being validated through real-time Opal-RT device.},

Therefore, high quality of service (QoS) routing is essential to the secure and robust operation of the WISNs. Specifically, the QoS routing optimization in WISN is a nondeterministic polynomial hard problem, which usually cannot be solved by ordinary algorithms. Based on this motivation, a novel heuristic trust scheme (i.e., multi-objective trust routing scheme based on cloned elite slime mould algorithm (CESMA-MTRS)) is proposed to greatly improve the security and QoS of WISN. The scheme designs a novel trust difference test mechanism to enhance the identification of malicious nodes. Furthermore, a new elite archiving strategy and clone optimization strategy are designed to improve the convergence speed of grid monitoring data transmission routing search. The simulation results show that when the network scale is 100 and the attacked node scale is 30\%, CESMA-MTRS reduces the delay by 8\% and 15\% and the packet loss rate by 24\% and 27\%, respectively, compared with trust-based routing protocol called the On-demand trust-based multicast routing protocol (ODTMRP) and evolutionary selfcooperative trust approach.},

In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of deep learning (DL)-based IPdM for the researchers and practitioners who focused on the promotion of fault diagnosis/prognosis. First of all, four mainstream algorithms of DL are reviewed around the specific IPdM applications of recent five years. Some prominent discussions and insights on the DL-based IPdM are given here in terms of data characteristics and model performance. Particularly, as an important contribution, a new industrial dataset of dual-bearings rotating machinery is published for opening research to address one of the main challenges for the development of DL-based IPdM, i.e., the shortage of high quality industrial datasets. Compared with current datasets, our dataset is multisensory, which is closer to reality and more suitable for building advanced DL-based IPdM models. We also give a DL-based case study to demonstrate how to build a predictive model for maintenance decisions based on this dataset. Finally, potential research trends and challenges are also discussed for enhancing the intelligence of IPdM in the industrial scenarios.},

Moreover, we formulate an optimization problem to show that hovering the UAV at a certain optimal position can result in maximizing the sum capacity of the network.

  abstract     = {With the continuous development of Internet of Things, data transmission presents an exponential rising trend. Due to the limited energy storage and low transmission power of sensor nodes, it is impossible to continuously transmit a large amount of collected data to the remote cloud center for a long time. To guarantee the data reliability and extend the lifetime of sensor nodes, we use unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted data collection for data transmission to improve the performance of the network. As each sensor node has a certain business requirement for unloaded data volume, the flight trajectory and node access scheme are jointly optimized to minimize the energy consumed by all the sensing nodes. First, a model regarding the minimization problem of the maximum energy consumption was constructed. To effectively solve this nonconvex problem, the block coordinate descent method and slack variable method are used to transform the original optimization problem into two subproblems: trajectory optimization problem and node access scheme optimization problem. Second, an algorithm is proposed using the successive convex approximation to jointly optimize the flight trajectory and node access scheme. This algorithm acquires the optimal node access scheme and UAV flight trajectory successively in each iteration. When the number of iterations is great enough, the minimum–maximum energy consumption of sensing nodes is gradually converged. The simulation results showed that in comparison with the basic UAV flight scheme, the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the energy consumption of nodes and improve the data transmission rate, and meanwhile, this algorithm is characterized by favorable convergence and tolerable complexity.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an enhanced control strategy for renewable energy resources connected to the grid through voltage-sourced converters (VSCs) in microgrids. The proposed scheme contains a voltage control loop with the minimum inverter switching, a power-sharing controller with the minimum inverter switching, a negative-sequence current controller, and a loop to identify the control system operation mode. All the controllers are designed using the multipurpose finite control set-model predictive control (FCS-MPC) strategy. Since these controllers use the dynamic current and VSC voltage, they can be applied in grid-connected and island operation modes and transferred between them. The method uses voltage–frequency control instead of power control for VSCs. One inverter controls voltage, and the other controls current. The conventional FCS-MPC is enhanced to reduce the computation power by eightfold. This improvement is significant because the maximum switching frequency is limited in practical implementations. Also, the superiority of the proposed multipurpose control scheme is proved theoretically. Simulation is implemented using MATLAB software and compared with methods in the literature. The simulation demonstrates that the presented control strategy is efficient, authentic, and compatible. The proposed method is also tested and validated in hardware experiments.},

The system consists of a multiantenna power station (PS) that transmits wireless radio frequency (RF) power signals, a multiantenna information receiver (IR) that collects RF information signals, and several single-antenna wireless devices (WDs). Harvest-then-transmit protocol is implemented by the WDs. Thus, WDs at first harvest energy from the signals transmitted by PS and then uses the harvested energy to simultaneously transmit information to the IR. We maximize the energy efficiency of the system by jointly optimizing the energy beamformer of the PS, the information receiving beamformer of the IR, IRS phase shift, and the energy/information transfer time. The formulated optimization problem is a nonconvex fractional problem. To tackle the fractional term, the main problem is transformed using the Dinkelbach technique. Then, the transformed problem is decomposed into several subproblems, and a solution is obtained for each subproblem. Following that, a joint solution to the transformed problem is obtained by alternatively optimizing the subproblems. In addition, we obtained computationally low-complex solutions for the proposed system by utilizing fixed beamforming techniques i.e., maximum ratio transmission and zero-forcing-receive beamforming. Numerical results confirm that the proposed system has a better energy efficiency performance compared with the benchmark schemes.},

The coordinated dynamic economic dispatch for integrated electricity and natural gas systems (IENs) is increasingly essential. Since electricity and natural gas systems belong to different administrative organizations, we build a coordinated economic dispatch model for IENs and propose a decentralized algorithm to realize collaborative distributed control. A distributed algorithm based on multiparametric programming and benders cuts is proposed to crack the optimization problem in a decentralized way. The quadratic exchanging function is built to accelerate the convergence speed, and the auxiliary variables relaxation method is applied to deal with the infeasible subproblems. The global convergence of the proposed methods is proved in detail. Furthermore, from the point of view of both iteration number and computation time, simulation results demonstrate that the computational performance of the proposed method is far superior to the popular decentralized methods.},

In recent years, data-driven approaches have been used to estimate the RUL. However, without a deeper understanding of process systems and their failure mechanisms, it is challenging to estimate the RUL for process systems. This demands an approach that integrates data with mechanistic understanding. This article proposes a model to estimate the RUL of process systems in real time by monitoring the system&#39;s fault condition. The fault is modeled using real-time observed data, while the progression of fault to failure is modeled using mechanistic understanding. These steps are carried out using a novel mixed model combining machine learning-based autonomous fault diagnosis with root cause analysis and a statistical degradation model. The autonomous RUL estimation method is then developed as a self-learning model. A fault dictionary is developed to store the fault patterns and failure margin for different failure conditions. The proposed approach is benchmarked using the Tennessee Eastman process.},

We study the joint optimization of computation offloading and resource allocation (CORA) with the objective of minimizing the system cost of processing tasks subject to the processing delay and transmission rate constraints. To attack the challenges brought by the dynamic environment, we use the Markov decision process model for formulating the dynamic optimization problem, and apply a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique to deal with high-dimensional and continuous states and action spaces. Then, we design a CORA algorithm, which is able to effectively learn the optimal scheme by adapting to the network dynamics. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted, in which we compare the CORA algorithm with both non-DRL algorithms and DRL algorithms. The experimental results show that the CORA algorithm outperforms others with excellent training convergence and performance in processing delay and processing cost.},

The green fog layer consists of three components: a self-powered edge server, wireless solar routers, and a new device resulted from the integration between a solar-powered smart camera and a solar-powered road side unit in order to create a better sensing mechanism of the road traffic. A proper power management strategy is suggested to be installed locally in the self-powered devices to decrease their power utilization and lengthen the lifetime of their batteries. On the system level, the design steps concentrate on building a sustainable, secured, reliable, and scalable communication infrastructure and this was done by adopting several approaches, such as VANET fog clustering, malicious nodes detection, and a combination of various security methods.

  abstract     = {Network intrusion detection is used to detect unauthorized activities on a digital network, with which the cybersecurity teams of organizations can then kick-start prevention protocols to protect the security of their networks and data. In real-life scenarios, due to the lack of high-quality attack instance data, building an in-depth network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is always challenging for a single enterprise, in terms of handling complex network security threats. To remedy the problem, this article proposes an efficient intrusion detection system called dynamic weighted aggregation federated learning (DAFL) based on federated learning. Specifically, DAFL has used the full advantages of federated learning for data privacy preservation. Moreover, compared to a conventional federated-learning based intrusion detection system, our scheme has implemented dynamic filtering and weighting strategies for local models. In this way, DAFL can perform better in detecting network intrusions with less communication overhead. We give the detailed designs of DAFL, and our experimental results demonstrate that DAFL can achieve excellent detection performance with a low network communication overhead, with data privacy preserved.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has made it possible for health institutions to have remote diagnosis, reliable, preventive, and real-time decision-making. However, the anonymity and privacy of patients are not considered in IoT. Therefore, this article proposes a blockchain-based anonymous system, known as GarliMediChain, for providing anonymity and privacy during COVID-19 information sharing. In GarliMediChain, garlic routing and blockchain are integrated to provide low-latency communication, privacy, anonymity, trust, and security. Also, COVID-19 information is encrypted multiple times before transmitting to a series of nodes in the network. To ensure that COVID-19 information is successfully shared, a blockchain-based coalition system is proposed. The coalition system enables health institutions to share information while maximizing their payoffs. In addition, each institution uses the proposed fictitious play to study the strategies of others in order to update its belief by selecting the best responses from them. Furthermore, simulation results show that the proposed system is resistant to security-related attacks and is robust, efficient, and adaptive. From the results, the proposed proof-of-epidemiology-of-interest consensus protocol has 15.93\% less computational cost than 26.30\% of proof-of-work and 57.77\% proof-of-authority consensus protocol, respectively. Nonetheless, the proposed GarliMediChain system promotes global collaborations by combining existing anonymity and trust solutions with the support of blockchain technology.},

This article proposes a new approach to identify the fault location in a multiterminal nonhomogenous ac microgrid. Implemented method utilizes the information of traveling waves (TW) with the help of intelligent electronic devices connected at the end terminals of the test system. Proposed approach is independent of the propagation velocity of TW for the estimation of fault. Algorithm identifies the fault section using an approach that utilizes the difference of change in voltage difference (prefault and during fault) at different buses. Then, variational mode decomposition signal processing technique is applied to TW waves captured at the fault section terminals, to estimate the fault location. This scheme is implemented on IEEE 33 bus system, modeled in electromagnetic transients including dc/power systems computer aided design (EMTDC/PSCAD), to validate the methodology. Impacts of variations in fault resistance, input noise level, and inception angle has been considered for the validation of proposed scheme. The outcome of test results indicates that the proposed method gives better performance compared to the conventional TW-based techniques.},

In this article, a cyberattack model using stealthy FDIs on load or generation units is formulated that may result in multiple transmission line overflows without being detected by bad data detection (BDD) algorithms embedded in ac state-estimation. A detection framework based on neural networks is developed that uses bad data generated from the attack model for training purposes and detects the stealthy FDIs. Results confirm the detection of stealthy FDIs with accuracy and precision higher than 99\% with 0–15\% measurement noise levels.

Therefore, the resource allocation problem has been formulated with the objective function of maximizing the V2I link&#39;s rate with the constraints of quality of service. Due to its NP hard nature, the original resource allocation problem is divided into two subproblems of power control and pairing. The power control subproblem is transformed into a convex problem using an exponential variable change. A fuzzy decision-making method is exploited to solve the pairing subproblem to have a highly reliable and stable V2V link. Then, the proposed joint power control and pairing-based resource allocation technique is evaluated with a simulated highway and compared with similar pairing algorithms. These performance comparisons reveal that the stability of the proposed resource allocation technique outperforms the other related methods.},

Aided by uniformly spaced pilot symbols, the direct least-square CFR estimation can enable reliable symbol-by-symbol data demodulation within the same OFDM block, based on the principle of generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). Such GLRT-based OFDM can be easily incorporated with single-input multiple-output (SIMO) antenna technique to enhance data demodulation over quasi-static channels exhibiting random multipaths. In this article, an upper bound to the average bit error probability (BEP) is analytically derived for this GLRT-based SIMO–OFDM system over quasi-static random multipath channels. The analysis is generally applicable to arbitrary two-dimensional component modulations when the quasi-static SIMO channel consists of independent but not necessarily identically distributed random channel paths with Rician or Rayleigh distributed path response magnitudes. The BEP upper bound facilitates the error performance characterization of the GLRT-based SIMO–OFDM system with respect to data-to-noise power ratio, data-to-pilot power ratio, antenna diversity, pilot density, and pilot power allocation.},

Although many sleep monitoring systems have been developed recently, they have limitations in achieving a good performance at low cost. To address this issue, this article proposes a new system based on channel-state information of domestic WiFi network to monitor both turnover activities and breathing rate of sleepers. Unlike recent approaches placing receiving antennas close to each other, scattered placement is adopted to fully exploit spatial diversity of receiving antennas. More importantly, a new error correction method is proposed to accurately recognize turnover activities. Based on the interrelation between consecutive activities, the proposed method can effectively correct the recognition errors of existing methods including convolutional neural network. Then, for accurately estimating breathing rate, both a new subcarrier selection method and a new peak identification method are proposed. Experiment results show that our system can significantly improve the recognition accuracy of eight typical sleep turnover activities and four typical sleep postures. We can achieve the mean accuracy of 94.59\% and 95.83\% on the recognition of turnover activities and sleep postures, respectively. Besides, our system can also significantly improve the estimation accuracy of breathing rate especially in tough scenarios, such as prone and side-lying positions.},

How to gain signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) of more users while assuring system stability becomes a problem that has to be solved urgently. In this article, a multi-BS heterogeneous network system model which is equipped with renewable energy (RE) production devices is constructed and a hybrid optimization algorithm which is composed of a linear programming (LP) algorithm and multiobjective genetic algorithm is proposed. The hybrid algorithm considers RE output and existing inventory of batteries of BSs comprehensively and maximizes the sum of SINR (sum-SINR) of users in the system through user scheduling and beam forming. First, the hybrid algorithm relaxes the binary parameters of user scheduling into a continuous value during user scheduling, thus changing the mixed integer nonlinear programming problem into an LP problem. As a result, user scheduling scheme of maximizing sum-SINR of the system is solved. Subsequently, the algorithm changes the maximum sum-SINR problem of the system into a multiobjective optimization (MOP) problem of maximum SINR of different BSs during beam forming. The fast nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II that carries the elitist strategy gains the Pareto frontier of MOP based on semidefinite programming constraint and finds the beam forming scheme of maximum sum-SINR of the system. According to stimulation results, the proposed hybrid optimization algorithm can increase sum-SINR of system users effectively while assuring the system stability.},

  abstract     = {The inclusion of autonomous vehicles into our society requires not only mature automated technologies but also adequate confidence in safety guarantees. Safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF) is an incipient important field that focuses on risk led by performance limitations rather than faults. There are still plenty of gaps in addressing it, especially when concerning perception ability. This article introduces a method to evaluate SOTIF-oriented perception effectiveness for forward obstacle detection of autonomous vehicles. Both inevitable existence uncertainty and state uncertainty in perception results are taken into account, and a formal SOTIF requirement specification is defined. Based on the safety distance model, we further deduce the minimum required perception area and the perception error requirements under a given driving situation to refine the SOTIF requirement specification. Then, a SOTIF-oriented unified sensing model is established by combining sensing space and ability characteristics. The system-level perception ability of an autonomous vehicle is subsequently deduced with the assumption that every available sensor is described in the form of our proposed sensing model. Evaluation can be executed according to the above methods that support determining the SOTIF requirements and the system-level perception ability, and the entire evaluation process is presented as an algorithm in this article. Finally, a practical case generated according to a well-known autonomous vehicle prototype is used to prove the effectiveness of the method. Evaluation results can serve as suggestions to improve the overall SOTIF level for perception.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a cooperative quadrature index modulation (QIM)-based orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, named OFDM-QIM, with per-subcarrier relay selection (RS), where the OFDM-QIM mapping is adopted to determine both the active subcarrier subsets and the modulated symbols for higher spectral efficiency, and per-subcarrier RS is employed to choose the decode-and-forward relay with maximum channel gain for each active subcarrier to provide better system reliability. Considering both the perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI), the closed-form average outage probability (AOP) and the upper bound of average bit error probability (ABEP) of the cooperative OFDM-QIM system with per-subcarrier RS are derived based on the order statistics and the union upper bound method, respectively. Meanwhile, through the asymptotic analysis of the AOP and the ABEP under the perfect CSI, full diversity can be achieved as the relay number. Numerical results verify the correctness of the theoretical derivation. In addition, the proposed cooperative OFDM-QIM system obtains the improved AOP and ABEP performance over the conventional cooperative OFDM with index modulation system and the non-cooperative OFDM-QIM system.},

  abstract     = {In federated learning (FL), to minimize the convergence time while reaching a desired accuracy, it is important to select appropriate mobile devices (MDs) as participants with the considerations of their characteristics (e.g., data distribution, channel condition, and computing power). In this article, we first formulate a Markov decision process-based MD selection problem in which the increased accuracy per unit-time is maximized. To solve the formulated problem without any prior knowledge of the environment, a deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm can be exploited. However, storing previous experiences into the replay memory for DQN consumes an increased time since the FL server needs to conduct a number of actual FL procedures and observe the resulted rewards. To address this problem, we proposed a virtual experience-based MD selection algorithm (VE-MSA). In VE-MSA, the FL server generates virtual experiences (especially reward) without any actual FL procedures by using two neural networks approximating the round time and the increased accuracy in a round according to the selected MDs, respectively. Evaluation results demonstrate that the derived optimal policy can achieve a target accuracy within the shortest time among comparison schemes.},

  abstract     = {This work introduces a novel polynomial chaos expansion (PCE)-based method for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in power systems, addressing probabilistic optimal power flow problem. The proposed approach leverages upon a series of transformations to overcome two main hinders to deploying POPF in practice, i.e., the vast number of random variables (RVs) and their interdependence. The proposed Lite-PCE method requires a small set of optimal power flow samples. The most important transformation is developed based on a Clayton copula to convert substantially large dimensional input variables into a single RV for efficient computing. The transformation allows Lite-PCE to be built on a single RV and offers a significant computational benefit while working with a large number of random renewable injections. The method also handles correlated random injection variables with different types of distributions in a nonparametric fashion. The Lite-PCE method is also used to develop the concept of transmission capacity sensitivity under uncertainty using coefficients of variation. The concept and nonparametric, scalable simulations are demonstrated using various IEEE test cases, up to the 1354-Bus system with 1242 random injection variables. The UQ results illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the method for systems of considerable size and a high number of renewable injections.},

This evidence indicates that the uncertainty features of wind power output from large-scale wind farms are not fixed but dependent on expansion decisions. The decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) will alter the traditional optimization process and pose solution challenges. This article proposes a coordinated planning model for large-scale wind farms and energy storage considering DDU. First, a DDU model, which quantifies the relationship between wind power prediction errors and the wind farm size, is established based on historical data. The proposed DDU model for a single wind farm is extended to multiple wind farms with their spatial correlation captured by a Gaussian Mixture Model. Then, tackling the coupling relationship between decisions and uncertainty, an affine function-based solution method for the stochastic model with decision-dependent probability distributions is proposed. The constructed affine function maps planning decisions to decision-dependent wind power scenario sets via linear transformation. The difference between the planning model with and without the DDU in wind power is compared and discussed. Case studies verify the proposed model and solution method.},

To fully utilize the bistatic MIMO radar structure, we develop a high-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD)-based algorithm for the direction-of-departure (DOD) and direction-of-arrival (DOA) joint estimation. It is worth noting that HOSVD divides the DOD and DOA into two independent dimensions, thus generating cross items. Consequently, it is difficult to obtain the exact DOD and DOA results. To address this issue, a pairing algorithm is introduced in this article to connect the DOD and DOA parameters, where the relationship between the covariance tensor and covariance matrix is utilized. Furthermore, the Cramér–Rao bound for the proposed compressive bistatic MIMO radar is derived, and computational complexity is also analyzed from the perspective of received signal dimension. Numerical simulations verify that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional MIMO radar, and the proposed tensor-based algorithm has a better estimation performance than the matrix-based MUSIC.},

  abstract     = {Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is gradually changing the mode of production, in which users can directly access data from smart devices through the network instead of collecting data where the smart devices are deployed. However, the data from these smart devices is usually transmitted via an insecure channel, which raises several security concerns. To solve these security issues, many authentication and key agreement schemes have been proposed. Nevertheless, the majority of said schemes only achieve authentication between one user and one smart device. When a user wants to access multiple smart devices simultaneously, he has to initiate multiple requests of key agreement, which incurs computation and communication costs. In this article, a secure one-to-many authentication and key agreement scheme for IIoT is put forward. Specifically, three factors, namely, smart card, password, and biometrics, are used to authenticate the user in the proposed scheme. By utilizing elliptic curve cryptography and Chinese remainder theorem, the different session keys between one user and multiple smart devices are agreed upon once, meaning the user only needs to initiate one request for authentication with multiple smart devices. Furthermore, security proof and analysis demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure under the real-or-random model and can withstand a wide range of common attacks. Lastly, performance evaluation reveals that the proposed scheme requires less computational and communication costs compared with the related schemes, which is essential for smart device networks, operating with limited resources.},

We integrated ArduPilot with the Android mobile platform, which equips DIY drones with AI computing power and 4G/5G connectivity. Embedded control software is developed to cooperate with the AI Wings cloud. Users can easily convert ArduPilot drones into AIoT drones using Android phones, and connect to a cloud server to create their own Internet of Drones.

The virtual simulation enables users to test software/hardware configurations as well as train AI models. Moreover, to ensure secure communication, we propose an authentication protocol based on elliptic-curve cryptography with pseudoidentities and time freshness check. In summary, AI Wings provides a cloud server for commanding drone fleets securely, software/hardware design for AIoT drones, and VR simulation for training and testing AI models.

The optimization problem is modelled as a weighted directed hypergraph matching game based on group preference, which is proven to achieve stable results. To address the topological change problem of UAV networks, a fast convergence algorithm is proposed in this article, which exhibits high stability when small fluctuations appear in the UAV topology.

Then, a novel detecting and tracking dynamic vehicle approach is designed based on the obtained 2-D scan. The approach classifies the FS points into static points and unstatic points by generating a Dempster–Shafer (D–S) evidence theory-based static obstacle map (SOM). At first, the SOM is predicted and updated by interacting with the model-free dynamic vehicle clustering and tracking module (MFCTM). Then, the unstatic points determined in SOM are clustered in the MFCTM, and each obtained cluster is initialized as a new track or assigned to the existing tracks. Finally, the dynamic states are calculated. The computational burden performance of the proposed method is compared with that of the other state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, it is also applied to three simulation scenarios and three field tests, and its validity is demonstrated through comparison with the results of the L-shape-based tracking method.},

  abstract     = {The detection of deceptive jamming in low probability of intercept/low probability of detection (LPI/LPD) tactical communications has been receiving increasing attention, especially in the context of radar communications. In this article, we propose a novel deep-learning-based algorithm, named two-stage deceptive jammer detection (TDJD), for pseudonoise (PN) code-integrated linear frequency modulation chirp jamming signals in radar communications. Specifically, the proposed algorithm uses the time–frequency distribution (TFD) and in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) representations of the received signals to obtain more discriminating features for the detection of unknown deceptive jammers under the realistic assumption that information about the deceptive jammer, such as the PN-code signal, power, and range, is not available. In particular, the received radar signals are converted into two kinds of TFD representations using the Choi–William distribution (CWD) and I/Q representations. Next, a two-stage approach based on deep learning-enabled outlier detection and automatic modulation classification techniques is applied to the CWD and I/Q representations to extract high-level features for jammer detection. Simulation results show that the TDJD algorithm outperforms other relevant deep learning algorithms in terms of the probability of detection and the probability of false alarm. In addition, the TDJD algorithm provides accurate detection at a low signal-to-jammer-plus-noise ratio.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the issue of exponential synchronization in complex dynamical networks. First, the nonfragile memory sampled-data control is used to mitigate the impact of controller uncertainties. Second, an augmented Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) is built using a modified two-sided looped-functional that requires the positive definite only at sampling instants instead of throughout the sampling period. Moreover, the constructed LKF takes into account the whole sampling period and encompasses information on both the current states and the delayed states. Some exponential synchronization criteria are obtained by combining the Wirtinger-based integral inequality with the optimal reciprocally convex technology, and this scheme results in a larger sampling upper bound. At last, two extensively used numerical simulation examples confirm the proposed method&#39;s validity and advantage.},

  abstract     = {Environmental and energy security concerns lead to the continuous displacement of traditional fossil fuel-based power generation to power electronics interfaced distributed generations (DGs). Increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and the substitution of synchronous generators with power electronic converters have resulted in reduced power system inertia and damping. This causes large frequency deviations and a higher rate of change of frequency. The fast and flexible nature of the energy storage system with a designed controller can achieve frequency stability in low inertia microgrids (MGs). The conventional proportional-integral-based virtual inertia controller is unable to eliminate frequency instability in low inertia MG. To enhance frequency stability, this article proposes a virtual inertia emulation strategy using a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm for fast frequency regulation of MGs with inverter-based DGs. A comparative analysis of the TD3 scheme and the conventional method is made. The results show that the TD3-based virtual inertia control provides better tracking with a 56.6\% reduction in frequency deviation and faster transient recovery than the conventional virtual inertia control against a broad range of operational scenarios. Performance metrics and simulation results are shown to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed control scheme.},

However, a dozen years of PEKS development is accompanied by some security and privacy issues in the encrypted data search and access processes. The keyword guessing attack is a typical user privacy threat model, that is, an adversary could guess the user’s retrieval keyword given a search trapdoor. On the other hand, the emergence of quantum computers make traditional PEKS schemes no longer secure. Although scholars put forward some postquantum secure PEKS schemes, these schemes are based on lattice cryptography with a larger key size. To the best of our knowledge, there is no quantum-resist PEKS scheme established on elliptic curve cryptography. This article utilizes PEKS with designated tester primitive and quantum resistance of isogeny. Then, we put forward a postquantum searchable encryption scheme named Isoga, which fights against keyword guessing attacks. We prove Isoga’s searchable ciphertext security and trapdoor indistinguishability under isogeny-related difficult assumptions. Performance evaluation indicates that the Isoga scheme is more practical in the quantum environment, considering seven schemes’ security properties, communication cost, and computing overload among.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular edge computing (VEC) effectively reduces the computing load of vehicles by offloading computing tasks from vehicle terminals to edge servers. However, offloading of tasks increase in quantity the transmission time and energy of the network. In order to reduce the computing load of edge servers and improve the system response, a shared offloading strategy based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed for the complex computing environment of Internet of Vehicles (IoVs). The shared offloading strategy exploits the commonality of vehicles task requests, similar computing tasks coming from different vehicles can share the computing results of former task submitted. The shared offloading strategy can be adapted to the complex scenarios of the IoVs. Each vehicle can share the offloading conditions of the VEC servers, and then adaptively select three computing modes: local execution, task offloading, and shared offloading. In this article, the network state and offloading strategy space are the input of the deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Through the DRL, each task unit selects the offloading strategy with the optimal energy consumption at each time period in the dynamic IoVs transmission and computing environment. Compared with the existing proposals and DRL-based algorithms, it can effectively reduce the delay and energy consumption required for tasks offloading.},

Due to the geographical distributions and distances of the edge, cloud, and mobile terminal, promoting cost efficiency and reducing the makespan of applications are urgent targets. For multiple mobile applications, the soft deadline constraint for each application is common in the edge-cloud environment. When multiple users initiate application requests, scheduling on the target offloaded platform commences. Some workflows, especially newly arrived workflows, might suffer from “starving to death,” which has the risk of being missed. This article describes a dynamic, multiworkflow offloading, and scheduling, adaptive heterogeneous earliest-finish-time-based algorithm, which can lightly run on a distributed network. We explore an innovative model composed of a multiobjective makespan and cost for a soft deadline constraint optimization problem. Abundant data are adopted to test the offloading and scheduling effect on a variety of platform parameters, and comparative experiments demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the adaptive system.},

A spatial sparsity-based pilot attack detection (SS-based-PAD) method is proposed in this study to determine whether there is an active eavesdropper. Different data transmission schemes were developed according to the detection results. In the presence of an eavesdropper, rate maximization power allocation (SRM-PA) algorithm is proposed to maximize the security of the eavesdropped user. On the contrary, achievable rate equalization power allocation (ARE-PA) algorithm is proposed to provide fair services for all legitimate users.

Therefore, we deploy deep learning algorithms (both in edge servers and mobile terminals) by considering the delay and energy consumption constraints of terminals in task processing. Specifically, a lightweight federated learning model is first proposed through the cooperative training between edge servers and mobile terminals. The trained model is then migrated to mobile terminals. Finally, image identification is considered to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed model. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the model reaches 90\% using two datasets and three network models. In addition, it further reduces the processing delay and saves energy.},

The proposed disperse transformation distributes the impulsive noise component to multiple physical resource elements. The transformed impulsive noise exhibits greater Gaussianity and better matches the Gaussian assumption of the EP algorithm. The associated channel sparsification can alleviate the adverse effects of deleterious message propagation caused by impulsive noise during the iterative process. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed REP detector exhibits greater resilience to impulsive noise than the classical EP detector, especially for systems with a high probability of impulsive noise occurrence and/or high-order modulation.},

Then, a position vector is introduced to indicate where lane key point is in the grid. Meanwhile, the novel rolling convolution layer following with the down-sampling and up-sampling convolution layer has been designed for good feature extraction, ensuring each feature grid perceives all other grid features in the feature map. Then, an adaptive hyperparameter branch is introduced to calculate the binary threshold effectively. Finally, the detected lane points are classified into different lanes by introducing distance-based quaternion.

Thus, it is inappropriate to only consider the power risks as the risk assessment for the system with the strong coupling between cyber systems and power systems. In this article, we investigate a dynamic risk assessment model for the cyber-physical power system (CPPS) against cyberattacks, combining the network security vulnerability of the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system in a substation and physical consequences in power systems caused by it under malicious control. By construction, a dynamic network security vulnerability assessment method for the SCADA system is well studied by considering SVs and deployed network security defense measures, which is also corrected by the propagation characteristics. Moreover, we estimate physical consequences by minimum shedding loads in N-1 contingencies caused by the SCADA system in a substation under malicious control. Finally, simulations on modified IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems verify the proposed model&#39;s effectiveness, highlighting the importance of network security in CPPS.},

  abstract     = {The monitoring and control of power distribution systems requires an accurate and stable time synchronization infrastructure. The major requirement for a time synchronization system is sharing a global time throughout the network. This article provides an overview of the synchronization techniques implemented in power distribution systems. The implementation of different techniques for time synchronization due to heterogeneous communication infrastructure creates various challenges in the system. Therefore, this article aims to propose a homogeneous, uniform approach for a network-based synchronization mechanism in or to implement multiple distribution system applications. For this purpose, the precision time protocol (PTP), IEEE 1588, is tested experimentally for various time criticality with an Ethernet-based communication network. The testbed uses single board computers to explore different criticality of the timestampings for IEEE 1588 (PTP) to determine how various applications need different type of timestamping depending upon the performance, cost, and accuracy requirements. These different levels of timestamping requirements for synchronization affect the performance of a range of next-generation distribution system applications. The proposed solution provides monitoring for each application using only a single time synchronization technique with an Ethernet-based network.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, with excessive integration of renewable energy sources (RESs), the distribution systems face several challenges due to exceeding the hosting capacity limit (HCL) of RESs. This article proposes a bi-stage approach to maximize the HCL considering RESs and load uncertainties. The first stage develops a multiobjective framework to adjust the system voltage profiles in a specific manner to avoid exceeding the voltage boundaries with high penetration of RESs. In the second stage, two processes are employed to maximize the HCL as the main objective function. In the first one, the photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbine (WT) plants are optimally allocated, while in the second process, a combination of three voltage control devices is proposed. A correlated multidimension probability uncertainty model is used to emulate the uncertainty of PV, WT, and load demand. Manta Ray foraging optimization (MRFO) algorithm is proposed to solve single-objective and multiobjective frameworks in the bi-stage approach considering the performance limits. The proposed approach is tested and validated on medium- and large-scale distribution systems. The effectiveness of the proposed MRFO is approved compared with two optimization algorithms. The proposed approach achieves up to 77.8\% RESs integration from the total load demand for the tested systems.},

  abstract     = {The application of blockchain to data sharing in an untrusted environment has received widespread industry attention in recent years. However, the tamper-proof property of blockchain brings protection for sharing data and also leads to a new limitation for the deletion of malicious data. Nowadays, many methods based on redactable blockchain with a chameleon hash is proposed to attempt to solve the above problem, but loss of effective access control to the modifiers can easily lead to breaking the positive characteristics of the blockchain. To address the aforementioned problem, a hierarchical access control redactable blockchain model for data sharing through attribute-based encryption and a chameleon hash is introduced. Under this model, the data owner can specify who can modify their data by setting an access policy and authenticating the modifier with a digital signature. The data owner’s full control over rights is guaranteed, while the modifier’s behavior is regulated. In addition, the hierarchical access control decentralized technique solves the overpowerful problem of center authority and single-point-of-failure problems in the existing works. The security analysis indicates that the proposed scheme achieves indistinguishable chosen plaintext attack security as well as collision resistance security. Performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme is more complete and has better efficiency compared with other schemes.},

A simple power system model consisting of two synchronous machines and a DFIG has been considered for mathematical derivations. For deriving the damping torque contribution to the rest of the power systems, DFIG has been used as a feedback system. The derived mathematical formulation has been validated for a higher order power system integrated with WES. The derived expression of damping contribution to synchronous machines supports the concept that the damping is highly dependent on transmission line reactance, which further assists the idea that WES placement in the power system has a crucial role in improving damping contribution to synchronous machines.},

In all architecture studies, cost (including development, production, and launch) is a central concern, including the variance or uncertainty of cost. A common complexity in constellation studies is due to multiple different but nonindependent satellite designs. This article discusses methods for estimating cost variances using probabilistic models at the satellite configuration level extended to constellations of satellites and including correlations due to shared design content. This article uses the NOAA Satellite Observing System Architecture study as a worked example.

  abstract     = {The randomness characteristics of large-scale grid-integrated intermittent distributed energy resources (DERs) and loads for power consumption pose significant power flow uncertainties to distribution networks. Although affine arithmetic (AA) is popularly and effectively used for uncertain power flow analysis, its nonlinear operation increases the conservatism of the identified solutions. Based on the interval Taylor formula, an improved AA (IAA) is developed to decrease conservatism and then an IAA-based power flow computation is proposed for distribution systems considering uncertainties. First, a multinoise elements affine model is established to predict the DERs’ generation, which considers the different effects and correlations of multiple uncertain factors of DERs. Second, an IAA based on the interval Taylor formula was proposed, which linearizes the nonlinear operation of affine division, and avoids the generation of new noise elements. Finally, the IAA is combined with forward/backward power flow computation to solve the uncertain power flow of the distribution network. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method are examined on IEEE 33, 69, and 118 systems. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has lower conservatism and higher computational efficiency, and it can provide guidance for power system operators to effectively monitor and control distribution systems under various uncertainties.},

In this article, a bipartite time-varying prescribed range formation is developed for a class of nonlinear MASs with unknown disturbances. The time-varying prescribed range formation means that agents achieve a formation shape within a predefined region relative to their neighbors, and the region changes along with the time-varying formation distance. An error transformation is introduced to transform this bipartite prescribed range formation problem into a stabilization control one. A surface-error-based predictor is developed to generate prediction errors for update of neural networks (NNs), and this form decouples approximation of system dynamics and control signal. With prescribed range information and signed graph, a disturbance observer with predictor-based NNs is constructed to compensate external disturbances and NNs&#39; approximation errors. Also, a normalization learning method is employed to reduce the number of NN&#39;s learning parameters. With Lyapunov-based stability analysis, it is proven that a bipartite time-varying formation is achieved within a prescribed range. Simulation results with a group of quadrotors verify the effectiveness of the proposed bipartite control scheme.},

As for the transmissive scenario, we derive the accurate closed-form ergodic capacity (EC) expressions taking into account the phase quantization errors in both the near- and far-fields. To further obtain practical physical insights, tight upper- and lower-bound expressions for EC are provided. It is found that when the transmit power and the quantization bits are sufficiently large, the EC performance would become saturated due to the existence of outdated CSI. Also, the impacts of the phase quantization errors, the outdated CSI, and channel parameters on the considered system performance are revealed. Furthermore, the correctness of our derived expressions is validated by extensive Monte-Carlo simulation results.},

To better understand the impacts of these technologies, this article presents a high-level dynamic simulation for evaluating wildfire response performance and resilience incorporating fire propagation, surveillance and communication, response planning, and the resulting mitigation actions. This simulation is then used to study the impact of communications and surveillance improvement, considering 1) the effect on fire containment and ground crew injuries and 2) the effect of introduced and existing disruptive fault scenarios. Simulating this model over a large number of scenarios finds that these changes can improve containment and reduce ground crew injuries. While these improvements generalize over both existing and introduced single-fault scenarios and, thus, result in a more resilient system, they could be negated if the introduced communications infrastructure is prone to full-scale outages.},

A cascading failure simulator considering the characteristics of generators is developed to avoid a relatively optimistic assessment result. In addition, a novel resilience index is proposed to reflect the capability of the power system to deliver power under sequential attacks.

Besides, the lack of inertia caused by droop and phase-locked loop-based current control brings negative effects to the system. In this article, we propose a distributed normalized power coordination (NPC) embedded with virtual synchronous generator for hybrid microgrid. The proposed NPC controller can achieve cross inertia support, accurate global power sharing, and frequency/voltage recovery among dispatchable DGs simultaneously. Furthermore, to suppress frequency and power oscillation, the index of inertia deviation is proposed to guide the inertia placement of hybrid MG based on Participation Factor analysis. Finally, the proposed strategy is validated by the simulation and hardware-in-loop tests compared to the conventional methods.},

Two transmission schemes, nonsimultaneous transmission (NST) scheme and simultaneous transmission (ST) scheme, are developed. To improve the system performance, the cooperative transmission technique is applied. In NST scheme, the base stations (BSs) obtain the uncached required files from the central processor (CP) and then transmit all required files to users. Based on this, we design an effective transmission model based on cache files and the qualities of the fronthaul link channels, and formulate a transmission delay minimization problem. Then, an alternative optimization algorithm is developed to solve it. In ST scheme, the BSs obtain the uncached files from the CP and transmit the cached files to users simultaneously. We divide two cases according to the access link transmission rate and cached files. For each case, we formulate an optimization problem by jointly designing the fronthaul multicast beamforming and access link transmission beamforming. Next, an iterative algorithm is developed via the L0 norm approximation, successive convex approximation and semidefinite relaxation techniques. Finally, simulation results show the proposed schemes can reduce the transmission delay better than the conventional multicast schemes.},

Our proposed approach accounts for the prosumers&#39; behavioral characteristics and models the emerging interactions among all the involved actors in the smart grid system, i.e., prosumers, energy management system (EMS), and utility companies. In particular, an off-policy reinforcement learning is introduced enabling the EMS to determine the optimal price that should be announced to the prosumers on an hourly-basis toward minimizing the overall system&#39;s cost. In this process, the utility companies&#39; hourly-based wholesale price and the prosumers&#39; energy generation and consumption characteristics are considered as input. At the same time, the prosumers&#39; optimal amount of purchased energy is determined in a real-time manner. The presented numerical results demonstrate the success of the proposed DRM model to deal with the incomplete information availability scenarios, regarding the prosumers&#39; energy selling and purchasing patterns, compared to the state of the art. Also, the detailed comparative evaluation against other price-based DRM approaches, e.g., cap-based and day-ahead pricing, shows the benefits of the proposed DRM model in terms of adapting in a real-time manner to the prosumers&#39; energy demand, while jointly minimizing the overall system&#39;s long-term cost.},

Based on the steady-state model of the dc transformer, the overcurrent mechanism is elaborated and a suppression strategy of H-bridge temporary blocking and DAB not blocking is proposed, which can automatically clear the fault current.

The identification, dynamic management of services, and fast analysis of healthcare data are a few challenges in existing remote healthcare monitoring devices. phSDN programs and reconfigures the resources and services, while updating the associated flow-rules in the data-plane of software-defined network (SDN) architecture. It is especially useful in scenarios with intermittent or constrained network connectivity and/or device availability. The newly identified flows associated with different resources are explicitly considered, while forwarding services over the SDN network. The on-the-fly programmable services enable healthcare devices to provide resource-specific analytics. The programmability over services also allows unified control over the end-devices by reconfiguring on-the-fly vendor-specific heterogeneity of resource types. Our prototype of phSDN supports three different types of resources: 1) body temperature, 2) pulse rate, and 3) blood pressure. Experiments using our implementation show that the proposed architecture minimizes the network response time by at least 43.87\% and 78.4\%, compared to the fog- and cloud-based approaches, respectively. The implemented system&#39;s scalability is further evaluated using Mininet by considering latency, packet delivery ratio, and throughput, as the performance metrics.},

The control techniques of these bidirectional VSCs are also proposed to control the operation of interconnected MGs system. The feedforward and feedback control signals are suggested in the proposed control techniques. The objectives of the proposed control techniques are to control the bidirectional power flow between the interconnected MGs, and to establish the constant rated voltages of all MGs, under islanded mode, for various operating scenarios.

With the scale of the road network continuously expanding, people choose to outsource the road network to the cloud server in the form of an encrypted graph. To the best of authors&#39; knowledge, the existing privacy-preserving shortest distance query schemes over large-scale encrypted graphs are all designed for the static graph. Nonetheless, the graph of road network is often updated over time. These static privacy-preserving shortest distance query schemes cannot work well in this practical application. In order to address this problem, we explore how to implement the privacy-preserving shortest distance query in an incremental large-scale road network. We use the 2-hop cover label index as the basic secure index structure, which can realize the shortest distance fast query. In order to update the 2-hop cover label index safely and efficiently, we combine a special adjacency index as an auxiliary index structure with homomorphic encryption to implement a dynamic incremental update algorithm for the encrypted graph. We prove that the proposed scheme achieves adaptive semantic security and verify its practicality through experiments.},

Procuring data from multiple sensors and making a singular assessment from them is a challenging task. KEdge overcomes such an issue by determining the severity of the patient by determining a condition index (CI) using a two-step analytical framework and a multiple rule fuzzy inference system (FIS). In the first step, KEdge detects the heart severity condition using a convolutional neural network model and, in the second step, it detects the respiratory condition using a random forest classification model. KEdge also utilizes auscultation sounds from SkopEdge (a digital stethoscope) for assessing the heartbeats. Through extensive experiments, we observe that KEdge identifies the arrhythmia condition with an accuracy of 98.53\% and respiratory condition by 98.68\%. KEdge considers the analytical predictions and analysis from SkopEdge to evaluate the CI for recommending the overall health condition using Mamdani FIS. We observe that KEdge is suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices providing memory consumption of 6.6\%. On offloading the same to the fog nodes, we observe improved CPU utilization with data upload rates in the order of 25 kb/s (KEdge) and 5 Mb/s (SkopEdge).},

  abstract     = {Researchers estimate that more than 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic have been produced since the early 1950s; however, only 9\% of all plastic waste ever produced has been recycled. In this article, we propose a plastic credit driven system consisting of a recyclability index (RI) and plastic credit to impel plastic recycling and increase the quality of recyclable plastics through a market self-regulation mechanism. The RI is designed to evaluate the recyclability value of different plastic products based on their material compositions. The plastic credit, defined by the quantitative relation between the RI and product information, can be issued or traded by system stakeholders. Instead of setting rigid industry standards to regulate plastic quality, we construct a governance community among industry participants using blockchain-enabled smart contracts to self-regulate and monitor plastic production and trading. The proposed system is constructed on a consortium blockchain and a public blockchain to negotiate the RI, issue credits, and trade credits using smart contracts. Through the overall system performance analysis, the experimental results demonstrate that the designed plastic credit system can promote a demand shift toward plastic products with higher plastic recyclability and achieve a lightweight operation for resource requirements and system maintenance.},

  abstract     = {By deregulating the countries&#39; electricity industry, the market players must adapt their performance to the deregulated environment. In this article, a risk-based stochastic optimization framework is proposed to model the participation of distribution system operator (DSO) in distribution expansion planning (DEP) problems in the presence of electricity wholesale multimarkets. Based on the proposed methodology in this article, the DSOs will be able to invest in the DEP by taking the benefits and imposed risks of the existing electricity multimarkets, i.e., forward contract, day-ahead, and balancing markets, to manage the risks of long-term uncertainties. The DSOs, who are the only retail suppliers in a specific region, can cover their DEP costs by offering fair retail prices to the retail consumers. Besides, DSOs could form diverse long- and short-term portfolios from the different electricity markets to procure the forecasted real loads and loss power of the network over the planning horizon. The diverse portfolio of the suppliers and a fair retail price can satisfy the DSOs to consider the multimarkets in the DEP process. Furthermore, the risk of uncertainties is modeled using the method of conditional value at risk (CVaR). Based on the obtained results, the DSO can reduce network loss costs by procuring power from markets rather than increasing the installed branches&#39; ampacity by considering multimarkets and market price uncertainties. Besides, the obtained profit of DSO is increased by 12.16\% in the proposed electricity multimarket environment.},

  abstract     = {In contrast to uniform linear arrays (ULAs), sparse arrays received considerable attention as they offer wider array aperture and increased degrees of freedom (DoFs). These factors play a vital role in improving the performance of the direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation system. However, most of the existing sparse designs are specific in terms of the array configuration. Motivated by this fact, we introduce a generalized multicascaded subarrays configuration (GMC-SC). The proposed GMC-SC system cascades a series of identical subarrays following an effective placement. First, the leading subarray is constructed using enhanced nested arrays. While the remaining subarrays, kept as mirror images of the leading subarray, are optimally distributed between the two levels. Such array structure is generic, transformable, and easier to realize. In addition, the GMC-SC substantially improves the number of DoFs and effective aperture to enhance DoA estimation accuracy for the array-based system. The resulting coarray of the configuration is also a filled (hole-free) ULA, reflecting its multifaceted advantages. Moreover, all the configuration parameters, such as optimal distribution of subarrays, interlevel as well as intersubarray displacement, number of DoFs, and sensor locations, benefit from closed-form expressions. In the end, simulation works are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the GMC-SC model.},

  abstract     = {Critical massive Internet of Things networks are emerging technologies that face new challenges in designing transmission protocols for beyond 5G communication systems. Conventional transmission schemes are ill-suited to provide ultrareliable, lowlatency, and scalability requirements of IoT networks with the massive number of nodes having sporadic data traffic behavior. This article overcomes such challenges with proposing a random access transmission scheme that exploits nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with short-packet transmissions and automatic request and repeat (ARQ) strategy with the limited number of retransmissions. To utilize the spectrum further and to meet ultrareliable low-latency requirement, an adaptive–persistent technique is proposed in which each node distributively controls its transmission based on the number of active devices without extra signaling. Since the nodes’ data traffic behavior is assumed sporadic, NOMA-based clustering is performed dynamically at each frame, avoiding additional signaling overhead. Network metrics, such as reliability, effective sum rate, and the distribution of packet latency, are analytically derived. Furthermore, the effects of different network parameters, such as blocklength, the maximum number of packet replicas, number of nodes, and number of resource blocks on network metrics, are investigated and compared with S-ALOHA-ARQ. The analysis show that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional schemes in terms of effective sum rate, reliability, and average packet latency.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the decentralized adaptive finite-time command filter control for interconnected nonlinear systems subject to input saturation by event-triggered (ET) output feedback. In practice, some subsystems may be distributed distantly, making it difficult for a centralized controller to acquire feedback signals from them. On the other hand, the finite-time control scheme with a nonsmooth controller could be used for accelerating the system convergence rate. However, with this control scheme, it is difficult to exclude Zeno behavior directly by using the existing methods. To overcome these obstacles, we consider a decentralized control scheme and exploit the property of hyperbolic tangent functions and the approximation capability of fuzzy logic systems to handle interconnected nonlinear functions. Furthermore, we develop a new switching-type finite-time ET mechanism in the presence of asymmetric input saturation. Under the developed decentralized controller, all system states are bounded as well as the tracking error converges to a compact set near the origin in a finite time. Meantime, the function&#39;s one-sided differentiability is employed to avoid Zeno phenomenon. Finally, two practical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the presented approach.},

One of the toughest challenges is analyzing the mutually amplified phenomena between various hazards, known as “multihazard coupling effects.” Despite the increasing attention devoted to the emerging research field, there still is no systematic and comprehensive review to summarize and overview multihazard coupling studies in CPI. In this two-part systematic and comprehensive review, 184 relevant grey- and peer-review literature are extracted and analyzed to systemize knowledge, identify research advances, and investigate future perspectives. In the first part of this article, preliminaries are first provided for the whole two-part review, including the origin and development of multihazard related research, the research procedure, and the discrimination of specific research interests. Then, the mechanism behind the formation of the mutually amplified phenomena between hazards is especially concerned. Based on the regional disaster system theory and the extracted knowledge, a comprehensive and inclusive framework is developed to generalize the analysis of multihazard coupling effects, and five general forms of multihazard coupling effects are identified, which provides insights for multihazard coupling scenarios to better understand the coupling hazard-formative mechanism.},

The UAPF operates as a bidirectional interface between the PV–BSS and point of interconnection for microgrid realization. A new control strategy is proposed to extract fast and accurate voltage and current reference signals to operate the system in a desired manner. Here, the extraction of load voltages and calculation of load and reference powers are used to generate the reference signals, thereby comparing with actual signals with hysteresis controller to produce switching pulses of converters. As a result, the shunt and series converters form a robust system by acting as a current-controlled voltage source and voltage-controlled current source, respectively. It eliminates the need for adaptive filters and low-pass filters to extract the fundamental component of the load current. Furthermore, it increases the conversion efficiency of converters and improves the static and dynamic performance of the system. The proposed system is developed with a 1-kVA prototype laboratory setup using a field-programmable gate array controller and extensively tested with various test conditions such as grid voltage fluctuations, nonlinear and imbalanced load, and change in irradiance.},

  abstract     = {The development of wireless technology has triggered wireless sensing. Most WiFi sensing methods are data driven and learning based. They face two major drawbacks: 1) a large number of labeled samples are required to train the sensing model; and 2) the sensing model depends on the training environment and degrades dramatically in a different environment. To mitigate these problems, we propose a domain adaptation method to achieve environment robustness for channel-state-information-based activity recognition with sparsely labeled samples. The method, named cross-domain activity recognition (CDAR), consists of iterative soft labeling, domain alignment, and activity classification. To reduce the number of labeled samples, CDAR adopts dynamic time warping to measure the similarity between the samples, based on which the unlabeled samples are pseudo-labeled iteratively and progressively. To tolerate false labels, the pseudo-labels take the form of soft labels. To reduce the data distribution discrepancy, the domains are aligned by minimizing the intraclass distance and maximizing the interclass distance, using maximum mean discrepancy as the metric. The activities are finally classified by integrating convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method CDAR on activity recognition across people, locations, environmental dynamics, and rooms.},

By adopting stochastic geometry, closed-form expressions for mode selection rate and residence time are derived as functions of the AP density, IIoT density, and velocity. The results have shown that high velocity and denser deployment cause a decrease in the average D2D residence time and an increase in the average D2D transition rate or vice versa.

  abstract     = {This article studies robust artificial noise-aided beamforming for correlated multiple-input-single-output eavesdropping channels under Gaussian channel uncertainties. In the case of high reception correlation, under a secrecy outage probability constraint, the achievable secrecy rate is very small and does not satisfy the requirements of some high-rate applications. In view of this, optimization designs on the premise of quality-of-service (QoS) assurance are considered. By exploiting the correlation and employing a novel QoS criterion of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) outage probability, two optimization problems, namely minimization of the target SNR at eavesdroppers and maximization of the loose secrecy rate, are formulated. Despite less rigorous secrecy, a much lower target SNR at eavesdroppers and a higher loose secrecy rate are achieved. Compared with the conventional SNR-QoS, SNR-outage-QoS is a more flexible criterion that can be applied to Gaussian channel uncertainties, although challenging probabilistic constraints are introduced into the optimization problems. To make the optimization problems feasible, two approaches, namely, the Bernstein-type inequality approach and ellipsoid bounding approach, are applied to approximate the probabilistic constraints. Simulation results show that the robust transmit designs contribute to a secrecy performance gain from the perspective of SNR-outage-QoS.},

  abstract     = {In industrial systems, massive content, such as high-quality video and a large amount of sensing data, should be exchanged between Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices under strict deadlines. The use of millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies of 28 and 60 GHz can satisfy the requirements of IIoT by providing a high data rate. In the mmWave band, it is necessary to use a directional antenna owing to its short wavelength. Consequently, directional links are vulnerable to adverse effects, such as deafness problems, where a communicating node cannot receive signals from other transmitting nodes. To alleviate the deafness problem, in this article, we propose a machine learning-based communication failure identification scheme for reliable device-to-device (D2D) communication in the mmWave band. The proposed scheme determines the type of network failure (deafness/interference) according to the IIoT device&#39;s state parameters. Based on the identification scheme, we additionally propose ML-DMAC to improve the throughput and minimize the deafness duration of D2D communication. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed ML-DMAC outperforms existing schemes in aggregate throughput and deafness duration by approximately 31\% and 88\%, respectively.},

Any global information, including the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix, is unavailable in the control scheme development. The reference trajectory is designed for each agent, and the corresponding performance function, which reflects the off-track error evolution and control cost, is proposed. The sufficient condition for the synchronization of reference trajectories, which does not rely on the topology dwell time, is established by constructing an appropriate current topology-independent Lyapunov function. Due to the fact that the nonlinear function in the system dynamical equation of each agent is unknown, an equation termed integral reinforcement learning (IRL) equation is provided, and it is strictly proven that the provided IRL equation is equivalent to the given Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. The model-free optimal feedback control law is then derived based on the IRL technique. In the implementation of the developed control scheme, the neural network approximation tool is adopted, and the scheme is applied to a numerical system to show its effectiveness.},

This article investigates a system that can counter such threats by utilizing a swarm of pursuer UAV agents that cooperate in tracking and jamming multiple rogue UAVs in an attempt to interfere with their operation. The proposed framework aims to select the best control actions for each UAV, in terms of joint mobility and jamming power, succeeding in optimally tracking and successfully jamming the rogue UAVs over time, while also ensuring that the power received by the pursuer UAVs remains below predefined interference levels. Additionally, the proposed framework minimizes the total energy consumption of the swarm of UAV agents (accounting for both jamming and propulsion energy consumption). The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through extensive simulation experiments for different pursuer-target scenarios, with UAVs utilizing both fixed- and rotary-wing technologies.},

Running deep learning models requires huge processing and incurs high computation delay and energy consumption on resource-constraint IoT devices. In this article, we introduce methods for distributed inference over IoT devices and edge server. Two distinct algorithms are proposed to split the deep neural network layers computation between IoT device and an edge server; the early split strategy (ESS) for battery powered IoT devices and the late split strategy (LSS) for IoT devices connected to regular power source. The evaluation shows that both the ESS and LSS schemes achieve the target inference delay deadline when tested over VGG16 and MobileNet_V2 CNN models. In terms of computational load, the ESS scheme achieves nearly 15–20\% reduction whereas LSS scheme achieves up to 60\% reduction. The gains in energy saving of IoT devices for both the ESS and LSS schemes are nearly 18\% and 52\%, respectively.},

Due to potential postsandstorm insulator flashover, OTLs face high failure probabilities, and implementing in-time maintenance on OTLs is crucial to mitigate postsandstorm losses. Aiming at determining an optimal maintenance sequence of targeted OTLs, this article proposes a decision-dependent stochastic approach for the joint operation and maintenance of OTLs. First, considering the inherent dependency of the uncertain availability of OTLs on maintenance decisions, the multiperiod maintenance process of OTLs is modeled as a stochastic process with decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU). Second, a two-stage stochastic model with DDU is formulated, where the maintenance sequence and unit commitment decisions are made in the first stage and the second stage comprises scenariowise operation. Then, to tackle the coupling relation between decisions and DDU, a unique modeling transformation technique is adopted to convert the established decision-dependent stochastic model into a computationally efficient form. Case studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for postsandstorm maintenance scheduling.},

The impacts of imperfect successive interference cancelation, imperfect channel state information, residual self-interference, and the power allocation coefficient for the users to the system performance are also investigated. We evaluate the performance of the considered mobile multiantenna UAV-assisted FD-NOMA relay system by deriving the outage probability and the throughput’s closed-form expressions for each communication pair in different communication urban environments. Monte Carlo simulation results verify the accuracy of these derived expressions.Numerical results show that the best outage performance can be achieved when the location of the UAV and transmission power of the source and the UAV are properly chosen.

At this stage, the WEM operator (follower-level player) collects offers/bids from MES and other market participants to clear the WEM with the optimal public interest and announce the market-clearing price. The vehicles were congregated in electric vehicle fleets via K-means clustering according to their uncertain specifications, such as daily travelled miles and arrival/departure times. Afterward, the stochastic programming scenarios were generated for each fleet according to their user-based probability distribution functions. However, more volatile parameters, e.g., wind speed, were handled by the data-driven distributionally robust optimization method, which is embodied by an ambiguity set within the Wasserstein ball.

  abstract     = {Virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control has received much attention for interfacing renewable energy sources, thus creating a low-inertia microgrid. However, proportional reactive power-sharing and voltage accuracy is still a serious concern due to unequal feeder impedances between VSG controlled DGs and the point of power coupling. This article proposes a virtual variable impedance (VVI) based VSG control technique to mitigate the reactive power sharing error by improving the line-impedance ratio among multiple DGs. The proposed VVI control is designed to estimate the value of variable virtual impedance by establishing an exponential relationship with the inverter&#39;s output reactive power. The reactive power communication method is also introduced to identify the proportion of reactive power share being injected by the DG. The effectiveness of the proposed VVI control is further analyzed through the small-signal stability analysis and Lyapunov stability analysis of a multi-VSG system. Finally, the proposed controller is tested in MATLAB/Simulink software and on an experimental setup that includes inverter hardware and dSPACE simulator. Results have shown that the proposed method allow only 0.026\% of reactive power sharing error as compared to the conventional droop control and state-of-the-art virtual capacitor-based droop control that experiences 2.86\% and 2.8\% error, respectively.},

Specifically, it considers a successive interference cancellation-capable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that collects data from ground devices operating in an Internet of Things network. Its objective is to maximize the minimum flow rate to a terrestrial gateway over a fixed time horizon. It outlines a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to optimize in each time slot: the routing from the UAV to the gateway, the set of links from ground devices to the UAV, and the flow rate over links. It also proposes a novel algorithm, called iterative flow and path reservation (IFPR), for use by the UAV to select paths. Further, IFPR uses two methods to schedule communications between ground devices and the UAV. The first method, called simplified MILP (SMILP), aims to maximize the sum rate from ground devices. The second method, called less data schedule first, prioritizes ground devices that have uploaded the least amount of data to the gateway. Numerical results show satellite links help the UAV collects 61\% more data from ground devices. Moreover, as compared to the MILP, IFPR collects 23\% less data. Further, for both MILP and IFPR, their Jain’s fairness index reaches around one when the number of time slots is sufficiently large. Finally, when IFPR uses SMILP, the gateway collects more data but at the expense of fairness.},

  abstract     = {In the cloud data centers, due to the variable resource requirements of cloud tenants, designers applied the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) model to provide services for tenants with allocating in charging. The application of virtualization technology enables multiple virtual machines (VMs) to share the resources of a physical machine (PM). Meanwhile, the efficiency of the data centers greatly depends on the working efficiency of VMs. Virtual machine placement (VMP) plays a vital role in minimizing total energy consumption and resource wastage for cloud data centers (CDCs). In this article, we propose a greedy algorithm minimizing power consumption and resource wastage (GMPR) for the VMP scheme to address the abovementioned issues. GMPR prioritizes the power-efficiency of PM to reduce the number of active PMs and to minimize total energy consumption. In addition, reducing total resource wastage involves first minimizing the resource of balance and resource wastage for a novel PM hosts VM and second minimizing resource wastage for PM placed VM. Extensive simulation results are conducted on synthetic and instances of Amazon EC2 with performance metrics confirm that GMPR has superiority in reducing energy consumption and resource wastage by an average of 1.91\% and 16.18\% compared with a cutting-edge method.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the problem of radio resource management is addressed by adjusting the tradeoff between two key quality of experience (QoE) influencing factors, namely transmission rate, and service price. To this end, a piecewise utility function is employed to assess the user QoE in three different quality classes. It comprises the combination of two utility functions corresponding to the transmission rate and the service price. A low-complexity fuzzy-based approach is then introduced to reallocate additional resources to dissatisfied users to increase the number of satisfied users. The simulation results indicate the efficiency and applicability of the novel approach in terms of increasing the service provider revenue while providing approximately the same overall QoE and power consumption. The results also show proposed approach achieves an improvement of at least 15\% in total service provider revenue on average compared to other methods.},

This study develops a multiobjective SDSSP model (MO-SDSSP) to simultaneously minimize the total setup time of tool switches and the tardiness of the machining process. Then, a two-stage Multiobjective Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (MOALNS) and Simulated Annealing (SA) is presented as a heuristic algorithm for the MO-SDSSP, in which the MOALNS is proposed to solve the job sequencing subproblem while the SA is used to solve the tool switching subproblem. Subsequently, the performance of MOALNS-SA is compared to several popular multiobjective optimization algorithms. Comparison on four performance criteria has shown the applicability of the MOALNS. Finally, managerial analysis is performed to analyze the relationship between the total tool setup time and the compliance of due dates.},

The crowd model is based on a decentralized control system structure, where each pedestrian agent is governed through a deliberative-reactive control architecture. The simulation model for evacuation includes a routing-based control system for dynamic-guided evacuation. A design case illustrates the modeling process. Results show that the crowd simulation model based on agent autonomy and local interactions is able to generate higher level crowd dynamics through emergence.},

We indicated that instead of simply inverting the Jacobian matrix, the inverse computation time of the DEPF may be substantially decreased by inverting the submatrices. A hybrid technique was developed for Dynamic ATC calculation using a mixture of the static and dynamic methods. Installing the high voltage direct current (HVdc) line is taken into account in the ATC calculations because HVdc is the backbone of the future transmission network. The challenge of integrating wind power plants and big loads into the future network is also explored in this article. In an attempt to rectify earlier techniques, an estimate of the potential energy boundary surface was also used in conjunction to assess transient stability. This technique was effectively applied on IEEE 39 bus, IEEE 118 bus, Iowa State 145-bus, IEEE 300-bus, the east of Iran (1153 buses), and Khorasan network (4438 buses) systems for different bilateral/ multilateral transactions.},

Specifically, we evaluate the performance of an IRS-aided bidirectional FD communication system in a practical scenario where imperfect self-interference (SI) cancellation and hardware impairments (HIs) are taken into consideration. We successfully derive the closed-form expressions of ergodic capacity (EC) and symbol error rate (SER) of the IRS-aided FD-HI system over Rayleigh fading channels. We confirm the correctness of the derived expressions via Monte-Carlo simulations. To clarify the effects of residual SI and HIs, we compare the performance of the IRS-aided FD-HI system with that of the IRS-aided FD-ideal hardware (ID), half-duplex (HD)-HI, and HD-ID systems. Numerical results clarify a strong impact of residual SI and HIs on the EC and SER of the IRS-aided FD-HI system. Thus, the EC and SER of the IRS-aided FD-HI system go to the saturated values in a high signal-to-noise regime even with a large number of reflecting elements in the IRS. Therefore, depending on the residual SI and HI levels as well as the requirements about the EC and SER in practice, we can use appropriately the transmit power of terminals and number of reflecting elements in the IRS for enhancing the performance and saving the energy consumption of the IRS-aided FD-HI system.},

An information-theoretic criterion is adopted to improve the radar detection performance, while the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio requirement is imposed on each downlink user to ensure communication quality. In addition, similarity restriction is also involved to manage some significant radar waveform characteristics. An iterative algorithm is introduced to tackle the resulted nonconvex and NP-hard problem. In each iteration, several subproblems are developed to decompose the original problem and are solved by the lower bound maximization and the alternating direction method of multiplier algorithm. Numerical simulations show that the proposed algorithm allows the objective function to increase monotonically and finally converge to a finite value. It also shows that the codesign scheme can effectively optimize the radar detection performance while ensuring the achievable sum rate and the bit error rate of the communication system.},

The presence of renewable distributed generations (RDGs) and energy storage systems, which have an increasing penetration in today&#39;s distribution networks are also considered. Moreover, two different practical load shedding methods are considered to balance the total generation and consumption in microgrids. The predetermined expansion plan of RDGs is also considered. To simplify the implementation of the proposed optimization model and ensure the global optimal solution, the planning model is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model which can be solved by various commercial solvers. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is illustrated by implementation on bus 4 of Roy Billinton test system through various case studies and sensitivity analyses.

The interconnected MGs form a structure in which the overall system operation and resource scheduling can be determined by considering centralized or decentralized approaches. This article introduces local energy and reserve markets (LERMs) in which the MG managers (MGMs) can meet their required energy and reserve with optimal scheduling of their resources, besides competing with the other MGs. To model such decision-making framework for MGMs, a bilevel optimization approach is developed in which the MGMs’ problem is modeled as the upper level problem and the LERMs clearing problem is modeled as the lower level problem. This model is transformed into a mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) using the primal-dual transformation. Then, the resulting MPEC for each MG is replaced with its Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions, obtaining an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) model. The nonlinear terms of the model are linearized through different approaches. Finally, the EPEC model is transformed into a mixed-integer linear problem considering the objective function of all MGMs. The model is applied to a test system with three interconnected MGs. Moreover, the sensitivity of the results to the probability of calling reserve is investigated.},

As a matter of fact, better earnings can be gathered from a low-cost system with effective functions, which results in the hybrid beamforming architecture combining digital chains with large-scale antenna arrays. The programmable metasurface (PM) is a promising antenna array concept that realizes reconfigurable beamforming. It is raised to be an attractive antenna array architecture due to its low price and power consumption. However, experimental investigations combining PMs with modern wireless communication systems have not been intensively studied. Its challenges and difficulties of signal processing and system implementation remain uncertainties to be discovered. In this article, a PM hybrid MIMO beamforming system including the aforementioned important topics is presented as follows. First of all, the hybrid beamforming channel estimation algorithm adapted for PM is created by merging analog beam training and digital interleaved orthogonal frequency division multiplexing. Afterward, data transmissions based on the estimated channel state information utilizes variant signal recovery methods to examine the channel estimation accuracy and system feasibilities. To practically analyze the proposed system, the aforementioned aspects are implemented into system-level experiments using three PMs operating at 28 GHz for downlink wireless communication in both single-user and multiuser scenarios. Proper results are delivered, which successfully prove the PM hybrid MIMO beamforming system functionalities.},

On account of the long-standing tracking requirements during vision-based formation process, an antiloss and redetecting strategy is fused in the proposed detecting and tracking algorithm and the binocular vision system can achieve real-time positioning underwater and calculate the 3-D coordinate so as to complete the follower&#39;s follow-up to the leader. An artificial submarine detection experiment and an antiloss redetection experiment are applied to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm.

  abstract     = {The growing uptake of electric vehicles (EVs) will likely require management schemes to enable their connection into distribution systems. While most of the existing approaches are developed from the operator’s perspective considering EV aggregated demands at the medium-voltage (MV) level, individual users’ comfort and the particularities associated with low-voltage (LV) networks need to be considered to holistically assess the EV effects in an integrated MV/LV network. This article proposes a two-level hierarchical optimization framework for the EV charging coordination (EVCC) that maximizes users’ satisfaction, while avoiding operational grid issues in the whole distribution system. The framework is tailored for unbalanced distribution systems with high penetration of EVs and introduces a novel index to measure charging priority-based EV user satisfaction. To reduce the computational burden, the EVCC problem is disaggregated into an upper level for MV network operation, and a lower level for LV network and individual EV scheduling, using mixed-integer linear programming models. This framework is later embedded in a dynamic scheduling approach that copes with unexpected EV arrivals. Benefits (increased overall user satisfaction and reduced strain over distribution assets) are demonstrated via case studies in a 459-node three-phase network in which solutions were achieved under a 60-s threshold.},

Then, a distributed adaptive consensus protocol, which includes a time-varying coupling weight for each edge, is designed based on the proposed event-triggering strategies. With the well-designed updating laws of dynamic variables, coupling weights and weighting parameters, we can theoretically guarantee the consensus of the concerned multiagent systems. Our event-triggering strategies do not require agents to continuously verify the event-triggering conditions or read their neighbors’ real-time state information. Moreover, Zeno behavior is inherently excluded as the interevent intervals are bounded from below by one period in the periodic event-triggering framework. Two numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered consensus protocols.},

This article proposes a practical and implementable methodology for measuring, predicting, and architecting system resilience during conceptual design that considers both known and unknown disruptions. This article extends the current literature by motivating the resilience curve using a Markov process, verifying resilience with empirical data, and incorporating the interaction between subsystems using common cause failure with the binomial failure rate.

In this article, for the first time, we consider the effect of pilot leakage on the performance of covert communication over a finite transmission blocklength. First, we construct a general analysis model of multiantenna joint covert communication (JTCC), where the uplink covert pilot, the imperfect channel estimation issues, and the downlink covert communication is taken into account. Second, we evaluate the covertness performance of the proposed system in which an independent detection scheme (IDS) and two joint detection schemes (JDSs) are adopted at an unintended warden, respectively. In particular, the closed-form expressions of tight average covert probability are derived under the different detection schemes. Third, we establish an optimization framework for the covert throughput maximization subject to the constraints of covertness, reliability, and blocklength. Moreover, a simple and robust solution is provided by jointly designing the pilot length and the transmit power. Numerical results highlight the advantages of the JTCC system in resisting pilot detection and indicate the tradeoff of pilot design between the achievable covertness, the required reliability, and the overall rate performance.},

  abstract     = {Broadband satellite systems are built to serve different user groups ranging from enterprise and military users to common personal users, with various kinds of services calling for dissimilar quality of service (QoS). Obviously, the satellite systems are expected to distinguish the specific type of an incoming service request as well as the importance of its owner in order to perform an efficient assignment of valuable resources. In this article, the uplink resource management challenge in a multifrequency-time-division multiple access satellite system is addressed where provisioning the discriminated QoS is of vital importance. Having taken both user priority and service type into account, a differentiated QoS support principle conforming to the digital video broadcast - second generation DVB interactive satellite system (DVB-RCS2) standard is put forward, based on which the uplink timeslot assignment problem is formulated.The NP-hardness of the problem is proved, and a differentiated QoS resource allocation scheme is designed, decoupling the problem into the coarse-level of resource allocation and fine-level of timeslot assignment. The former stage involves the constant rate assignment, bandwidth adjustment, QoS degradation and user scheduling, among which the subproblem of user scheduling is an integer nonlinear program. To tackle the issue, the problem is first innovatively converted to an integer linear program, and is then modeled as the multiple-choice multiple knapsack (MCMK) problem. Furthermore, an MCMK algorithm is presented to give the optimal solution to the user scheduling problem, after which the timeslot assignment is investigated in the second phase to generate the terminal burst time plan table for return channel satellite terminals.},

The frame structure is coordinated through the two-phase harvest-then-transmit protocol. The energy-limited SUs first harvest wireless energy in the downlink phase and then transmit their information signals simultaneously to H-AP with the CDMA scheme in the UL phase. An overlay spectrum sharing model is also considered where H-AP has access to the primary transmitter&#39;s codebook and primary network&#39;s channel. Our goal is to maximize the sum-throughput optimization problem of SUs via jointly optimizing power and time allocation. The considered joint optimization problem is generally nonconvex due to coupled variables. As a solution, we first transform it into the equivalent convex form using proper variables and then we solve it using the convex optimization technique. The closed-form solutions for time and power allocations are given. We also confirm from various simulations’ results that our proposed CDMA scheme is superior to the conventional time-division multiple access schemes.},

We propose the convergence probability to aid further analysis of the performance and security of DAG-based ledgers. Under unsteady load regimes, the convergence probability is the probability of each possible cumulative weight of the observed transaction when it is approved by all new arrival transactions. In this article, we derive a closed-form expression and an approximate expression of the convergence probability under the high-to-low regime (H2LR). Also, we verify the accuracy of the derived expressions through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Numerical results shows that the simulation results match well with its analytical results, which indicates the accuracy of the exact expression and the approximate expression of the convergence probability.},

  abstract     = {With the advances in fog computing, various users’ data, collected by smart devices in the Internet of Things (IoT), are published to facilitate services and efficiency. This leads to the users’ worry about security and privacy issues in fog-enhanced IoT. Although privacy protection can ease such worry, users need to pay some extra price, such as more computation costs. Besides, there are some users who want convenience rather than privacy. They prefer to publish their raw data to exchange for better convenience or benefit. In this article, an optional privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme based on BGN homomorphic encryption is proposed, without any trusted third party. In the proposed scheme, each user can choose either no privacy encryption or privacy encryption to upload its own data according to its own privacy sensitivity. With the help of the fog node, the control center can get the aggregated data of all smart devices and the single data of smart devices that choose the no privacy option. In addition, the proposed scheme is analyzed to achieve correctness, privacy preservation, and robustness. Experimental results and comparisons show the proposed scheme is satisfactory in terms of computation cost and communication overhead.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle ad-hoc networks (VANETs) can offer numerous benefits, but also face many privacy and security issues. There exist the certificate management burden and key escrow issue in traditional public key infrastructure (PKI)-based and identity (ID)-based privacy-preserving authentication schemes, respectively. In addition, the security of some existing cryptographic schemes depends on strong assumptions about the ideal tamper-proof devices. To address these issues, a certificateless aggregate signature (CLAS) scheme for VANETs has been proposed, which was claimed provably unforgeable. However, we found that this scheme cannot resist collusion attacks, which means the equivalent validity of the aggregate signature would be broken. Therefore, this article proposes an improved CLAS scheme against collusion attacks for VANETs (CA-CLAS). Security and performance analyses show that the proposed CA-CLAS scheme not only offers privacy and security guarantees for VANETs, but also improves efficiency compared to existing authentication schemes.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a hybrid control strategy to improve the control and power sharing of a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) used in an isolated dc microgrid. While the photovoltaic panel is the primary energy source, the battery and supercapacitor work together to meet the additional power requirements. A modification to the traditional filter method for dividing the average and transient HESS current components is done by replacing the low pass filter (LPF) with a rate limiter to ensure proper power splitting and smoother battery discharge. The rate limiter integrates power balance into the system and allows for the integration of battery discharge rates, eliminating the problems caused by the unintentional selection of the cut-off frequency. In addition, the HESS current outputs are no longer affected by low order LPF phase delay. A simple prediction based current control is proposed for HESS current regulation to precisely track the rate-limited current references and avoid common windup concerns associated with proportional integral (PI) controllers arising from system nonlinearities and uncertainties. The proposed control approach can reduce the peak overshoot below 2\% and settling time during disturbances less than 15\%. Simulation and experimental investigations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Dynamic transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) co-simulation is an effective method to evaluate the impact of D-IBRs on the system response, however, implementation is a challenge. This article innovatively achieves accurate T&amp;D model coordination with inclusion of dynamic models of power electronic controls. It also demonstrates that D-IBRs operating with grid-forming (GFM) controls with frequency support capability can aid in primary frequency regulation in a low-inertia power system. The article discusses the fundamentals of dynamic T&amp;D co-simulation to analyze the primary frequency response on the IEEE 39-Bus transmission system coupled to IEEE 123-Bus distribution system with D-IBRs with GFM controls. To demonstrate scalability, a large system (286383 T&amp;D buses) is co-simulated: IEEE 39-bus transmission system with all load buses coupled to a total of 2328 parallel IEEE 123-Bus distribution feeders containing a mix of D-IBRs is considered. The article also discusses the use of parallel computation used for distribution system solutions enabled in the scalable multi-timescale T&amp;D co-simulation framework along with computation time comparisons between the large and small system simulations with GFM inverter dynamics.},

  abstract     = {The stability of alternating current microgrids (ac MGs) is significantly affected by the procedure of collecting precise and sufficient information of the system and tightly controlling power inverters. Whereas using many sensors increases ac MG ripples and cost, integrating cost-effective and low number of sensors is preferred. Furthermore, assuring the stability and tracking issue of ac MGs in different operating modes and in the presence of unknown time-varying loads is a hard task. Aiming at these issues, this article proposes an improved augmented-Kalman filter to estimate the state vector and disturbance inputs and a nonlinear backstepping controller with a command filter to design the control law. Compared to the conventional Kalman filters, the developed approach is able to estimate the external disturbances, which improves the state estimation performance and provides extra information about the power system. The proposed command filter-based backstepping has the key feature of avoiding the calculation of time-derivatives of desired references of virtual inputs, which is a common drawback of conventional approaches. Whereas the dynamics of the disturbance time-varying load are not available, the command filter is utilized to avoid the time derivatives terms of the disturbance inputs. Simulation results illustrate the estimation performance of the augmented Kalman filter and the tracking performance of the command filter-based backstepping controller.},

Physical layer security (PLS) is an emerging technique to complement and significantly improve communication security in wireless networks. This article analyses the PLS performance of cooperative NOMA cognitive wireless networks. Furthermore, a cognitive collaboration method is proposed, combining legitimate links and eavesdropping links. More specifically, new closed expressions of the outage probability (OP) of the primary user (PU) and secondary users (SUs), as well as the intercept probability (IP) of an eavesdropper (E), are derived to evaluate the proposed scheme&#39;s PLS transmission performance. Monte Carlo simulations verify the analysis. The results show the SU selection scheme incorporated with the eavesdropping link can slightly improve the security performance compared with the legitimate link. It can also be obtained that increasing the transmit power and increasing the number of SUs could enhance the security performance of PU and SUs.},

With the help of machine learning techniques, a surrogate model is obtained which quantifies the risk of wildfire ignition by individual power lines under extreme weather conditions. The cases illustrate the superior performance of WRAP under extreme weather conditions in mitigating wildfire risk and serving customers compared to the naive PSPS approach and another method in the literature.

Specifically, we propose a biological ledger-based relay model to secure targeted drug delivery without affecting surrounding healthy tissues. In BioBlock, each successful transaction generates a block with genetic signatures of the bionodes in the nanonetwork, which eventually gets validated by the neighboring bionodes. We show the effectiveness of our model regarding energy utilization and information delivery while highlighting the average delay introduced in the network with an increasing level of security. We observe that the information delivery factor in the case of the naive approach is 90.59\%, while in the case of a 6-fold secure approach, it is 89.77\%.

Considering the ecological assessment, urban and rural telecommunication infrastructure is moving toward deploying green cellular base stations to cater to the needs of the ever-growing traffic demands of heterogeneous networks. In such scenarios, the existing learning-based renewable resource provisioning methods lack intelligent and optimal resource management at the small cell base stations (SCBS). Therefore, in this article, we present a novel machine learning-based framework for intelligent resource provisioning mechanisms for micro-grid connected green SCBSs with a completely modified ring parametric distribution method. In addition, an algorithmic implementation is proposed for prediction-based renewable resource re-distribution with energy flow control unit mechanism for grid-connected SCBS, eliminating the need for centralized hardware. Moreover, this modeling enables the prediction mechanism to estimate the future on-demand traffic provisioning capability of SCBS. Furthermore, we present the numerical analysis of the proposed framework showcasing the systems’ ability to attain a balanced energy convergence level of all the SCBS at the end of the periodic cycle, signifying our model’s merits.},

  abstract     = {To meet the need of computation-sensitive (CS) and high-rate (HR) communications, the mobile edge computing and caching framework has been widely regarded as a promising solution. When such a framework is implemented in heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs), it is a key and open topic how to assign mobile edge computing and caching servers to mobile devices (MDs) with CS and HR communications. In this article, under the resource partitioning and resource constraints, joint MD association and resource allocation is performed to minimize the total delay of MDs. In such a formulated problem, the MD association and resource allocation parameters are in a coupling form. In addition, it is also in nonlinear mixed-integer one and hard to tackle. To solve it, we try to develop an alternating optimization algorithm according to the coalitional game and convex optimization theorems. As for the designed algorithm, we provide some detailed convergence, stability, parallel implement, and computation complexity analyses. At last, in the simulation, we introduce other association algorithms for comparison, and investigate the impacts of MD density, time, and frequency partitioning factors on the delay of MDs. Simulation results show that the designed algorithm can achieve lower network delay than existing algorithms in general.},

  abstract     = {Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is commonly deployed in Internet of Things (IoT) systems to achieve high data rates with reasonable complexity, where noncooperative protocols encode signals with different modulations for multiple users. However, conventional modulation recognition is limited to single-carrier communication systems, and there is an urgent need to design an effective method to blindly identify the unknown modulation format of received signals. In this article, we propose an automatic modulation classification method for the OFDM systems with the presence of channel deterioration. Our method first leverages a data reconstruction mechanism to arrange signals into high-dimensional data arrays and then exploits an efficient convolutional network, namely OFDMsym-Net, to learn underlying radio characteristics. OFDMsym-Net is designed by two kinds of processing modules, which manipulate one-dimensional asymmetric convolution filters to extract the intracorrelation within an OFDM symbol and the intercorrelation between different symbols. Moreover, a sophisticated structure with addition and concatenation layers is developed inside every module to improve learning efficiency. Based on simulation results achieved on a synthetic dataset of OFDM signals, our proposed method shows the classification robustness under various channel impairments. It reveals to have an overall accuracy of 95.41\% at 10-dB signal-to-noise ratio, being superior to several state-of-the-art approaches.},

Mobile edge computing (MEC) has become an effective computing model for meeting the IoT applications’ requirements. However, the resource-constrained nature of the IoT devices, different characteristics of IoT tasks such as delay sensitivity, and heterogeneity of the edge cloud servers (ECSs) make the task offloading problem a fundamental challenge in the MEC systems. Motivated by this, in this article, we propose a deadline-aware and energy-efficient computation offloading algorithm, DECO, for scheduling and processing the generated tasks from the IoT devices. The proposed algorithm jointly takes into account the deadline requirement of the tasks and the energy consumption of the IoT devices in the local decision-making process. Also, it considers the priority of the tasks and heterogeneity of ECSs for the task-node mapping process. The extensive simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm improves the deadline satisfaction ratio of delay-sensitive tasks about 85.4\% and reduces their average response time up to 62.9\% compared to the state-of-the-art method while the amount of increase in the total energy consumption of IoT devices is less than 13.4\%.},

However, designing grant-free random access (GF-RA) protocols to manage such connections is challenging, since they must operate in interference-aware scenarios with sporadic device activation patterns and a shortage of mutually orthogonal resources. Supervised machine learning models have provided efficient solutions for activity detection, noncoherent data detection, and nonorthogonal preamble design in scenarios with massive connectivity. In this article, we develop two deep learning (DL) sparse support recovery algorithms to detect active devices in massive machine-type communication random access. The DL algorithms, developed to deploy GF-RA protocols, are based on the deep multilayer perceptron and the convolutional neural network models. Unlike previous works, we investigate the impact of the type of sequences for preamble design on the activity detection accuracy. Our results reveal that preambles based on the Zadoff–Chu sequences, which present good correlation properties, achieve better activity detection accuracy with the proposed algorithms than random sequences. Besides, we demonstrate that our DL algorithms achieve activity detection accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art techniques with extremely low computational complexity.},

In this article, a NOMA-based vehicle edge computing (VEC) network model is proposed, and the cost minimization problem is constructed. Under the premise of ensuring the delay tolerance of all VUEs, the total system cost is minimized through the joint optimization of offloading decision-making, VUE clustering, subchannel and computation resource allocation, and transmission power control. Since the proposed problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, which is difficult to solve, we decouple it into two subproblems and propose two heuristic algorithms to solve the task offloading and the MEC resource assignment problem, respectively, and finally, we obtain the closed-form solutions for cloud-related optimization problems through simple analysis.

Standardization for recently started IEEE 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7) Working Groups has focused on significant medium access control layer changes that emphasize the role of the access point (AP) in radio resource management for coordinating channel access due to the high collision probability with the distributed coordination function (DCF), especially in dense overlapping Wi-Fi networks. This article proposes a novel multi-AP coordination system architecture aided by a centralized AP controller. Meanwhile, a deep reinforcement learning channel access (DLCA) protocol is developed to replace the binary exponential backoff mechanism in DCF to enhance the network throughput by enabling the coordination of APs. First-order model-agnostic meta-learning further enhances the network throughput. Subsequently, we also put forward a new greedy algorithm to maintain proportional fairness (PF) among multiple APs. Via the simulation, the performance of DLCA protocol in dense overlapping Wi-Fi networks is verified to have strong stability and outperform baselines such as shared transmission opportunity and request-to-send/clear-to-send in terms of the network throughput by 10\% and 3\% as well as the network utility considering PF by 28.3\% and 13.8\%, respectively.},

Furthermore, to avoid unwanted operations caused by abnormal data under external faults, abnormal data index is designed to identify abnormal data. Saturation index is proposed to improve the security of ECDP in the case of CT saturation. Compared with CDP, ECDP has a faster respond speed for internal faults. ECDP can perform well under different operation modes of MMC-HVdc station and various fault conditions.

To address this imperfect hardware problem, phase shifter impairments are modeled, and robust hybrid beamforming is formulated to maximize the worst-case signal-to-interference–plus-noise ratio (SINR). The digital beamformer and analog beamformer are jointly optimized based on an alternating optimization (AO) approach, where both the outage probability of users and the average transmit power at the base station (BS) are derived into closed-form expressions in each iteration. Moreover, the semidefinite programming (SDP) approach is resorted to handling the hybrid beamforming design. Based on the penalty and the successive convex approximation (SCA) approaches, we further propose a penalty-SCA-SDP-AO (PSSA) algorithm to address the constant-modulus constraint caused by phase shifters and the rank-one constraint introduced by the semidefinite form. Simulation results show that compared to the conventional nonrobust design, our robust hybrid beamforming design generally improves 40\% nonoutage performance at least.},

In the proposed scheme, the internal voltage and reactive power of the synchronous generator (SG) have been exploited to fulfill the condition of not needing the threshold amount because they are directly dependent on the rotor field and continuously reduced during the LOE, leading to having a negative polarity of variation. However, due to slow dynamic variation during the LOE condition, they are multiplied to accelerate and highlight the reduction changes, giving rise to increasing the detection speed. Meanwhile, owing to the considerable difference between the value of internal voltage and reactive power and to highlight the effect of multiplication function, an adaptive gain on the basis of steady-state parameters of SG is suggested. Furthermore, given that the negative polarity of the multiplied parameters can be affected during the hybrid events, the limited integral function is implemented to eliminate the happened swings, resulting in keeping the negative polarity and thus clustering the hybrid events reliably. The performed simulations on the IEEE 9-bus and 39-bus test systems prove that the provided setting-free protection can detect all types of the events reliably and quickly than other schemes.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the physical layer security (PLS) is investigated for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided wireless communication systems, where one RIS is deployed to assist the communications between a pair of transmitter (Alice) and receiver (Bob), under a passive eavesdropper (Eve) attack. For the Eve, different from the bounded channel state information uncertainty model, the distribution of the Eve’s location is introduced into the wiretap link. In the proposed system, considering that the Eve can overhear signals transmitted from Alice or reflected by the RIS, two scenarios are studied for RIS-aided secure communication systems: one is that the Eve distributes close to Alice without the RIS orientation, and the other is that the Eve locates close to Bob and in the presence of the RIS. After investigating the probability distribution functions of the Eve’s location and the wiretap link, the novel cumulative density functions (CDFs) of the received signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the Eves are, respectively, derived for the two considered scenarios, taking into account the effects of RIS reflection coefficients, pathloss, and Eve’s location distribution. The closed-form expressions for the probability of the nonzero secrecy capacity and the ergodic secrecy capacity are obtained, providing insights into the impact of the Eve’s location uncertainty and the RIS design on the secrecy performance. Moreover, based on the derived CDFs for received SNRs at Eves, the secrecy outage probabilities are, respectively, analyzed. Specifically, under the constraint of the secrecy outage probability, the closed forms of the minimum required SNRs at Bob and the number of RIS elements are also obtained. Simulation and analytical results corroborate the derived expressions and reveal the tradeoff between the system’s energy efficiency and the number of RIS elements.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a reliable and efficient medium access control (MAC) protocol, RE-MAC, for resource-constraint underwater acoustic multimedia communication systems. RE-MAC achieves scalability by utilizing a hybrid MAC protocol smartly, which takes advantage of contention, reservation, and null data packet (NDP) based channel access mechanisms. The proposed scheme achieves multihop communication and synchronization for video streaming using a transmission opportunity (TXOP) based efficient channel access mechanism at the access point (AP) and relay nodes. TXOP time has been utilized by relay and AP for sending stream of frames with low overhead. To improve the efficiency in multihop communication, RE-MAC finds an optimal frame duration for relays and AP. RE-MAC efficiently places the NDP mechanism replacing traditional ACK-based control packet exchange. We incorporate the TXOP in AP and relay nodes for multimedia streaming and sleep mode for stations. Further, the video compression technique gives the efficiency of our system to improve the transmission of multimedia data. Our proposed schemes help communicate multimedia data without compromising the quality of service. We have demonstrated our proposed scheme experimentally in a prototype. After that, a simulation-based detailed performance analysis is provided to see the scalability of the proposed scheme. Compared to the existing state-of-the-art solutions, RE-MAC significantly delivers the throughput, energy consumption, delay, and packet loss.},

This article focuses on visualizing low frequency oscillatory modes, their detection, and classification following an event. The significant oscillatory modes present in the signal are extracted through a novel energy preserving, nonredundant “frequency partition based mode extraction (FPBME)” algorithm. These modes are analytically deduced and classified as governor mode, interarea mode, and local mode through a novel “energy based mode detection and classification (EBMDC)” algorithm. This article proposed method introduces the concept of “visualization” that is highly operator-friendly through the time domain plots of extracted modes. Time-domain plots of mode’s instantaneous frequency and instantaneous energy, which are considered fundamental characterization of low-frequency oscillations, are also portrayed through the developed method. The proposed method is validated through various scenarios of Kundur’s two-area system and IEEE-39 bus system. A practical test case on the ISO-NE system is also verified through the suggested scheme. Comparison of the proposed method in the context of visualization with other methods such as the Hilbert–Huang technique and continuous wavelet transform is also discussed in this article.

In this article, we present a novel design for a functional modular exoskeleton composed of four independent active joints using a decentralized electronic architecture, being the first wearable exoskeleton to apply this technology. This new approach avoids the use of a main processor, and the modular scheme allows every possible configuration between the hip and knee. The decentralized electronic architecture is enabled by implementing adaptive central pattern generator (CPG) algorithms in each module controller. Each CPG has been trained to mimic the joint trajectory of a healthy person walking. The communication between modules assures their coordination through synchronization terms. The operation of each configuration was first tested on a bench at different speeds and later used by a healthy subject. These tests show how the decentralized control strategy maintains the synchronization between modules, reproducing and adapting the trained walking pattern. These results prove that our proposal is suitable for the development of exoskeletons focused on personalized therapies.},

In this article, a multiobjective optimal MESV dispatch model is established to minimize the power loss, renewable energy source curtailment, and total operating cost of ADNs. Additionally, a method to directly obtain the compromise optimal solution (COS) of the Pareto optimal solutions (POSs) of a three-objective optimization problem is proposed. Based on the normalized normal constraint (NNC) method for solving the POSs of a three-objective optimization problem, a bilevel optimization model is established to directly obtain the COS. The innerlayer model uses the NNC method to calculate the POS corresponding to a point on the Utopia plane, and the outerlayer model uses the improved Nelder–Mead (INM) method to directly search the POS with the minimum distance to the Utopia point as the COS. Compared with the traditional method, which first solves the POSs of the three-objective optimization problem and then selects the COS, the proposed INM method has higher computational efficiency and obtains a better COS. Finally, case studies on the modified IEEE-33 bus distribution network and an actual 180 bus distribution network demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

This joint design problem can be decoupled into reflecting beamforming and hybrid precoding/combining design problems. However, such a decoupled approach experiences difficulties in solving the reflecting beamforming design problem. A known solution further reformulates the reflecting beamforming design problem into a more tractable problem addressed by a Riemannian manifold optimization (RMO)-based algorithm. However, the application of the RMO-based algorithm to solve the reformulated problem may lead to performance degradation given that the reformulated problem differs from the original one. Moreover, the RMO-based algorithm is tailored for the IRS with infinite-resolution phase shifters rather than practical finite-resolution phase shifters. Furthermore, the complexity of the RMO-based algorithm remains high. Therefore, we propose two coordinate descent method-based algorithms to tackle these issues. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms compared with the state-of-the-art RMO-based algorithm.},

Besides, inspired by the movement of bird flocks, the light transmission model is proposed to improve the conventional potential field functions, which can realize the UAV swarm with the capability of repulsion in the short-range, speed and position cooperation in the middle range, and attraction in the remote range. Then, the distributed control architecture and the control algorithm of UAVs are designed, and the stability of the swarm is proved correspondingly. In the end, several numerical simulation results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, which illustrates the distributed control architecture of the swarm system to be more adaptable, stable, and scalable.

  abstract     = {The combination of nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provides an effective solution for achieving massive connections and improving spectrum efficiency. However, the related security risk becomes serious due to the line-of-sight (LoS) channels involved and high transmit power for weaker users in NOMA-UAV networks. In this article, a UAV-assisted NOMA transmission scheme is proposed to achieve secure downlink transmission via artificial jamming, where a UAV flies straightly to serve multiple ground users in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. During the flight, only the closest NOMA users are chosen to connect with the UAV in each time slot to achieve high LoS probability. To balance the security and transmission performance, the tradeoff between the jamming power and the sum rate is investigated by jointly optimizing the power allocation, the user scheduling and the UAV trajectory. The formulated problem is mixed-integer and nonconvex due to the coupled variables. To address this, we first decompose the problem into two subproblems of power allocation and trajectory optimization. Then, they are transformed into convex ones via the first-order Taylor expansion. After that, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the convex problem. Finally, numerical results show that the security of the network is well enhanced and verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

To confirm the secrecy transmission, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing duplex mode selection and secrecy transceivers to maximize the overall secrecy spectral efficiency, where the information signals at APs are injected with artificial noise (AN) to prevent interception of information by Eves. Considering that downlink secure beamforming, uplink transmission power, and uplink receivers are tightly coupled in both the objective function and the constraints, we propose a two-loop strategy to solve the optimization problem. In particular, we propose a quantum-inspired tabu search algorithm to find a better duplex mode in the outer loop for each iteration. Then, for the inner loop, we propose a successive convex approximation based iterative algorithm to optimize the transceivers and AN by fixing the duplex mode selection vectors obtained from the outer loop. To address the proposed inner loop design subproblem, we resolve the subproblem by a series of nonconvex-convex approximate methods, such as the equivalent transformation and the iterative concave-convex procedure. The simulation results show that the proposed solution can achieve a higher secrecy spectral efficiency gain than the fixed-mode duplex scheme and simple greedy duplex mode selection schemes and achieve secrecy spectral efficiency performance similar to that of the optimal exhaustive search solution for both noncolluding Eve and colluding Eve cases.},

In our model, the concepts of latitudes of acceptance, noncommitment, and rejection from social judgment theory and the cognitive error in the process of persuasion, namely assimilation, are introduced. When people are exchanging their opinions with their neighbors, the opinions in the latitude of acceptance will be assimilated, those in the latitude of noncommitment will keep unchanged, and those in the latitude of rejection will not be considered. Theoretical proofs show that our model will converge to a stable state in a finite time. Numerical results of extensive simulation experiments on four datasets show the performance of the model.

Although a vast amount of work has analyzed mobility from both analytic and stochastic points of view, much of it has focused on a time-based analysis and disregarded spectral features. In this article, we propose a method of analyzing the main features of mobility traces in the frequency domain and determining the possible relationships between typical mobility grades (in terms of average and maximum speed) and the required sampling frequencies. The collection and storage of mobility pattern samples when they are not required is impractical, and therefore, we attempt to demonstrate how mobility can be sampled to avoid information loss or oversampling (many works in the literature are based on a default sampling period of 1 s). The work also contributes with the proposal of a closed form for relating the sampling period and average moving speed with the spectral components. We conducted numerous simulations to confirm that, compared with classical sampling approaches that provide static behavior, it is possible to obtain a gain of about 35\%–65\% in the collected samples, with a negligible loss of accuracy in the reconstructed signal.},

Existing unmeasured PV sources violate the white noise assumption in Kalman and least-squares-based estimators, causing the estimator to be biased. Because the one-step difference of aggregated customer demand is characterized as white noise, the suggested PV estimation technique based on the differencing strategy is used to decouple PV from the measured load. Using the specified contribution factors, the new online pseudo current injections are generated. In addition, the estimator’s accuracy is improved by using a new PV-scaling-aided ACKF approach based on the PV separation strategy. For validation purposes, this method is applied to real DN case studies. This study also makes use of an actual dataset to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed technique. The proposed technique outperforms the existing snapshot and dynamic DSSE techniques, and significant improvements are achieved in terms of accuracy and computational cost.},

However, many of these schemes are insecure against various attacks. In this article, we analyze the security of an efficient certificateless aggregate signature with conditional privacy preservation in Internet of vehicles. The results of the analysis show that it is insecure against forgery attack. In order to overcome the security vulnerability, we put forth an improved scheme. Then, the formal and informal security analysis of our improved scheme both are provided, which show that the improved scheme meets the expected security requirements and is secure against several known attacks in VANETs. Finally, performance evaluation shows that our improved scheme is feasible for the VANETs in terms of computation and communication overhead.},

This IoT-enabled smart grid tackles challenges brought by renewable penetration in new ways: Accurate and real-time information allows for the application of artificial-intelligence-powered computation. We employ the deep learning framework and consider the problem of storage control facing uncertainties in renewable generation. We propose both model-based and model-free storage control frameworks to identify the value of information. For the first framework, opposing to most deep-learning-oriented research in the electricity sector, we use the one-shot load decomposition technique to encode structural information into the learning framework. The structural information refers to the fact that the one-shot load decomposition maintains the control strategy space. Based on this structural information, we develop the storage control policy by utilizing a deep learning framework for price and renewable prediction, which is the basis of our deep-learning-enabled storage control. For the model-free framework, we regard historical price and demand data as input and directly output the control actions. For each model, we further establish theoretical analysis on how the uncertainties in price and renewables influence the cost. Numerical evaluations illustrate the remarkable performance of our proposed frameworks and reveal the value of information.},

This platform provides Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading among MG prosumers to achieve a win–win outcome in the presence of emerging energy resources, such as electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage systems (ESSs), and demand response programs (DRPs). P2P energy trading, from the power system perspective, can facilitate energy balance locally and self-sufficiency. Despite the conventional noncooperative game that players act individually, prosumers can cooperate in exchanging energy and reaping economic benefits in the proposed model. To this end, a bargaining cooperative game is adopted due to MGs autonomy and self-interest. Besides, to avoid prosumers’ private data launching, the fast-alternating direction method of multipliers is introduced to solve MGs&#39; energy management problem in a decentralized manner. A robust optimization method is also applied to manage electricity market uncertainty, allowing MGs operators to decide how much risk they want to consider by adjusting the uncertainty budget parameter. The numerical results show that MGs can actively trade with each other and achieve economic benefits. Moreover, many of the utilized technologies such as ESS, DRP, and EVs assist MGs in sharing more energy with each other.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel approach that considers the time-varying load restoration capability is proposed for operational reliability assessment of distribution networks. To evaluate the operational reliability, two indices are firstly defined as the minimal load loss under the worst-case fault contingency in the upcoming time interval. To search for the optimal remedial actions for load restoration, a sequential network reconfiguration (NR) model is then proposed considering the reconfigurability of feeders and capability of emergent power support of energy storage systems (ESSs). Since this model is a complex nonlinear mixed integer programming model, an improved greedy searching-based algorithm is proposed to compute the optimal remedial actions and to further evaluate the risk of load loss. Comparative case studies are presented in this article to demonstrate that the load level, the expectation of the state-of-charge of ESS and the failure duration have the impacts on the system operational reliability. Besides, the proposed sequential NR model can be used to enhance the reliability of distribution networks by enabling an effective sequential load transfer strategy under emergent conditions. Unlike traditional reliability assessment, the proposed method provides the operators with the real-time awareness of the operational reliability level considering the real-time condition of distributed resource equipped feeders and worst-case emergency constraints.},

Based on multiagent consistency theory, the distributed secondary controller is established. Second, the event trigger function of the secondary controller is constructed, and the stability of the secondary controller is proved by Lyapunov theorem. Third, a data predictive controller is established to train and learn the historical voltage, frequency, and active power of MG by using the improved extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm. When communication is interrupted, the ELM controller is triggered and the lost data is compensated in time. Finally, the effectiveness of the control strategy is verified by simulation. Simulation results show that the proposed control strategy effectively adjusts the frequency and voltage, realizes accurate active power sharing, reduces the communication burden, and improves the reliability of MG.},

The simultaneous and hierarchical optimization of multiple agents has not yet been attempted. The techno-economic aspects can be accomplished more effectively if the energy management framework considers hierarchically coordinated decision-making of all agents. The decisions of all agents are interlinked and can be realized with a hierarchical Stackelberg game model. This article proposes an energy management framework incorporating a three-level hierarchical decision approach, through which multiple operating agents can actively participate in energy management to achieve their respective goals. In this framework, a game-theoretic dynamic pricing scheme is used to enable the interaction of distribution utility and microgrid operators as well as the microgrid operators and end-user aggregators. This arrangement enables end-user aggregators to negotiate adequately with microgrid operators. This article also investigates the impact of risk-averse and risk-seeker decisions of microgrid operators on the operating cost of distribution utility. The numerical results establish the effectiveness of the proposed framework and demonstrate that the proposed participatory strategy can improve economic benefits with technical aspects, such as lower peak demand and improved voltage profiles.},

The primary side of SPIT is connected to the faulty phase and its leading phase; the secondary side of SPIT is connected to the fault leading phase and ground. The influence of the leakage impedance of SPIT is analyzed. Parameters of leakage impedance angle and ratio of the SPIT are designed to achieve a desirable compensation effect. The proposed topology does not rely on the neutral point of the distribution network. The compensation effect of the proposed topology under different grounding capacitances and grounding resistances is analyzed.

Based on traditional data aggregation, multisubset data aggregation can obtain data distribution characteristics rather than just the sum of data. However, almost all existing multisubset aggregation schemes do not pay attention to adjusting the size of subsets according to the data distribution, which limits the data utility. In this article, a flexible subset data aggregation (FSDA) scheme based on Paillier homomorphic encryption for smart grids is proposed. The proposed FSDA scheme can dynamically adjust the size of each subset and aggregate the electricity consumption data into the corresponding subsets while protecting individual privacy. It is proved that FSDA scheme can obtain the distribution of consumption data and resist various internal attacks aiming to expose the individual or aggregated data. Experimental results show that FSDA scheme has lower overhead compared with related schemes, which is practical for resource-constrained smart meter devices.},

As the technological advancements, the great demands for the scales of antenna arrays and frequency bands adopted in mobile communications become imperative. The essential radio frequency (RF) chains and phase shifters (PSs) turn into the principal causes of excessive energy dissipation in the massive MIMO mmWave systems. Accordingly, a complexity-efficient SI-based network is being substituted for a massive volume of energy-consuming high-resolution PSs in the analog RF precoder. As a consequence, the need of hardware complexity and energy consumption is alleviated significantly and thus results in superior energy efficiency (EE) performance. In addition, an innovative integration of the GenSM and the SI-based hybrid precoder is exploited as well in the article. The updated version of the coordinate update algorithm is developed and utilized to the analog precoding design. Furthermore, the spatial multiplexing gain acquired by the extra space-domain information of the GenSM mechanism improves substantially the spectral efficiency of the system. Finally, simulation results demonstrate remarkable performances on both the achievable sum-rate and the EE.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces an antieavesdropping method named cooperative beamforming that simultaneously exploits the benefits of multiple-input multiple-output and coordinated multiple-point communications. Specifically, to enhance the security of the user terminal (UT), we propose to employ multiple multiantenna base stations to cooperatively form beams that intersect at a small area, where messages can only be well received. In particular, the original message intended for the UT is divided into submessages, each of which will be transmitted by different base stations. A counterintuitive phenomenon is discovered that the crossing point of beams is not the achievable rate highest point from the perspective of antieavesdropping communications. Correspondingly, an optimization problem is formulated to find beam azimuths and select proper serving base stations for maximizing the achievable rate under the security constraint. A Nelder–Mead-based algorithm is developed to optimize beam azimuths for maximizing the achievable rate of the UT for a given group of selected serving base stations. To address the mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem in selecting serving base stations, we further develop a low-complexity algorithm. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is near to the exhaustive search, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed antieavesdropping method.},

To solve the problem, this article explores a novel SE algorithm with enhanced SE accuracy for power systems against consecutive DoS attacks. First, according to the characteristics of data packet losses induced by DoS attacks, we design a strategy by using the latest received measurement packet to compensate for consecutive data packet losses, and reconstruct the power system model. Second, by integrating Holt’s two-parameter exponential smoothing and extended Kalman filter techniques, a new enhanced SE algorithm is proposed, where the statistical properties of data packet losses are contained in the recursion formulas of the state prediction and state filtering processes. Third, the boundedness of estimation error covariance matrix and prediction error are proved. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with traditional SE algorithms via three IEEE testing systems and verified in a real power system. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm under various data packet losses scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel wide-area scheme is proposed based on a new sink and source area (SSA) concept. The SSA concept identifies the sink and source regions using a limited number of system voltage phasors. These voltage phasors can be easily transmitted to the control center using a few number of phasor measurement units (PMUs). The SSA idea is used to determine the priority of load buses or regions in the load shedding procedure. Since the SSAs are directly dependent to the generation and load distributions among the resource and demands, they vary over the time. The load shedding locations identified by SSA will accordingly change, which makes more technical sense versus selection of fixed candidates regardless of the real-time operation status. Furthermore, the amount of load shedding is adaptively determined based on the comprehensive analysis of interaction characteristics between load buses. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on two networks under various realistic scenarios. The simulation studies’ results reveal promising operation of the proposed approach comparing to that of other load shedding techniques. Moreover, the required number of PMUs and communication infrastructure are presented and the impact of communication link delay on the proposed algorithm is investigated.},

  abstract     = {To solve a decentralized radio resource management problem in a 5G vehicular network, we propose a novel resource allocation algorithm based on a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MARL). We let each vehicle act as an individual agent that can select a unique combination of transport block (TB) and transmission power to broadcast periodic packets. Agent explores the environment and collects observations that later will be used to find the best combination of TB and transmission power. We apply an actor-critic reinforcement learning technique to choose optimal TB for each agent. To eliminate a nonstationarity in a multiagent setting, we utilize a centralized training that allows all agents to share their observations over critic networks. The information shared through critic network can assist each agent to learn the policies of other agents. In a decentralized execution, each agent may only use its actor network and local observation to find the most appropriate TB in the given level of transmission power. While training, the actions taken by actor are evaluated by corresponding critic that maps Q-value for all feasible actions in the given state. Our method results in 18\% higher packet reception ratio than a spectrum allocation scheme based on a double DQN. The proposed method achieves 33\% higher reward than the previous state-of-the-art that is also based on MARL.},

This sliding mode can not only eliminate singular values, but also ensure that settling time is irrelevant to the initial conditions of system states. Then, an ANFTSMC law is designed by combining NFTSM and adaptive techniques. The significant features of this approach are that the proposed controller is continuous and chattering free, and the fixed-time stability is ensured in the presence of uncertainties and actuator faults. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed sliding mode surface and the errors can converge into a small neighborhood in the scheduled time.

Most existing works focus on either spatial attributes or keyword attributes over encrypted spatial keyword data, which cannot solve the problem of geographic keyword range queries directly. And several other works considering these two attributes have some limitations in terms of query efficiency and security assurance. In this article, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving geographic keyword Boolean range query (EPBRQ) scheme to solve existing challenges in the current work. In particular, we design a recoding algorithm to break the limits of the current work to achieve lower time complexity and employ secure Knn computation to protect user data privacy comprehensively.

This article proposes a data-driven model predictive control-based proactive scheduling strategy for microgrids subject to extreme weather events. The goal is to maximize the utility value of the building by realizing the difference between the comfort level of critical loads and the total operating cost of the commercial microgrid during the planning horizon. A two-layer framework is proposed to solve the considered problem. First, the aggregate demand load measured by smart meters is processed using a combined long short-term memory and fuzzy neural network algorithm to eliminate anomaly data. Then, the obtained real data are applied through the deep-Q network method to seek appropriate proactive scheduling solutions. However, the rewards obtained from the deep-Q network method are random because of the uncertainties in extreme events. Therefore, robust optimization namely, robust deep reinforcement learning, is incorporated to enhance the robustness of the solutions. The proposed framework ensures the optimality and feasibility of the commercial microgrid&#39;s proactive scheduling strategy within the uncertainties in extreme events and the different intensity levels of anomalous data. Extensive simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed optimization model and algorithm for enhancing commercial microgrid resilience in extreme events. Furthermore, it also shows good ability in detecting smart meters anomalous data, with a stable convergence value of the performance index, to secure commercial microgrid smart meter data.},

In this article, we consider a time-constrained data gathering problem from a network of sensing devices and with assistance from a UAV. A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed to further help in improving the connectivity and energy efficiency of the UAV. This integrated problem brings challenges related to the configuration of the phase shift elements of the RIS, the scheduling of IoT devices&#39; transmissions, as well as the trajectory of the UAV. First, the problem is formulated with the objective of maximizing the total number of served devices each during its activation period. Owing to its complexity, we leverage deep reinforcement learning in our solution; the UAV trajectory planning is modeled as a Markov decision process, and proximal policy optimization is invoked to solve it. Next, the RIS configuration is then handled via block coordinate descent. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of our solution approach that, in many cases, outperforms other methods by more than 50\%. We also show that integrating an RIS with a UAV in IoT networks can improve the UAV energy efficiency.},

Specifically, we divide the users into confidential subscribers with secure communication requirements and general communication users with simple communication requirements. During the communication period, we guarantee the secure rate of the confidential subscribers while ensuring the service quality of the general communication users, thereby reducing the transmit power of the BS. To realize such a secure and green information transmission, the BS implements a beamforming design on the transmitted signal superimposed with artificial noise (AN) and then broadcasts it to users with the assistance of the IRS’s reflection. We develop an alternating optimization framework to minimize the BS downlink power with respect to the active beamformers of the BS, the AN vector at the BS, and the reflection phase shifts of the IRS. A successive convex approximation method is proposed so that the nonconvex beamforming problems can be converted to tractable convex forms. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is convergent and can reduce the transmit power by 20\% compared to the best benchmark scheme.},

  abstract     = {The increasing demand for improving fuel efficiency of marine transportation has presented opportunities for the development of the power management system (PMS). Different from the terrestrial power system, a shipboard power system contains a large proportion of propulsion loads, which has the characteristics of high dynamics, periodicity, uncertainty, and high dependence on the marine environment. The propulsion load fluctuation induced by sea waves, in-and-out-of water effects, and changeable consumers requirements, may lead to a low power quality and fuel efficiency and it brings challenges in the development of the marine PMS. In addition, the fluctuated load profiles could also be volatile and unpredictable, which makes long-term load forecasting unrealizable and real-time load forecasting essential. To address these issues, a real-time two-layer PMS is proposed for hybrid-powered ship in this article, that can maintain a high fuel efficiency and a healthy state-of-charge (SOC) level over the voyage even in extreme sea conditions. To adapt well to the fluctuated and changeable load condition, a novel multistep load forecasting system is integrated to make accurate load forecasting in a very very short-term time scale (centisecond). Multiple cases studies are conducted under different cases of voyage time, sailing speed, wave conditions, and submergence ratios. The results show that the proposed PMS can significantly reduce the power tracking delays, improve the fuel efficiency, and maintain a healthy SOC level.},

In the case of active eavesdroppers, perfect channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be available, whereas for passive eavesdroppers, only statistic CSI is available. Both self-interference (SI) mitigation and BS-aided cooperative jamming are considered for the D2D secure transmissions. For system design, nonconvex power minimization problems under transmission rate constraints are formulated and convex approximated for efficiently obtaining numerical solutions. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can well coordinate the cellular transmissions and the FD-D2D secure transmissions, while the cooperative jamming strategy can enhance the D2D transmission security, especially in the case of passive eavesdroppers.},

  abstract     = {Shipboard integratedpower systems (SIPSs) usually have multifaceted operational objectives in engineering scenarios, and many key tasks are performed by multiple pulsed power loads (PPLs) with a high power density. Owing to the complexity of the ocean environment, the optimization of SIPS comprehensive performance remains challenging. This article proposes a multiobjective energy management strategy of multiple PPLs in SIPSs. A multiobjective energy coordination model is formulated. By identifying typical operation modes of the SIPS based on discrepant priority, the PPL utility and maneuverability are incorporated into the comprehensive regulation objective in the form of a weighted sum. In the case of limited energy supply, the service duration is further considered in the optimization objective to meet the high survivability requirements. Reasonable methods are adopted to quantitatively evaluate different performances. Moreover, to improve SIPS survivability in the face of emergencies, a system-level energy allocation scheme with maneuverability enhancement is formulated to coordinate the power consumption of different functions. A particle swarm optimization algorithm with directional guidance and selective evaluation of the nonconvex constraint is proposed to solve the optimization problem effectively. Case studies on a typical SIPS under various working scenarios are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

We propose signal quantization and reception strategies to facilitate the distributed reception system by allowing a small amount of data-exchange. First, we develop a singular direction-based signal quantizer to include more channel gain in the received signals by employing low-resolution codebooks. Furthermore, we develop a minimum mean square error type receiver for a user cooperation network to facilitate distributed reception without the aid of a fusion center. Lastly, a quantization resource allocation algorithm is developed to maximize network throughput by using limited quantization resources.

More specifically, when the data rate exceeds the OSC threshold determined by the RHIs level, the communication of the entire network ceases no matter what the signal-to-noise ratio is. In addition, we derive the achievable diversity gain of the considered network, and demonstrate that the diversity gain always equals zero due to the existence of RHIs and RSI.

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies with rich bandwidth can greatly alleviate the surging traffic demand of wireless communication from mobile video streaming. However, the harsh propagation environment at mmWave bands and user mobility make it hard to provide a reliable service. Multibeam transmissions can be taken as an essential approach for maintaining a robust mmWave link. Meanwhile, the introduction of coded caching can further reduce the end-to-end latency and backhaul traffic. Considering the interaction between caching and transmission in mobility scenario, we develop a joint design for mmWave heterogeneous networks (HetNets), by combining multibeam transmission and maximum distance separable (MDS)-coded caching. First, a joint optimization problem of cache placement and beam pair selection is formulated, in order to maximize the backhaul traffic offload in mmWave HetNets. To solve the mixed-timescale mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, we then decompose the joint problem into the long-term mobility-based proactive content caching (CC) and short-term content delivery (CD) subproblems. Subsequently, two many-to-many matching-based algorithms are proposed for tackling the CD subproblem and the convex technique is applied to deal with the CC subproblem. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms over benchmark schemes.},

As the checking incurs extra costs, a lot of research has been done to find the optimal checking strategy. However, there remain two problems: 1) What kind of influence does the competition between CSPs for clients have on the checking strategies? 2) How to incorporate the influence of CSP&#39;s reputation in a reasonable and practicable way? To solve these problems, we propose a one-population evolutionary game model. The competition for clients is first captured via the game between CSPs. Then, we introduce a reputation term in the game model, which is defined as the function of checking probability. We analyze the model, and then, derive the thresholds of checking probability. A verifier can optimize the use of checking resources whatever checking methods are using according to the thresholds. Finally, we conduct various comparison experiments between our model and another game-based model. The comparison results show that the long-term effects of competition and reputation can help a verifier save checking resources or promote the checking effect.},

Existing codebook allocation schemes for SCMA and PDNOMA-SCMA systems consider only the physical layer. We propose an iterative cross-physical-and-application-layer codebook allocation for uplink video communications. We allocate the codebook according to the channel state information of the physical layer, and codebooks are exchanged among users to minimize the sum of the video mean square error in order to increase the average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Furthermore, we propose a deep neural network (DNN) approach to reduce the computational complexity. We propose a novel postprocessing algorithm that is applied to the DNN output to ensure the constraints of codebook allocation are satisfied. Simulation results show that the proposed iterative PDNOMA-SCMA cross-layer codebook allocation scheme outperforms an existing scheme that uses only the physical layer by 1.27 dB in terms of PSNR (video quality) for 12 users, four subcarriers, and SNR = 21 dB. The proposed DNN-based approach has an execution time that is 67\% lower than the proposed iterative PDNOMA-SCMA cross-layer codebook allocation scheme, at the cost of a performance degradation of 0.84 dB.},

  abstract     = {Wind being stochastic in nature results in intermittent and fluctuating wind power sources. This affects the power quality during normal operation. Major causes for such changes are mainly due to tower shadow and wind shear effects (3p oscillations), which lead to active power changes and delay penetration of wind power into the grid. At times, due to lower short circuit ratios and grid impedance angle at the point of common coupling power quality concerns, such as voltage stability and flicker occur. This literature focuses on a method to mitigate flicker by reducing the grid current deviations using flexible ac transmission system (here, static synchronous series compensator) device under different modes. Due to changes in wind speed, the mechanical torque changes and as a result, its impact is visible on the grid current at the static synchronous series compensator. A detailed case-to-case study has been made for the grid-connected system for low as well as high wind speed conditions. The static synchronous series compensator has been used for capacitive series voltage injection as well as inductive series voltage injection. The proposed method attains a better reduction in flicker using static synchronous series compensator for inductive series voltage injection as seen using MATLAB/Simulink.},

To solve these issues, an improved MPE (IMPE) detector is proposed, which can speed up the convergence significantly with uncomplicated polynomial coefficients. However, a challenging problem of performing IMPE is needed to compute all the eigenvalues of channel covariance matrix in real time. Unfortunately, directly calculating the eigenvalues of the channel covariance matrix requires complexity, which is as costly as the matrix inverse. To this end, an inverse-transform-sampling based IMPE (ITS-IMPE) detector is proposed to enhance the convergence rate and accuracy in a simple way. First, the closed-form expression of the eigenvalue spectral cumulative distribution function of the channel covariance matrix is deduced analytically, which is a critical factor that influence the eigenvalues estimation. Second, the improved polynomial coefficients of ITS-IMPE are then introduced by a fast online ITS-based eigenvalues estimation algorithm and a least-squares fitting procedure, which achieve a well trade-off between precision and computation. Simulation results exhibit that ITS-IMPE detector is able to achieve a significant enhancement performance with much lower complexity compared with many reported detectors under Rayleigh fading channel and low spatial correlated channel.},

Particularly, the UAV moves according to the three-dimensional (3D) random way point model at low altitude in a complex urban environment. However, a stationary relay-station (RS) decodes and forwards the UAV’s signal over an IRS-aided virtual line-of-sight (LoS) link to a GCS. The highly dynamic and terrain-dependent UAV-to-RS channel follows the Beaulieu-Xie fading model. However, the RS-to-IRS and IRS-to-GCS links enjoy clear LoS; thus, follow the Rice fading model. We derive new closed-form expressions for the probability density functions (PDFs) and the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). Then based on the derived statistical expressions, several performance metrics including outage probability, average bit error rate, and ergodic channel capacity are derived in closed-forms. Additionally, simple and accurate approximated expressions in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime are also provided. The analytical results are validated through some representative numerical examples and supported by Monte-Carlo simulation results.},

In general, a phishing attack is carried out by the exercise of sending fraudulent communications (like a fake email with harmful uniform resource locators), that pretends to come from a reputable source. The problem of designing user authentication protocol for mitigating phishing attacks in OSNs is a challenging research problem. In this article, we propose a secure and lightweight cryptography-based authentication scheme, called authentication scheme for phishing attack (ASPA)-mobile online social network (mOSN), that provides resistance to phishing and other related attacks in OSNs. The security of the proposed scheme is explained using both informal security analysis and formal security analysis through the widely recognized real-or-random model and ProVerif simulation tool. Finally, we compare the security, functionality, computation, and communication costs of the proposed ASPA-mOSN with related schemes. The comparison results show that ASPA-mOSN outperforms other existing competing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Cloud-based Internet of Things systems facilitate cloud storage and provide cloud users with convenient data outsourcing service, although there are a number of associated risks to the users (e.g., an untrusted cloud server or their employee/vendor may delete rarely accessed data). In order to ensure that the cloud server stores the data correctly, users need to verify the integrity of remote data periodically. Most of the existing public auditing protocols only considered storing single copy on the cloud; in this case, the loss of users is irreparable when the data are damaged. Subsequently, some multicopy auditing schemes have been proposed where users can store multiple replicas on the cloud. However, it can be challenging to check the integrity of all the copies without incurring significant computation overheads for the auditor/user. Hence, this article proposes a provable multicopy integrity auditing scheme (PMCIA), which reduces the verification cost of the auditor to several lightweight hash operations. Using the medical settings (e.g., where electronic health records containing sensitive information of patients need to be preprocessed before outsourcing storage) as a use case, we explain how our proposed scheme can be deployed. Specifically, to minimize computation overhead for users (e.g., patients), we introduce a hospital information center to help patients generate multiple copies and corresponding tags. We then prove the security under the computational Diffie–Hellman assumption as well as evaluate the performance of our PMCIA scheme. Finally, we explain how PMCIA can be extended to support batch auditing to improve auditing efficiency for multiple auditing tasks.},

A distributed agent-based dual engine is proposed for coordinated ancillary service optimization, thereby reducing communication and computational burden. The strategy enables the microgrid operator and the LVDN aggregator, which are selfish entities, to perform ancillary service power exchanges by coordinating for both the active/reactive power as well as the compensation rates. The proposed strategy is numerically validated on a 30-node microgrid-LVDN test system consisting of solar PVs, conventional and renewable distributed generators, loads, community battery, and electric vehicles (EVs). This is shown to be beneficial than simply tracking a power profile by the LVDN or considering fixed compensation rates. Microgrid reduces its total operating cost significantly by approximately 31.78\%, while maintaining the voltage and state of charges of EVs and community battery within the operation limit. Further, ancillary service coordination for residential and commercial LVDNs with a car park is analyzed, and the study is extended to consider fast charging of EVs with other related constraints.},

Different from the civilian applications, the presence of various electronic countermeasures (ECM) in IoBT would destroy the infrastructure of a network, making the mobile edge computing (MEC) with quality of service (QoS) guaranteed in such a resource-limited IoBT more challenging. To improve the QoS of mobile users under an ECM environment, we address the optimization scheme in an MEC network with heterogeneous edge servers, considering that the connections in a network might be destroyed and therefore switch to the other connections for data transmission due to ECM. Mathematically, we characterize the optimization of wireless resource allocation as a mixed-integer nonlinear problem to maximize the relative improvement in task computation time and energy consumption. We decompose the original problem into a few suboptimization problems and propose a heuristic algorithm that can achieve a suboptimal solution in polynomial time by solving this NP-hard problem. The analytic results show that our proposed scheme can save task computation time and energy consumption over traditional approaches under an ECM environment.},

Aiming to solve the real-time transmission problem in the IIoT system, a delay-sensitive multibase-station multichannel access scheme is proposed. First, a multibase-station multichannel access model for real-time transmission is developed. The way to match sensing nodes with base stations and channels is formulated as a delay-sensitive multibase-station multichannel access (DMMA) problem. Moreover, it is theoretically proved that the DMMA problem is NP-Hard. Finally, a delay-sensitive greedy schedule (DG-Schedule) scheme based on the minimum deadline priority is proposed to obtain a feasible solution to the DMMA problem. According to experiments on the TI CC2530, DG-Schedule can reduce packet loss by 11\% and average latency by 88\% compared to CSMA/CA. Therefore, the DG-Schedule scheme is more suitable for IIoT scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicle (EV) has been applied as the main transportation tool recently. However, EVs still require a long charging time and, thus, inevitably cause charging congestion. The traditional plug-in charging mode is limited by fixed location and peak hours. Therefore, a flexible vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging mode is considered in this article. Here, parking lots (PLs) widely dispersed in cities are reused as a common place for V2V charging. EVs are divided into EVs as energy consumers and EVs as energy providers to form as vehicle-to-vehicle charging pairs (V2V-Pairs). In this article, we propose a V2V charging management scheme, which includes a distance-based V2V-Pair matching algorithm and a PL-selection scheme. As the occupation status at PLs is difficult to predict, to achieve high PL utilization and evenly PL selection, V2V charging reservation is introduced. Meanwhile, since EV drivers usually park at PLs within a limited duration, our proposed V2V charging scheme introduces the parking duration to optimize V2V charging under a temporal constraint. We simulate this V2V charging scheme under the Helsinki city scenario. The results prove that our proposed V2V charging scheme achieves great charging efficiency (minimized charging waiting time and maximized fully charging times).},

To this end, a new mathematical model, including the rules for buying and selling energy, is presented. In this model, a supply function bidding mechanism is formulated to match the power supply imbalance and calculate the market-clearing price. An optimization problem is formulated to identify the optimal strategies for energy buying and selling, which consists of two parts: the first part is to maximize the social welfare; the second part is to minimize the unfair benefit distribution that participants can gain through P2P energy trading. The case study based on the real data for four different household categories has revealed that households can achieve 26.38\% net cost reduction, and the proposed fair benefit distribution function also can fairly allocate the benefit by enforcing households&#39; benefit variance indexes at a low level.},

In C-RAN, the processing units, known as the baseband units (BBUs), are segregated from the individual remote radio heads (RRHs) and moved to a convenient location to serve more than one RRH. This migration leads to an efficient resource allocation and cost-effective solution at the expense of a huge fronthaul traffic between the RRH and BBU hotel. The required fronthaul data rate largely depends on the employed functional split options. In this article, we propose a novel optimal BBU placement with a mixed functional split scheme to combat the fronthaul latency challenge while providing the network with greater flexibility and cost reduction. We introduce an integer linear programming (ILP)-based BBU placement problem with a mixed functional split selection approach to simultaneously minimize the number of BBU hotels and fibers, thereby reducing the network cost.

In connected vehicle systems, connected cruise control (CCC) is a wildly concerned technique to improve traffic safety and mitigate congestion. In this article, an optimal state-estimation-based (SE-based) control algorithm is proposed in a backward recursion manner to regulate CCC vehicle&#39;s longitudinal motion under stochastic communication delays, state noises, and channel interferences. Based on the analysis of error dynamics of vehicles and optimal state estimation strategy, the SE-based system dynamics is first formulated by using the Kalman filtering method. Then, a two-step SE-based control algorithm aiming at minimizing the quadratic system cost is proposed to enhance the vehicular platoon stability. In particular, the optimal control strategy can be generated online as a linear function of the estimated state information and previous control signals, and the corresponding coefficient can be iteratively calculated in an offline step. Finally, the results are successfully extended to the case of arbitrary communication delays, and the condition for the asymptotically mean square stability of the proposed optimal SE-based CCC algorithm is derived. Simulation results indicate that the proposed SE-based control algorithm has better system performance and control stability compared with existing works.},

To avoid interference caused by unstable V2V links, a transmission mode selection is considered in the scheme design. In addition, we introduce a binarized weight algorithm to accelerate the deep neural network learning process and, therefore, improve the computational complexity of our scheme. Through extensive simulations and complexity analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme yields excellent performance in terms of the sum-rate and probability rate of V2I and V2V communication modes. We also compare the proposed scheme with binarized weights with other algorithms in terms of accuracy evaluation.},

  abstract     = {For millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems, hardware cost and power consumption can be reduced via hybrid precoding, while keeping almost the same spectral efficiency (SE) as the fully digital precoding scheme. However, for different hardware configuration and channel environments, system SE varies with the number of transmitted data streams at the transmitter, and hence this should be determined primarily before hybrid precoding design. In this article, for single-user massive MIMO systems, a regression model based on the support vector machine technique is proposed, through which the optimal number of data streams can be obtained automatically based on the propagation characteristics of wireless channels, the number of antennas, and RF chains. To validate the correctness of the proposed model, simulation results are presented under various parameter settings.},

  abstract     = {In Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), the certificate-based aggregate signature (CBAS) scheme was used to ensure privacy and security of IIoT, thus, the concrete construction of CBAS scheme without bilinear pairing has proposed, which was employed as an underlying building block to create an efficient data aggregation protocol. In this article, we first point out that the previous CBAS scheme cannot keep its claimed security. Particularly, a malicious KGC can compute a valid forgery signature, because it has the knowledge of the master secret key. After that, we discussed how specific forgery attacks could be made to against the existing CBAS schemes, which demonstrates that the previous related constructions cannot achieve its claimed security. In order to further provide a secure CBAS scheme for IIoT, we suggest a method to improve the CBAS scheme and propose a concrete construction of it. In the random oracle model, based on the hardness of discrete logarithm problem, the security of our new proposal can be proved. Compared with the previous CBAS schemes, our construction has better security, which is efficient with respect to computation and communication.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks have been widely applied in machinery health prognostics due to their powerful feature learning capacity. However, in many existing remaining useful life (RUL) prediction methods, the data distribution shift between multiple working conditions is ignored. In fact, there are inevitably certain differences between different working conditions. How to transfer knowledge to different but related domains for machine RUL prediction is not considered well. Thus, this article proposes a novel domain adaptation method named selective adversarial adaptation network (SAAN) for machine RUL prediction. A selective feature interaction is utilized in SAAN to implement knowledge selection, and the selective weights can be updated according to different data distribution. A new feature generator, residual convolutional long short-term memory is utilized for sequential information extraction from time-series input. Finally, two experiment on engine and bearing are utilized to validate the performance of SAAN for RUL prediction. The comparison results demonstrate that SAAN can implement knowledge transferring for machine RUL prediction.},

  abstract     = {Connected autonomous vehicles can significantly improve the safety and mobility of urban transportation systems. However, these systems are vulnerable to model uncertainties, wireless communication impairments, and external disturbances. In this article, we propose a new autonomous intersection management (AIM) system, called hierarchical model predictive control (HMPC). In HMPC, the intersection coordination unit (ICU) in a global centralized layer is responsible for assigning a safe speed to each vehicle while minimizing the system&#39;s cost. In the Local decentralized layer, each vehicle is responsible for tracking the reference speed assigned by the ICU, while avoiding collisions. In our method, each vehicle can use its own sensors to monitor its close surroundings, and take its own decisions on its movements, independent on the control decisions sent from the ICU. We investigate the safety, scalability and robustness of HMPC compared with two well-known AIM methods based on centralized and decentralized control strategies. For the evaluation, we use simulation of urban mobility (SUMO). Further, we study the scalability and performance of the algorithms in the presence of communication impairments associated with wireless channels. Our simulation results show that HMPC can safely handle high traffic flow rates. Also, HMPC is robust to uncertainties caused by the wireless communication.},

  abstract     = {Wireless sensor network (WSN), as one of the core technology in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) system, plays a critical role in collecting data for the monitoring areas. Security and privacy are essential to ensure the trustworthy completeness of data access and transmission for the WSN-based IIoT system. Recently, a series of excellent privacy-preserving authentication schemes for the WSN-based IIoT system have been proposed. There is, however, strong demand for further improvements in multiple registrations, user revocation, and forward secrecy. Targeted by these security issues, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving authentication scheme with revocability for multi-WSNs in the IIoT environment. In the proposed scheme, the user can access multiple different WSNs with the same identity and password through a single registration. Our scheme is provable secure under the random oracle model, and security analysis via practical circumstances shows that it is able to provide a variety of security requirements, such as user revocation, forward secrecy, etc. In addition, the comparison with related schemes indicates that the proposed one has fewer sensor nodes-based computations and overall communication overheads. It is, therefore, more suitable for the resource-constrained IIoT environment than existing approaches.},

They place emphasis on notions of domain and task, and neglect notions of structure and behavior. In doing so, they limit the extent to which formalism can be carried through into the elaboration of their frameworks. Herein, we use the Mesarovician systems theory to define transfer learning as a relation on sets, and subsequently, characterize the general nature of transfer learning as a mathematical construct. We interpret existing frameworks in terms of ours and go beyond existing frameworks to define notions of transferability, transfer roughness, and transfer distance. Importantly, despite its formalism, our framework avoids the detailed mathematics of the learning theory or machine learning solution methods without excluding their consideration. As such, we provide a formal, general systems framework for modeling transfer learning that offers a rigorous foundation for system design and analysis.},
