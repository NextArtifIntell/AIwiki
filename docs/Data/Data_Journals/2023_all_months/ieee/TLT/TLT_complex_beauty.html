  abstract     = {The education metaverse (Edu-Metaverse), as a simulated extension of the real world, is an infinite virtual space where learners can build their relationships with others and create interactive content. However, preparing learners to engage fully with Edu-Metaverse remains challenging. As technologies on Edu-Metaverse are new to learners, there is a lack of studies on how to enhance learner engagement with human–machine collaboration. Therefore, this study proposes a technology-enhanced Edu-Metaverse framework for facilitating learner engagement with human–machine interactions. The framework consists of two major components: technology enhancement of Edu-Metaverse and interactions among learners and avatars in Edu-Metaverse contexts. In the proposed framework, Edu-Metaverse reshapes the relationships between humans and machines. With the support of human–machine collaboration, learner engagement could be concluded in the following three patterns: training engagement guided by Edu-Metaverse, collaboration engagement supported by Edu-Metaverse, and creative engagement empowered by Edu-Metaverse. In addition, a case analysis is conducted to validate the Edu-Metaverse theoretical framework and engagement patterns. The proposed framework can provide a more holistic understanding of the Edu-Metaverse implications as well as learning designs that are aimed at enhancing learner engagement with the support of human–machine collaboration.},

This study aimed to design and develop a 3-D metaverse platform, “Learningverse” to support teaching, social, and cognitive presences. Learningverse combines the key features of an immersive learning environment with avatars that mirror the real users, rich social interactions among avatars, custom tools that allow users to construct or create their own artefacts, and a low threshold for users to join the metaverse on an ordinary computer with a webcam and without having to wear a VR headset. A usability test was conducted to understand students&#39; perceived teaching, social, and cognitive presences in a scenario called “Assembling the Solar System,” which had an immersive learning instructional design embedded in Learningverse. The study involved 36 postgraduate students in a course on the innovative design of interactive learning environments. The results showed that students perceived the three presences positively. Discussions were made, followed by design principles for the educational metaverse based on this study. Finally, future work was explored.},

  abstract     = {The metaverse entails modes of interactivity that hold enormous potential for education in various contexts and domains. The metaverse represents a convergence of technologies, such as immersive virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality, that allow for multimodal engagements with digital objects, virtual environments, and people. In this article, we focus specifically on the ways by which VR interactions with the metaverse can enhance learning and education. In our view, two primary issues have so far hindered the development of successful metaverse educational applications: first, the lack of theory-driven designs that use technologies such as VR in ways that are consistent with what we know about how people learn, and second, insufficient methods of evaluating metaverse technologies that go beyond usability and instead capture their efficacy for improving learning outcomes. To address these issues, this article aims to explore how three learning theories—experiential learning theory, distributed cognition theory, and embodied learning theory—can be applied to the design of educational VR, and how these theories can be leveraged to better support educational applications of the metaverse. We also introduce two science education VR environments developed in our lab that employ these theories to demonstrate how the design and development of the educational metaverse can be guided by research and evaluated on its ability to generate new learning.},

While virtual teaching communities have emerged as an approach to minimizing educational inequity through resource sharing and information exchange, the achievement of deep collaboration among individuals remains an area that requires further study. Metaverse, with its advanced behavior interaction capabilities, has shown the potential in promoting deep collaboration and communication among individuals. However, the pathway toward leveraging Metaverse for enhancing educational equity remains unclear. To address this gap, this study aims to review the concept and educational applications of Metaverse, as well as its evolution to pedagogical interactions within virtual teaching communities. This article, specifically, proposes the possibility of achieving educational equity by establishing a Metaverse-supported virtual community that leverages immersive environments for behavior interaction, employs diversified avatars for affective communication, and implements equitable mechanisms for knowledge creation. Overall, the present study underscores the importance of constructing a warmer virtual teaching community that promotes deep collaboration and equitable knowledge creation. By leveraging the capabilities of Metaverse, educators and learners can work together to create a more inclusive and equitable learning environment.},

Based on 310 academic papers published from 2004 to 2022, this study identifies contributors, scientific cooperations, and research themes using bibliometrics, social network analysis, topic modeling, and keyword analysis. Results suggest that Edu-Metaverse has been gaining increasing attention in academia since 2019. Countries/affiliations located in the same regions are close partners in scientific cooperation. By jointly interpreting topic modeling and keyword analysis results, this study reveals eight main themes in the field of Edu-Metaverse: 1) Metaverse-based physical education; 2) Metaverse-supported simulations for collaborative problem-based learning (PBL) in health/medical education; 3) 3-D virtual learning environment-supported art appreciation and creation in art education; 4) Metaverse-enabled laboratories for STEM education; 5) language and 21st century skill development through Metaverse-supported immersive language learning; 6) Metaverse for developing autism children’ social communication abilities; 7) virtual world Metaverse-supported gameful experience-based education; and 8) quantitative research on Edu-Metaverse focusing on learners’ experience. We also identified challenges and directions needing further attention: 1) data security and privacy protection; 2) balance between the real world and virtual world identities; 3) preparing instructors for Edu-Metaverse; and 4) assessment of higher-order thinking competencies in Edu-Metaverse-based PBL.

This opens the question on what a metaverse for education, or edu-metaverse, should look like. It is believed that this metaverse for learning should be grounded by a pedagogical theory. Particularly, we propose a constructivist metaverse learning theory with eight actionable principles to guide the edu-metaverse and its applications. With this metaverse learning theory, we further propose the framework for an edu-metaverse; it is essentially walkable yellow pages that connect knowledge. The core idea is to combine the structure of knowledge graphs and the immersion of virtual reality in order to facilitate association, exploration, and engagement in learning. Our current prototype for this edu-metaverse vision, K-Cube VR, is also presented. We have tested K-Cube VR for the introduction of course topics to our students and the results indicate that our edu-metaverse framework benefits students by providing a focused environment and structured learning on the topics of a course, akin to a mind map. Overall, in this article, we present an edu-metaverse design that is rooted in a constructivist pedagogy that already shows promising results from a pilot user study via our metaverse prototype.},

Offline learning has been the primary method for teaching and learning Chinese Kung Fu due to the inability of online 2-D videos to convey spatial information and provide feedback. To address the issues of the high cost of offline teaching, fixed perspectives in 2-D videos, lack of spatial path feedback, and the absence of practical Kung Fu teaching systems, this article proposes Kung Fu Metaverse: A new movement guidance training system. A digital character in the system is given nearly a hundred kinds of Chinese Kung Fu. Learners can observe the static postures and dynamic transitions of martial arts from various angles. Composite navigation module of our system provides learners with a feedback of spatial path teaching method so that they can receive real-time feedback when training. We recruited volunteers and conducted two experiments. The first compared the cognitive experience of volunteers in three different modes, while the second investigated the impact of voice prompts, trajectory settings, arrow indicators, and free gestures on learning outcomes. The results indicate that volunteers demonstrated significantly higher levels of satisfaction, comfort, and interactivity in the mixed reality (MR) mode. Compared to virtual reality, MR allows free movement and significantly reduces adverse effects such as sickness and dizziness. The addition of the composite navigation module improves the movement precision during practice. This work is a pioneering system that integrates nearly a hundred sets of traditional Chinese Kung Fu routines with a low-cost device.},

First, we developed a scenario of a rose theft, and then based on that, we created a town in the metaverse, which offered a variety of multimodal language input and missions to solve the problem and identify the thief. The entire activity was developed grounded in constructivist language learning principles (e.g., contextualized, motivating, interactive, and task-based learning), thus, learners could explore, play, and learn in the playful constructivist space. In total, 72 Korean EFL students participated in the activity. The study employed a mixed method for more robust research. Quantitative data (the pre- and posttests and the postsurvey) indicated that the students had a great interest in the activity and the learning outcome increased. Qualitative data (the students’ journals, the interviews with the teachers, and the screen recordings) further evidenced the students’ enjoyment of the activity. Particularly, the screen recordings showed how the students participated in the activity in the metaverse, collaboratively created an emergent narrative through interaction, and produced their own narrative to reach the answer. The study suggested pedagogical implications for using the metaverse for L2 learning based on the results of the study.},

To this end, a systematic literature review of articles published in Web of Science and Scopus since 2007 was carried out. In the selection process, 115 articles were identified, of which 34 deal with the metaverse in the field of Higher Education. The analysis shows that the educational metaverse follows a growing trend, since 23.5% of the publications are concentrated in the last year of the analysis and, furthermore, how the metaverse can be analyzed as a virtual learning environment from its three dimensions: technological, pedagogical, and content. Educational practices are identified in multiple areas of knowledge, with the educational metaverse being used in the learning of second languages and the simulation of professional environments, both of which are key to HE teaching. The experiences have had mostly positive results, especially due to the immersive potential of the metaverse and the active role of the learner, who becomes the protagonist of the action. Another key element identified in the development of educational strategies in the metaverse is interaction, not only within the techno-educational context, but also with the learning community itself and the communicative and interactive options that arise in this space.},

This article reports a pilot study that has two objectives: First, to investigate whether learning science with IVR leads to more positive learning outcomes than that with a traditional video-viewing activity; and second, to investigate whether corrective feedback produces more positive learning outcomes than explanatory feedback in IVR-mediated contexts. A randomized, controlled pilot trial was designed during a school year at a secondary school in western China. Forty-seven participatory students were randomly assigned to a control group (learning with instructional videos, n = 17), an intervention group 1 (learning with IVR with corrective feedback, n = 15), and an intervention group 2 (learning with IVR with explanatory feedback, n = 15). We evaluated an array of student learning-related outcomes, including extraneous and germane cognitive loads, intrinsic learning motivation, academic self-efficacy, learner satisfaction, and academic achievement. The results revealed a significant difference in intrinsic learning motivation, academic self-efficacy, learner satisfaction, and academic achievement, but an insignificant difference in extraneous and germane cognitive loads when students learned with video and IVR. In terms of the type of feedback provided in IVR-mediated environments, students who were prompted with corrective feedback and explanatory feedback showed little difference in their learning outcomes. The reasons related to the findings and limitations are discussed.},

Considering the prospect of application in the field of education, a series of studies on the design of Education Metaverse frameworks and applications have sprung up. However, there is no consensus on the technical framework of the Education Metaverse, and how to design the key elements is still an outstanding challenge. In this article, we propose a novel five-layer framework for the Education Metaverse guaranteed by management and incentives mechanisms, including physical layer, data layer, computational layer, interaction layer, and application layer. Moreover, the design criteria of three key elements (virtual avatars, virtual learning resources, and virtual teaching scenarios) in the Education Metaverse are presented, as well as interaction modes. Based on this technical framework and design criteria, we develop a prototype system to verify its feasibility and ease of use. This article provides a practical reference for the development and design of Education Metaverse applications, facilitating a step forward in the standardization of Education Metaverse.},

  abstract     = {Extended reality (XR) is a general term for virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). By converting abstract digital expressions into intelligent feedback through figures, one can effectively compensate for the poor performance of traditional learning in deep cognitive processing and operational skills training. However, the extant results are uncertain, and only a limited number of studies have investigated the influence mechanism of heterogeneity among VR, AR, and MR on procedural knowledge learning, higher-level presence and generative cognitive processing, higher-quality operational behavior, and knowledge transfer. This study explored and analyzed the influence of XR heterogeneity on procedural knowledge gain and operation training. Participants ( n = 127) were recruited from junior undergraduate students majoring in rail traffic signal and control. Based on the procedural disassembly and assembly of the ZD6 electric switch machine, an XR pretraining system and a 3-D-printed combined virtual-real procedural training system were developed to collect three types of data regarding knowledge gain, procedural training, and a set of questionnaires. Subsequently, a one-way analysis of variance was conducted with XR as the moderator variable. The results indicate that fully immersive VR is more conducive to procedural operation training; however, space and real factors must be considered. AR is consistent with the learner&#39;s operating habits, but the corresponding lack of immersion and interactivity restricts the improvement of procedural learning effects. MR multimodal perception leads to an increase in cognitive load, but moderate cognitive pressure is conducive to the cultivation of procedural cognition skills. Furthermore, this study proposes suggestions for using XR to intensify the perception and understanding of procedural cognitive actions.},

  abstract     = {In automated essay scoring (AES), essays are automatically graded without human raters. Many AES models based on various manually designed features or various architectures of deep neural networks (DNNs) have been proposed over the past few decades. Each AES model has unique advantages and characteristics. Therefore, rather than using a single-AES model, appropriate integration of predictions from various AES models is expected to achieve higher scoring accuracy. In this article, we propose a method that uses item response theory to integrate prediction scores from various AES models while taking into account differences in the characteristics of scoring behavior among models. It is found that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy than that of individual AES models and conventional score-integration methods. Furthermore, the proposed method facilitates interpreting each AES model&#39;s scoring characteristics and score-integration mechanism.},

Specifically, we aim to identify the pedagogical possibilities and technical considerations of using MAS in designing robot-based activities. We have designed three educational robotics experiences based on the MAS approach. The first experience describes the use of the MAS approach in creating a learning activity based on multirobots systems (MRS). The second experience describes the use of the MAS approach for implementing theater-based activities with MRS. Finally, the third experience outlines the implementation of an artificial cognitive architecture based on MAS to control the educational actions of an anthropomorphic social robot. The results reveal that MAS and MRS offer opportunities to design distributed learning environments with distributed artificial intelligence.},

  abstract     = {Online Judge (OJ) systems are typically considered within programming-related courses as they yield fast and objective assessments of the code developed by the students. Such an evaluation generally provides a single decision based on a rubric, most commonly whether the submission successfully accomplished the assignment. Nevertheless, since in an educational context such information may be deemed insufficient, it would be beneficial for both the student and the instructor to receive additional feedback about the overall development of the task. This work aims to tackle this limitation by considering the further exploitation of the information gathered by the OJ and automatically inferring feedback for both the student and the instructor. More precisely, we consider the use of learning-based schemes—particularly, multi-instance learning (MIL) and classical machine learning formulations—to model student behavior. Besides, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is contemplated to provide human-understandable feedback. The proposal has been evaluated considering a case of study comprising 2500 submissions from roughly 90 different students from a programming-related course in a computer science degree. The results obtained validate the proposal: The model is capable of significantly predicting the user outcome (either passing or failing the assignment) solely based on the behavioral pattern inferred by the submissions provided to the OJ. Moreover, the proposal is able to identify prone-to-fail student groups and profiles as well as other relevant information, which eventually serves as feedback to both the student and the instructor.},

This study inspects the implicit quality of teaching artifacts to examine teachers&#39; technology adoption throughout the evolution process of teaching artifacts. We demonstrate how patterns within the artificial synthesis of digital tools and teaching practice can be identified by examining the technology-specified quality of digital artifacts shaped by teachers of a primary school in Shanghai. To address the potential challenges of artifact analysis, we conduct a set of semiautomatic processes to manage the quality properties of teaching artifacts and measure quality indicators by training a series of automatic annotations. The artifact quality changes over nine semesters demonstrated that teachers increase technology flexibility, content variety, instruction diversity, and richness of artifacts as their technological understanding gradually improves. Other than the mainstream technology adoption research, this study revealed details regarding technology adoption: the introduction of new technology in schools should involve the enhancement of the technological understanding of teachers, the encouragement of teachers to adapt each component of their teaching practice to technological contexts, and the quality and use frequency of artifacts. Moreover, the proposed inspection of artifact quality can reflect the teacher&#39;s adoption process in an unconstrained environment. The artifact analytic approaches we created can contribute to the technology adoption from a more objective perspective.},

  abstract     = {In peer assessment, students assess a task done by their peers, provide feedback and usually a grade. The extent to which these peer grades can be used to formally grade the task is unclear, with doubts often arising regarding their validity. The instructor could supervise the peer assessments, but would not then benefit from workload reduction, one of the most appealing features of peer assessment for instructors. Our proposal uses a probabilistic model to estimate a grade for each test, accounting for the degree of precision and bias of grading peers. The grade that the instructor would assign to a test can help enhance the model. Our main hypothesis is that guiding the instructor through supervision of a peer-assessed task by pointing out to them which test to evaluate next can lead to improvement in the validity of the model-estimated grades at an early stage. Moreover, the instructor can decide how many tests to grade based on their own criteria of tolerable uncertainty, as measured by the model. We validate the method using both synthetically generated data and real data collected in an actual class. Models that link the roles of the student as grading peer and as test-taker appear to better exploit available information, although simpler models are more appropriate in specific conditions. The best performing technique for guiding the instructor is that which selects the test with the highest expected entropy reduction. In general, empirical results are in line with the hypothesis of this study.},

  abstract     = {For predicting and improving the quality of essays, text analytic metrics (surface, syntactic, morphological, and semantic features) can be used to provide formative feedback to the students in higher education. In this study, the goal was to identify a sufficient number of features that exhibit a fair proxy of the scores given by the human raters via a data-driven approach. Using an existing corpus and a text analysis tool for the Dutch language, a large number of features were extracted. Artificial neural networks, Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm, and backward elimination were used to reduce the number of features automatically. Irrelevant features were eliminated based on the inter-rater agreement between predicted and human scores calculated using Cohen&#39;s kappa ( $\kappa$ ). The number of features in this study was reduced from 457 to 28 and grouped into different categories. The results reported in this article are an improvement over a similar previous study. First, the inter-rater reliability between the predicted scores and human raters was increased by tweaking the corpus for overfitting for average scores. The resulting maximum value of $\kappa$ showed substantial agreement compared to moderate inter-rater reliability in the prior study. Second, instead of using a dedicated training and test set, the training and testing phases in the new experiments were performed using $k$ -fold cross validation on the corpus of texts. The approach presented in this research article is the first step toward our ultimate goal of providing meaningful formative feedback to the students for enhancing their writing skills and capabilities.},

However, despite the growing popularity of VR implementations in education, it remains unclear to what extent industrial design (ID) students and instructors will adopt this technology. Hence, this article discusses the limited adoption of VR technology in ID education based on the analysis of qualitative data obtained from ID students and instructors, specifically their perspectives on integrating VR into the education process. The dataset comprises written and verbal expressions obtained through an online form and a group discussion session. The findings obtained from the analysis conducted through the content analysis approach suggest that both ID students and instructors harbor concerns regarding the incorporation of VR technology in ID education. These reservations primarily revolve around the potential adverse impacts of VR usage on students’ skill development in terms of manual dexterity and material knowledge, as well as the effectiveness of its implementation within the context of ID education.},

To improve reliability, this study proposes a consensus-reaching measure that reduces the impact of inconsistent evaluations (harsh or overvalued) through minimizing iteratively the sum of weighted incoherencies. Furthermore, it improves validity by computing the similarity of each assessment to the professor&#39;s evaluation. Moreover, it is easier for students to assess with linguistic grades “Good,” “Fair,” etc., than with classical numbers, hence fuzzy logic is used to encompass the inherent uncertainty of students’ assessments. This pilot study included 23 students in the 4th year project management course where learners assessed their peers&#39; oral presentations. Results suggest that the used measures permit achieving high reliability even with students from different cultures.},

The concept was first mentioned in 1992s Neal Stephenson novel “ Snow Crash ” [4], and it follows the web and mobile Internet revolutions, allowing users to experience virtual environments in an immersive and hyperspatiotemporal manner [1]. Thus, it represents a paradigm shift in digital interaction, enabling real-time, multidimensional experiences that transcend the boundaries of physical space with the promise of bringing new levels of social connection and collaboration. The metaverse exists within the Internet, but not in the traditional way of seeing the world through a screen [1]. Instead, the metaverse aims to provide immersive experiences based on the convergence of spatial computing technologies that enable multisensory user interactions [e.g., virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR)] [2], [3] combined with 3-D data and artificial intelligence. The metaverse is also related to the concept of digital twins (DTs), which are digital replicas of elements in the real world (e.g., assets and processes) that mirror and synchronize in real time with their source, creating a bidirectional connection between them. While DTs focus more on the bidirectional connection between real and virtual and the accuracy of the representation toward better decision-making, the metaverse looks at sociotechnical challenges of seamless embodied communication between users and the dynamic interactions with the virtual spaces.},

This study employs a structural approach encompassing data collection, data preprocessing, model training, testing, and evaluation. In detail, the system can then customize the knowledge maps and recommend videos according to the knowledge nodes. Students consequently dedicate additional time to studying concepts with which they are unfamiliar and adjust their learning efforts accordingly. After teachers and teaching assistants have captured students&#39; performance metrics and idiosyncratic weaknesses through knowledge maps, teachers can modify the teaching materials. Through the use of education data mining and learning analytics, our system can benefit both teachers and online learners. We hope that the proposed system provides a more personalized and intelligent online learning environment within which students can learn in a more efficient and flexible manner.},

  abstract     = {Students&#39; and instructors&#39; adoption of “e-learning management systems (e-LMSs)” is critical to their success in a “virtual learning environment.” Students can use “e-learning” to obtain instructional materials to supplement “traditional classroom” instruction. This study intends to highlight the important factors of e-learning adoption in higher education institutes. The aim is to determine the factors forming positive intention toward using e-LMS based on “individual characteristics” (“instructor quality,” “course quality,” “learning value,” “social influence,” “facilitating condition,” “system quality,” “perceived usefulness,” and “perceived ease of use”). The questionnaire-based survey based on 369 responses is from LMS users. The proposed research model was tested using structural equation modeling. Initially, postadoption behavior was required to be investigated. The original measurement model contained eight independent constructs. A modified measurement model was created after the initial model was enhanced using exploratory factor and principal component analysis. The results of this study will help practitioners and policymakers in the effective development and implementation of e-LMSs in higher education institutions (HEIs), especially in developing countries, such as India. From the theoretical point of view, the result of this study will further enrich the IT adoption literature.},

  abstract     = {In the context of virtual learning communities (VLCs), where the participants may not know each other, it is necessary to have a mechanism to help when deciding who to work with and what reliable contents and information sources are. This study aims to design a generic trust model, named T-VLC, applicable to VLCs, which can be adapted to different learning scenarios. T-VLC is composed of eight factors—direct experience, reputation, role, knowledge, security, quality, institutional trust, and closeness, which, with their corresponding weights, will estimate the trust among the members of the community. T-VLC is a generic model that can be adapted to a particular educational context by adjusting the weights associated with each factor. In addition, this article presents the implementation of the model in the modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment (Moodle) learning environment systems and describes the experimentation and results obtained in four real educational contexts.},

  abstract     = {The global outbreak of the new coronavirus epidemic has promoted the development of intelligent education and the utilization of online learning systems. In order to provide students with intelligent services, such as cognitive diagnosis and personalized exercises recommendation, a fundamental task is the concept tagging for exercises, which extracts knowledge index structures and knowledge representations for exercises. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, existing tagging approaches based on exercise content either ignore multiple components of exercises or ignore that exercises may contain multiple concepts. To this end, in this article, we present a study of concept tagging. First, we propose an improved pretrained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) for concept tagging with both questions and solutions (QSCT). Specifically, we design a question–solution prediction task and apply the BERT encoder to combine questions and solutions, ultimately obtaining the final exercise representation through feature augmentation. Then, to further explore the relationship between questions and solutions, we extend the QSCT to a pseudo-siamese BERT for concept tagging with both questions and solutions. We optimize the feature fusion strategy, which integrates five different vector features from local and global into the final exercise representation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, which clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed models for concept tagging.},

This study explored the learning effect of smart glasses integration into the English language dinosaur exhibition at the Museum of Natural Science and investigated their impact on motivation. The experimental group used smart glasses learning strategy to facilitate their learning experience, whereas the control group used a tablet learning strategy. The research results show that: 1) Learning effectiveness and motivation were significantly superior when using smart glasses learning strategy, as compared to using a tablet learning strategy when learning through the English language situated exploration game. 2) The interaction between different learning strategies and learning styles had a significant impact on learning effectiveness. In the smart glasses learning strategy group and the tablet learning strategy group, the learning effectiveness of the kinesthetic students was significantly higher than those of the auditory students. The learning effectiveness of the visual students using the tablet learning strategy was higher than auditory students. 3) The interaction between different learning strategies and learning styles had no significant effect on learning motivation.

  abstract     = {Formative assessment provides teachers with feedback to help them adapt their behavior. To manage the increasing number of students in higher education, technology-enhanced formative assessment tools can be used to maintain and hopefully improve teaching and learning quality, thanks to the high amount of data that are generated by their usage. Based on literature and on authentic usages of the formative assessment system called Elaastic, we use learning analytics to provide evidence-based knowledge about formative assessment practices. An Elaastic sequence consists in asking learners to answer a choice question with a vote, a confidence degree, and a rationale, then to confront their viewpoints through a peer grading activity, and finally to answer the same question a second time. Benefits of such sequences are measured through the increase of correct answers between the two votes. Our results suggest that: 1) benefits of sequences increase when close to 50% of learners&#39; first votes are correct; 2) benefits of sequences increase when peers provide better grades to rationales related to correct answers than others; 3) benefits of sequences do not significantly increase when learners who provided correct answers are more confident than learners who did not; 4) grades attributed by peers depend on such peer&#39;s confidence degree; 5) self-grading is inaccurate in a peer grading context; and 6) the number of evaluations each learner performs makes no significant difference in terms of sequence benefits. These results lead to recommendations regarding formative assessment and to a new data-informed formative assessment process, which is discussed at the end of this article.},

  abstract     = {Generic competence (GC) development is an integral part of higher education to provide holistic education and enhance student career development. It also plays a critical role in complementing the curriculum. Many tertiary institutions provide various GC development activities (GCDA). Moreover, institutions strongly need to further understand student participation, especially its relationship to student backgrounds, activity profiles, and academic results. With the fast advancement of educational technologies and data mining, data analytics (DA) in formal learning and online education has been widely explored. However, there has been little work on student behavior in GCDA. To fill this gap and to provide new contributions, we conduct a comprehensive study to investigate the interrelationship of GCDA participation and academic performance before and after higher education with significant and representative data (over 10 000 records) across three years. Hypotheses are formulated and validated, and the findings are triangulated with machine learning (ML) and DA. With supervised learning, the predictors of academic performance and GCDA participation are formulated, and the features to enhance predictions are analyzed. We develop predictors using novel approaches of genetic algorithms and Stacking in ML. The impacts of the breadth and depth of involvement are also studied. Results indicate that involvement in GCDA positively impacts student academic results. Our novel approaches give improvements in predicting student participation. Our holistic studies covering hypothesis validation, data analysis, and ML provide valuable insights into GCDA development.},

  abstract     = {Swing movements and muscle strength are essential for mastering badminton techniques. Traditionally, students learn badminton through their instructor&#39;s physical demonstration, verbal instructions, and small group activities. To enhance students&#39; learning experience and assist badminton instructors more effectively, this study proposes an alternative teaching approach that utilizes a Badminton Teaching-Assisted System (BTAS) to teach swing movements. The system uses a gesture control armband to collect electromyography and gyroscope signals from professional players, which are then used to build a machine learning model based on the back propagation neural network. The model can be used as a scoring tool to assess the correctness of the student&#39;s swing movements and muscle strength. A total of 87 students participated in an eleven-week experiment focusing on two fundamental badminton skills: The backhand push and backhand lift. The results demonstrated a significant improvement in the correctness of the muscle strength during swing movements for the experimental group, compared to the control group. The BTAS can help to enhance the effectiveness of badminton instruction, thereby improving students&#39; swing techniques. Future research could expand upon this study to develop more precise artificial intelligence-based sports assistance systems, which would facilitate personalized teaching and learning in physical education.},

Interactions with customized exergames, with both high and low cognitive loads, provided increased improvements in the forward limit of stability and improved dynamic weight shifts after the intervention compared with traditional exercises. No differences in the effects were observed between exergames with different cognitive loads. Exergames were more effective than traditional exercises for improving the dynamic aspects of postural control and stability in adolescents.

Background: Immersive technologies for education have been used for some years. Despite this, there are few works that aim to support the development and use of virtual environments for immersive learning. Research questions: This systematic review has the following main research question: What is the state of the art of immersive learning frameworks? In order to answer this question, secondary research questions were defined: 1) What definitions of immersive learning were adopted in primary studies? 2) What are the types of frameworks and how do they support immersive learning? 3) What are the elements that compose the frameworks? 4) What are the methods used to validate the frameworks? Methodology: As per the systematic review guidelines, this study followed a rigorous and replicable process for collecting and analyzing data. From 1721 articles identified in the search engines, 15 were selected after the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Findings: Most frameworks are models that investigate the causal relationship between immersive learning factors that influence learning outcomes. Although this theoretical aspect is important for the advancement of research, the area still lacks more practical frameworks that address more technical details and support development, as well as the use of immersive virtual environments by teachers and instructors.},

This agent has been seamlessly integrated into the ITS to replace the previously available button-based user interface and allow the user to interact with HBPS in natural language. Once appropriately trained, the conversational agent was capable of identifying the intention of a given user utterance and extracting the relevant entities related to the message content, with average weighted F1-scores of 0.965 and 0.989 for intents and entities, respectively. Methodological guidelines are provided to generate a realistic training set that enables the creation of the required natural language understanding model and also evaluate the resulting system.

To discover its full potential, we employ gamification based on self-determination theory and nine heuristics suggested by Roy and Zaman (2017). Students earn more game points by submitting unique programs early, reading the generated reports, and collecting badges. Those with the highest game points are rewarded at the end of the course. According to our evaluation, involving 240 computing undergraduates in three quasi-experiments over three academic semesters, students with gamification become slightly more aware of programming plagiarism and collusion, complete assessments earlier, and read generated reports more frequently.

  abstract     = {The evaluation of student projects is a difficult task, especially when they involve both a technical and a creative component. We propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-based methodology to help in the evaluation of complex projects in engineering and computer science courses. This methodology is intended to evaluate the assessment process itself allowing to analyze the influence of each variable in the final grade, to discover possible biases, inconsistencies and discrepancies, and to generate appropriate rubrics that help to avoid them. As an example of its application, we consider the evaluation of the projects submitted in an undergraduate introductory course on computer science. Using data collected from the evaluation during five academic years, we follow the proposed methodology to create AI models and analyze the main variables which are involved in the assessment of the projects. The proposed methodology can be applied to other courses and degrees, where both technical and creative components are considered to evaluate the projects.},

  abstract     = {To provide intelligent learning guidance for students in e-learning systems, it is necessary to accurately predict their performance in future exams by analyzing score data in past exams. However, existing research has not addressed the uncertain and dynamic features of students&#39; cognitive status, whereas these features are essential for improving the accuracy of performance prediction. A novel approach via neutrosophic cognitive diagnosis is proposed to predict student performance in a personalized e-learning environment. This approach innovatively employs the neutrosophic set (NS) theory to comprehensively measure the students&#39; cognitive status on knowledge concepts from three features, i.e., understanding level, degree of misunderstanding, and uncertainty. A new measurement method of NS similarity is used to identify top- k neighboring students for one student. Then, we predict a student&#39;s performance on exercises in future exams by integrating a neighborhood-based collaborative filtering algorithm with a probabilistic matrix factorization method to address the data sparsity problem. Finally, the experiments based on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach provides higher prediction accuracy than the existing ones with a low execution cost.},

  abstract     = {In traditional English as a foreign language (EFL) speaking classes, students have insufficient time and opportunities to practice (Zhan et al., 2015). In addition, they lack cultural and communicative contexts (Ko et al., 2021) to improve their speaking skills. Furthermore, a large number of students, especially in Asian countries, have low self-efficacy with regard to their English-speaking competence and try to avoid any activities that require speaking in public (Sun et al., 2017). In this study, we designed social language learning (SLL) activities to bridge the above-mentioned gaps and developed a mobile-assisted SLL system to support students’ participation in SLL activities. We explored how our SLL activities affect language learners’ speaking performance and self-efficacy and investigated their SLL networks and perceived acceptance of the mobile-assisted SLL system. A total of 58 graduate students were recruited for the study and randomly divided into two groups: a control group in which students completed assigned tasks using the traditional method and an experimental group in which students completed assigned tasks using the mobile SLL system. Our results showed that while the speaking skills of students in the two groups improved after the study, the learning gains of the experimental students in EFL fluency, lexis, pronunciation, and content were significantly better than those of the control students. The experimental students significantly outperformed their counterparts on the dimension of culturality, authenticity, and abundance of created verbal content. The self-efficacy of the experimental students was much better than that of the control students. The results also showed that the interaction degree of the experimental students improved, and they positively perceived applications of the mobile-assisted SLL system to EFL learning. Based on the results, several suggestions and precautions were proposed for educators and researchers in the field to consider.},

  abstract     = {Procrastination, the irrational delay of tasks, is a common occurrence in online learning. Potential negative consequences include a higher risk of drop-outs, increased stress, and reduced mood. Due to the rise of learning management systems (LMS) and learning analytics (LA), indicators of such behavior can be detected, enabling predictions of future procrastination and other dilatory behavior. However, research focusing on such predictions is scarce. Moreover, studies involving different types of predictors and comparisons between the predictive performance of various methods are virtually nonexistent. In this article, we aim to fill these research gaps by analyzing the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms when predicting the delayed or timely submission of online assignments in a higher education setting with two categories of predictors: 1) subjective, questionnaire-based variables and 2) objective, log-data-based indicators extracted from a learning management system. The results show that models with objective predictors consistently outperform models with subjective predictors, and a combination of both variable types performs slightly better with an accuracy of 70%. For each of these three options, a different approach prevailed (gradient boosting machines for the subjective, Bayesian multilevel models for the objective, and Random Forest for the combined predictors). We conclude that careful attention should be paid to the selection of predictors and algorithms before implementing such models in learning management systems.},

This article presents an authoring tool (named EDIT) and analyzes its acceptance by educators for creating educational activities. The novelty of the tool lies in the possibility of creating projects with a schedule of educational activities, sequenced as required for a group of students. In addition, it has specific characteristics for the educational scenario, such as the personalization of feedback and the meta-annotation of projects. Sessions were held with educators ( n = 38) to analyze variables related to the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use) when creating TI educational activities on tabletops using the EDIT tool. The sessions were observed and recorded on video, and a Focus Group was held afterward. During the sessions, educators gave a positive assessment in relation to using this type of tool. It was observed that, in general, they find TI valuable mostly for working with children. Finally, the results showed a high acceptance obtained from the TAM and the novel features of EDIT were found to be useful.},

To this end, large-scale digital learning presents new opportunities to address the need for inclusive education. A unique challenge for students with dyslexia in Hong Kong is learning Chinese characters. In this article, we investigate whether students with dyslexia can learn the writing of Chinese characters independently in an informal learning environment. For that purpose, we developed a mobile application for learning to write Chinese characters with three different writing conditions. First, students learn new Chinese characters in Condition 1: Grid+Contour+Instruction . Then, students strengthen their memory of the learned Chinese characters in Condition 2: Grid+Contour . Finally, students retrieve the memory of the learned Chinese characters in Condition 3: Grid Only . Students with dyslexia demonstrated a significant improvement after practicing with the three-condition design. For example, they wrote much slower than students without dyslexia before the study but caught up over time. This study contributes an approach to facilitate the self-paced learning of students with dyslexia at scale.},

To advance research in this area, we systematically identified key design elements that have shown promise in leading to positive learning results. We then conducted an experiment in which we varied gamification intensity in web-based virtual training environments for a procedural industrial task. In total, 355 participants were divided into a baseline group without gamification, a basic, and an advanced gamification group. Analysis of participants’ learning included learning outcomes (time-to-completion and number of mistakes), affective learning factors (motivation, self-efficacy, and satisfaction), learning system usability, and perceived cognitive load throughout the learning process. The results did not show any statistically significant differences between the lower and higher levels of gamification intensity.

  abstract     = {A text semantic classification is an essential approach to recognizing the verbal intention of online learners, empowering reliable understanding, and inquiry for the regulations of knowledge construction amongst students. However, online learning is increasingly switching from static watching patterns to the collaborative discussion. The current deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural network, are ineffective in classifying verbal content contextually. Moreover, the contribution of verbal elements to semantics is often considerably varied, requiring the attachment of weights to these elements to increase verbal recognition precision. The bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) is considered to be an adaptive model to investigate semantic relations according to the context. Moreover, the attention mechanism in deep learning simulating human vision could assign weights to target texts effectively. This study proposed to construct a deep learning model combining Bi-LSTM and attention mechanism, in which Bi-LSTM obtained the verbal features and keywords, and the generated keywords were weighed in accordance with the attention mechanism. A total of 12 000 sentences generated in online collaborative discussion activities have been classified into six categories, namely, statement, negotiation, question, management, emotion, and others. Results showed that the classification accuracy of attention-Bi-LSTM reached 81.50%, which is higher than that of the baseline Bi-LSTM model. This study theoretically uncovers the features of collaborative discussion of onliners and practically provides an effective approach to automatic behavior analysis in an online context.},

A common task has been predicting students at risk of dropping out for the necessary interventions to be made. However, issues of discrimination by these predictive models based on protected attributes of students have recently been raised. An important question that is constantly asked is: should the protected attributes be excluded from the learning analytics (LA) models in order to ensure fairness? In this article, we aimed at answering questions that if we exclude the protected attributes from the LA models, does the exclusion ensure fairness as it supposedly should? Does the exclusion affect the performance of the LA model? If so, why? We found answers to these questions and went further to explain why. We built machine learning models and performed empirical evaluations using a three-year dropout data for a particular program in a large Australian university. We found that excluding or including the protected attributes had marginal effect on predictive performance and fairness. Perhaps not surprisingly, our findings suggest that the effect of including or excluding protected attributes is a function of how they relate with the prediction outcome. More specifically, if a protected attribute is correlated with the target label and proves to be an important feature, then their inclusion or exclusion would have effect on the performance and fairness and vice versa. Our findings provide insightful information that can be used by relevant stakeholders to make well-informed decisions.},

  abstract     = {In a massive open online courses (MOOCs) learning environment, it is essential to understand students&#39; social knowledge constructs and critical thinking for instructors to design intervention strategies. The development of social knowledge constructs and critical thinking can be represented by cognitive presence, which is a primary component of the community of inquiry model. However, identifying learners’ cognitive presence is a challenging problem, and most researchers have performed this task using traditional machine learning methods that require both manual feature construction and adequate labeled data. In this article, we present a novel variant of the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model for cognitive presence identification, namely MOOC-BERT, which is pretrained on large-scale unlabeled discussion data collected from various MOOCs involving different disciplines. MOOC-BERT learned deep representations of unlabeled data and adopted Chinese characters as inputs without any feature engineering. The experimental results showed that MOOC-BERT outperformed the representative machine learning algorithms and deep learning models in the performance of identification and cross-course generalization. Then, MOOC-BERT was adopted to identify the unlabeled posts of the two courses. The empirical analysis results revealed the evolution and differences in MOOC learners’ cognitive presence levels. These findings provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of pretraining on large-scale and multidiscipline discussion data in facilitating accurate cognitive presence identification, demonstrating the practical value of MOOC-BERT in learning analytics.},

  abstract     = {The prevalence of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has brought about profound changes in the field of reading, resulting in a large and rapidly growing number of young digital readers. The article intends to identify key contextual factors that synergistically differentiate high and low performers, high and average performers, and low and average performers in digital reading, through the utilization of machine-learning methods, namely, support vector machine (SVM) and SVM recursive feature elimination. In addition, the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method was applied to augment the machine-learning models and detect the features impact on the final output. The latest-released Programme for International Student Assessment reading data were analyzed, and the samples included 276 269 15-year-old students from 38 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. The results show that an optimal feature set of contextual factors at the school, classroom, and student levels in the high–low model, high–average model, and low–average model boast high accuracy. Compared with average-performing students, high-performing students spend more time reading emails and are associated with high-quality teaching that incorporates digital literacy, and low-performing students are characterized by a lack of interest in ICT use and are more susceptible to the abuse of ICT resources, classroom disorder, and discrimination at school. The use of machine-learning algorithms for pairwise comparisons provides new perspectives for personalized digital reading education, and the evaluation of the effect of every factor using SHAP method offers a clear view for educational researchers. This article sheds light on factors that may contribute to the development of students’ digital reading literacy and the practice of adopting an individualized approach to digital reading pedagogy for educators and instructors.},

  abstract     = {Technology has become an essential part of our everyday life, and its use in educational environments keeps growing. In addition, games are one of the most popular activities across cultures and ages, and there is ample evidence that supports the benefits of using games for assessment. This field is commonly known as game-based assessment (GBA), which refers to the use of games to assess learners&#39; competencies, skills, or knowledge. In this article, we analyze the current status of the GBA field by performing the first systematic literature review on empirical GBA studies. It is based on 65 research papers that used digital GBAs to determine: the context where the study has been applied, the primary purpose, the domain of the game used, game/tool availability, the size of the data sample, the computational methods and algorithms applied, the targeted stakeholders of the study, and what limitations and challenges are reported by authors. Based on the categories established and our analysis, the findings suggest that GBAs are mainly used in K-16 education and for assessment purposes, and that most GBAs focus on assessing STEM content, and cognitive and soft skills. Furthermore, the current limitations indicate that future GBA research would benefit from the use of bigger data samples and more specialized algorithms. Based on our results, we discuss current trends in the field and open challenges (including replication and validation problems), providing recommendations for the future research agenda of the GBA field.},

The early identification of such potential at-risk learners is the key to intervening and trying to help them before they decide to drop out. This article focuses on this challenging problem by providing a predictive dropout model with distinctive characteristics from previous approaches. First, the identification is in real time by providing a daily dropout prediction. Second, a temporal window of variable size is defined to evaluate the likelihood of being a dropout learner at the activity level. Such contributions will serve as a basis for designing and applying intervention mechanisms to reverse the course dropout at-risk situation. The predictive model and the temporal window have been evaluated on data from an authentic online learning setting in two first-year undergraduate courses. We show the accuracy of correctly identifying at-risk learners within activities and the model performance to detect actual course dropout learners.},

A lack of theoretical and empirical research devoted to understanding coding education acceptance provided the motivation for this article. As a way to engage in the debate, this article investigated kindergarten teachers’ acceptance of coding education by drawing on the theory of planned behavior framework, with self-efficacy, pedagogical beliefs, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, student readiness, teacher readiness, and parent readiness serving as external factors. The data were obtained from 236 in-service and preservice teachers in South Korea. Partial least square was employed to evaluate the research hypotheses. We find that self-efficacy and pedagogical beliefs exert a positive effect on perceived behavioral control. Perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are pertinent for forming positive attitudes. Teacher readiness and parent readiness matter for generating positive subjective norm. Perceived behavioral control, attitude, and subjective norm all have a positive effect on behavioral intentions. The positive indirect effect of perceived usefulness on behavioral intentions through attitude is also noteworthy. In this article, we provide exploratory results as to how teachers believe and perceive coding in early childhood education. Practical insights are provided based on these initial findings.},

  abstract     = {Programming online judges (POJs) have been increasingly used in CS1 classes, as they allow students to practice and get quick feedback. For instructors, it is a useful tool for creating assignments and exams. However, selecting problems in POJs is time consuming. First, problems are generally not organized based on topics covered in the CS1 syllabus. Second, assessing whether problems require similar effort to be completed and map onto the same topic is a subjective and expert-dependent task. The difficulty increases if the instructor must create variations of these assessments, e.g., to avoid plagiarism. Thus, here, we research how to support CS1 instructors in the task of selecting problems, to compose one-size-fits-all or personalized assignments/exams. Our solution is to propose a novel intelligent recommender system, based on a fine-grained data-driven analysis of the students&#39; effort on solving problems in the integrated development environment of a POJ system, and automatic detection of topics for CS1 problems, based on problem descriptions. Data collected from 2714 students are processed to support, via our artificial intelligence (AI) method recommendations, the instructors&#39; decision-making process. We evaluated our method against the state of the art in a simple blind experiment with CS1 instructors ( $N =$ 35). Results show that our recommendations are 88% accurate, surpassing our baseline ( $p&amp;lt;$ 0.05). Finally, our work paves the way for novel POJ smart learning environments, wherein instructors define learning tasks (assignments/exams) supported by AI.},

To enable such adaptiveness, we propose, develop, and deploy a new tutor model and a training format. We evaluate the learning environment using two different adaptive trainings attended by 114 students of various proficiency. The results show that students were assigned tasks with a more appropriate difficulty, which enabled them to successfully complete the training. Students reported that they enjoyed the training, felt the training difficulty was appropriately designed, and would attend more training sessions like these. Instructors can use the environment for teaching any topic involving real-world computer networks and systems because it is not tailored to particular training.

They can collect various data related to student behavior and support pedagogical interventions. This research used feature engineering and nearest neighbor smoothing models to predict the performance of students. Five learning behavior features were selected based on Spearman&#39;s rank correlation coefficients with students’ final grades. Through testing with data from the fall semester of 2020, the model attained the highest ROC-AUC value of 0.9390. Based on these models, the researchers conducted an engagement intervention that displayed learning behavior dashboards to students in the fall of 2021. During the intervention, the course platform updated the dashboards and notified students weekly. This intervention was further investigated through a randomized controlled trial. The experimental results suggested that the intervention could improve students’ learning behavior in terms of total study time, tutorial reading, and video viewing. In addition, this study used a modified dynamic key-value memory network model to depict a student&#39;s knowledge state and to calculate the probability of solving an exercise by mining numerous exercise records. Based on the predicted probability, instructors could recommend personalized exercises for each student. In the fall of 2021, the researchers also conducted a randomized controlled trial on this intervention, demonstrating that this personalized exercise recommendation could increase students’ concept mastery. Experiments revealed that the proposed models and interventions had a positive effect on students’ learning of course content.},

However, in large programming classrooms, it is hard for instructors to provide such real-time support for every student. Researchers have, therefore, put tremendous effort into developing algorithms to generate automated data-driven hints to help students at scale. Despite this, few controlled studies have directly evaluated the impact of such hints on students&#39; performance and learning. It is also unclear what specific design features make hints more or less effective. In this article, we present iSnap, a block-based programming environment that provides novices with data-driven next-step hints in real time. This article describes our improvements to iSnap over four years, including its “enhanced” next-step hints with three design features: textual explanations, self-explanation prompts, and an adaptive hint display. Moreover, we conducted a controlled study in an authentic classroom setting over several weeks to evaluate the impact of iSnap&#39;s enhanced hints on students&#39; performance and learning. We found students who received the enhanced hints perform better on in-class assignments and have higher programming efficiency in homework assignments than those who did not receive hints, but that hints did not significantly impact students&#39; learning. We also discuss the challenges of classroom studies and the implications of enhanced hints compared to prior evaluations in laboratory settings, which is essential to validate the efficacy of next-step hints&#39; impact in a real classroom experience.},

The evaluation of users&#39; experience indicates that the CollabGraph is useful, highly likeable, and could benefit users&#39; participation and teacher&#39;s feedback by providing more precise insights into the project status. Our approach helps users better perceive about everyone&#39;s work, and it is a highly preferable feature alongside the list view.

  abstract     = {This report describes a randomized controlled study that compared the personalization of educational content based on neural networks to personalization by human experts. The study was conducted in a graphically rich online learning environment for elementary school mathematics, in which N = 135 fourth- and sixth-grade students learn via mathematical applets. The performance of students who followed the algorithm&#39;s recommendations was compared with that of students who followed an a priori sequence constructed by the experts. While the algorithm only considered students&#39; performance on past problems when recommending new problems, the human experts also took into consideration other factors related both to content and to the graphical interface. The findings reveal no significant differences in performance between the two groups, suggesting that the algorithm was as successful in preparing the students as human teachers. Herein, we discuss the different mechanisms used to prepare each of the groups for the learning tasks and highlight the importance of the user interface in that process. Specifically, we find that applets involving supportive interactions, in which students&#39; interactions were intended to help solve the problem but were optional, represented students&#39; preknowledge, while applets entailing required interactions did not. We contribute to the field of personalization in education with new evidence of the advantages of a content sequencing algorithm—based on collaborative filtering ranking and implemented via a neural network—in a graphically rich environment as tested in authentic classrooms.},

  abstract     = {Peer grading has diverse applications in many fields, including the peer grading of open assignments in online courses. The major challenge in peer grading is improving the seriousness (reviewing carefully) of reviewers. Previous studies have proposed several incentive reward mechanisms intended to reward or punish reviewers. Although these mechanisms are effective in massive open online courses environments with a large number of students, they are not suitable for small private online courses (SPOCs) environments with a small number of students. This article analyzes the characteristics of reviewers in a small private online course environment and designs an incentive and reward mechanism based on a hybrid human–machine peer grading framework, including an autograder (reviewed by the machine). The main component of the proposed mechanism is the autograder whose function is to evaluate the reviewers’ reports (reviewers refer to students) and provide feedback information on reports to reviewers. The framework can incentivize reviewers to review carefully and give their reports truthfully when the reports between reviewers’ and the autograder’ are consistent. The proposed framework is verified experimentally. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid human–machine peer grading framework can effectively incentivize reviewers to review submissions carefully and improve the overall effect of peer grading.},

  abstract     = {In online courses, discussion forums play a key role in enhancing student interaction with peers and instructors. Due to large enrolment sizes, instructors often struggle to respond to students in a timely manner. To address this problem, both traditional machine learning (ML) (e.g., Random Forest) and deep learning (DL) approaches have been applied to classify educational forum posts (e.g., those that required urgent responses versus those that did not). However, there lacks an in-depth comparison between these two kinds of approaches. To better guide people to select an appropriate model, we aimed at providing a comparative study on the effectiveness of six frequently-used traditional ML and DL models across a total of seven different classification tasks centering around two datasets of educational forum posts. Through extensive evaluation, we showed that 1) the up-to-date DL approaches did not necessarily outperform traditional ML approaches; 2) the performance gap between the two kinds of approaches can be up to 3.68% (measured in F1 score); 3) the traditional ML approaches should be equipped with carefully-designed features, especially those of common importance across different classification tasks. Based on the derived findings, we further provided insights to help instructors and educators construct effective classifiers for characterizing educational forum discussions, which, ultimately, would enable them to provide students with timely and personalized learning support.},

  abstract     = {For offering adaptive learning to learners in intelligent tutoring systems, one of the fundamental tasks is knowledge tracing (KT), which aims to assess learners&#39; learning states and make prediction for future performance. However, there are two crucial issues in deep learning-based KT models. First, the knowledge concepts are used to predict learners&#39; performance instead of exercises. This choice ignores the actual difference among exercises, which leads to the KT model&#39;s inability to explore the rich information at the exercise level, thus, weakening the KT model&#39;s performance. Second, the actual difference in prior knowledge is neglected. Therefore, in-depth research of these two types of the actual differences offers the possibility to improve the prediction performance of KT further. To this end, we propose a fine-grained knowledge tracing model (FGKT) 1 to capture these two types of actual differences. We first obtain the exercise representations by considering the corresponding knowledge concepts and actual difference among exercises. Then, an effective attention mechanism is designed to capture the relevance between assessment exercises and historical interactions to acquire individual prior knowledge. Finally, we evaluate the proposed FGKT model on several available benchmark datasets. The experiment results show that our model surpasses benchmark KT models by up to 7% in prediction performance on the latest ASSISTments dataset.},

  abstract     = {To provide personalized support on educational platforms, it is crucial to model the evolution of students&#39; knowledge states. Knowledge tracing is one of the most popular technologies for this purpose, and deep learning-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance. Compared to classical models, such as Bayesian knowledge tracing, which track students&#39; knowledge proficiencies, deep learning-based knowledge tracing is usually modeled to predict students&#39; performances on questions, while ignoring the interpretability of students&#39; knowledge states. However, for many practical applications, such as learning resource recommendation, it would be more helpful if we could explicitly track students&#39; abilities or knowledge proficiencies separately from performance prediction. Researchers in psychometric area already designed cognitive diagnosis solutions to quantify the knowledge states of students in static conditions (e.g., examination), where the educational priors (i.e., factors related to students&#39; learning process) were proved beneficial for student modeling. Inspired by this, we propose dynamic cognitive diagnosis , which integrates the interpretability of educational priors from cognitive diagnosis into deep learning-based knowledge tracing methods. We first discuss and provide evidence of which educational priors can be integrated, including question attributes and interaction function. Then we show the effects of using the educational priors in deep learning-based knowledge tracing from two aspects, i.e., interpretability and accuracy. Through extensive experiments and analyses, we prove that properly chosen priors can enable deep learning-based methods to evaluate students&#39; knowledge states in a manner that is consistent with domain knowledge or human experience. Moreover, educational priors also improve the accuracy of student performance prediction.},

  abstract     = {Soft skills (such as communication and collaboration) are rarely addressed in programming courses, mostly because they are difficult to teach, assess, and grade. A quantitative, modular, AI-based approach for assessing and grading students&#39; collaboration has been examined in this article. The pedagogical underpinning of the approach includes a pedagogical framework and a quantitative soft skill assessment rubric, which have been adapted and used in an extracurricular Java programming course. The objective was to identify pros and cons of using different AI methods within this approach when it comes to assessing and grading collaboration in group programming projects. More specifically, fuzzy rules and several machine learning methods (ML onward) have been examined to see which one would yield the best results regarding performance, interpretability/explainability of recommendations, and feasibility/practicality. The data used for training and testing span four academic years, and the results suggest that almost all of the examined AI methods, when used within the proposed AI-based approach, can provide adequate grading recommendations as long as teachers cover other aspects of the assessment not covered by the rubrics: code quality, plagiarism, and project completion. The fuzzy-rule-based method requires time and effort to be spent on (manual) creation and tuning of fuzzy rules and sets, whereas the examined ML methods require lesser initial investments but do need historical data for training. On the other hand, the fuzzy-rule-based method can provide the best explanations on how the assessment/grading was made—something that proved to be very important to teachers.},

The assessment method has two key components. The first component considers the scores provided by a task learning system, with progressive task lists set to guide students to finish the experiments. After each subtask, the completeness and quality are verified, and the system automatically records the corresponding score according to checking rules executed through JavaScript codes. The second part analyzes the behavior data, and student performance during the online experiments is analyzed using a fuzzy inference method. This work also presents a case study based on practical teaching at Wuhan University, where students in the courses Classical Control Theory and System Identification use the networked control system laboratory for their laboratory courses. The results show that the proposed assessment method can be applied to effectively and automatically evaluate students&#39; laboratory work.},

Moreover, the proposed model has the capacity to discover item-skill associations from the scratch without expert input based on attentive modeling.

Recently, embeddings, as semantic-rich textual representations, have been increasingly used to represent short answers and predict the grade.

Therefore, following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, this scoping review summarizes relevant literature on the use of embeddings in ASAG, and reports on the current state of the art in that research area and on the identified knowledge gaps. We searched seven research databases for the relevant journal, conference, and workshop papers published from 2016 to 2021. The inclusion criteria were based on the type of publication, its venue ranking, study focus, and evaluation methods. Upon the full-text screening, 17 articles were included in the scoping review. Among these, most of the articles used word embeddings, mainly to estimate the similarity of student and model answers using the cosine similarity measure or to initialize a neural network-based classification model. The contribution of embeddings to the performance of ASAG models compared to nonembedding features is inconclusive. Models employing embeddings were mostly evaluated on four public ASAG datasets using earlier ASAG methods as baselines. We summarize the reported evaluation results and draw conclusions on the performance of the state-of-the-art ASAG models.},

Under the proposed framework, we implement a novel social robot and deploy it in the challenging learning context, which demands the robot provide natural interactions and autonomous learning supports to adult learners. The evaluation results show that the robot significantly improves the learners&#39; intrinsic motivation, and the adult learners have also shown great interests in learning and communicating with the robot. This article sheds light on how to design interactive and autonomous social robots for adult learners and contributes a concrete solution that employs the established psychological theories as the design guidelines and the AI models as the enabling technologies.},

  abstract     = {Combining individual and collaborative learning is common, but dynamic combinations (which happen as-the-need arises, rather than in preplanned ways, and may happen on an individual basis) are rare. This work reports findings from a technology probe study exploring alternative designs for classroom co-orchestration support for dynamically transitioning between individual and collaborative learning. The study involved 1) a technology-probe classroom study in an authentic, AI-supported classroom to understand teachers&#39; and students&#39; needs for co-orchestration support over dynamic transitions; and 2) workshops and interviews with students and teachers to get informed feedback about their lived experiences. About 118 students and 3 teachers from a middle school in the US experienced a pairing policy—student, teacher, and AI-controlled pairing policy—(i.e., identifying students needing help and potential helpers) for switching from individual to a peer-tutoring activity. This work aims to answer the following questions: 1) How did students and teachers react to these pairing policies? and 2) What are students&#39; and teachers&#39; desires for sharing control over the orchestration of dynamic transitions? Findings suggest the need for a form of hybrid control between students, teachers, and AI systems over transitions, as well as for adaptivity and adaptability for different classroom characteristics, teachers, and students&#39; prior knowledge.},

  abstract     = {Image processing-based augmented reality (AR) is widely used in several fields. However, audio content is also crucial in certain cases, for example, focusing on appreciating artwork in a museum, rather than a virtually synthesized image. In this study, an attempt was made to provide ubiquitous learning (u-learning) services by using audio AR for smart cities where people do not need smartphones, tablets, or wearable devices for learning. The concept of “unmanned stores” was introduced in the proposed learning environments. A 360° camera was mounted on the ceiling of an exhibition room. An algorithm was used to detect moving objects and locate a visitor, from whose position an information-processing platform searched the showpiece nearest to the visitor and selected the corresponding audio guide. For multiple visitors, infrared (IR) sensors were used to count the visitors inside the room. A loudspeaker array was built to emit directional sounds for eliminating interference between multiple sound sources. Along with the proposed algorithm for increasing the accuracy while sensing multiple movements, the conventional sound field synthesis method was modified to improve the listening experience and learning quality. Image-based sensor technology, IR detection, and an audio signal-processing platform were integrated into a smart environment in which people can conduct u-learning without personal devices. The method can provide immersive audio tours with virtual narrators and peer-helpers in schools, museums, and art galleries. Qualitative and quantitative analyses indicated that effective hands-free and eyes-free learning was achieved.},

  abstract     = {Circuit simulation, together with practical sessions, is considered a fundamental tool to assist in the teaching of electronics. Robotics offers rich real-world applications that foster student interest in developing engineering projects. Despite the potential benefits of uniting these two realities, software tools that combine circuits and robotic systems in a single simulation platform are scarce. This article presents Ardosia, a simulation software that combines electronics and robotics in a single simulation arena. The electronic aspects of the simulation are handled by the Falstad Circuit Simulator, a software with proven success in promoting student interest and learning outcomes. Importantly, this software features significant interactive and visualization characteristics that are deemed valuable to enhance conceptual understanding. Non–electrical physics simulation is performed by a special-purpose engine, designed to simulate sensor and actuator behavior in a 2-D world. In combination, the two simulation engines yield a model where electronic circuits are embodied in the world through robot sensors and actuators interacting together and with the surroundings. Such a simulator is intended to promote the use of robotics projects in electronics education, since students will be equipped with software to conveniently design and evaluate robotic systems, through simulation, before applying their ideas in an experimental setting. This article presents an overview of Ardosia, complemented with examples of use in electronics education and a validation experiment comparing simulation with real-world data.},

  abstract     = {Previous research and experiences have indicated the potential that games have in educational settings. One of the possible uses of games in education is as game-based assessments (GBA), using game tasks to generate evidence about skills and content knowledge that can be valuable. There are different approaches in the literature to implement the assessment machinery of these GBA, all of them having strengths and drawbacks. In this article, we propose using multivariate Elo-based learner modeling, as we believe it has a strong potential in the context of GBA for three aims: first, to simultaneously measure students competence across several knowledge components in a game; second, to predict task performance; and finally, to estimate task difficulty within the game. To do so, we present our GBA Shadowspect, which is focused on solving geometry puzzles, and we depict our implementation using data collected from several high schools across the USA. We obtain high-performing results (AUC of 0.87) and demonstrate that the model enables analysis of how each student&#39;s competency evolves after each puzzle attempt. Moreover, the model provides accurate estimations of each task&#39;s difficulty, enabling iterative improvement of the game design. This study highlights the potential that multivariate Elo-based learner modeling has within the context of GBA, sharing lessons learned, and encouraging future researchers in the field to consider this algorithm to build their assessment machinery.},

Nevertheless, little is known about how technical features and technology affordances of the XR environment are used and addressed in these studies. In this article, we had reviewed 66 empirical studies regarding XR for autistic individuals and examined the corresponding research designs from 3 major dimensions, namely, autonomy (i.e., the degree of freedom users have), human–computer interaction, and the sense of presence. We then investigated the technical features and technology affordances in these studies through the lenses of these three dimensions. Fifty-four (81.82%) studies used VR as their interventional tool, eleven (16.67%) studies used AR, and only one (1.52%) study used MR. Results showed that the use of different XR platforms is closely related to the technical features, technology affordances, and study characteristics. We further provided an extraction of the essentials that serve as a practical reference for educational researchers and practitioners to inspect the design and implementation of XR technologies in learning and training environments for autistic students.},

  abstract     = {Digital outcrop models (DOMs) have facilitated quantitative and qualitative studies in digital and virtual environments of source and reservoir rock analogs important to the oil industry. The use of immersive virtual reality (iVR) to extend field experiences has motivated several research groups to develop software integrating iVR techniques with tools to interpret and derive geological information from DOMs. This virtual approach can also contribute to the development of geological and spatial thinking skills taught in the classroom and during field trips. The immersive virtual field trips (iVFTs) can provide students access to outcrops and additional data restricted to field learning activities while allowing additional interactions impossible in the field. iVFTs have been developed recently; however, the structuring of iVFTs for geology classes has not been presented in a way that inexperienced iVR users can make use of such systems. In this scenario, our work proposes a method to structure an iVFT using georeferenced data containers and the virtual reality software Mosis LAB while evaluating users&#39; perceptions during an iVFT study case. The evaluation using technology acceptance model questionnaires showed that users were positively impacted by the observational iVFT experience, effectively supporting e-learning, and class field learning activities and preparations. This approach allows field trip experiences in less accessible study sites, especially in less favorable conditions like the ones during the Coronavirus 2019 pandemic where many geoscience departments had their field trips hampered.},

  abstract     = {Engaging students in creating learning resources has demonstrated pedagogical benefits. However, to effectively utilize a repository of student-generated content (SGC), a selection process is needed to separate high- from low-quality resources as some of the resources created by students can be ineffective, inappropriate, or incorrect. A common and scalable approach is to use a peer-review process where students are asked to assess the quality of resources authored by their peers. Given that judgments of students, as experts-in-training, cannot wholly be relied upon, a redundancy-based method is widely employed where the same assessment task is given to multiple students. However, this approach introduces a new challenge, referred to as the consensus problem: How can we assign a final quality to a resource given ratings by multiple students? To address this challenge, we investigate the predictive performance of 18 inference models across five well-established categories of consensus approaches for inferring the quality of SGC at scale. The analysis is based on the engagement of 2141 undergraduate students across five courses in creating 12 803 resources and 77 297 peer reviews. Results indicate that the quality of reviews is quite diverse, and students tend to overrate. Consequently, simple statistics such as mean and median fail to identify poor-quality resources. Findings further suggest that incorporating advanced probabilistic and text analysis methods to infer the reviewers&#39; reliability and reviews&#39; quality improves performance; however, there is still an evident need for instructor oversight and training of students to write compelling and reliable reviews.},

To overcome this issue, we implemented an online learning system based on electroencephalography (EEG)-based passive brain-computer interface technology referred to as the “adaptive neuro-learning system (ANLS).” It monitors the current mental states of learners seamlessly using EEG signals. Then, it adaptively provides natural and interactive video feedback rather than simple alarms or pop quizzes following the current mental conditions of a learner. In this article, a total of 60 university students were assigned randomly to one of four groups: two experimental groups, for which either ANLS based on attention state estimation or ANLS based on both attention and comprehension states estimation was tested, and two control groups, the students in which were taught using either the conventional online lecture without feedback or an online course with randomized video feedbacks. Each member of these groups attended a 53 min open courseware video lecture. Then, the educational effects of the proposed system were evaluated quantitatively via a written examination. Our results revealed a significantly higher learning performance for the experimental group (average test score of the experimental groups = 83.83 and that of the control groups = 56.67), demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed education strategy.},

Furthermore, using TUIs leads to lower cognitive load, increases attention on key areas, and provides higher entertainment value, which has long-term effects on promoting preschool children&#39;s learning. The results of the perception questionnaire show that the TUI version is easier to use, more interesting, and more motivating for them to learn mathematics than the MTI version is. On the other hand, the interview results show that 62.5% of students prefer to use the TUI version to learn mathematics.

  abstract     = {Multiple-choice question (MCQ) plays a significant role in educational assessment. Automatic MCQ generation has been an active research area for years, and many systems have been developed for MCQ generation. Still, we could not find any system that generates accurate MCQs from school-level textbook contents that are useful in real examinations. This observation motivated us to develop a system that generates MCQs to assess the student&#39;s recall of factual information. Also, the available systems are often domain, subject, or application-specific in nature. Although the MCQ generation task demands a specific setup, we expect a level of generalization can be achieved. In this development, we also focus on this issue. We propose a pipeline for automatic generation of MCQs from textbooks of middle-school level subjects, and the pipeline is partially subject-independent. The proposed pipeline comprises four core modules: preprocessing, sentence selection, key selection, and distractor generation. Several techniques have been employed to implement individual modules. These include sentence simplification, syntactic and semantic processing of the sentences, entity recognition, semantic relationship extraction among entities, WordNet, neural word embedding, neural sentence embedding, and computation of intersentence similarity. The system is evaluated using the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), India, textbooks for three subjects. The quality of system-generated questions is assessed by human experts using various system-level and individual module-level metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system is capable of generating quality questions that could be useful in a real examination.},

  abstract     = {Free text answers to short questions can reflect students&#39; mastery of concepts and their relationships relevant to learning objectives. However, automating the assessment of free text answers has been challenging due to the complexity of natural language. Existing studies often predict the scores of free text answers in a “black box” manner without analyzing their semantic components, which at least partially limit the prediction performance. In this article, we focus on fine-grained semantic facets in free text answers that correspond to knowledge to be mastered. Using a dataset with semantic facet annotation, we first show the correspondence of semantic facet matching states and answer quality, as well as the importance of semantic facets in automatic assessment of answer quality. We then extend the work to a dataset without semantic facet annotation and demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed automated methods in assessing answer quality, including semantic facet extraction, matching state prediction based on a neural framework, and feature engineering with semantic facets. The contribution of this research is twofold: 1) the proposed methods improve state-of-the-art performance of automatic assessment of free text answers and 2) it delves into fine-grained semantic components of free text answers, making it possible to explain the scores and generate detailed feedback.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing popularity of open educational resources in the past few decades, more and more users watch online videos to gain knowledge. However, most educational videos only provide monotonous navigation tools and lack elaborating annotations. This makes the task of locating interesting contents time consuming. To address this limitation, in this article, we propose a slide-based video navigation tool that is able to extract the hierarchical structure and semantic relationship of visual entities in videos, by integrating multichannel information. Features of visual entities are first extracted from the presentation slides by a novel deep learning framework. Then, we propose a clustering approach to extract hierarchical relationships between visual entities (e.g., formulas, texts, or graphs appearing in educational slides). We use this information to associate visual entities with their corresponding audio speech text, by evaluating their semantic relationship. We present two cases where we use the structured data produced by this tool to generate a multilevel table of contents and notes to provide additional navigation materials for learning. The evaluation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solutions for visual entity extraction, hierarchical relationship extraction, as well as corresponding speech text matching. The user study also shows promising improvement in the autogenerated table of contents and notes for facilitating learning.},
