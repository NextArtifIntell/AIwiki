  abstract     = {The article demonstrates for the first time that a brain-inspired spiking neural network (SNN) architecture can be used not only to learn spatio-temporal data, but also to extract fuzzy spatio-temporal rules from such data and to update these rules incrementally in a transfer learning mode. We propose a method, where a SNN model learns incrementally new time-space data related to new classes/tasks/categories, always utilizing some previously learned knowledge, and presents the evolved knowledge as fuzzy spatio-temporal rules. Similarly, to how the brain manifests transfer learning, these SNN models do not need to be restricted in number of layers and neurons in each layer as they adopt self-organizing learning principles. The continuously evolved fuzzy rules from spatio-temporal data are interpretable for a better understanding of the processes that generate the data. The proposed method is based on a brain-inspired SNN architecture NeuCube, which is structured according to a brain three-dimensional structural template. It is illustrated on tasks of incremental and transfer learning and knowledge transfer using spatio-temporal data measuring brain activity, when subjects are performing tasks in space and time. The method is a general one and opens the field to create new types of adaptable and explainable spatio-temporal learning systems across domain areas.},

  abstract     = {The performance of multilabel learning depends heavily on the quality of the input features. A mass of irrelevant and redundant features may seriously affect the performance of multilabel learning, and feature selection is an effective technique to solve this problem. However, most multilabel feature selection methods mainly emphasize removing these useless features, and the exploration of feature interaction is ignored. Moreover, the widespread existence of real-world data with uncertainty, ambiguity, and noise limits the performance of feature selection. To this end, our work is dedicated to designing an efficient and robust multilabel feature selection scheme. First, the distribution character of multilabel data is analyzed to generate robust fuzzy multineighborhood granules. By exploring the classification information implied in the data under the granularity structure, a robust multilabel $k$ -nearest neighbor fuzzy rough set model is constructed, and the concept of fuzzy dependency is studied. Second, a series of fuzzy multineighborhood uncertainty measures in $k$ -nearest neighbor fuzzy rough approximation spaces are studied to analyze the correlations of feature pairs, including interactivity. Third, by investigating the uncertainty measure between feature and label, between features, multilabel data is modeled as a complete weighted graph. Then, these vertices are assessed iteratively to guide the assignment of feature weights. Finally, a graph structure-based robust multilabel feature selection algorithm (GRMFS) is designed. The experiments are conducted on 15 multilabel datasets. The results verify the superior performance of GRMFS as compared with nine representative feature selection methods.},

  abstract     = {For the sake of eliminating multiple degradations, most existing multitask image restoration methods prefer to learn the properties of each degradation type, which is often accompanied by a bloated model size and a heavy learning burden. To tackle the aforementioned issues, in this article, we propose to treat multiple degradations uniformly to achieve degradation type-agnostic multitask image restoration. We observe that the degradations in different spatial locations are always morphologically similar while the background sceneries vary greatly. In accordance with the aforementioned observation, we decouple the degradation features and the background features by an efficient fuzzy clustering method. The degradation features contain all the diverse degradation information, while the images are recovered from the decoupled background features. In practice, we discover a uniformity between the fuzzy C-means algorithm and cross attention and propose a deep fuzzy clustering transformer to achieve degradation type-agnostic background extraction via feature map clustering based on spatial distribution characteristics. Furthermore, to capture the spatial distribution properties of an image, an efficient global attention tree (GAT) is devised to provide a global spatial receptive field for the clustering process. By virtue of the quadtree structure, the proposed GATs enable more efficient global modeling than existing methods. Our experimental analysis showed that the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art models in terms of both efficiency and performance.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) has been a commonly used algorithm in fuzzy clustering for decades. However, it still faces two problems: how to determine the initial cluster center and how to determine the number of clusters. The recently proposed robust learning fuzzy C-means (RL-FCM) can automatically obtain the optimal number of clusters. However, it assumes that the initial cluster center is the entire dataset, which incurs a significant time cost and involves parameters that are also difficult to determine. Additionally, RL-FCM is unable to handle imbalanced datasets and datasets with a large span of sample attributes. Therefore, we propose a robust learning membership scaling fuzzy C-means algorithm based on new belief peaks (RL-MFCM). Within the framework of the confidence function, the neighbors of the sample points provide evidence for the sample points being cluster centers. Consequently, according to Jiang&#39;s combination rule, we consider the new belief peak as the initial cluster center. To avoid excessive interference of the mixing ratio of the cluster to the calculation of membership degree, we employ triangle inequality to improve the influence of the samples in the cluster in the clustering process. We analyze the time complexity of the proposed algorithm and conduct comparative experiments with existing fuzzy clustering algorithms on artificial and real datasets in the article. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm accurately estimates the number of clusters and exhibits superior clustering performance without needing initialization.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes an adaptive fuzzy decentralized output-feedback control scheme for large-scale systems with multichannel asynchronous event triggering. Uncertain system dynamics, unknown interconnections, and time-varying sensor faults are handled simultaneously, even though only the corrupted measured local output is available for the design procedure. First, local state estimation filters are designed to estimate the unmeasured states. Then, considering that the resource-limited communication and computation may exist in all three types of channels, including state estimation filter-to-controller channel, parameter estimator-to-controller channel, and controller-to-actuator channel, an asynchronous event-triggering framework with time-varying triggering threshold is developed for multiple channels to release the communication and computation burden. Compared with the existing synchronous triggering mechanism, the proposed asynchronous one has several advantages: 1) the redundant signal transmission is reduced; 2) the triggering conditions for different channels are uncorrelated, which enables the designer to adjust the signal transmission frequency of each channel independently; and 3) the robustness could be improved in the face of noise as ideal synchronous triggering is not easy to be achieved in practice. In addition, both gain and bias faults, which are allowed to be unknown and time varying, are covered in a unified sensor fault model. It is proved that, with the proposed control scheme, all the closed-loop signals are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the output tracking error converges into an adjustable residual set without Zeno behavior. Finally, simulation and comparison results illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the membership-function-dependent (MFD) stability and positivity analysis of positive interval type-2 (IT2) Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy fault-tolerant control systems under the event-triggered control framework. Considering the fact that parameter uncertainties may exist in nonlinear plants, the IT2 T–S fuzzy model as an effective mathematical tool is employed to approximately express a complex positive system with nonlinearities and uncertainties. In order to save communication resources and improve the security of system operation, an event-triggered fault-tolerant (ETFT) control strategy is then designed based on the imperfectly premise matching concept. In addition, for capturing positivity characteristic and matching with the linear copositive Lyapunov function, a novel event-triggered condition in the 1-norm rather than in the 2-norm is developed to control the positive IT2 T–S fuzzy systems. Thereinto, the nonconvex problem as the first obstacle is required to be cleared since feasible solutions usually cannot be obtained based on the nonconvex conditions. For dealing with this problem, a valid approach is presented to conduct convexification with the help of a user-chosen constant vector. Besides, because of event-triggered action, the inherent mismatched issue of the premise variables of the fuzzy model and the ones of the fuzzy controller is encountered. Fortunately, the advanced MFD analysis, which is capable of bringing the information contained in the membership functions into the stability and positivity conditions, provides an effective strategy to remove this barrier. Consequently, relaxed results that can accomplish the stability and positivity for wider positive systems are developed and displayed in sum-of-squares form. Detailed simulation results are given to clarify the effectiveness of the designed ETFT control method.},

Further, a fuzzy memory-based SD controller is designed to obtain the asymptotic stability condition under the circumstances of packet dropouts, and simultaneously, disturbance reduction is confirmed.

  abstract     = {Quantifying the uncertainty of information distributions containing randomness, imprecision, and fuzziness is the premise of processing them. A useful information representation in the field of intelligent computing are information granules, which optimize data from the perspective of specificity and coverage. We introduce information granularity into evidential information and model the basic probability assignment (BPA) as a weighted information granules model. Based on the proposed model, a new uncertainty measure of BPA is derived from the quality evaluation of granules. In addition, the proposed measure is extended to fuzzy evidential information distributions. When the Fuzzy BPA (FBPA) degenerates into the Probability Mass Function (ProbMF) and Possibility Mass Function (PossMF), the proposed method degenerates to Gini entropy and Yager&#39;s specificity measure, respectively. We use a refined belief structure to interpret the meaning of FBPA in the transfer belief model, and verify the validity of the proposed method by analyzing its properties and presenting numerical examples. The concept of information granule is used for the first time to model focal set and beliefs. Compared with Shannon entropy based information measures, the proposed method provides a novel perspective on the relationship between randomness, imprecision, and fuzziness in FBPA.},

Nonlinearities in the underlying systems are tackled with the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model. As distinct from the previous achievements, the case that the semi-Markov kernel with partially known information is taken into account such that the underlying systems can be extended to a wider scope. Given that actuator saturation is ubiquitous in engineering systems, the convex hull method is embraced to address this circumstance. To reduce the conservativeness of the obtained results, on the basis of Lyapunov stability theory and LaSalle&#39;s invariance principle, some criteria related to the sojourn time are presented. Next, the mean-square exponential stability of the underlying system is obtained based on the derived results. Finally, further experiment to verify the feasibility of the proposed methodology is given by a tunnel diode circuit model.},

Each solution of the inequalities represents a feasible flow control scheme. Motivated by some different managerial objectives, several optimization problems subject to the addition-min inequalities have been recently studied. For example, considering the total efficiency for decreasing the network congestion, the linear objective function was adopted. While considering the fairness among the terminals, the min–max objective function was employed. In this article, combining these two objectives, we establish a corresponding bilevel fuzzy relation programming subject to the addition-min inequalities. For solving the bilevel programming, we first investigate some properties of the first-level programming, using the concept of fixed index set. Based on the properties of the first-level programming, our studied bilevel programming could be equivalently converted into a single-level programming and then solved by the existing linear programming approach. Our resolution approach is carried out by the fixed-index-set based algorithm and illustrated by some numerical examples.},

This FCA is designed dexterously according to the variation of two errors related to the INT-ZNN. Thus, the most feature of the INT-ZNN is that the added fuzzy control can inherently restrain the various noises. Compared with the previous noise-tolerant ZNN derived by the integral design formula, the INT-ZNN with a much simpler structure can tolerate the noise in finite/fixed time. That is, the INT-ZNN activated by nonlinear functions possesses finite/fixed-time convergence while suppressing the noise, which is guaranteed by the presented theorems. Besides, it also theoretically proves that the INT-ZNN has global stability under the interference of noise. In the simulative experiment, the INT-ZNN is used to solve the time-varying Sylvester matrix equation problem and the experimental results verify the excellent noise-tolerance of the INT-ZNN. Meanwhile, the INT-ZNN is successfully applied to image processing.},

We propose a new observer architecture that solves partially decouplable unknown inputs and converts nonlinear error dynamics into a linear parameter-varying type. Using the systematic $\ell _\infty$ -technique, the design conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities ensure stability and output performance of the state estimation. We also derive a straightforward and effective zonotopic analysis method, considering the fuzzy and local nonlinear context, for less conservative results without using any specific interval set computation. Furthermore, a fast fault detection logic is proposed as an application of the set-membership estimation.

Although many k-means-friendly deep clustering models have been explored, the existing division-based methods tend to directly implement clustering with a specific number of clusters, which suffers from poor performance resulted from indistinguishable clusters, and contributes to bad local optimum. At the same time, the representation learning of fuzzy $c$ -means clustering in the feature space still needs more research. In this article, a deep fuzzy curriculum clustering method with the learning strategy of clustering from easy to complex automatically is proposed to tackle the above issues. First, considering the soft flexible allocation of fuzzy $c$ -means and the preservation of local structure of original data, the fuzzy clustering loss and the autoencoder&#39;s reconstruction loss are constructed to learn the embedded features and clustering centers simultaneously. Second, curriculum loss is introduced into the constraint to make clusters successively merge in line with implementing clustering from easy to complex, and realize the bottom-up deep aggregative clustering automatically. In addition, novel curriculum information is proposed as constraint to guide the merging of clusters belonging to the same class. Experimental results on four real-world datasets show the superiority of the proposal.},

The FlexRay protocol is characterized by both the time- and event-triggered mechanisms, which are conducted in a cyclic manner. By using a piecewise approach, the measurement outputs affected by the FlexRay protocol are established based on a switching model. Then, a fuzzy PID controller is proposed with a concise and realizable structure. To evaluate the performance of the controlled system, a special time sequence is introduced that accounts for the behavior of the FlexRay protocol. Subsequently, a general framework is obtained to verify the boundedness of the closed-loop system, and then, the controller gains are designed by minimizing the bound of the concerned variables.

Meanwhile, distinguished from the existing control methods for state-constrained uncertain CPSs under malicious attacks, which can only ensure the system performance when time leans toward infinity or in finite time, the presented control strategy can guarantee the system performance in fixed time. It has been substantiated that the developed control strategy can make sure that the output tracking error converges to a predefined small neighborhood of the origin, and all signals of the resulting closed-loop system satisfy the corresponding time-varying state constraints during the total operation. In particular, the settling time and tracking precision are known and can be preconfigured by selecting the design parameters appropriately. More significantly, all the initial states of the system are independent of the developed fixed-time adaptive fuzzy tracking control law and can be arbitrarily chosen in the constrained region specified by the corresponding time-varying state constraints conditions.

Concerning the main objective, a novel approximation method that combines the fuzzy blend of local performance indexes and the radial basis function neural network is developed to approximate the global performance index for Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy systems. Based on the result in the linear case, the performance residual is constructed along the closed-loop system trajectory, and the threshold is determined for the fuzzy control systems with reference inputs and model uncertainties.

We argue that this construction provides semantic justification for all subfamilies of complemental fuzzy sets, which include $q$ -rung orthopair fuzzy sets (when $\mathfrak {c}$ is a Yager&#39;s fuzzy complement) and the new family of Sugeno intuitionistic fuzzy sets (when $\mathfrak {c}$ belongs to the class of Sugeno&#39;s fuzzy complements). We study fundamental operations and a general methodology for the aggregation of complemental fuzzy sets. Then, we give some specific examples of aggregation operators to illustrate their applicability. On a more practical level, constructive proofs demonstrate that all orthopair fuzzy sets on finite sets that satisfy a mild restriction are Sugeno intuitionistic fuzzy sets, and they are $q$ -rung orthopair fuzzy sets for some $q$ too. These contributions produce a new operational model that semantically justifies, and mathematically contains, “almost all” orthopair fuzzy sets on finite sets.},

In noncascade control structures, the lack of firsthand current references imposes a tricky challenge in dealing with current constraints from the circuit and unmatched disturbances caused by load torques. To this end, a virtual reference-based fuzzy noncascade speed control scheme is proposed for PMSM systems. First, unmatched load torques are estimated by a fuzzy disturbance observer. And then, a novel virtual reference planner is constructed to inject the estimated unmatched disturbance into the control channel as feedback compensation. This improves antidisturbance performance, while keeping the current response within the feasible domain and reducing speed overshoot. Furthermore, the noncascade speed regulation problem is converted into a system stabilization problem and addressed by the composite control strategy based on the nonparallel distributed compensation. Finally, closed-loop stability with reduced conservatism is ensured through the fuzzy Lyapunov functions and improved slack variables. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed scheme achieves excellent speed response without overcurrent even under mismatched load torque variations.},

This article improves SNN in terms of the coding process and the spike response function by invoking fuzzy sets. In terms of coding, a new fuzzy C-means coding (FCMC) method is proposed, which breaks the limitation of uniformly distributed receptive fields of existing coding methods and automatically determines suitable receptive fields that reflect the density distribution of the input data for encoding through the fuzzy C-means clustering. In terms of spike response function, triangular fuzzy numbers instead of the commonly used alpha-type function are used as the spike response function. Different from other functions of fixed shape, width parameters of the proposed function are learnt in the iterative way like weights of synapses do. Experimental results obtained on seven benchmark datasets and two real-world datasets with eleven approaches demonstrate that SNN with triangular spike response functions (abbreviated as T-SNN) combining FCMC can achieve improved performance in terms of accuracy, F-measure, AUC, required epochs, running time, and stability.},

  abstract     = {This article researches $H_{\infty }$ asynchronous admissibilization for nonlinear singular delayed hybrid hydraulic turbine governing systems with impulsive perturbations. By exploiting Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy technique, the fuzzy singular delayed hybrid hydraulic turbine governing system with impulsive perturbations is built, which cannot only accurately and concisely describe the dynamic behaviors of the pipeline, but also resist damages for the hydraulic turbine system caused by sudden reasons. Then, the asynchronous fuzzy state-feedback controller (FSFC) is designed by using parallel distributed compensation technique, and the asynchronous mechanism between the modes of FSFC and the modes of controlled plant is depicted by a hidden Markovian model. By constructing an improved timer-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, the new criteria about $H_{\infty }$ admissibilization for fuzzy singular delayed hybrid hydraulic turbine governing systems with impulsive perturbations can be acquired. The gains of asynchronous FSFC are expressed by solving linear matrix inequalities. Impulsive operators are successfully generalized and extended from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ , which makes the approach presented in this article more universal. Finally, the simulation results prove the correctness and availability of the method provided in this article.},

  abstract     = {The ensemble of fuzzy clustering can address the problems presented in the base clustering, such as fluctuations in results due to random initialization and performance degradation due to outliers. However, the performance of fuzzy clustering ensembles is still hampered by some challenges that include misaligned membership matrices, loss of information in the cosimilarity matrix, large storage space, unstable ensemble results due to an additional reclustering, the need for original data information for assistance, etc. To address these issues, we propose a parameter-free robust ensemble framework for fuzzy clustering. After obtaining the set of membership matrices, we cascade these membership matrices and mine the latent spectral matrix of the raw data. Benefiting from this step, we obtain global features of the dataset without knowing the specific data. Then, our framework uses transition matrices to solve the alignment problem, avoiding the storage of large-scale matrices. Most importantly, we introduce a robust weighted mechanism in the optimization model, where each base clustering is adaptively adjusted and the effect of outliers is suppressed by a robust function. In addition, the model yields the results as a membership matrix, which produces the exact partition results directly without any subsequent clustering operations. Finally, since our model is a parameter-free model, the setting of hyperparameters is avoided and the applicability of the model is improved as well. The effective algorithm of the optimization model is derived and its time complexity and convergence are analyzed. The results of competitive experiments on benchmark data show that the proposed ensemble framework is effective compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

Optimal control depends on the solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation, which is hard to be calculated directly due to its inherent nonlinearity. To overcome this difficulty, the reinforcement learning strategy with fuzzy logic systems is proposed, in which identifier, actor, and critic are used to estimate unknown nonlinear dynamics, implement control behavior, and evaluate system performance, respectively. Different from the existing optimal control algorithms, a new performance index function considering formation error cost and control input energy cost is constructed to achieve optimal formation control of MASs within a prescribed time. The presented control strategy can ensure that the formation error converges to the desired accuracy within a prescribed time.

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation deals with a task from an unlabeled target domain by leveraging the knowledge gained from labeled source domain(s). The fuzzy system is adopted in domain adaptation to better tackle the uncertainty caused by information scarcity in the transfer. Most existing fuzzy and nonfuzzy domain adaptation methods depend on data-level distribution matching to eliminate the domain shift. However, data sharing can trigger privacy concerns. This situation results in the unavailability of source data, wherein most domain adaptation methods cannot be applied. Source-free domain adaptation is then proposed to handle this problem. But the existing source-free domain adaptation methods rarely deal with any soft information component due to data imprecision. Besides, fewer methods handle multiple source domains that provide richer transfer information. Thus, in this article, we propose source-free multidomain adaptation with fuzzy rule-based deep neural networks, which takes advantage of a fuzzy system to handle data uncertainty in domain adaptation without source data. To learn source private models with high generality, which is important to collect low-noise pseudotarget labels, auxiliary tasks are designed by jointly training source models from multiple domains, which share source parameters and fuzzy rules while protecting source data. To transfer fuzzy rules and fit source private parameters to the target domain, self-supervised learning and anchor-based alignment are built to force target data into source feature spaces. Experiments on real-world datasets under both homogeneous and heterogeneous label space scenarios are carried out to validate the proposed method. The results indicate the superiority of the proposed fuzzy rule-based source-free multidomain adaptation method.},

  abstract     = {It is widely recognized that learning systems have to go deeper to exchange for more powerful representational learning capabilities in order to precisely approximate nonlinear complex problems. However, the best-known computational intelligence approaches with such characteristics, namely, deep neural networks, are often criticized for lacking transparency. In this article, a novel multilayer evolving fuzzy neural network (MEFNN) with a transparent system structure is proposed. The proposed MEFNN is a metalevel stacking ensemble learning system composed of multiple cascading evolving neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ENFISs), processing input data layer-by-layer to automatically learn multilevel nonlinear distributed representations from data. Each ENFIS is an evolving fuzzy system capable of learning from new data sample by sample to self-organize a set of human-interpretable IF– THEN fuzzy rules that facilitate approximate reasoning. Adopting ENFIS as its ensemble component, the multilayer system structure of the MEFNN is flexible and transparent, and its internal reasoning and decision-making mechanism can be explained and interpreted to/by humans. To facilitate information exchange between different layers and attain stronger representation learning capability, the MEFNN utilizes error backpropagation to self-update the consequent parameters of the IF–THEN rules of each ensemble component based on the approximation error propagated backward. To enhance the capability of the MEFNN to handle complex problems, a nonlinear activation function is introduced to modeling the consequent parts of the IF–THEN rules of ENFISs, thereby empowering both the representation and the reflection of nonlinearity in the resulting fuzzy outputs. Numerical examples on a wide variety of challenging (benchmark and real-world) classification and regression problems demonstrate the superior practical performance of the MEFNN, revealing the effectiveness and validity of the proposed approach.},

Fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are used to model unknown nonlinearities and avoid the algebraic loop arising from the system structure. Appropriate integral Barrier Lyapunov functions (IBLFs) are chosen so that time-varying full state constraints can be guaranteed directly rather than by transforming the constraint object. In the framework of backstepping technology, the relative threshold strategy is introduced to modify the adaptive control scheme so that the controller can be updated only after the trigger condition has been met, which reduces the update frequency of the controller and the loss of the actuator. Combined with Lyapunov stability theory, it is shown that all closed-loop signals are bounded in probability, in which the states remain within the specified constraints, and there is no Zeno behavior. A series of simulation results are given to reveal the effectiveness of the constructed control scheme.},

Based on the idea of fuzzy logic system, a fuzzy-logic-based-membership function is constructed to realize the local expanded constraint boundary. The state constraint problem is solved by constructing a transformation function, which can avoid feasibility conditions of the barrier Lyapunov function. At the same time, as the reference command is slightly beyond the border, the output can still track the reference command via locally expanding the constraint boundary. In addition, the boundaries of other states can be expanded automatically. The unknown nonlinear functions are solved by the radial basis function neural network, and time-varying actuator faults are handled by an adaptive technique. Then, a backstepping-method-based control scheme is proposed, which ensures that the output track, the out-of-bound reference command, and the constraints of remaining states can also be expanded. In the framework of Lyapunov theory, it is proven that the closed-loop system can eventually be bounded stable, and the tracking error converges to an arbitrarily small vicinity of zero.

In this article, we introduce an innovative spectral embedding method, namely, joint learning of anchor graph-based fuzzy spectral embedding model and fuzzy K-means (AFSEFK). Drawing inspiration from fuzzy logic, our method employs a membership vector in lieu of the conventional indicator vector for spectral embedding, amalgamating it with fuzzy K-means to concurrently optimize membership, thereby simultaneously learning the local and global structures inherent in the data. Moreover, to enhance the quality of similarity graphs and augment clustering performance, we implement the balanced K-means-based hierarchical K-means technique to generate representative anchors. Subsequently, an anchor-based similarity graph is devised through a parameter-free neighbor assignment strategy. Comprehensive extensive experimentation with synthetic and real-world datasets substantiates the efficacy of the AFSEFK algorithm.},

Then, better disturbance rejection can be achieved for this specific type of T–S fuzzy system. In order to save the system resources, an event-triggered mechanism is developed. Different from the widely existing dynamic event-triggered mechanism, a dynamic memory event-triggered mechanism is established by introducing dynamic variables with memory. Rigorous theoretical analysis shows that the proposed dynamic memory event-triggered mechanism possesses larger event-triggered intervals than the existing dynamic event-triggered mechanism. This facilitates the implementation of the proposed scheme in real systems, as real physical components require time intervals between successive event executions. Furthermore, based on the newly proposed index and dynamic memory event-triggered mechanism, the finite-time event-triggered $H_{\infty }$ control problem of the considered system is solved.

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose a new framework for solving the optimal consensus problem of agents with continuous dynamics. Motivated by the EXTRA algorithm, we introduce novel auxiliary continuous variables that utilize only sampled measurements of the neighbor outputs. The use of suitable smoothing functions, which allow us to gradually incorporate the samples in the new variables within a sampling period, guarantees the continuity of these variables. It is shown that the regulation of these EXTRA-based smoothed optimal consensus variables to a neighborhood of zero ensures approximate optimal consensus of the agent outputs. Taking this property into account, adaptive fuzzy distributed controllers are then designed for fully actuated Lagrangian agents that approximate the unknown system nonlinearities and guarantee approximate optimal consensus of all agent outputs. Moreover, all closed-loop signals are proven to remain bounded. Simulations on a swarm of wheeled robots validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

A wavelet layer is added to the structure of the fuzzy neural network to further improve the feature extraction ability. Because of its good effect in dealing with nonlinear terms, the WFNN controller is utilized to approach the equivalent controller to reduce switch gains and remove chattering. At the same time, parameter adaptive laws of WFNN are derived by the Lyapunov stability method to realize the fast training of WFNN.

Thus, a novel practical fixed-time stability criterion is proved in this article to resolve the abovementioned problem and can obtain the precise value of the settling time upper bound. The control singular issue caused by the fixed-time stability criterion form is avoided by introducing adding power integration method. Compared with other approaches, this method is easy to apply in control design, and it is convenient to prove its effectiveness. And fuzzy logic system is adopted to approximate the unknown nonlinear items. Combining the proposed fixed-time stability criterion, traditional backstepping scheme, and fuzzy logic system, an adaptive practical fixed-time controller is proposed.

For granular computing of Big Data, discernibility matrix and dependency degree are the most representative methods for matrix-based and feature-importance-degree-based feature selection, respectively. However, their temporal and space complexities are high and often lead to poor performance. In this article, a novel feature selection framework for large-scale data processing with linear complexities was proposed for the first time. First, a much more concise fuzzy granule set, called fuzzy arithmetic covering, was introduced to reduce computational costs. Then, a new matrix-based feature selection framework, namely consistent matrix, was proposed for general rough set models. As a result, a heuristic attribute reduction algorithm, i.e., HARCM, was designed accordingly. Compared with six state-of-the-art algorithms for feature selection, the average running time of the newly proposed algorithm was reduced up to 2913 times, with a comparable or even better classification performance.},

According to the derived data-driven model, a static control policy is proposed to transform the considered optimal tracking control problem into an optimal regulation control problem of an induced error system. Subsequently, based on sliding mode control technology and the concept of hierarchical design, a novel optimal feedback control policy is developed to regulate the tracking error by minimizing a performance index function related to the HSMS. The solution to the Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equation of nonlinear multiplayer ZSGs is obtained via the HSMS-based critic neural network. Furthermore, the historical stored data are utilized to conquer the difficulty associated with the persistence of excitation conditions. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, it is strictly proven that the tracking error and the critic neural network weight are uniformly ultimately bounded.

  abstract     = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) show strong adaptability in solving the complex optimization problems. Fitness evaluation is an important step of EA. In this step, the fitness of individuals is calculated by fitness evaluation methods. However, there are many complex optimization problems in which the existing fitness evaluation methods cannot express solutions’ fitness by crisp values but only fuzzy fitness information. Even if some fitness evaluation methods can predict crisp values to express the individuals’ fitness, these methods must “see” some crisp fitness information in advance. These shortcomings of existing fitness evaluation methods make EAs unable to work effectively in many optimization tasks. In this article, we propose the concept of blind fitness evaluation. A blind fitness evaluation method (BFEM) can output individuals’ crisp fitness information without “seeing” any crisp fitness information in advance. Based on the concept, we propose a BFEM which uses an artificial neural network, named modified fitness comparison network (MFCN) to evaluate the fitness of individuals. The MFCN can be trained by fuzzy fitness information, and the trained MFCN can predict the crisp fitness information of any individual. By applying the BFEM to EAs, the EAs with blind fitness evaluation are obtained and the algorithms can effectively solve the complex optimization problems with only fuzzy fitness information. The proposed BFEM is compared with several popular fitness evaluation methods that rely on crisp fitness information. Experimental results show that the fitness evaluation accuracy of MFCN trained based on only fuzzy fitness information is similar to or higher than that of the fitness evaluation methods relying on crisp fitness information. The EAs with MFCN also show higher performance than the EAs with the popular fitness evaluation methods in search ability and solution quality.},

However, there are few studies on robust feature selection methods for monotonic classification tasks. The fuzzy dominance rough set (FDRS) model is a nontrivial knowledge acquisition tool, which is widely used in feature selection of monotonic classification tasks. Nonetheless, this model has been proved in practice to be generally poorly fault-tolerance, and only one noisy sample can cause huge interference in acquiring knowledge. In view of these two issues, this article first designs an adaptive $K$ -nearest neighbors strategy to calculate the density of samples. The noisy samples are identified according to their densities, and then an active antinoise FDRS model is proposed. Then, in the active antinoise fuzzy dominance rough approximation space, the class-separability is evaluated by the approximation operators of the proposed model, and the feature-redundancy is evaluated by the fuzzy ranking conditional mutual information. On this basis, a feature evaluation index is designed comprehensively considering class-separability and feature-redundancy. Finally, a feature selection algorithm is designed to select the feature subset with the highest classification performance. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has better robustness and classification performance.},

Furthermore, the Pade approximation method is applied to address the input delay by introducing a new intermediate variable. Then, a novel adaptive event-triggered mechanism is proposed to reduce the number of data transmissions and mitigate the effects of tracking error. The stability analysis shows that the closed-loop signals are semiglobal finite-time stable in probability, while the tracking performances are well and satisfy the output constraint condition. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach.},

  abstract     = {The generation of intentional delay in response to the stride frequency is seldom considered in prosthesis-human symbiosis (PHS). Unfortunately, such intentionally delayed human-robot interaction poses a new challenge to their gait coordination (GC) in stochastic environments. Utilizing fuzzy logic systems (FLSs), we investigate an adaptive fuzzy finite-time control of a stochastic PHS with intentional delay to address this issue. Noting that the intentional delay is related to walking velocity, this article conducts experiments on ten healthy subjects to identify the intentional delays at different velocities using the FLS. Introducing the FLS-identified delay and contralateral healthy limb gaits, we propose a prosthetic gait planner to simultaneously determine the reference stride frequency and stride length, thus properly regulating the desired velocity. Considering the adverse effects of the required intentional delay and state constraints in the stochastic framework, we propose a new statistical Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, together with a Tan-type barrier Lyapunov function. Correspondingly, an adaptive fuzzy controller is developed via a backstepping design, thus solving the semi-global finite-time stable in probability with intentional delay, unknown nonlinearities, and state constraints. Application studies validate the efficacy of the proposed approach. The results show that our approach can predict walking behavior while performing GC.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy or neuro-fuzzy systems have been successfully employed in many areas, but their limitation in solving high-dimensional problems remains a challenging task. On the other hand, fuzzy model-based feature selection (FS) approaches have been well studied but, because of the above limitation, are rarely applied to high-dimensional data, which exactly needs feature reduction. In this article, we design a novel adaptive Ln-Exp softmin operator as the approximator of the minimum T-norm, which is equipped in Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy systems to make them capable of dealing with high-dimensional problems. The adaptive Ln-Exp softmin-based TSK (ALETSK) model is developed. Then, we improve the gate function by introducing an enhanced scheme and propose a double groups of gates-based ALETSK (DG-ALETSK) fuzzy approach to simultaneously conduct FS and rule extraction (RE), where the gate function is a function measuring the importance of the features or rules and it acts like a gate. More specifically, a group of feature gates are embedded in the antecedents of ALETSK for FS. Meanwhile, another group of rule gates are embedded in the consequents of ALETSK for RE. In one training phase, the gate parameters are trained along with the system parameters, so that the FS and RE are done together. Our proposed DG-ALETSK is effective and time-saving for FS and RE in the high-dimensional tasks, which is verified by the numerical experiments.},

To mitigate the communication load, WTOD protocol is exploited to schedule the transmission order of the signals, in which those signals may be subjected to randomly occurring deception attacks. The observer is constructed under immeasurable premise variables, and then the controller with imperfect matching MFs is designed according to the estimated states. Moreover, the observer-based controller is derived with Lyapunov stability theory such that the stochastic stability of the augmented closed-loop system with predefined disturbance attenuation performance can be guaranteed. Subsequently, sufficient conditions are provided for the desired observer and controller gain matrices based on linear matrix inequalities technique.

This article proposes a sentiment-driven fuzzy cloud multicriteria model for online product ranking and performance to provide purchase recommendations. In this novel model, bidirectional long short-term memory network-conditional random fields, sentiment analysis, and K-means clustering are first integrated to mine product attributes and compute sentiment values based on the reviews from various platforms. Next, considering the confidence of the sentiment value, the cloud model is combined with q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets to define the new concept of the q-rung orthopair fuzzy cloud (q-ROFC) and the interaction operational laws between q-ROFCs are given. The sentiment values of each product attribute from different platforms are cross combined and transformed into a type of q-ROFC, while multiple interactive information matrices are established. To investigate the correlation among homogeneous attributes, the q-ROFC interaction weighted partitioned Maclaurin symmetric mean operator is proposed. Finally, we provide real-world examples of online mobile phone ranking and attribute performance evaluation. The results show that our proposed method offers significant advantages in dealing with customer purchase decisions for online products and problems with performance direction identification.

For surmounting this situation, a novel time-dependent multiple Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional approach is developed by integrating a ranged dwell time switching mechanism. Then, the corresponding (input–output) finite-time stability criteria with less conservativeness are simultaneously derived for the (perturbed) STSF delayed systems to be (input–output) finite-time stable over the concerned finite-time interval. Finally, two illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the accuracy and superiority of the developed (input–output) finite-time analysis framework.},

  abstract     = {The determinization of fuzzy automata is a well-studied problem in theoretical computer science celebrated for its practical applications. Indeed, in the fields of fuzzy discrete event systems, fault diagnosis, clinical monitoring, decision-making systems, and model checking, when a suitable model of a fuzzy automaton is employed, it is desirable to find its language-equivalent deterministic version because of its computational efficiency. Although many methods have been developed to convert a fuzzy automaton to its language equivalent fuzzy deterministic finite automaton (FDfA), they can be applied only for fuzzy automata defined over specific underlying sets of truth values. For example, recently developed determinization methods employ the concept of maximal factorization, which can be defined only on nonlocally finite lattices or the Boolean lattice. In addition, not all such determinization methods result in a minimal FDfA. On the other hand, even though such determinization methods have been developed for fuzzy automata over specific underlying structures, these methods cannot be generalized for fuzzy automata over locally finite lattices. This article focuses on filling this gap and develops a novel method for computing a minimal FDfA for a fuzzy automaton defined over a locally finite and divisible residuated lattice. Our method uses the new concept of a reduction graph that emerges from the strict order relation on the resulting fuzzy states, according to which we can construct all minimal FDfAs equivalent to a given fuzzy automaton.},

The main objective is to design a positive and stable fuzzy filter, which makes the $L_{1}$ performance index of the estimated output signal as good as possible with limited networked bandwidth resources. Since the positive constraints exist in the positive systems, while the disturbance signal of the output signal and the transmission delay in the event-triggered mechanism are taken into account in this research, the augmented system is rebuilt by introducing the weight coefficient of the disturbance signal, and a novel linear copositive Lyapunov function is proposed. In order to adapt to the analysis framework based on the linear Lyapunov function, a novel linear event-triggered condition is proposed. Furthermore, to handle the mismatched premise variables caused by the event-triggered mechanism, the premise variables associated with event-triggered instants are integrated into the interval of continuous premise variable with the help of the novel event-triggered condition, which means that the original multidimensional type-1 membership functions (MFs) are transformed into single-dimensional interval type-2 MFs. Then, an interval type-2 membership-function-dependent method is employed to introduce MF information into the resultant conditions, so that a more optimized $L_{1}$ performance index is obtained. Finally, an example with simulation results is given to verify the effectiveness of all the fuzzy filter design strategies proposed in this article for optimizing the performance index.},

A key feature is that the signal transmission is inevitably affected by fading phenomenon due to random noise and amplitude attenuation during the wireless communication. The main challenge lies in designing an appropriate fuzzy control scheme to achieve the reachability of the specified sliding region in line with channel fading. Under the common sliding surface, a fuzzy SMC law is constructed, which is related to the state signals affected by dynamic event-triggered protocol and channel fading. Then, by means of the boundary information of the global membership functions, sufficient conditions to ensure the stochastic stability of the underlying system, and the system states can be driven on the specified sliding region within a finite-time interval, which attenuates the influence of the channel fading.

Hierarchical structure may be treated as the most representative one, which is mathematically depicted as a tree-like structure or directed acyclic graph. In this article, considering data in the real world may arrive dynamically, we propose an incremental feature selection approach in hierarchical classification by employing fuzzy rough set technique. First, we use the sibling strategy to reduce the scope of negative samples. Second, we present a theoretical analysis of the incremental updating of the lower approximation, positive region and dependency degree at the arrival of new samples, respectively. Third, we perform the algorithmic design of the incremental approaches. To do that, we first present two improved versions (NIDC and NIFS for short) of the existing nonincremental methods, based on NIDC, NIFS, and the aforementioned theoretical analysis, two incremental algorithms (IDU and IFS for short) are then designed to perform incremental feature selection. Finally, a numerical experiment is conducted on some commonly used datasets for hierarchical classification tasks, whose true classes are distributed to both leaf nodes and internal nodes. A comparative study is further performed to show that our approach is effective and feasible.},

By constructing a type of finite-time preassigned-performance function (FTPF), the tracking error variable is confined within the boundaries of the FTPF such that the performance metrics, for instance, steady-state error, and convergence time, could be satisfied. Incorporating fuzzy adaptive control with the NDO technique, an effective composite NDO (CNDO) scheme is built to reckon the unknown composite disturbances, including unknown external disturbances and fuzzy approximation errors, which implies that fuzzy approaching errors can be further cut down. It is confirmed that the closed-loop system is semiglobally practically finite-time stable, as well as the tracking error and convergence time satisfy the predefined performance indices. In the end, the validity of the CNDO-based finite-time adaptive DSC scheme has been evidenced by a practical example model.},

Then, an improved adaptive integral sliding mode disturbance observer (AISMDO) with reconstructed errors is established to obtain the estimation of external disturbances, which shows less conservatism and provides better estimation performance. Furthermore, considering the potential collisions among agents and obstacles, two artificial functions are incorporated into the backstepping technique to develop the adaptive fuzzy controller.

The output GRFN is constructed by combining GRFNs induced by prototypes using a combination operator that generalizes Dempster&#39;s rule of evidence theory. The three output units indicate the most plausible value of the response variable, variability around this value, and epistemic uncertainty. The network is trained by minimizing a loss function that generalizes the negative log-likelihood. Comparative experiments show that this method is competitive, both in terms of prediction accuracy and calibration error, with state-of-the-art techniques such as random forests or deep learning with Monte Carlo dropout.

In addition, a nonlinear extended state observer (NESO) is designed for simultaneously estimating the unmeasurable states and generalized disturbances, including the nonlinear hysteresis term of the PI model and external disturbances. In addition, a novel nonlinear function is designed to replace $fal(\cdot)$ function of the general NESO to address a modification that increases the convergence speed.

To this end, this article proposes credibility-supervised dynamic clustering and consensus model involving minority opinion processing. First, DMs’ information is analyzed and preprocessed to obtain DMs’ credibility evaluation. Subsequently, DMs’ credibility is used as one of the clustering criteria to supervise and guide the trust relationships and the clustering of large-scale group, which assists in deriving the reliable clustering result. This clustering is dynamic because the clustering result may alter as the DMs’ information changes in consensus. Afterwards, an SN-LSDM consensus model with minority opinions settlement is developed. A credibility-based mechanism for identification, DMs’ discussion, and weight adjustment of minority opinion subgroup is constructed, including it trust risk measurement method and trust risk level-based weight adjustment. Then, a risk index is defined in feedback adjustment mechanism to adjust DMs’ information, and a decision plan with a higher consensus level is obtained. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model are verified through the case study of “916” Lu County earthquake relief. Discussions and comparisons are conducted by simulation experiments to explore the capabilities and advantages of our proposal.},

The upper and lower grades of membership functions are used to characterize uncertain parameter-dependent nonlinear systems in the interval type-2 fuzzy (IT2F) model. Different from the existing literature, a new fuzzy dependent refined looped Lyapunov functional (LF) is introduced, which involves the new exponent terms and state information such as $\frac{e^{2\gamma _{v}(\varrho -\varrho _{\mathscr{k}})}-1}{2\gamma _{v}}, \ \frac{e^{2\gamma _{v}(\varrho _{\mathscr{k}+1}-\varrho)}-1} {2\gamma _{v}}, \ \mathscr{z}(\varrho _{\mathscr{k}})$ , and $\mathscr{z}(\varrho _{\mathscr{k}+1})$ with tuning parameters and few slack variables. The AE-DADT switching property has also been taken into account for nonlinear systems, and it contributes to getting more information about previous modes. Based on the proposed new refined looped LFs, new sufficient conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which ensure the global uniform exponential stability of the nominated switched IT2F systems. The feasibility of the obtained results is verified by the numerical example, and the tunnel diode circuit system model and the Lorenz chaotic system are established to illustrate the feasibility and efficacy of the theoretical findings.},

In data clustering, prototype-based clustering is effective and efficient. The main idea of prototype-based clustering is discovering prototype samples to represent clusters and assigning samples to the represented clusters. In this article, we draw the idea of prototype-based clustering to fuzzy clustering ensemble and handle the problems of how to discover prototype samples based on a set of fuzzy clustering results and how to assign the samples without accessing the original data features. First, we propose a self-coassociation measure of a sample and discover its natural ability to evaluate the sample&#39;s local density. The rationality of the prototype samples discovered based on self-coassociation is theoretically analyzed and visually shown on eight artificial data sets. Then, we propose a prototype propagation method to assign data samples gradually. The working mechanism of the proposed sample assignment method is visually shown in the image segmentation scene. Finally, we develop a fuzzy clustering ensemble method based on self-coassociation and prototype propagation.

By resorting to the interval type-2 Takagi–Sugeno (IT2 T-S) fuzzy set theory, the nonlinearity and uncertainty features of the investigated systems are modeled. Taking the uncertain membership functions (MFs) of IT2 T-S fuzzy systems into consideration, the nonparallel distributed compensation strategy is employed for designing the MFs of the controller such that they do not need to be obtained in time. Furthermore, in view of the difficulty of accurately acquiring the mode of NMJSs with complex transition probabilities, the hidden Markov model is employed to provide a detected mode for constructing the sliding mode law. Afterward, a novel fuzzy sliding surface is proposed, and an asynchronous IT2-fuzzy-model-based sliding mode control law is designed for forcing the closed-loop systems to move on the predefined sliding surface. Thereafter, a novel two-mode-dependent Lyapunov-like function is conceived for the studied systems, where modes of NMJSs and transition probabilities are permitted to change simultaneously. By applying an improved technique to handle the parameteric matrix inequalities, some less-conservative sufficient conditions in the form of linear matrix inequality are obtained for ensuring the stochastic exponentially asymptotical stability of the sliding mode with $H_\infty$ performance.

However, the task of long-term time-series forecasting is accompanied by the problem of increasing cumulative error and decreasing time correlation. To overcome these shortcomings, this article proposes a prediction framework based on the nonlinear fuzzy information granule (NFIG) series, which can boost the long-term performance of most predictors. First, we propose the representation of the NFIG for the first time, replacing the linear core lines with nonlinear time-dependent curves. Second, we propose a temporal window splitting algorithm based on curvature equations and weighted directed graphs, which can not only merge temporal windows with the same trend but also cointegrate incremental data. Finally, the nonlinear trend fuzzy granulation can be employed as a data preprocessing module for various time-series predictors to achieve a better long-term forecasting performance. As a typical time-series forecasting task, the precise long-term forecast of traffic flow data can relieve the overburdened traffic system and improve the traffic environment to a certain extent. Thus, the proposed method is employed for the long-term traffic flow forecasting. Compared with existing forecasting models, which achieves superior performances.},

  abstract     = {As one of the rapidly developing methodologies for dealing with complex problems in line with human cognition, granular computing has made significant achievements in knowledge discovery. Neighborhood classifier, as a typical description of granular computing, is an effective method for the classification of continuous data. However, in the phase of constructing neighborhood rules, the existing neighborhood classifiers are divided into the following two modes and both have defects: 1) the strategy driven by center: there are a lot of overlap and inclusion among neighborhood rules, that is, it needs to spend much time to reduce redundancy rules; and 2) the strategy driven by rule: there are many rules containing only one object, which cannot form an effective covering and would affect knowledge acquisition in the incremental environment. Therefore, in this article, fuzzy quotient space theory is introduced to construct neighborhood rules. Based on the optimal granularity of fuzzy quotient space, first, a neighborhood covering classifier, which has no redundant rules and could form the effective covering, is proposed without any artificial parameter. Second, comprehensively considering the knowledge purity and complexity, the quality measure of granularity is proposed, which guides the optimal granularity selection of hierarchical quotient space structure. Third, neighborhood rules are constructed in optimal granularity. Then, the offset of center is introduced to describe the membership degree of the test object to different neighborhood rules, and the neighborhood allocation strategy is proposed accordingly. Next, an algorithm for the neighborhood covering classifier based on these theories is proposed. Finally, experiments on 13 UCI datasets and three real datasets are carried out to verify the performance of the proposed classifier from four common classification indexes.},

A fuzzy observer is designed to estimate the unmeasured states. The quartic asymmetric time-varying barrier Lyapunov function is established to ensure constraint satisfaction. By utilizing the stochastic theory, finite-time command filtered backstepping method and event-triggered mechanism, a finite-time event-triggered controller is recursively designed, which can not only guarantee finite-time convergent property, but also reduce communication pressure. Meanwhile, the matter of “explosion of complexity” is removed by introducing the finite-time command filter and the effect of filtered errors is offset by constructing error compensation signals. Moreover, an auxiliary system is introduced to handle the input constraint. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is demonstrated by the simulation example.},

Simultaneously design of the proportional-integral (PI)-like state feedback controller and fuzzy antiwindup compensator is achieved with the aim of output tracking. In the faulty case, by considering the nominal system as a reference model, a direct adaptive projection-based approach is developed using the T–S fuzzy modeling and control techniques to supply the adaptive fault-tolerant controller components. An enhanced PI state/fault observer with unmeasurable premise variables is introduced only to provide the estimation of states to be used in the proposed controller. The overall closed-loop system ensures the uniformly ultimately bounded solutions for error dynamics.

For unstructured uncertainties that are completely unknown, by employing Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy logic systems to approximate the unstructured uncertainties, a novel adaptive fuzzy boundary observer is developed to estimate both unknown system states as well as unknown weights in the fuzzy logic system, and the estimation errors are ultimately bounded. Therein, in the design of the proposed observer, a set of swapping filters and an infinite dimensional backstepping technique are combined. On the other hand, for structured uncertainties that can be described in a concrete parameterized form, the proposed method can easily achieve the exact estimation of weights and states to their true values. The rigorous proof is provided to show that the ultimately bounded estimation errors for the case of unstructured uncertainties and the exponential convergent estimation errors for the case of structured uncertainties can be realized.

First, the Jensen–Shannon divergence with statistical interpretability is used to capture the attribute information with strong correlation under on a level, and then an fresh attribute-oriented $\delta$ -rough fuzzy set model is presented. The pessimistic and optimistic decision concepts of the proposed rough fuzzy set model are used to interpretability enhancement of data information. On this basis, an interpretable predictive analysis model is constructed by combining logistic regression model. The construction process of the prediction model is supported by sufficient interpretable information. The predicted result is a result of development trend with a certain interpretability. Finally, to assess the effectiveness and viability of the proposed prediction model, we conduct comparative experiments with other three prediction models accompanied with four prediction performance indexes. Experimental results display that the proposed prediction model has well-pleasing prediction performance and antinoise ability.},

  abstract     = {Model checking possibilistic linear-time properties was investigated by Li in 2017. However, nondeterminism of the system is absent in previous studies. Therefore, in order to permit both possibilistic and nondeterministic choices, we use the generalized possibilistic decision process (GPDP) as a model of the system. First, the definition of GPDP describing the behavior of nondeterministic system is given in detail, the resolution of nondeterminism is performed by using the notion of schedulers, and the semantics of generalized possibilistic linear-temporal logic (GPoLTL) with schedulers are defined. Second, we study possibilistic model checking of some fuzzy linear-time properties under GPDP. Since there are many (infinite) schedulers satisfying a certain linear timing property in a given state of a GPDP, it is particularly critical to study the optimal strategy and its corresponding possible measure, which is called extremal possibility model checking. For some special fuzzy linear-time properties, such as constrained reachability, step-bounded constrained reachability, reachability, always reachability, repeated reachability, persistence reachability, we present complete solution to the optimal (including maximum and minimum cases) possibilistic model checking of the above reachability using the fixpoint techniques. We also introduce fuzzy $\omega$ -regular properties in GPDP and show that their model checking can be simplified by repeated reachability. The algorithms for model checking are also provided.

  abstract     = {Performing an accurate clustering analysis is of great significance for us to understand the behavior of complex networks, and a variety of graph clustering algorithms have, thus, been proposed to do so by taking into account network topology and node attributes. Among them, fuzzy clustering algorithm for complex networks (FCAN) is an established fuzzy clustering algorithm that optimizes the memberships of nodes based on dense structures and content relevance. This article proposes an improved fuzzy-based graph clustering algorithm, namely FCAN-multi objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) that retains all the benefits associated with FCAN while achieving significantly increased convergence rate using multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO). To do so, FCAN-MOPSO first modifies the original optimization model of FCAN by adopting an instance-frequency-weighted regularization, which enhances the ability of FCAN-MOPSO to handle the imbalance observed in the distribution of fuzzy memberships of nodes. After that, FCAN-MOPSO decomposes its optimization problem into a set of suboptimization problems. Following the MOPSO framework, FCAN-MOPSO develops an effective solution to reach a consensus optimization among them by balancing the global exploration and local exploitation abilities of particles. A theoretical analysis is provided to prove the global convergence of FCAN-MOPSO. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of FCAN-MOPSO on five real-world complex networks with different scale, and experimental results demonstrate that when compared with state-of-the-art clustering algorithms, FCAN-MOPSO achieves a better accuracy performance with improved convergence. Hence, FCAN-MOPSO is a promising graph clustering algorithm to precisely and efficiently discover clusters in complex networks.},

However, the performance of existing maglev control strategies for maglev trains may be deteriorated by various challenges, including disregard of the coordination and synchronization between multiple electromagnets, control input unidirectionality, dead zones, saturation, finite-time stability ability, etc. In this article, an adaptive fuzzy-based suspension control method based on a multielectromagnets dynamic coupling model is proposed that can cope with dead-zone and saturation problems and guarantee the finite time of the airgap tracking errors of multiple electromagnets simultaneously. Specifically, a fuzzy-logic system is utilized to compensate for the nonlinear input unidirectionality, dead-zone, saturation, and unmodeled dynamics. Moreover, considering the coupling dynamic characteristics of adjacent electromagnet control modules, a fuzzy-based cooperative suspension controller with adaptive update law is designed. The finite-time stability of the presented control strategy is proven with the Lyapunov method.

  abstract     = {In this article, the problem of the event-triggered optimal control for a class of strict-feedback nonlinear systems with external disturbances is investigated. First, by introducing proper low-pass filters to the steps of backstepping design, the problem of “jump of the error surfaces” is avoided. What is more, it facilitates the design of a fuzzy hybrid-mode-triggered feedforward controller, which aims to transform the original controlled nonlinear strict-feedback system into an equivalent nonlinear system in affine form. Second, by utilizing the adaptive dynamic programming theory, an event-triggered feedback controller is developed for the equivalent affine nonlinear system. Differing from the existing methods, the real control input consists of two event-triggered terms, which can be updated synchronously under the proposed composite error-based triggering condition. Moreover, it is proven that all the closed-loop signals are bounded. At last, by taking a second-order nonlinear system and missile integrated guidance and control system as examples, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

However, most existing algorithms are solely liable for labeled or unlabeled data, whereas a limited portion of real-world data is annotated with labels. In this article, we therefore propose a novel scheme named SemiFREE, i.e., semisupervised feature selection with fuzzy relevance and redundancy. First, both labeled and unlabeled samples are assigned with fuzzy decisions that allow class membership to naturally express the fuzziness or uncertainty in data labeling. Second, sample similarities in feature space and fuzzy decision are captured to induce fuzzy information measures for redefining the feature relevance and redundancy. Finally, adhering to the principle of relevance-maximization and redundancy-minimization, SemiFREE leverages the forward sequential searching strategy to identify qualified features progressively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SemiFREE in the presence of partially labeled data against some other well-established feature selection algorithms.},

To cope with the drawbacks, trapezoidal fuzzy additive reciprocal preference matrices (TFARPMs) are utilized to characterize preference information and addition and subtraction of fuzzy arithmetic are applied to fuzzy numbers. This article introduces formulas to calculate left and right spread indices and imprecision indices of cores and supports for fuzzy elements in a TFARPM. Based on the addition of fuzzy arithmetic, a transitivity equation system with a parameterized trapezoidal fuzzy vector is built and computational formulas are devised to identify values of parameters from imprecision indices of cores and supports of the trapezoidal fuzzy elements in a TFARPM. A fuzzy addition based nonparametric transitivity equation is then established to define additive consistency of TFARPMs. Properties of additively consistent TFARPMs are proposed and an index formula is brought forward to compute additive inconsistency degrees of TFARPMs. A novel approach is presented to generate additively consistent TFARPMs from fuzzy vectors and a new framework is put forward to normalize [0, 1]-valued trapezoidal fuzzy vectors. An absolute deviation based minimization model is developed and converted equivalently into a linear program to acquire normalized trapezoidal fuzzy priority vectors from TFARPMs. A closed-form solution of the minimization model is found to calculate normalized optimal trapezoidal fuzzy priority vectors of additively consistent TFARPMs. Two illustrating examples including a multicriteria decision-making problem are provided to validate the proposed models.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed a drastic surge in graph representation learning, which usually produces low-dimensional and crisp representations from graph topology and high-dimensional node attributes. Nevertheless, a crisp representation of a node or graph actually conceals the uncertainty and interpretability of features. In citation networks, for example, the reference between the two papers is always involved with fuzziness denoting the correlation degrees, that is, one connection may simultaneously belong to strong and weak references in different beliefs. The uncertainty in node connections and attributes inspires us to delve into fuzzy representations. This article, for the first time, proposes an unsupervised fuzzy representation learning model for graphs and networks to improve their expressiveness by making crisp representations fuzzy. Specifically, we develop a fuzzy graph convolution neural network (FGCNN), which could aggregate high-level fuzzy features, leveraging fuzzy logic to fully excavate feature-level uncertainties, and finally generate fuzzy representations. The corresponding hierarchical model composed of multiple FGCNNs, called deep fuzzy graph convolution neural network (DFGCNN), is able to generate fuzzy node representations which are more expressive than crisp ones. Experimental results of multiple network analysis tasks validate that the proposed fuzzy representation models have strong competitiveness against the state-of-the-art baselines over several real-world datasets.},

The connectivity, determined by the limited communication ranges and initial positions of agents, is preserved by incorporating an error transformation. Further, a common Lyapunov function is considered to deal with the switching modes. By combining a reduced fuzzy logic system with Fourier series expansion, a novel approximator is constructed to deal with periodically disturbed nonlinearities and to surmount the difficulty brought by the nonstrict-feedback structure. More importantly, distinctly from the existing finite/fixed-time control strategies where the settling time is heavily dependent on the accurate value of the initial states and control parameters, the settling time of the proposed prescribed-time consensus is completely independent of the initialization and control parameters and can be given a priori only according to actual demands. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, the designed controller ensures that the connectivity-preserving consensus is achieved in prescribed time and all the signals remain bounded in probability. To the end, the feasibility of the proposed consensus protocol is demonstrated by simulation.},

  abstract     = {Most of the existing consensus reaching approaches for group decision-making (GDM) need decisionmakers to reevaluate alternatives multiple times or require additional external interventions, which results in great time and labor consumption. To this end, automatic consensus reaching approaches have been developed to improve effectiveness and efficiency. However, in the existing automatic consensus reaching approaches, preference adjustment willingness (PAW) is overlooked and consistency/consensus thresholds cannot be guaranteed to be reached, which may lead to an unacceptable collective decision. This study proposes a new automatic consensus reaching approach with PAW for GDM. First, under the paradigm of interval information granularity, PAW is formally defined by considering both the amount and sensitivity of preference adjustment. Levels of interval information granularity are adaptively determined by an algorithm with achievement of the consistency threshold. Then, we propose an automatic preference adjustment model where the weighted average of PAW, group consensus, and individual consistency is defined as its performance index. Based on the proposed model and algorithm, a consensus evolution realizing a continuous improvement of consensus is subsequently developed. Finally, the framework of the proposed approach is presented. The applicability of the proposed approach was analyzed through a case study concerning the concept selection of a turbofan engine&#39;s component. Discussions on parameter settings and time-consuming of the approach show its great effectiveness and time efficiency. Comparison with other similar approaches demonstrates that the proposed approach is able to achieve larger consistency and consensus improvement with a smaller preference adjustment amount.},

Second, a less conservative and more general fuzzy dynamic event-triggered strategy (DETS) is proposed to reduce communication consumption and avoid unnecessary continuous signal monitoring. Since the dynamic threshold is closely related to the currently sampled signal and the latest successfully transmitted signal, it can be promptly dynamically adjusted. In addition, on the basis of a reasonable assumption, a novel linear matrix inequality (LMI) relax technique is introduced to deal with the mismatched premise variables between the fuzzy systems and the fuzzy controller. By constructing the appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii candidate functional, the criterion that the SLPSs can asymptotically track the target systems is derived, and the desired dynamic event-triggered control gains can be obtained by solving a set of LMIs. The DETS reduces effectively communication resource consumption. Finally, the control problem of temperature distribution of catalytic rod in practical engineering application is given to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy clustering decomposes data into clusters using partial memberships by exploring the cluster structure information, which demonstrates the comparable performance for knowledge exploitation under the circumstance of information incompleteness. In general, this scheme considers the memberships of objects to cluster centroids and applies to clusters with the spherical distribution. In addition, the noises and outliers may significantly influence the clustering process; a common mitigation measure is the application of separate noise processing algorithms, but this usually introduces multiple parameters, which are challenging to be determined for different data types. This article proposes a new fuzzy-rough intrigued harmonic discrepancy clustering (HDC) algorithm by noting that fuzzy-rough sets offer a higher degree of uncertainty modeling for both vagueness and imprecision present in real-valued datasets. The HDC is implemented by introducing a novel concept of harmonic discrepancy, which effectively indicates the dissimilarity between a data instance and foreign clusters with their distributions fully considered. The proposed HDC is thus featured by a powerful processing ability on complex data distribution leading to enhanced clustering performance, particularly on noisy datasets, without the use of explicit noise handling parameters. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed HDC, which generally outperforms the popular representative clustering algorithms on both synthetic and benchmark datasets, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Label distribution learning (LDL), leveraging the label significance (LS), is more appropriate for solving label ambiguity problems than multilabel learning (MLL). However, directly obtaining the LS of LDL is extremely expensive and challenging. Thus, label enhancement (LE) algorithms are effectively proposed to acquire inherent LS from MLL for training the LDL models. Nevertheless, most existing LE models will suffer from low accuracy and low efficiency with following issues: ignoring mapping relationship between feature and label space, resulting in inaccurate enhanced data; designing independently apart from LDL models, resulting in an inability of unified LE-LDL learning; and requiring to optimize numerous parameters iteratively, resulting in worse training efficiency. Consequently, a novel unified LE-LDL learning framework, namely stacked graph-regularized polynomial-based fuzzy broad learning system (SGP-FBLS), is proposed by following three innovations: polynomial-based fuzzy system is introduced to enhance feature mapping ability while improving the learning performance effectively; graph regularized-based optimization objective function (GP-FBLS) is presented by considering interinstance correlation and label correlation to mine potential LS, thereby improving the accuracy of subsequent LDL tasks; and a weight stacked strategy is innovatively proposed to directly transmit LS and weighted parameters from GP-FBLS to SGP-FBLS without retraining, achieving the most satisfactory performance while significantly improving the training efficiency.

However, this will lose the information corresponding to the remaining scale fuzzy granules, which will affect the classification results or learning tasks. Inspired by this, multiscale fuzzy entropy is defined to fuse the granule information at different scales, and applied to feature selection.

Moreover, the unknown nonlinearities, actuator faults and disturbances can be reconstructed by the designed adaptive mechanism, where the switching problem of sliding surfaces in sliding-mode observers can be avoided. Finally, a circuit system example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the fault reconstruction scheme.},

  abstract     = {Due to the existence of strong nonlinearity and external disturbances, the controller design of complex nonlinear systems is a challenging problem. Therefore, it is necessary to design an effective robust predictive controller for this issue. In this article, based on a fuzzy neural network, an iterative learning model predictive control (FNN-ILMPC) is designed for complex nonlinear systems. First, a dynamic linearization technique is used to establish a data-driven model, which only relies on input and output data. Since the established model contains an unknown disturbance term that may have an impact on the control performance, an FNN is used to evaluate the disturbance so that the uncertainty of the system is captured. Subsequently, based on the above data-driven model, an FNN-ILMPC strategy, considering the impact of external disturbances, is developed to eliminate the influence of disturbances. Then, it is proved that the designed controller can make both modeling error and tracking error decrease gradually and ensure the closed-loop system stability. Finally, the experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the designed controller.},

First, a fixed-time controller based on a backstepping control is designed and its disadvantages are analyzed.

In addition, the tracking errors of the system will be practically convergent within a fixed-time, which provides additional system information in advance.

Without loss of generality, we consider FDES with constraints where a FDES is modeled by a fuzzy automaton. Sequences of events that can be generated by the system are regarded as constraints and are modeled by a crisp automaton. A supervisor is designed to control the FDES so that the supervised system is prevented from entering a prespecified set of illegal/unsafe fuzzy states. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a supervisor is obtained. When the condition is satisfied, an online supervisor can be designed. Fuzzy state estimation problem is first solved, as the supervisor is fuzzy-state-estimate-based. A method is developed to estimate fuzzy state iteratively after observation of each new event. We show that the supervisor so developed ensures the safety of the system and is least restrictive among all possible safe supervisors.

In order to avoid continuous transmission and reduce the communication burden in the closed-loop system, an event-triggered mechanism is introduced such that the control signal is updated only at a specific instant when a triggered condition is violated. By virtue of the disturbance observer and state observer, an output-feedback ADP control approach then is developed, where only a critic network is employed to estimate the value function.

  abstract     = {Intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) set theory combined with twin support vector machines (TSVM) has shown highly advantageous performance in robust and fast classification. However, the existing methods have some inherent flaws: 1) The inaccurate confidence caused by the single-center-based IF strategy degrades the classification performance of the model. 2) The nonmembership degree is time-consuming and the threshold is difficult to determine, as it depends on sample&#39;s local neighborhood set. 3) Recent theoretical studies have demonstrated that optimizing the margin distribution achieve better generalization performance than maximizing the minimum margin in SVM-based models (SVMs). In view of the aforementioned shortcomings, we propose a novel dual-center-based IF (DC-IF) function, and introduce the margin distribution into IFTSVM, forming a DC-IF twin bounded large margin distribution machines (DC-IFTBLDM). Initially, the DC-IF strategy references the contribution of one sample to both categories, which is time efficient and more accurately reflects the credibility of the samples. Moreover, the margin mean and variance are used to optimize the margin distribution, and a regularization term is utilized to minimize structural risk. Therefore, DC-IFTBLDM has a good performance in noise immunity and classification capability. Comparative experiments based on synthetic datasets, UCI benchmark datasets, and datasets with different noise ratios verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The parameter sensitivity analysis further proves the high accuracy and stability of DC-IFTBLDM.},

To analyze the influence of immediate predecessor operations on machine tool manufacturing workshops, four forms of immediate predecessor operations with the consideration of uncertain transportation and preparation time are defined. Then, the four forms of immediate predecessor operations are integrated into the FJSP, and a multiobjective FJSP is constructed. An improved optimal foraging algorithm (OFA) and Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) are combined to establish a multiobjective optimization algorithm, named PFSOFA. This algorithm is then used to solve the multiobjective FJSP. In PFSOFA, the Pareto fronts are mapped into PFSs. The Pythagorean fuzzy numbers (PFNs) in a PFS are transformed into right triangles, and the distances between the PFNs and the reference PFNs are defined as the distances between their right triangle centroids. Then, all distances of a PFS are integrated by the distance prospect function to obtain a distance prospect value. This value is then used to lead the iteration of PFSOFA. Through extensive experiments, including a real factory application case, the performance of PFSOFA is verified to be better than four classical multiobjective optimization algorithms for solving the multiobjective FJSP constructed in this article. And for the factory case, PFSOFA also obtained the better schemes.},

Of the various post-hoc explainability approaches, rule extraction methods assist to understand the logic that underpins their functioning. Whereas the rule-based solutions are directly managed and understood by practitioners, the use of intervals or crisp values in the antecedents that rely on numerical values might not be intuitive enough. In this case, the benefits of a linguistic representation based on fuzzy sets/rules are straightforward, as these semantically meaningful components ease the model understanding. This article proposes fuzzy rule-based explainer systems for deep neural networks. The algorithm learns a compact yet accurate set of fuzzy rules based on features&#39; importance (i.e., attribution values) distilled from the trained networks. These systems can be used for both local and global explainability purposes.

First, based on the Tagaki-Sugeno fuzzy modeling method, a unified switched system model is established for the positioning control of nonlinear UMV systems with actuator saturation, multiplicative gain uncertainties, external disturbance, and hybrid attacks. Then, by resorting to introducing the integral-type state error, a novel adaptive memory-based event-triggered mechanism is proposed to lighten the communication load in UMV systems. Furthermore, a sufficient criterion is proposed to make the mean square exponential stability of UMV systems with a nonweighted $L_{2}$ -gain level be guaranteed, and gain parameters of the designed controller and observer are also solved efficiently. Finally, the simulation example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed nonfragile control strategy.},

The social trust network (STN), a typical SN, is considered the basis of interaction for experts. Therefore, in the STN environment, an STN-driven consensus decision framework of multiattribute group decision making is developed. First, a two-stage analysis method of STN completeness considering the social psychology of experts is proposed to obtain a complete STN, which includes the processes of trust propagation and aggregation. Second, based on the complete modified STN, an STN-driven consensus-reaching process is presented with a consensus optimization model aiming at minimum adjustments. In addition, a numerical example is used to further elaborate on the applicability of these methods. Finally, a series of simulation experiments are designed to objectively determine the parameters in the proposed methods and highlight the rationality and superiority of the proposed methods by comparisons and discussions with related studies.},

However, the impact of intricately overlapped social trust relationships within overlapping communities on evaluation modifications in the SN-GDM consensus reaching process is seldom considered. To alleviate this issue, this study attempts to construct an overlapping community-driven feedback mechanism for improving consensus in SN-GDM. The Lancichinetti–Fortunato method is used to detect the overlapping community structures under social trust networks. Subsequently, the trusted recommendation advice is conducted within overlapping communities, which guides the inconsistent subgroups to make an interaction with each other to reach higher consensus level. Then, an associated feedback mechanism for SN-GDM with overlapping communities is proposed, which enables the inconsistent subgroups to minimize the consensus cost by selecting personalized feedback parameters. Moreover, it shows that the overlapping communities based feedback mechanism is superior to the feedback mechanisms with nonoverlapping communities. Finally, an illustrative example is included, which is also used to testify the efficacy of proposal by comparing the consensus cost under different representative recommendation advice in overlapping social trust networks.},

Then, a novel partial differential inequality is proposed to handle the spatial diffusions, which relaxes the restriction for symmetric around the origin of the bounded spatial domain. To stabilize FSCNNs within a finite time, a novel control strategy without delay-dependent terms is established. Moreover, different from the existing works, a more succinct Lyapunov functional is constructed, which does not need to include multiple integral type functional terms to eliminate the influence of the hybrid delays. By virtue of the comparison method and inequality techniques, several sufficient criteria are deduced to guarantee the finite-time stabilization of FSCNNs.

To avoid the increase of the number of state variables caused by reduced-order method, nonreduced order approach is utilized fully, and a fuzzy exponential gain event-triggered controller is designed so as to occupy the less communication resources. Then, by establishing a novel Lyapunov functional well handling the high-order term, a new synchronization condition is derived under static event-triggered scheme. And then, to further reduce the number of triggers, a dynamic event-triggered condition is developed and the corresponding sufficient criterion is given. Meanwhile, it is proved that the lower bound of event intervals are nonzero positive and the Zeno phenomenons do not exist via rigorous mathematical derivation.

For this purpose, initially to conquer this obstacle regarding the output constraint, a barrier Lyapunov function is developed to keep the output variable within the predefined constraint during operation. Then, the unknown functional bounds of uncertainties in the considered system are modeled by invoking fuzzy logic systems. With the integrated use of adaptive fuzzy control and backstepping-like techniques, a novel protocol for the fixed-time HOSM control with asymmetric output constraints is developed. Through the strictly theoretical clarification, the HOSM is fixed time established under the suggested control strategy.

However, there is few work to fuse multisource information from the perspective of possibility distribution (PD) and use IQ as the evaluation criteria for feature selection. The PD is one of important concepts in the possibility theory, which is a generally acknowledged method for describing a kind of uncertain knowledge. In this article, we propose a novel representation model of PDs based on FMs, namely, a possibility distribution information system (PDIS). Then, several IQ measures are defined in the PDIS, including Gini entropy, compatibility, conflict, credibility, and separability degrees. In view of this, a minimal-separability-minimal-uncertainty-based unsupervised feature selection algorithm (UmSMU) is designed. The proposed UmSMU can sufficiently fuse multiple possibilistic information. Meanwhile, the selected features maintain as much information as possible while minimizing the uncertainty of information. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs well, especially when it comes to selecting fewer features and improving performance.},

It is noted that the injected false data may result in the system state to exceed the modeling domain. In order to handle the above phenomenon, a reconstruction method of the controller&#39;s membership functions (MFs) is proposed via analyzing the variation range of the attacked state, and then, a feasible IT2 fuzzy sliding mode security controller is designed. The explicit relation between the raw state signal and attacked state is established, based on which stability conditions dependent on the regional boundaries of MFs are obtained for the input-to-state stability in probability of the closed-loop system. Meanwhile, a framework of security performance optimization is established via searching a desirable sliding matrix, which may be solved via the particle swarm optimization algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed security control scheme is extended to imperfectly matched MFs case, where the controller does not demand the same fuzzy rules as the controlled fuzzy system.

Furthermore, when subjected to abnormal interference, measurement outputs result in measurement outliers. In order to mitigate the negative effects on the estimation error, a state estimator scheme is presented by introducing a saturation function. By using an appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and with the help of a free-weighting matrix, sufficient conditions can be deduced to guarantee the asymptotical stability and prescribed $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance index of the disturbance attenuation of the estimation error. Next, a design strategy of an outlier-resistant nonfragile state estimator is put forward by employing some decoupling techniques.

To overcome the difficulty that the virtual control signals are discontinuous due to the state-triggering, the virtual controllers are designed with the continuous sampling states signals, and the actual optimal controller is redesigned by using the triggered states in the last step. Furthermore, the proposed ETOC in this article has significant advantages in terms of saving network resources because the event-triggered mechanism is employed in the sensor-to-controller channel and the event-sampled states are utilized to directly activate the control actions.

  abstract     = {Fuzzy C-means (FCM) is a kind of classic cluster method, which has been widely used in various fields, such as image segmentation and data mining. Euclidean distance is a frequently used distance metric in FCM, but it is only suitable for data with spherical structure. As an extension of Euclidean distance, Mahalanobis distance has been used in Gustafson–Kessel FCM and its variants to tackle ellipsoidal data. For the convenience of optimizing, most existing Mahalanobis distance-based FCM algorithms only focus on squared Mahalanobis distance. However, squared Mahalanobis distance may not be the best distance metric for FCM because it is easy to enlarge the influence of outliers. In this article, we propose a novel $\ell _{2,p}$ -norm and Mahalanobis distance-based FCM model, abbreviated as LM-FCM, which can help FCM improve the ability of tackling ellipsoidal clusters and outliers. Then, in order to reduce computational complexity, we propose a more simplified model, abbreviated as SLM-FCM. Furthermore, we develop an iteratively reweighted optimization algorithm to optimize the proposed models and provide a rigorous monotonous convergence proof. Finally, compared with the existing state-of-the-art FCM algorithms, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to manifest the superior clustering performance and robustness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Choosing adequate sampling frequencies in sensors has a considerably positive impact on the two time scale fuzzy logic controller design. Motivated by this concept, this article addresses the fuzzy-parallel distribution compensation (PDC)-based control synthesis for a singularly perturbed nonlinear systems (SPNS) under a nonperiodic multirate sampling mechanism, which also provides guidance on the reasonable choice of maximum allowable sampling time intervals (MASTIs) for multirate sensors. First, the sampled SPNS is converted into a continuous-time Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy singularly perturbed model (TSFSPM) with slow and fast time-varying delays. Then, an $\epsilon$ -dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional of order $n$ is proposed to derive the sufficient conditions for stabilizing a multirate sampled TSFSPM under a two time scale PDC control. Given the slow MASTI, an efficient linear-matrix-inequality-based design is proposed to recast the $\epsilon$ -dependent stabilization conditions as a set of $\epsilon$ -independent linear matrix inequalities that are easily solved. On this basis, the upper bound of singular perturbation parameter $\epsilon$ , i.e., $\epsilon ^*$ , should be determined to compute the fast MASTI for the possibly slow sampling of fast states. The optimal match of $(\epsilon ^*,n)$ is detected for a tradeoff among the closed-loop stability, the controller performance, and the sensor cost. The superiority of the obtained results is shown in an example of a flexible joint inverted pendulum system.},

In this study, we propose a novel and systematic design methodology of fuzzy design rule-based models completed in the following privacy-driven environment. Multidimensional data are available for model design in two different formats: those attributes that are privacy sensitive are provided at the higher nonnumeric level of abstraction represented in the form of information granules, while the remaining ones are available directly. It is shown that the granular manifestation of data becomes beneficial in the formation of the conditions of the rules, whereas numeric attributes are available for the construction of the conclusions of the rules. The generic development scheme is discussed. Some generalization is introduced to cope with a number of data islands associated with the corresponding data owners. It is shown that the formation of the data structure calls for a mechanism of collaborative clustering. A way of handling information granules at different levels of information granularity is discussed. Some illustrative examples are presented.},

  abstract     = {In multilabel learning, research on label correlation provides an effective solution to compress the hypothesis space of classifiers. However, this article focus on the label correlation adapted to overall data, while ignoring the locally targeted information presented by some instances. The lack exploration on the distribution of local label correlation in multilabel instance space undoubtedly limits the in-depth application of label correlation in multilabel learning. Based on the fuzzy rough set theory, the instance-level label correlation distribution is first proposed in this article and applied to design a novel multilabel learner. For each multilabel instance, the local importance of features to label is quantitatively analyzed, by considering the decisive influence of input information on decision making. According to coincidence degree between local feature weight distribution for different labels, the instance-level label correlation is constructed. In order to reflect the internal relationship between label variables objectively, the instance-level label correlation distribution is integrated into the empirical label relevance. On the basis, the label relevance matrix is used to define the constraints of the optimization function in a new form. The relative position of subseparating hyperplanes in input space is quantitatively characterized to reduce the complexity of the multilabel classifier and improve the learning performance. The experiment results on 18 multilabel datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. The impact of core parameters on the performance is also dissected.},

First, a probabilistic linguistic attribute weight determination method is developed that considers probabilistic linguistic information entropies and the weighted total deviation of all objects from the negative ideal solution (NIS). Then, a new group satisfaction index is designed to replace the utility function in RT, which overcomes the limitation of the RT calculation in PLTSs. Second, the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm is extended to PLTSs for obtaining equivalent objects under different clusters and calculate conditional probabilities in corresponding TWD models, which makes up for the shortage of the PLTS evaluation matrix when dividing equivalence classes. Third, RT is introduced into PLTSs to rank objects according to utility perception values. At the same time, a new TWD model constructed by average utility perception values is used to realize object domains in probabilistic linguistic environments. Finally, the proposed method is applied to realistic cases, and the effectiveness and superiority of the PL-TWDR method are verified via comparative analysis and sensitivity analysis in terms of other nine popular decision-making methods.},

  abstract     = {The three-way decision theory provides a three-way philosophical thinking to solve problems, and the regret theory quantifies the risk preferences of decision makers under different psychological behaviors. On the one hand, the combination of these two theories makes models more practical by considering the psychological behaviors of decision makers. On the other hand, we can effectively combine the advantages of the three-way decision theory with the regret theory to highlight the interpretability of decision-making processes. In this article, we propose a novel approximate estimation method for incomplete utility values via the regret theory and establish a wide sense of a three-way decision model on incomplete multiscale decision information systems. First, the degree of consistency for each scale is measured via using the dependence degree, then the optimal subsystem is selected by evaluating the scale selection cost. Furthermore, the incomplete multiscale evaluation information is transformed into triangular fuzzy numbers via linguistic term sets. Second, in light of fuzzy evaluation values and tradeoff factors, an estimation method for incomplete fuzzy subsystems is constructed, which can be used to calculate the utility difference and regret-rejoicing values for pairwise comparisons. Finally, from the perspective of human cognition, the tripartition and the corresponding decision rules are built by the tolerance degree, and the ranking of objects is calculated by the relative closeness degree. Additionally, multiaspect comparative and experimental analyses are performed by extensive experiments, and the feasibility, validity, and stability of the constructed model are shown by parametric analyses.},

Second, an improved DET mechanism (DETM) is proposed to reduce the communication burden. Contrasting with existing works, by introducing two adjustable parameters into the novel DETM, the presented DETM has more flexibility in adjusting the data packet transmissions to conserve more limited network resources. Meanwhile, the Zeno behavior is probably excluded under the proposed DETM while preserving the system performance. Third, imperfectly matched membership functions (MFs) are considered between fuzzy controller and IT2 fuzzy model, and the global boundary information of MFs and slack matrices are introduced to relax stability conditions. Besides, by constructing a proper Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the exponentially mean-square stable of the IT2 fuzzy systems with the $H_{\infty }$ performance.

  abstract     = {It is known that a controller designed via backstepping contains all virtual control signals constructed at the previous design steps. When this controller is used to generate an event-triggered control signal which is discontinuous, those virtual control signals are simultaneously triggered and the corresponding triggered virtual signals are utilized for the real control operation, they are also discontinuous. This fact results in the noncontinuity of the virtual error dynamics. This problem is ignored in the existing backstepping-based event-triggered control schemes, in which control design and stability analysis are implemented according to the continuous virtual error dynamics, namely, all the virtual control signals are required to be continuous. Based on this observation, this article focuses on the backstepping-based event-triggered fuzzy adaptive control for nonlinear strict-feedback systems with unavailable states. To do so, a concurrent event generator is first introduced, furthermore, the backstepping-based output feedback control design is given according to the discontinuous virtual error dynamics. Then, the Lyapunov approach for nonlinear impulsive systems is used to provide the closed-loop performance analysis. The results show that with the event-based fuzzy adaptive controller, all the closed-loop signals meet bounded requirements and the Zeno phenomenon is prevented.

  abstract     = {To manage consensus in opinion dynamics models (ODMs), removing bias from agents&#39; interactions and considering their willingness are critical. It can be accomplished by providing a secure mechanism that does not disclose agents&#39; identities and opinions in their interactions, eliminating the impact of opinion similarity on trust building. To build trust and consensus opinion, we propose a linguistic ODM based on the Blockchain technology. This model allows agents&#39; opinions to be expressed using Z -numbers, as opposed to regular ODMs with numerical opinions. Agents are encouraged to modify their initial opinions in response to a minimum cost consensus model. Willingness of agents to accept or refuse the suggested modifications is realized through a Blockchain regime to avoid bias. The regime, however, must be supported by a trust-building mechanism to persuade agents to alter their opinions. To this end, we propose a Blockchain-enabled trust-building mechanism to improve agents&#39; trust and guide them toward a consensus opinion. Following a sensitivity analysis of the underlying assumptions in the developed model, the proposed ODM is tested for its efficiency and validity.},

Combining fuzzy logic systems with the adding on power integrator technique, an adaptive approximation policy is introduced to handle the system uncertainties.

The median value theorem provides help to solve this problem and an asymmetric state-triggering strategy is presented. In addition, it is proved that the closed-loop signals are input-to-state stable, and the sampling error and tracking error are bounded. Then, a general self-triggered tracking control scheme is presented. In order to compare the control performance of different triggering mechanisms, fuzzy observer and logarithmic barrier Lyapunov function are selected also, and the scheme is designed under the framework of backstepping method.

  abstract     = {Noisy image segmentation using fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) algorithm is an important direction in the field of image segmentation, among which FCM using local information or nonlocal information constraints has made some progress. However, as the noise density increases, the local information cannot restore the real image. The nonlocal information-based segmentation method overly retains the noise and thus produces false edges resulting in the degradation of image segmentation accuracy (SA). To address these problems, this article uses regional and local information to develop an adaptive FCM image segmentation algorithm. First, the regional information and local information are obtained by the regional information filtering method and the local information filtering method. Then, the weighted image is constructed in a certain way. Second, to make the objective function adaptively adjust the constraint ratio of the original image and the weighted image pixel by pixel, the degree of constraint is adaptively changed by using the difference between them as the coefficients of both through certain transformation. Finally, to speed up the convergence of the objective function, we add the number of clustering samples to the denominator of the objective function by certain transformations to reduce the number of iterations of the objective function. The proposed algorithm achieves more than 90\% in image SA and mean Intersection-over-Union through synthetic and real-world image tests and acquires good performance in other indexes.},

The uncertainty in the system is (possibly fast) time-varying but lies in the fuzzy set. First, a machine-electric coupled state-space equation that can accurately describe the state transition of the system is established by considering the assembly relationship among components. Second, inequality constraints are proposed to reduce the range of steady-state error fluctuations. By constraint reorganization, a new system containing only equality constraints is constructed to replace the original system. The control problem for systems with inequality constraints is solved. Third, fuzzy set theory is used to characterize the “fuzzy” features of the uncertainty in the system more accurately, and robust control with parameters to be determined is proposed. The optimal control parameter is selected by establishing and minimizing a fuzzy performance index, which weighs the effectiveness and cost of control. Thus, the contradiction between short time and high precision control performance due to the fast movement of the tank is solved.

Therefore, this article considers the exponential stabilization almost surely (ES a.s.) for a class of Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy systems with delay and stochastic switching by designing a novel mode-dependent event-triggered output control. It is assumed that only the measured output can be utilized in designing the controller and complete actuator faults occur in some modes. Periodic sampling is utilized to avoid the Zeno phenomenon. Combining the sampling interval with delay-partitioning method, a fuzzy Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) is designed on the basis of the derivative of the membership functions to obtain less conservative results. Especially, the increment coefficient of the multiple LKF at switching instant is smaller than one. The maximum feasible value of the sampling interval is derived and the control gains are designed by solving linear matrix inequalities. Our results show that the ES a.s. is ensured though some modes are not controlled. Numerical simulations demonstrate the merits of the theoretical analysis. It is significant to find by numerical simulations that the time delay cannot be divided into too small values though the delay-partitioning method is effective in reducing the conservativeness.},

In the first place, based on the approximation characteristic of fuzzy logic systems (FLSs), a fuzzy state observer is designed to estimate the immeasurable state variables in the controlled system. Next, under the framework of adaptive backstepping control technology, FLSs are selected not only to approximate unknown nonlinear functions but also to avoid the algebraic loop problem caused by nonstrict feedback structure. At the same time, asymmetric Barrier Lyapunov functions are selected to solve the problem that system states are subject to function constraints, which are related to states and time. Then, Lyapunov stability theory is utilized to prove the stability of the controlled system, the realizability of function constraints, and the convergence of output tracking errors. Finally, a simulation is given to check the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

Some Takagi–Sugeno type if–then f uzzy rules are also introduced into the CMNNs. An event-triggered controller (ETC) is designed to achieve the MS in finite time, which avoids continuous control signals. Along with Lyapunov theory, differential inclusion theory, and inequalities, some criteria can be obtained to achieve the finite-time MS (FTMS), and the setting time (ST) of the FTMS can be calculated. By jointly considering ST, control inputs, error networks, and synchronization conditions, an optimization model is provided to get an optimal ETC (OETC). Further, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is utilized to solve the optimization model. Thus, it gives a method to choose control gains and parameters of an event-triggered function. Finally, two examples are given to verify the theoretical results. Especially, two comparative experiments are proposed to demonstrate that the OETC can save more control energy and reduce the number of triggered times.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning methods have achieved an excellent performance in medical image segmentation. However, the practical application of deep learning-based segmentation models is limited in clinical settings due to the lack of reliable information about the segmentation quality. In this article, we propose a novel quality control algorithm based on fuzzy uncertainty to quantify the quality of the predicted segmentation results as part of the model inference process. First, test-time augmentation and Monte Carlo dropout are applied simultaneously to capture both the data and model uncertainties of the trained image segmentation model. Then, a fuzzy set is generated to describe the captured uncertainty with the assistance of the linear Euclidean distance transform algorithm. Finally, the fuzziness of the generated fuzzy set is adopted to calculate an image-level segmentation uncertainty and, therefore, to infer the segmentation quality. Extensive experiments using five medical image segmentation applications on the detection of skin lesion, nuclei, lung, breast, and cell are conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the estimated image-level uncertainties using the proposed method have strong correlations with the segmentation qualities measured by the Dice coefficient, resulting in absolute Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.60–0.92. Our method outperforms other five state-of-the-art quality control methods in classifying the segmentation results into good and poor quality groups (area under the receiver operating curve of greater than 0.92, while other methods are below 0.85).},

A cost function based on the tracking error derivative is used. It not only solves the problem that the traditional input quadratic cost function at the infinite time is unbounded, but also solves the problem that the optimal control input derived from the cost function with exponential discount factor cannot make the error asymptotically stable. Considering the case where the states are unmeasurable, a fuzzy state observer is designed that removes the restriction of the Hurwitz equation for the gain parameters. Based on reinforcement learning, the observer, and error derivative cost function, an improved optimized backstepping control method is given. Using observed information and actor-critic structure to train fuzzy logic systems online, the control inputs are obtained to achieve approximate optimal control.

We propose a unified finite-time tunnel prescribed performance (FTPP), which not only provides more tight allowable set leading to smaller overshoot, but also drives the tracking error into the prescribed set within a known time. To remove the implicit assumption that both input and performance constraints need to be satisfied simultaneously, an auxiliary system is developed to establish a balance between these two constraints instead of ignoring their interconnection and conflict. With aid of its generated nonnegative signals, the developed saturation-tolerant prescribed performance (SPP) possesses flexible performance. Namely, SPP can temporarily enlarge the performance boundaries to guarantee both constraints when input saturation occurs, and fast recover back to the prescribed boundaries when input saturation disappears. Consequently, a low-complexity SPC for uncertain nonlinear systems is developed, which can always guarantee both input and performance constraints even under unknown time delay and unknown control directions. Finally, comparative simulation is provided to illustrate the merits of the presented control strategy.},

FLSs are used to approximate the unknown disturbances to enhance system robustness. To deal with the switching topologies of MAS, a reconstructing mechanism using a novel piecewise differentiable function is first proposed for the state and consensus errors of agents, which renders the state and consensus errors zero at each switching time instant and facilitates to the control design based on barrier functions, against the unexpected controller action at switching time instant. Incorporating with this reconstructing mechanism, a novel distributed controllers is designed, which is featured with low-complexity structure, fully distributed manner, and adaptively reconstructing ability. These technical attempts contribute to some new results. First, the global consensus of MAS with switching directed topologies and unknown nonlinearities is first achieved. Second, the consensus errors can be explicitly regulated to a prespecified arbitrary small residual set in the sense that the range of the set is the predefined functions given by designer.

More specifically, for the sampled data, the design of each model is carried out in a standard way as commonly encountered in the case of Takagi–Sugeno (TS) rule-based models and next augmented by gradient boosting. The aggregation is realized by optimizing a weighting scheme applied to the results of the individual models. Our intent is also to carefully demonstrate the performance offered by the mechanisms of machine learning applied in the setting of rule-based models, which is an original task completed before. A number of high-dimensional data are used in the experimental studies to complete a thorough assessment.

To improve a PSO&#39;s performance on complicated multimodal functions, various selection strategies based on the fitness value are introduced in PSO community. However, the inherent defects of the fitness-based selections still remain. In this article, a novelty of a particle is treated as an additional criterion when choosing exemplars for a particle. In each generation, a few of elites and mavericks who have better fitness and novelty values are selected, and saved in two archives, respectively. Hence, in each generation, a particle randomly selects its own learning exemplars from the two archives, respectively. To strengthen a particle&#39;s adaptive capability, a multiple-input multiple-output fuzzy logic controller is used to adjust two parameters of the particle, i.e., an acceleration coefficient and a selection proportion of elites. The experimental results and comparisons between our new proposed PSO, named as MFCPSO in this article, and other six PSO variants on CEC2017 test suite with four different dimension cases suggest that MFCPSO exhibits very promising characteristics on different types of functions, especially on large scale complicated functions.

Recently, bisimulations have been introduced to fuzzy transition systems (FTSs) and developed quickly. Relational lifting by using weight functions is one of the most used methods in bisimulation research, which lifts a crisp relation on the state spaces to a crisp relation on the distributions of state spaces of FTSs. This article proposes a method, called fuzzy relational lifting method, via fuzzy similarity measures induced by residua (implications) in complete residuated lattices. In contrast with the existing method, fuzzy relational lifting method relaxes the conditions of lifting relation by using weight functions and is a generalization of the method. Some properties of fuzzy lifting operation are presented. Based on the fuzzy lifting operation, a fuzzy bisimulation for nondeterministic fuzzy transition systems is introduced, which is much more natural and robust than some behavioral measures, and can measure the degree of similarity between any two states, which are deemed to be equivalent intuitively but simply distinguished by other behavioral measures. Then some properties of fuzzy bisimulations are provided. Moreover, a fixed-point characterization of fuzzy bisimulations is given and the greatest fuzzy bisimulation is computed. Finally, a real-valued logic is introduced to characterize fuzzy bisimulations over Gödel algebra.},

Reaching consensus in linguistic group decision making (GDM) requires understanding the overconfidence behaviors exhibited by DMs and implementing effective management. However, owing to the differences in individual expression and understanding, the management of the overconfidence behaviors of DMs must effectively handle heterogeneous preference information and personalized individual semantics (PIS). To solve this problem, this article manages overconfidence behaviors exhibited by DMs in linguistic GDM by considering PIS and multiple self-confidence levels. Specifically, DMs utilize flexible linguistic representation models to provide preference values over alternatives and corresponding self-confidence levels, thereby generating heterogeneous preference relations (HPRs) with self-confidence (PRs–SC). We then integrate HPRs into unified linguistic distribution expressions. In addition, we transform linguistic PRs–SC into additive PRs–SC using a PIS model. We detect and manage individuals’ overconfidence behaviors to decrease the negatively impact of overconfidence on consensus efficiency and the decision quality. Subsequently, DMs’ preference values and SC levels are utilized to generate modification suggestions to achieve a consensus. Finally, we use a loan selection on a peer-to-peer lending platform as an example to illustrate and demonstrate the usability, effectiveness, and feasibility of our model through a simulation and comparative analysis.},

For a typical hesitant fuzzy set, this set of membership degrees has a finite number of values. One of the motivations to introduce score functions was to rank alternatives. In this case, as the membership degrees are a set, the comparison of membership values does not lead, in general, to a total order. Score functions can be seen as functions that transform the set of membership degrees into a single membership value. In this way, we can construct the total order. In this article, we propose a general framework to define score functions for hesitant fuzzy sets based on fuzzy integrals. This framework permits to see most relevant indices as particular cases. Moreover, previous approaches focused on typical hesitant fuzzy sets. Our approach is more general in the sense that we can process both typical hesitant fuzzy sets and the nontypical ones (with membership values that are not finite). We also frame the problem into a more general setting. That is, the problem of hesitant fuzzy set transformation. Score functions can be seen as functions that transform a hesitant fuzzy set into a standard fuzzy set. Similarly, we can consider its transformation to interval-valued fuzzy sets and type-2 fuzzy sets. Aggregation functions can also be used for the same purpose.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose an efficient Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy zeroing neural network (TS-FZNN) activated by a new activation function for solving the time-varying Sylvester equation. The self-adaptive convergence parameter is designed by the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy logic system. Convergence and robustness of the proposed model are analyzed. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed model not only has less fixed convergence time than the recently suggested ZNN models, but also is noise-tolerant. Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate its efficiency and effectiveness as well as the superior performance over the existing ZNN models for solving the time-varying Sylvester equation, including the applicability of the proposed model to robot manipulator. The effects of model parameters on the dynamic response of the robotic manipulator system are also illustrated by the convergence rate of position errors of the robotic manipulator trajectory.},

An interval type-2 fuzzy model with partially known transition probability matrix is used to capture the underlying nonlinearities and a hidden Markov model with an incomplete conditional probability matrix is employed to describe the possible asynchronous phenomenon between the plant and the tracking controller. A multiple-event-triggered methodology involving two adaptive event-triggered schemes for the actuator channel and the sensor channel is proposed. By using the Lyapunov and dissipativity theory, sufficient conditions for the desired tracking controller are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities.

First, human motion is predicted by utilizing Gaussian mixture regression. Second, the motion planning of an online robot is performed such that the robot can appropriately react to a human coworker while executing a task. In our proposed framework, the predicted human motion is transferred to a virtual force acting on a robot&#39;s end effector. Its initial trajectory is modified so as to avoid any collisions with the human. To obtain a smooth, collision-free, and energy-minimized trajectory, a constrained optimization problem is formulated. A neural dynamics optimization algorithm is then adopted to solve it. Third, an adaptive fuzzy controller is proposed to track the robot&#39;s desired trajectory with uncertain dynamics parameters. We provide the rigorous proof of stability for the proposed methods. The physical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed collaborative strategy.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy type-2 modeling techniques are increasingly being used to model uncertain dynamical systems. However, some challenges arise when applying the existing techniques. These are the following: 1) a large number of rules are required to complete cover the whole input space; 2) a large number of parameters associated with type-2 membership functions have to be determined; 3) the identified fuzzy model is usually difficult to interpret due to the large number of rules; and 4) designing a fuzzy type-2 controller using these models is a computationally expensive task. To overcome these limitations, a procedure is proposed here to identify the fuzzy type-2 model directly from the data. This model is called the distending-function-based fuzzy inference system (DFIS). This model consists of rules and interval type-2 distending functions. First, a few key rules are identified from the data, and later, more rules are added until the error is less than the threshold. The proposed procedure is used to model the altitude controller of a quadcopter. The performance of the DFIS model is compared with that of various fuzzy models. Furthermore, a simplified procedure based on the rules is presented to design a computationally low-cost type-2 controller. The effectiveness of the controller is shown by regulating the height of a quadcopter in the presence of noisy sensory data. The performance of this controller is compared with that of various other controllers. Finally, the proposed type-2 controller was implemented on a Parrot Mambo quadcopter to demonstrate its real-time performance.},

An ingenious adaptation law is developed to co-design the control law and the ET rule, thereby effectively compensating the sampling error caused by the ET rule under unknown control directions. Based on the presented adaptation law and the Nussbaum gain technique, a novel ET fuzzy tracking control strategy is proposed, which can handle the situations with and without state constraints in a unified way without readjusting the control scheme. Subsequently, the nonlinear transformed function is extended to the time-varying state constraints, and the corresponding ET fuzzy control scheme is also modified to guarantee the closed-loop boundedness. The proposed two control strategies guarantee the satisfactory tracking performance, avoid the violation of the prescribed state constraints, and decrease the communication load effectively.

The central idea is to build a mathematically equivalent bridge between a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a fully interpretable first-order TSK fuzzy system called FIMG-TSK, with the help of Gaussian-mixture&#39;s mean. The resultant FIMG-TSK has a simple expected output expression without summation-to-one defuzzification, which will be helpful in inducing both smaller output variance and a negative entropic and rule-stability-based regularizer for enhancing the generalization performance. After revealing three factors affecting the output stability of FIMG-TSK, the negative entropic and rule-stability-based regularizer is designed through both these factors and the squared entropy to make the output variance of FIMG-TSK as small as possible. Accordingly, a novel training method, whose objective function takes the proposed regularizer as an additional term and hence compromises both accuracy and output stability of FIMG-TSK, is developed to quickly provide an analytical solution to the weight of each rule. The effectiveness of the proposed training method is manifested by the experimental results on ten regression datasets.},

In this study, we develop a novel PML model with fuzzy neighborhood-based ball clustering and kernel extreme learning machine (KELM). To reduce the interference from noise, ball k -means clustering is introduced to preprocess partial multilabel data and initialize ball clustering. A new ball clustering model based on fuzzy neighborhood is first designed to address partial multilabel systems. The particle-ball fusion strategy is developed to merge the particle balls reasonably, and the fuzzy membership function and label enhancement are studied for the subsequent training process. Then novel KELM with feature transformation matrix of training data is produced to analyze the nonlinear relationships among features. Finally, a nonsmooth convex objective function with the regression model is constructed to analyze the complex nonlinear relationships among features, and the optimal solutions of three objective parameters are solved by accelerated proximal gradient optimization. Experiments on 14 datasets reveal the effectiveness of the developed algorithm.},

For authority allocation strategy of considered LKC system, designed practical and easily-to-implement cooperative allocation factor (CAF) is adaptively adjusted by the correlation characteristics between buffered interested states for the first time. For derived fuzzy model of networked LKC system with time-varying CAF and path tracking velocity, a new security-based resilient event-triggered output feedback control with communication scheme consisting of adaptive adjusted auxiliary variable and attack-induced random but bounded uncertainty is proposed to reduce communication burden when free of attacks and simultaneously release necessary data for stability maintenance at the cost of predefined allowable control performance degradation when attack-induced uncertainty less than its upper bound. Furthermore, sufficient conditions are derived for exponentially stability of considered LKC system with $\bm{H}\infty $ performance, and gain matrices for controller and trigger are cdesigned and obtained by solving certain matrix inequalities. Benefiting from saved communication resource and more sparse but necessary assistant torque commands under resilient event-triggered communication scheme as well as dynamic authority allocation strategy with adaptive CAF, the obtained results illustrating fewer driving conflict, less driver effort, and higher resistant ability to attack-induced yaw instability demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

Yet, the traditional FNNs do not explicitly address the reliability aspect of uncertain real-world applications. Here we propose a reliable fuzzy neural networks (ReFNNs) in which an information reliability measure is employed for rule training and robust decision making of the uncertain input data. The universal approximation property of the proposed structure is proved using the Stone-Weierstrass theorem. Furthermore, the resulting structure is continuous and differentiable. Hence, a backpropagation training algorithm is developed to optimize the proposed ReFNN&#39;s parameters. Additionally, asymptotic stability analysis based on the Lyapunov theorem is shown for ReFNNs. Finally, this structure is first evaluated with several basic benchmark examples in function approximation (sine, increasing sinusoid, quadratic Hermite, and nonlinear functions). We then apply it to modeling several benchmark nonlinear systems (including a 3rd order nonlinear dynamical system, a continuous stirred tank reactor, a two-cascaded tank problem, a Wiener-Hammerstein system, and wind speed prediction) and the adaptive control of nonlinear systems in both direct and indirect frameworks. Results confirm the superiority of the proposed structure over traditional FNNs in terms of error and sensitivity in the presence of noise.},

We study several properties and construction methods of vector Choquet integrals (VCIs).

  abstract     = {This article proposes an interpretable fuzzy estimation system (IFES) for fast estimation of severity of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) using three easily available physiological variables: neck circumference, waist circumference, and average blood pressure after waking up. The IFES aims to decrease the waiting list of polysomnography so that OSAHS treatment can be performed as soon as possible. The IFES is optimized to achieve the following three objectives: high estimation accuracy, the largest number of applicable subjects, and high model interpretability. The applicable subjects are determined by evaluating the influence of six screening factors, such as smoking, hypertension, and sleep efficiency, on the estimation performance. This article finds solutions of this multiobjective optimization problem using a multiobjective genetic algorithm. A total of 1197 participants are enrolled with the five-fold cross-validation scheme employed to evaluate an estimation performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method successfully finds the influence of different screening factors and the found IFESs outperform different estimation models used for comparison.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy decision trees (FDTs) is one of the considerably excellent methods. Most of the existing FDTs’ methods are oriented to classification tasks. Applying FDTs to regression tasks may solve complex industrial modeling problems. In this article, we propose the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy regression tree (TSFRT), which uses the hypothesis of “feature screening followed by T–S fuzzy reasoning.” In the TSFRT, the growth process (crisp set theory) can be deemed as feature screening, and each leaf node (fuzzy set theory) is viewed as a T–S inference reasoning system. Thus, the TSFRT becomes a top-down structure. We develop multiple strategies to identify the parameters of the T–S system in the leaf node using sample-by-sample and batch samples. To improve the method&#39;s generalization performance, we also generalize an ensemble method with pseudoinverse and ridge regression. The proposed methods are evaluated by several high- and low-dimensional complex industrial processes. The experimental results show that the proposed method remarkably outperforms other popular regression methods.},

Furthermore, a novel alternative optimization (AOP) approach and a dual-mode optimal control (OP)/AOP strategy are proposed to prevent the performance deterioration of the online OP approach due to the challenges in addressing the bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) constraints. With the established AOP and dual-mode OP/AOP techniques, the optimization problem constrained by BMIs is transformed into convex, and a significantly more precise approximation of the ellipsoidal minimal robust positively invariant set can be calculated. Besides, the system can eventually converge into a more compact ellipsoidal set. These two alternative optimization methods can be easily extended to various nonlinear systems.

  abstract     = {A major limitation of fuzzy or neuro-fuzzy systems is their failure to deal with high-dimensional datasets. This happens primarily due to the use of T-norm, particularly, product or minimum (or a softer version of it). Thus, there are hardly any work dealing with datasets having features more than hundred or so. Here, we propose a neuro-fuzzy framework that can handle datasets with even more than 7000 features! In this context, we propose an adaptive softmin (Ada-softmin) which effectively overcomes the drawbacks of “numeric underflow” and “fake minimum” that arise for existing fuzzy systems while dealing with high-dimensional problems. We call it an adaptive Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (AdaTSK) fuzzy system. We then equip the AdaTSK system to perform feature selection and rule extraction in an integrated manner. In this context, a novel gate function is introduced and embedded only in the consequent parts, which can determine the useful features and rules, in two successive phases of learning. Unlike conventional fuzzy rule bases, we design an enhanced fuzzy rule base, which maintains adequate rules but does not grow the number of rules exponentially with features that typically happens for fuzzy neural networks. The integrated feature selection and rule extraction AdaTSK (FSRE-AdaTSK) system consists of three sequential phases: 1) feature selection; 2) rule extraction; and 3) fine tuning. The effectiveness of the FSRE-AdaTSK is demonstrated on 19 datasets of which five are in more than 2000 dimension including two with more than 7000 features. This may be the first attempt to develop fuzzy rule-based classifiers that can directly deal with more than 7000 features without requiring separate selection of features or any other dimensionality reduction method.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy clustering is an essential algorithm in image segmentation, and most of them are based on fuzzy c-mean algorithms. However, it is sensitive to noise, center point selection, cluster number, and distance metric. To address this problem, we propose a new fuzzy clustering method based on low-rank representation (LRR) for image segmentation, which integrates low-rank structure with fuzzy theory. First, we improve the morphological reconstruction superpixel method based on edge detection by introducing anisotropy to enhance the image edge. Thus, on the one hand, the improved morphological reconstruction superpixel method can improve its noise-resistance performance; on the other hand, the complexity of the subsequent low-rank computation can be reduced by enhancing the superpixels constructed by the edges. Second, inspired by the fact that rank can represent correlation, we propose the concept of fuzzy low-rank structure, which is not dealing with data directly but with the relationship between data. Specifically, we perform rank minimization on the constructed membership matrix to obtain the optimal matrix. To obtain better clustering results, we added the Frobenius norm of the fuzzy matrix as a fuzzy regularization term in the LRR model to achieve global convergence and obtain a membership matrix with a strong element correlation. Finally, we obtain the final clustering results by clustering the processed membership matrix using a subspace clustering with a low-rank structure constraint. Experiments performed on artificial and real-world images show that the proposed method is more effective and efficient than the current state-of-the-art methods.},

Consistency can prevent self-contradictory judgments, and consensus limits the deviation among individual judgments within the preset threshold. Because acceptably multiplicative consistency still cannot avoid self-contradictory judgments, this article considers the ordinal consistency and acceptably multiplicative consistency simultaneously. In view of these aspects, we introduce a new optimal model-based method for GDM with FPRs. As minimum total adjustment and minimum individual adjustment may be inconsistent, we introduce the Solidarity consistency and consensus adjustment mechanism to allocate the minimum total adjustment, which fully considers the cooperation and solidarity among decision makers. When the So-CCAM does not exhibit stability, we present the nucleolus CCAM, which is the best element in the core according to lexicographical order. After that, an algorithm is offered. To demonstrate the application and efficiency of the new method, an illustrative example is offered, and a comparison is carried out. It offers the first optimization models-based method for GDM with FPRs in view of ordinal consistency, acceptably multiplicative consistency, and consensus analysis. Further, it provides two rational consistency and CCAMs by cooperative game theory.},

Then, in order to handle the adverse effect of the actuator saturation on the control performance, bounded-input-bounded-state stable systems are developed to stabilize the closed-loop control system based on bounded compensations. Specially, flexible adjustment terms are exploited to modify the developed simple performance functions, while fragility-free prescribed performance is achieved for tracking errors, and moreover the fragility defect of the existing PPC is remedied.

Different expressions of the proposed binary relation under different values of weight parameter are discussed, and the changes of the properties of the binary relation under different parameter values are provided. By measuring the significance of attributes in the feature space, a feature selection method, called forward heuristic feature selection (FHFS), is designed to construct the low-dimension feature space based on maximizing the original data and information retention through the defined degrees of aggregation and dispersion. It is shown how the results of feature selection and classification performance vary when the values of the weight factor locate in different ranges. To illustrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed FHFS algorithm, nine high-dimensional datasets and eight image datasets from University of California-Irvine (UCI) repository are used and compared with other feature selection methods, respectively.

Fuzzy c-means (FCM) is a soft clustering method that introduces the concept of membership. In this method, the fuzzy membership matrix is obtained by calculating the distance between data points in the original space. However, these methods may yield suboptimal results owing to the influence of redundant features. Moreover, FCM is always sensitive to noise points and heavily subject to outliers. In this article, we propose a method called sparsity FCM clustering with principal component analysis embedding (P_SFCM). We simultaneously conduct principal component analysis and membership learning, and then add an additional weighting factor for each data point. The goal of this operation is to identify the noise or outliers. Overall, the benefit of our framework is that it retains most of the information in the subspace while improving the robustness of the noise. In this article, we employ an iterative optimization algorithm to efficiently solve our model. To verify the reliability of the proposed method, we conduct a convergence analysis, noise robustness analysis, and multicluster experiments. Furthermore, comparative experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that the P_SFCM is competitive with comparable methods.},

To fulfill this meaningful aim of performing Sugeno-like aggregation with numerical uncertainties, it needs two parts of work. We first formally define basic uncertain vector and basic uncertain fuzzy measure. Then, we discuss the methods to construct or adjust basic uncertain vector and basic uncertain fuzzy measure in two situations, the general fuzzy measure situation and the probability measure only situation, respectively. With uncertain input and uncertain fuzzy measure, we then accordingly propose the corresponding restricted Sugeno-like operator, for which some different logic restrictions are analyzed.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the tracking problem of event-triggered prescribed performance fuzzy fault-tolerant control (FTC) for unknown Euler–Lagrange systems with actuator faults and external disturbances. First, the barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs) and prescribed performance functions are synthesized to guarantee that the tracking errors satisfy the preset transient performance. Different from existing prescribed performance control methods, which require the initial values of the tracking errors to be within the prescribed performance functions, an error transformation method is introduced to ensure that the tracking errors with any bounded initial values can enter the preset boundaries within a preset time. Then, considering the unavailability of system parameters, the fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate unknown parameters of the system. What is more, to solve the problem of limited communication and computing resources in practical systems, an improved event-triggered control (ETC) scheme is proposed, which can reduce the communication and computation burden without satisfying the input-to-state stability assumption. Meanwhile, the Zeno phenomenon can be avoided. Furthermore, the effects of actuator faults and the event-triggered mechanism are handled by Nussbaum gain technology. Finally, the superiority of the proposed control algorithm is verified by simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the rationale behind the predictions produced by machine learning models is a necessary prerequisite for human to build confidence and trust for the intelligent systems. To tackle the problem of interpretability faced by black-box models, a fuzzy local surrogate model is proposed in this study to articulate the rationale for predictions to enhance the interpretability of the results of machine learning models. Fuzzy rule-based model comes with high interpretability since it is composed of a collection of readable rules, and thus is suitable for prediction interpretation. The general scheme of fuzzy local surrogate model is composed of the following phases: i) select data points around the instance of interest, for which we wish to explain the prediction result produced by the predictive model; ii) generate predictions for these newly selected data and weight the selected data based on the distance from the instance of interest; and iii) a fuzzy rule-based model composed a collection of interpretable is constructed to approximate the weighted data and offer meaningful interpretation to the prediction result of the given instance. The proposed fuzzy model for explaining predictions is model-agnostic and could provide high estimation accuracy. The proposed methodology offers a significant original contribution to the interpretation of machine learning models. Experimental studies demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed fuzzy local surrogate model in providing local explanations.},

  abstract     = {Spectral clustering have attracted more and more attention due to their well-defined mathematical frameworks and superior performance. However, there still exist two limitations to be solved: 1) most spectral clustering methods consist of two independent stages, which may cause unpredictable deviation of obtained clustering results from the genuine ones and lead to severe information loss and performance degradation; 2) spectral clustering methods employ the hard clustering mode, which lacks interpretability for data points in the boundary area belonging to multiple clusters. To simultaneously address these challenging issues for spectral clustering, we propose a graph-based soft-balanced fuzzy clustering (GBFC) model. Specifically, we explicitly preserve the nonnegative property of the clustering indicator matrix to enhance the interpretability of clustering results. Moreover, row normalization is imposed on the cluster indicator matrix to show the membership of each data point to different clusters. Additionally, a novel balanced constraint is designed to regularize the clustering results and constrain the size of clusters. We can directly obtain the clustering assignments without any post-processing, and the limitations of the previous two-stage clustering framework can be effectively addressed. Extensive experiments performed on both synthetic datasets and real world datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with several state-of-the-art methods.},

Concretely, we treat the problem of finding a lattice structure on set-valued fuzzy sets ( $\operatorname{SVFS}$ s) whose restriction to interval-valued fuzzy sets ( $\operatorname{IVFS}$ s) and (type-1) fuzzy sets ( $\operatorname{FS}$ s) match Zadeh&#39;s classical lattice operations. A prominent approach to this problem was given by Torra by means of the so-called hesitant fuzzy sets ( $\operatorname{HFS}$ s). Nevertheless, despite their usefulness in group decision-making problems, it is well-known that Torra&#39;s operations do not produce a lattice. Here, we mend partially this handicap by giving two lattice orders. Each of them preserves one of the Torra&#39;s operations and, additionally, reduces to Zadeh&#39;s orders on $\operatorname{FS}$ s and on $\operatorname{IVFS}$ s. As a counterpart, they cannot be defined on the whole class of $\operatorname{HFS}$ s, or $\operatorname{SVFS}$ s. Finally, we provide a full answer combining both orders. We define a partial order, that we call the symmetric order, on the whole class of nonempty subsets of [0,1]. This order extends the usual ones on [0,1] and on closed intervals of [0,1]. As a consequence, we find a lattice structure on $\operatorname{HFS}$ s whose restriction to $\operatorname{FS}$ s and $\operatorname{IVFS}$ s reduces to Zadeh&#39;s operations.},

Initially, the nonlinear delayed PPDESs are represented by Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy models and random time-varying delay is considered by taking the influence of uncertain factors, which belongs to two intervals in a probabilistic way. Since the system state is not fully available and NCBM makes the boundary control design very difficult, a fuzzy observer under NCBM is presented to surmount the design difficulty. Subsequently, an observer-based fuzzy boundary controller is proposed and spatial linear matrix inequality (SLMI)-based sufficient conditions to ensure mean-square exponential stability are obtained for closed-loop delayed PPDESs by utilizing the Lyapunov direct method and Wirtinger inequality. Then, to solve the SLMIs, the feasibility conditions of DFBOF controller design for nonlinear delayed PPDES are expressed in LMIs. Finally, two examples are offered to demonstrate the validity of the presented dynamic fuzzy boundary control approach.},

The input of the process is proposed by a space-filling method that uses a sequence of step functions to maximize the coverage of the antecedent clusters in the input space of the evolving model, which is called the heuristic step sequence (HSS). When the system reaches a steady state, a new rule is added, existing rules are merged based on the similarity of the consequent transfer functions, and a new optimal excitation is calculated. The output error model structure was chosen because it assumes a noise distribution common to real processes and is suitable for identification, while the step function input signal is one of the most commonly used signals in identification and control. A filtered recursive least squares method is used to identify the consequent parameters of the output error models and the optimization filter is adapted based on the the confidence interval of the local model. Evaluations were performed on a Hammerstein type model comparing the HSS method with a staircase excitation and on a real plate heat-exchanger pilot plant. The experiments show that the proposed HSS method outperforms the staircase excitation and can be used to identify nonlinear dynamical systems of Hammerstein–Wiener type.},

  abstract     = {Data reduction, aiming to reduce the original data by selecting the most representative information, is an important technique of preprocessing data. At present, large-scale or huge data are very common and the development of data reduction techniques for such data has attracted much attention. As a powerful tool for handling uncertainty in real-valued data, the fuzzy rough set theory has been widely applied to data reduction including extensive feature selection methods and some instance selection approaches. Nevertheless, not much work has been devoted to the simultaneous selection of feature and instance based on fuzzy rough sets. In this article, we investigate the fuzzy rough set-based bi-selection issue for data reduction. Specifically, the unified concepts of the importance degrees of fuzzy granules are presented to select the representative instances first and then the critical features. An instance selection algorithm with a noise elimination technique is provided to firstly remove the noise and then select the representative instances according to the importance degrees of fuzzy granules. Then, the importance-degree-preserved attribute reduction is proposed, and a corresponding feature selection algorithm with a wrapper technique is given to search for a best feature subset. Last, the bi-selection method based on fuzzy rough sets (BSFRS) is presented for data reduction by integrating the instance selection and the feature selection methods. Moreover, some numerical experiments are conducted to assess the performance of BSFRS, and the results show that BSFRS performs well in terms of the effectiveness.},

Second, besides the switching DOF control law for every subsystem, an additional controller state jump rule is employed at controller switching instant. Third, the “multiple state impulsive jumps” means that not only the system states, but also the controller states will jump, and these two different types of switching perform asynchronously. The average dwell time approach is used to design the switching law. By employing a new type of Lyapunov-like functions permitting to increase during the asynchronous period and jump at system switching and controller switching instants, new criteria are established to guarantee the asymptotical stability with a mixed $H_\infty$ and $L_{2}-L_\infty$ performance index of the switched T–S fuzzy systems with multiple state impulsive jumps and asynchronous switching.

In this situation, IT2FNNs usually struggle to identify potential features from samples with explicit inductive biases. To address this problem, a self-organizing IT2FNN with an adaptive discriminative strategy (ADS-SOIT2FNN) is developed to maintain the identification performance in the presence of covariate shift. First, a granularity-based metric (GM), using higher order statistics of local samples, is designed to distinguish the distribution discrepancy caused by covariate shift. The multiple kernels incorporated into GM are able to cover the sample features of the whole Hilbert space. Second, a self-organizing strategy, associated with GM-based discriminative information, is presented to alleviate the structural bias by growing and pruning fuzzy rules. Then, a compact structure of ADS-SOIT2FNN is achieved to adapt to the covariate shift of samples and further strengthen its inductive ability. Third, an adaptive risk mitigation learning algorithm (RMLA) is introduced to update the parameters of ADS-SOIT2FNN. RMLA can regulate the derivatives of parameters with arbitrary distribution samples, which is beneficial for maintaining the global accuracy by relieving the risk of parameter biases. Finally, the effectiveness of ADS-SOIT2FNN is verified by some experiments for identifying nonlinear systems with covariate shift.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the problem of adaptive quantized fault-tolerant tracking control for a class of uncertain nonstrict-feedback nonlinear systems in the presence of input and output quantization and sensor fault. The main technical challenges come from how to deal with the input and output quantization errors and the partial loss of sensors&#39; effectiveness. First, a new observer, including the quantized input and output signals and the estimation of fault parameter, is designed to reconstruct the unavailable states, and some special techniques are developed to deal with the sector-bounded quantization errors. Furthermore, based on the cubic absolute-value Lyapunov function, the adaptive fault compensation strategy is presented to make up for the influence from sensor fault upon the control performance. Then, with the aid of the fuzzy logic system approximation method and the backstepping technique, a novel output feedback adaptive fuzzy fault-tolerant control scheme is proposed for this class of systems, such that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, while the tracking error remains in a small vicinity of the origin. Finally, the effectiveness and the applicability of the proposed control scheme are validated by conducting two simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {Granular computing (GrC) and two-way concept learning (TCL) are influential studies of knowledge processing and cognitive learning. A central notion of two-way concept learning is learning concepts from an arbitrary information granule. Although TCL has been widely adopted for concept learning and formal concept analysis in a fuzzy context, the existing studies of TCL still have some issues: the sufficient and necessary granule concept is only obtained from the necessary granule or sufficient granule concept; and the cognitive mechanism ignores integrating past experiences into itself to deal with dynamic data. Meanwhile, concept-cognitive learning (CCL) method still faces challenges, such as incomplete cognitive and weak generalization ability. This article proposes a novel two-way CCL (TCCL) method for dynamic concept learning in a fuzzy context for these problems and challenges. Unlike TCL, fuzzy-based TCCL (F-TCCL) is more flexible and less time consuming to learn granule concepts from the given clue, and meanwhile, it is good at dynamic concept learning. Moreover, we design a fuzzy-based progressive learning mechanism within this framework under the dynamic environment. Some numerical experiments on public datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. The considered framework can provide a convenient novel method for researching two-way learning and CCL.},

  abstract     = {This study discusses the new stochastic maximum power point tracking control approach toward the photovoltaic cells (PCs). A PC generator is isolated from the grid, resulting in a direct current microgrid that can provide changing loads. In the course of the nonlinear systems through the time-varying delays, we proposed networked control systems beneath an event-triggered approach basically in the fuzzy system. In this scenario, we look at how random, variable loads impact the PC generator&#39;s stability and efficiency. The basic premise of this article is to load changes and the value matching to a Markov chain. PC generators are complicated nonlinear systems that pose a modeling problem. Transforming this nonlinear PC generator model into the Takagi–Sugeno (T--S) fuzzy model is another option. The T--S fuzzy model is presented in a unified framework, for which 1) the fuzzy observer based on this premise variables can be used for approximately in the infinite states to the present system, 2) the fuzzy observer-based controller can be created using the same premises being the observer, and 3) to reduce the impact of transmission burden, an event-triggered method can be investigated. Simulation in the PC generator model for the real-time climate data obtained in China demonstrates the importance of our method. In addition, by using a new Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional for combining with the allowed weighting matrices incorporating mode-dependent integral terms, the developed model can be stochastically stable and achieves the required performances. Based on the tensor-product (T-P) transformation , a new depiction of the nonlinear system is derived in two separate steps in which an adequate controller input is guaranteed in the first step and an adequate vertex polytope is ensured in the second step. To present the potential of our proposed method, we simulate it for PC generators.},

To efficaciously tolerate the cyberattacks and guarantee the expected performance for the proposed systems, a fuzzy-regulation-dependent adaptive spatiotemporal security sampled-data-based event-triggered control scheme (SDBETCS) is first introduced according to distinct fuzzy regulations. In light of the current and latest sampling signals, the threshold parameters can be timely and flexibly updated and the associated adaptive spatiotemporal SDBETCSs can be adaptively regulated for different fuzzy rules. In comparison with the conventional fuzzy SDBETCSs, the designed fuzzy adaptive spatiotemporal SDBETCS can not only reduce the event-triggering frequency but also effectively conserve more finite network communication resources. Through considering a discontinuous Lyapunov functional, a new exponential synchronization criterion is provided for fuzzy coupled RDNNs. Furthermore, a more general fuzzy adaptive spatiotemporal SDBETCS with time-dependent and continuous threshold function is presented to compare with the traditional fuzzy SDBETCS. Finally, demonstrative examples are given to verify the validity and feasibility of the theoretical analysis results and illustrate its potential application in image secure communication.},

Specifically, the dark knowledge (soft label information) is partitioned into five fixed antecedent fuzzy spaces. The centers of each soft label information in different fuzzy rules are {0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1}, which may have corresponding linguistic explanations: { very low, low, medium, high, very high }. For the consequent part of the fuzzy rule, the original features are employed to train the consequent parameters that ensure the direct interpretability in the original feature space. The experimental results on the benchmark datasets and the CHB-MIT EEG dataset demonstrate that CNNBaTSK can simultaneously improve the classification performance and model interpretability.},

To describe the effects of DoS attacks, an appropriate mathematical model is established to characterize the complicated dynamical behaviors of DoS attacks and periodic sampling mechanism. On this basis, a resilient sampled-data control scheme including communication protocols and security controller gains, is proposed to account for the effects of DoS attacks. Meanwhile, a novel index is developed to measure the antiattack ability and security level. By utilizing the information of DoS attacks and resilient sampling intervals, a continuous interval-dependent Lyapunov function is constructed which does not increase at the resilient sampling instants. Then, according to the designed interval-dependent function, several inequalities estimation techniques, convex combination approach, and together with discrete-time Lyapunov theory, two sufficient criteria are derived to guarantee that the closed-loop T--S fuzzy systems are globally asymptotically stable with prespecified security levels subject to DoS attacks. The advantages of designed function are well analyzed in contrast with the previous discontinuous Lyapunov functionals. At last, two simulation examples are given to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the obtained results.},

Furthermore, a quantized fuzzy antidisturbance control scheme is synthesized by fusing the estimation of the multiple disturbances. With the support of Lyapunov functional method, $It{\hat{o}}$ ’s formula and auxiliary function-based integral inequality, the resulting IT2 fuzzy stochastic systems are proved to be robustly stochastically stable with mixed $H_\infty$ /passivity performance index. The design methods of the fuzzy disturbance observer and quantized antidisturbance controller are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities so that the corresponding gain matrices can be easily obtained.

In reality, there are plenty of GDM problems with diversified attributes and heterogeneous information. In this article, the diversified attributes describe the differences in attributes given by different decision makers, and heterogeneous information refers to the differences in data types. Nonetheless, few existing GDM studies simultaneously focus on the above two characteristics of GDM problems. Moreover, the scenario of multiple decision preferences and the attribute and expert weights based on heterogeneous information are also seldom discussed. Given this, by considering a kind of GDM problem with the characteristics of multisource, heterogeneity, diversity, and multiple fuzzy decisions, this article builds a novel GDM method from the perspective of multigranulation rough sets. First, we construct a new weighted multigranulation generalized fuzzy rough set (WMGGFRS) over multisource heterogeneous fuzzy decision systems. Subsequently, in response to heterogeneous information, the extended entropy weight methods are given to calculate the weight of each attribute and the weight of each expert. After that, we establish a GDM method using the WMGGFRS model to realize multisource information fusion. Finally, we apply the established method to the management decision-making problem of gout diagnosis. The results of comparative and sensitivity analyses demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness, stability, and superiority of the method.},

Therefore, in this note, first and foremost, several theorems are initiated to address and specify the usage scope of the iSDA, which is related to the type of fuzzy variables involved in the functions. Furthermore, examples and counter-examples with schematic diagrams based on the proposed theorems are provided to illustrate the performance of the iSDA. It is shown that the simulation results of the iSDA would be uncontrollable and lead to unbearable error for counter-examples, which immediately shows the necessity of this note. Second and incidentally, the respective convergence of the iSDA and another algorithm, i.e., the special numerical integration algorithm (NIA-S), are proved as supplementary contents for the original paper. Finally, the conclusion about the comparison between the iSDA and NIA-S is also restated.},

The synchronization model between FO master and slave PMSGs with capacitive and resistive couplings is built. The dynamic analysis fully reveals its abundant dynamical behaviors including chaotic oscillations and gives stability/instability boundaries with the designed numerical method. In controller design, the hierarchical type-2 fuzzy neural network (HT2FNN) with a transformation is designed to approximate unknown functions, the fixed-time command filter matched up with the compensating signal is proposed to achieve precise estimate and fast convergence, and a fixed-time preconfigured performance function integrated with a smooth and invertible function is built to realize fixed-time convergence and performance constraint. Then a fuzzy fixed-time optimal synchronization control scheme fusing with the HT2FNN, filter, performance function and optimal control is developed under the FO backstepping theory. The stability analysis proves that all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded along with the cost function being minimized. Finally, numerical simulation results verify the feasibility and advantages of our scheme.},

There exists a strong need in developing accurate, suitable, and efficient classification methods and algorithms with broad applicability. Random forest is a general algorithm that is often used for classification under complex conditions. Although it has been widely adopted, its combination with diverse fuzzy theory is still worth exploring. In this article, we propose the intuitionistic fuzzy random forest (IFRF), a new random forest ensemble of intuitionistic fuzzy decision trees (IFDT). Such trees in forest use intuitionistic fuzzy information gain to select features and consider hesitation in information transmission. The proposed method enjoys the power of the randomness from bootstrapped sampling and feature selection, the flexibility of fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets, and the robustness of multiple classifier systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the IFRF has competitive and superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art fuzzy and ensemble algorithms. IFDT is more suitable for ensemble learning with outstanding classification accuracy. This study is the first to propose a random forest ensemble based on the intuitionistic fuzzy theory.},

Then, the possible replay attack from the sensor to the shore-based center is considered, and a switching-type attack tolerant fault detection filter is designed. Sufficient conditions are given to ensure that the filtering augmented system is stable and with stochastic finite frequency $H_{\infty }$ and $H_{-}$ performances, which reflect the robustness to the disturbance and sensitivity to the fault. On this basis, through a series of mathematical processing, the linear solvable conditions for the design of fault detection filters are obtained.

  abstract     = {Evolving intelligent systems (EISs), particularly, the zero-order ones have demonstrated strong performance on many real-world problems concerning data stream classification while offering high model transparency and interpretability thanks to their prototype-based nature. Zero-order EISs typically learn prototypes by clustering streaming data online in a “one pass” manner for greater computation efficiency. However, such identified prototypes often lack optimality, resulting in less precise classification boundaries, thereby hindering the potential classification performance of the systems. To address this issue, a commonly adopted strategy is to minimize the training error of the models on historical training data or alternatively to iteratively minimize the intracluster variance of the clusters obtained via online data partitioning. This recognizes the fact that the ultimate classification performance of zero-order EISs is driven by the positions of prototypes in the data space. Yet, simply minimizing the training error may potentially lead to overfitting while minimizing the intracluster variance does not necessarily ensure the optimized prototype-based models to attain improved classification outcomes. To achieve better classification performance while avoiding overfitting for zero-order EISs, this article presents a novel multiobjective optimization approach, enabling EISs to obtain optimal prototypes via involving these two disparate but complementary strategies simultaneously. Five decision-making schemes are introduced for selecting a suitable solution to deploy from the final nondominated set of the resulting optimized models. Systematic experimental studies are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization approach in improving the classification performance of zero-order EISs.},

To achieve agreed solutions that increase DMs&#39; satisfaction toward the collective solution, linguistic consensus reaching processes (LiCRPs) have been developed. These LiCRPs aim at suggesting DMs to change their original opinions to increase the group consensus degree, computed by a certain consensus measure. In recent years, these LiCRPs have been a prolific research line, and consequently, numerous proposals have been introduced in the specialized literature. However, we have pointed out the nonexistence of objective metrics to compare these models and decide which one presents the best performance for each LiGDM problem. Therefore, this article aims at introducing a metric to evaluate the performance of LiCRPs that takes into account the resulting consensus degree and the cost of modifying DMs&#39; initial opinions. Such a metric is based on a linguistic comprehensive minimum cost consensus (CMCC) model based on Extended Comparative Linguistic Expressions with Symbolic Translation information that models DMs&#39; hesitancy and provides accurate Computing with Words processes.

However, it is challenging for DFNNs to handle cases in which the local data are nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID). In this article, we propose a federated fuzzy neural network (FedFNN) with evolutionary rule learning (ERL) to cope with non-IID issues as well as data uncertainties. The FedFNN maintains a global set of rules in a server and a personalized subset of these rules for each local client. ERL is inspired by the theory of biological evolution; it encourages rule variations while activating superior rules and deactivating inferior rules for local clients with non-IID data. Specifically, ERL consists of two stages in an iterative procedure: a rule cooperation stage that updates global rules by aggregating local rules based on their activation statuses and a rule evolution stage that evolves the global rules and updates the activation statuses of the local rules. This procedure improves both the generalization and personalization of the FedFNN for dealing with non-IID issues and data uncertainties. Extensive experiments conducted on a range of datasets demonstrate the superiority of the FedFNN over state-of-the-art methods.},

The types of fuzzy sets (FSs) can be constructed automatically by self-organizing method, so as to form a hybrid fuzzy system. Different from the existing evolutionary type-1 fuzzy system, which is full of type-1 FSs, and the evolutionary interval type-2 fuzzy system, which is full of interval type-2 FSs, there are both type-1 FSs and interval type-2 FSs in the hybrid fuzzy system. A new transparency-oriented objective function is defined, and the constraint of the footprint of uncertainty of the interval type-2 (IT2) FS is considered for the first time. A new FS merging criterion focusing on the proximity of the cores of FSs is proposed, which is easy to calculate and maintains the characteristics of classical similarity measures. Combined with the new merging criterion, the online cluster and FS updating algorithm is employed to initialize the reference rule base and the type of FS, as it is assumed that no training data are collected in advance. Based on the reference rule base, the advanced multiobjective front-guided continuous ant colony optimization algorithm is introduced to optimize all the free parameters of the FLS. With the operation mentioned above, the self-generated FLSs achieve a good balance between interpretability and performance.

And the reciprocally convex inequality is used to estimate the upper bound of the integral terms from the derivative of L–K functional. The new delay-derivative/distribution-dependent stability and stabilization criteria are derived.

  abstract     = {Fuzzy rough set theory can model uncertainty in data and has been applied to feature selection for machine learning tasks. The existence of noise in data is one of the reasons for data uncertainty. However, most classical fuzzy rough set models are often sensitive to the noise in data, which somewhat degrades their applicability to process uncertainty of data. Furthermore, a robust feature evaluation function is nontrivial in a fuzzy rough set model as a nonoptimal feature subsets may be selected due to the perturbations from redundant features. In this article, we delve into local density and indispensable features for fuzzy rough feature selection to address these challenges. We first propose a local density-based fuzzy rough set (LDFRS) model to tackle noisy data. Mutual information is then plugged into the proposed LDFRS model to evaluate uncertainty in data. A joint feature evaluation function on the indispensability and relevance of features is constructed to evaluate the significance of features. On this basis, a fuzzy rough feature selection algorithm is built upon the LDFRS model. Experimental results using four typical classifiers demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed model including our feature selection algorithm and its superiority against baseline methods.},

An infinite number of fuzzy measures are associated with the DS belief structure. This article proposes a theorem to calculate the general form of a specific set of fuzzy measures associated with the DS belief structure. This specific set of fuzzy measures can be expressed as a weighted summation of the basic assignment function of the DS belief structure. The main advantage of expressing the fuzzy measures in this format is that the monotonic condition that needs to be maintained during the calculation of the fuzzy measure can be avoided, and only the basic assignment function needs to be evaluated. The calculation of the basic assignment function is formulated using a method inspired by the Monte Carlo approach used to calculate value functions in the Markov decision process.},

First, a disturbance observer is introduced to identify the compounded disturbances, which are made up of external disturbances and fuzzy approximation errors. Second, the asymmetric time-varying barrier Lyapunov functions are constructed to guarantee that all the state constraints are not violated. Meanwhile, the finite-time command filters are embedded in the backstepping-based controller design to overcome the explosion of complexity problems. Third, the event-triggered adaptive controller is developed to reduce the communication burden based on the relative threshold algorithm. The proposed control strategy can guarantee that the closed-loop system is semiglobally practically finite-time stable, and the tracking error converges to a small residual set in a finite time. Finally, a simulation example is included to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

First, a novel sliding-mode manifold (SMM), not only devoted to the finite-time convergence of tracking errors to a small residual set around zero but also ensuring stringent constraint requirements, is proposed. The SMM is available for both the constrained and unconstrained EL systems in a unified manner with no structural changes. Then, a fuzzy logic system is introduced to dynamically compensate for uncertainties in the system. An extra robustifying term is added to the training policy to accelerate online learning. Also, an event-triggered mechanism is integrated into the tracker design procedure to reduce the frequency of signal transmission. Stability analysis proves that all the closed-loop signals are uniformly bounded, and numerical simulations further illustrate the theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {All intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS methods contain two key elements: (1) the order structure, which can affect the choices of positive and negative ideal-points, and construction of admissible distance/similarity measures; (2) the distance/similarity measure, which is closely related to the values of the relative closeness degrees and determines the accuracy and rationality of decision-making. For the order structure, many efforts are devoted to constructing some score functions, which can strictly distinguish different intuitionistic fuzzy values (IFVs) and preserve the natural partial order for IFVs. This paper proves that such a score function does not exist. For the distance or similarity measure, some examples are given to show that classical similarity measures based on the Euclidean distance and Minkowski distance do not meet the axiomatic definition of IF similarity measures. Moreover, some illustrative examples are given to show that classical intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS methods do not ensure the monotonicity with the natural partial order or linear orders, which may yield some counter-intuitive results. To overcome the limitation of non-monotonicity, we propose a novel intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS method, using three new admissible distances with the linear orders measured by a score degree/similarity function and accuracy degree, or two aggregation functions, and prove that the proposed TOPSIS method is monotonous under these three linear orders. This is the first result with a strict mathematical proof on the monotonicity with the linear orders for the intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS method. Finally, we show two practical examples to illustrate the efficiency of the developed TOPSIS.},

We use the COVID-19 data and extended versions of the SIR model whose encounters are modeled by four triangular norms, namely, product, minimum, and Frank and Hamacher t-norms, to analyze the scenario in three countries: 1) Germany; 2) Italy; 3) Switzerland. We compare all versions of the SIR model based on these triangular norms, and we analyze their effectiveness in fitting data and determining important parameters for the pandemic, such as the basic and effective reproduction number. In addition, Frank and Hamacher triangular norms present an auxiliary parameter that can be interpreted as an indicator of control measure, which we show to be important in the current pandemic scenario.},

Moreover, it is found that the solution set of a min-plus system could be generated by a unique minimum solution and a finite number of quasi-maximal solutions. As a consequence, one is able to find the complete solution set of a min-plus system. Besides, motivated by the optimal managerial objective, we establish an optimization model with the min-plus inequalities constraints. A so-called feasible index set (FIS)-based algorithm is developed for searching an optimal solution of our studied optimization model. We have provided a simple numerical example for checking the effectiveness of our proposed FIS-based algorithm.

Thus, an immediate question arises: Do we need to study discrete implications or is it enough to study implications defined in [0,1], and then, to discretize them? The answer must rely on the preservation of the additional properties of fuzzy implication functions through these discretization methods. In this article, for two specific methods based on the ceiling and floor functions, it is proved that most of the additional properties are not preserved in general, showing that the preservation of the additional properties depends directly on the properties of the underlying operators considered in the discretization.

  abstract     = {Decisions made in areas such as economics, engineering, industry, and medical sciences are usually based on finding and interpreting solutions to optimization problems. When modeling an optimization problem, it should be clear that people do not make decisions in a vacuum or in isolation from the reality. So, there is always a decision-making context that, in addition to the natural constraints of the problem, acts as a filter on the candidate solutions available. If this fact is omitted, optimal but useless solutions to the problem can be obtained. In this article, we propose a systematic way of modeling contexts based on fuzzy propositions and two approaches (a priori and a posteriori) for solving optimization problems under their influence. In the proposed a priori approach, the context is explicitly included in the mathematical model of the problem. As this approach may have a limited application due to the increasing number of constraints and their nature, an a posteriori approach is proposed, in which a set of solutions, obtained by any means (like exact algorithms, simulation, or metaheuristics), are checked for their suitability to the context by using a multicriteria decision-making methodology. A simple fish harvesting problem in a sustainability context and a tourist trip design problem in a pandemic context were solved for illustration purposes. Our results provide researchers and practitioners with a methodology for more effective optimization and decision making.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we utilize a combination of integral control, fuzzy control, and observer-based output feedback control to deal with the issue of nonlinear output tracking control (OTC) design for nonlinear infinite-dimensional dynamic systems. The system dynamics model is represented by a semilinear parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) with boundary control and noncollocated boundary measurement. Initially, a Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy parabolic PDE model is constructed to surmount the OTC design difficulty from the infinite-dimensional nonlinear system dynamics. Subsequently, a fuzzy-observer-based OTC law is proposed via the T–S fuzzy PDE model and the integral control approach. Here, the integral control ensures asymptotic output regulation, and the observer-based output feedback control is employed to conquer the stabilizing control design difficulty caused by the noncollocation between control actuation and measurement. It is shown via the Lyapunov technique with variants of vector-valued Poincaré–Wirtinger&#39;s inequality that the suggested fuzzy OTC law drives the measurement output to asymptotically track the desired reference signal and ensures the boundedness of the resulting closed-loop system, provided that a sufficient condition given in the form of linear matrix inequalities is fulfilled. Moreover, the proposed fuzzy-model-based OTC design is also revised for the exponential stabilization case. Finally, extensive simulation results for a numerical example and a cooling process in hot strip mills are provided to examine the effectiveness and merit of the proposed fuzzy OTC scheme.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of multiview fuzzy clustering is to integrate fuzzy partitions of multiple complete views and obtain the optimal clustering partition. However, multiview data collected in the real world are often incomplete. To address this problem, partial view-based methods and missing view imputation-based methods have been proposed in recent years and achieved some success. However, these two groups of methods still have the following issues. First, since missing view processing and clustering are handled separately, the processed data lack relevance for clustering. Second, either hidden or visible information is explored for clustering, which precludes cooperative learning between these two types of information. Third, the within view and between view information is not fully explored. This article proposes a new end-to-end incomplete multiview fuzzy clustering method to deal with the issues. Based on traditional multiview fuzzy clustering, we construct a new end-to-end clustering framework to integrate the three tasks—missing view imputation, hidden view learning and clustering—as a single process. The framework not only enables mutual coordination of the three tasks, but also cooperative learning between the hidden and visible views. Next, we explore the within and between view information and propose two enhanced learning mechanisms to improve the quality of the imputed missing views and the learned hidden views. Finally, we introduce an adaptive view weighting mechanism to further improve the robustness of the model. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computers can be a revolutionary tool to implement inference engines for fuzzy rule-based systems. In fact, the use of quantum mechanical principles can enable parallel execution of fuzzy rules and allow them to be used efficiently in complex contexts such as distributed and big data environments. This article introduces the very first quantum-based fuzzy inference engine that is capable of providing exponential acceleration in fuzzy rule execution compared to its classical counterpart, and allows a quantum computer to be programmed by fuzzy linguistic rules. The proposed inference engine was implemented using a quantum algorithm design scheme based on the oracle notion. This scheme allows the modeling of a fuzzy rule-based system as a Boolean function, the oracle, which is able to reconstruct the relationships between the antecedent and consequent parts of fuzzy rules, and can be efficiently computed on a quantum computer. The suitability of the proposed quantum algorithm for use as a fuzzy inference engine was tested in a typical benchmark scenario, such as that provided by inverted pendulum control.},

A characterization of residual implications derived from proper quasi-copulas is obtained, which provides a characterization of residual implications derived from copulas.

  abstract     = {We present a reduced-complexity control approach for a class of descriptor nonlinear systems with a nonlinear derivative matrix, possibly singular. To this end, a systematic approach is proposed to obtain an equivalent polytopic representation of a given nonlinear system within a compact set of the state-space. This modeling approach has two particular features compared to the related Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model-based framework. First, the model complexity only grows proportionally , rather than exponentially, with the number of premise variables. Second, the vertices of the proposed polytopic models can admit an infinite number of representations for the same predefined set of premise variables. This nonuniqueness feature allows introducing some specific slack variables at the modeling step to reduce the control design conservatism. Based on the proposed polytopic representation and Lyapunov stability theory, we derive reduced-complexity admissibility analysis and design conditions, expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities, for the considered class of descriptor systems. In particular, a new nonlinear control law is proposed for regular descriptor systems to avoid using the extended redundancy form, which may yield numerically complex and conservative results due to the imposed special control structure. Both numerical and physically motivated examples are given to demonstrate the interests of the new control approach with respect to existing T–S fuzzy model-based control results.},

The parameter selection range of the improved FTPF is relaxed, which renders systems to achieve better transient performance. Benefitting from the stochastic Lyapunov stability theory, it is shown that all signals of systems are semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded in probability, and bipartite consensus errors can satisfy the arbitrary precision with probability in the predefined time.

For achieving desirable performance while saving communication resources, the memory-based dynamic event-triggered protocol is constructed by flexibly exploiting a series of historically triggered packets. The fading channel is time-varying and described as a novel nonhomogeneous Markov process, in which a higher level deterministic switching signal regulates the variation of transition probabilities.

First, improved Lyapunov–Krasovskii functions (LKFs) based on fuzzy membership functions are constructed, which combine the characteristics of nonlinear problems in the system to reduce the initial constraints. Then, a second-order weight method (SOWM) is introduced to divide the time interval of sampling meticulously. Besides, the information stored in the LKFs is enhanced. Furthermore, we construct the novel looped functions by relying on the SOWM.

The fuzzy logic systems are applied to deal with uncertain and continuous functions in the system model. By constructing the appropriate Lyapunov function, not only the vibrations can be suppressed, but also the containment error between the convex hull spanned by the multiple leaders and all followers can be converged to zero by designing a distributed containment feedback control law.

  abstract     = {Fuzzy description logics (FDLs) are useful for dealing with fuzzy terminological knowledge for domains with linked data. Logical similarity or indiscernibility between individuals with respect to a given FDL is a fuzzy measure, which becomes crisp when the logic is extended with the Baaz projection operator. The measure is closely related to bisimulation. While logical indiscernibility is defined semantically, its corresponding notion based on bisimulation enables the computation. In this article, we study crisp bisimulations between fuzzy interpretations in FDLs with the Baaz projection operator under a general semantics based on an abstract algebra of fuzzy truth values. We define such bisimulations for a large class of FDLs with a rich set of well-known concept and role constructors, including qualified/unqualified number restrictions, nominals and the role constructors that correspond to the program constructors of propositional dynamic logic. We formulate and prove their logical characterizations, including the invariance of concepts under crisp bisimulations and the Hennessy–Milner property of crisp bisimulations. Such logical characterizations do not depend on a concrete semantics, such as the Gödel, Łukasiewicz, and product semantics. Based on crisp bisimulations, we also study indiscernibility of individuals in FDLs with the Baaz projection operator. An interesting consequence of our results states that, when restricting to the considered FDLs and image-finite fuzzy interpretations that are witnessed and modally saturated, indiscernibility of individuals is independent from the underlying algebra of fuzzy truth values in the case without number restrictions, and it is the same for both the Gödel and product semantics in the case with number restrictions.},

How to mine more useable features of time series to make accuracy predictions is still an open issue. To address these challenges, from the perspective of fuzzy interaction between nodes, we propose a novel network constructing model called fuzzy cognitive visibility graph (FCVG) for time series to convert the time series into a pair of directed weighted graphs. To calculate the similarity between nodes in the FCVG, we develop the weighted multisubgraph similarity (WMSS). With these tools, we introduce the prediction based on fuzzy similarity distribution (PFSD), a novel forecasting method for time series, that can efficiently capture the spatiotemporal dependence. A time series is converted into a network by the FCVG, and the similarity scores between nodes are calculated through the WMSS. Based on the normalized similarity distribution, the predictions of time series are made. Extensive experiments on different datasets confirm the benefits of leveraging fuzzy interaction in time-series forecasting. Moreover, the construction cost index is predicted to show how to apply PFSD to forecast a specific time series.},

Then the sEMG signals and image information are integrated to jointly determine the grasp posture of the bionic hand based on fuzzy decision strategy. Fusing multisensory data and using cross-modal integration, the system is capable of crossmodally recognizing multimodal information. In order to realize the prosthesis automatically reaching the target position under the guidance of computer vision, an interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller considering uncertain dynamic parameters and disturbance is designed. Experiments are performed in some typical 3C assembly scenarios, and results show that our proposed strategy can obviously improve the accuracy of grasp posture selection and trajectory tracking effect, which brings more potential job opportunities with hope to amputees, and provides a promising approach toward robotic sensing and perception.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the containment control for state-constrained multiagent systems. Existing results assume that the dynamic of the multiple leaders is known as prior knowledge. First, a distributed adaptive observer is used to estimate the leader&#39;s unknown parameters. The local reference signal and its high-order derivatives are generated by an $n$ th-order filter, which will be employed in the backstepping design procedures. Second, a log-type nonlinear state-dependent barrier function is established to cope with the time-varying asymmetric full-state constraints. The constrained system is equivalently transformed into a nonconstrained one. Finally, a distributed adaptive fuzzy containment control scheme is developed for the nonconstrained system. Only one adaptive law is required in each distributed controller, and no feasibility conditions and partial-derivative terms are involved in the virtual and actual controllers. In addition, the time derivatives of the candidate Lyapunov functions are guaranteed to be negative semidefinite by introducing a series of reduced-order smooth functions. It is proved that the containment error converges to a user-predefined interval, and all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded. The time-varying asymmetric full-state constraints imposed on the followers are not violated. Two illustrative examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested approach.},

Taking the quantization and dead zone in the control link into account, the adaptive parameters and a part of the control are used to estimate and compensate the nonlinear disturbance, respectively. In addition, under reasonable assumptions, the complexity of the Lyapunov function compared with conventional stochastic adaptive control is reduced.

Meanwhile, the novel model considers the NDTVDs and removes the strict constraints including node alignment and one-to-one interlayer connection to meet diverse modeling requirements in complex applications. Then, the proposed fuzzy impulsive controller does not need to share the same fuzzy parameters as the fuzzy MNNs model, reducing the implementation complexity of the fuzzy impulsive controller. To derive the main results using the augmented vector form of unconstrained MNNs, the sparse matrix method is proposed to convert the node-dependent delayed MNNs model into an equivalent model with multiple delays. Moreover, the time-dependent Lyapunov function (TDLF) technique is adopted to improve the reliability of the stabilization conditions by fully utilizing the state information of both the current and neighboring impulsive intervals.

  abstract     = {Fuzzy relational formal concept analysis (FRCA) mines collections of fuzzy concept lattices from fuzzy relational context families , which are special datasets made of fuzzy formal contexts and fuzzy relations between objects of different types. Mainly, FRCA consists of the following procedures: first, an initial fuzzy relational context family is transformed into a collection of fuzzy formal contexts; second, a fuzzy concept lattice is generated from each fuzzy formal context by using one of the techniques existing in the literature. The principal tools to transform a fuzzy context family into a set of fuzzy formal contexts are the so-called fuzzy scaling quantifiers , which are particular fuzzy quantifiers based on the concept of evaluative linguistic expression . FRCA can be applied whenever information needs to be extracted from multirelational datasets including vagueness, and it can be viewed as an extension of both relational concept analysis and fuzzy formal concept analysis . This article contributes to the development of fuzzy relational concept analysis by achieving the following goals. First of all, we present and study a new class of fuzzy quantifiers, called t-scaling quantifiers , to extract fuzzy concepts from fuzzy relational context families. Subsequently, we provide an algorithm to generate, given a t-scaling quantifier, a collection of fuzzy concept lattices from a special fuzzy relational context family, which is composed of a pair of fuzzy formal contexts and a fuzzy relation between their objects. After that, we introduce an ordered relation on the set of all t-scaling quantifiers, which allows us to discover a correspondence among fuzzy concept lattices deriving from different t-scaling quantifiers. Finally, we discuss how the results obtained for t-scaling quantifiers can be extended to the class of fuzzy scaling quantifies. Therefore, this analysis highlights the main differences between t-scaling and fuzzy quantifiers.},

However, since majority of decision-making models focus solely on knowledge or data resources, avoiding the interrelations and dependencies between the operation information, these models are difficult to obtain comprehensive and precise solutions. Thus, to solve this problem, a knowledge-aided and data-driven fuzzy decision-making (KD-FDM) model is designed for sludge bulking. First, a recursive reconstruction contribution (RRC) method is proposed to analyze the operation data to diagnose the fault of sludge bulking. Then, the fault information can be recorded as valid knowledge to assist in decision making. Second, a knowledge internalization mechanism is developed to make use of the knowledge from the results of RRC and the expert experience of sludge bulking to construct the initial condition of KD-FDM model. Then, the KD-FDM model can obtain the precision parameters and compact structure in the initialization phase. Third, the KD-FDM model using a knowledge-aided fuzzy broad learning system is employed to determine suppression strategies for sludge bulking. Then, the KD-FDM model can obtain fast and accurate strategies to mitigate the detrimental impact on the process performance. Finally, the KD-FDM model is tested in a real WWTP to confirm its effectiveness. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve outstanding performance.},

On this basis, a novel successive packet loss modeling method is proposed with some basic assumptions. By the exact discrete-time model approach, a discretized sampled-data T–S fuzzy model is first established by considering the probability characteristic of the deception attacks and successive packet losses in a unified framework. Based on the established mode, the sufficient conditions to guarantee the security degree are derived by the Lyapunov function approach.

  abstract     = {Collaborative multiview clustering methods can efficiently realize the view fusion by exploring complementary and consistent information among multiple views. However, these studies ignore all the differences between multiple views in fusion. In fact, in the multiview clustering, the data are diverse from view to view. The larger the difference between any two views is, the more the fusion of these views is required. Moreover, a global tradeoff parameter is generally adopted to restrain the penalty related to the disagreement of all views, which is often defined empirically. Inspired by the idea of transfer learning, a series of novel collaborative multiview clustering algorithms are proposed to tackle these challenges. In the most basic one, each view performs clustering independently and learns from others to improve its own clustering performance, in which a global learning factor is defined to control the interaction between multiple views. The fuzzy memberships are regarded as the important knowledge to provide guidance between views, and the consensus constraint is defined to ensure the consistent partitions of all views. In addition, the local adaptive learning factors between any two views instead of a global fixed one are adopted in an improved version to emphasize the difference between views, and the adjustment strategy for the learning factor is further designed to guarantee the stability of multiview clustering without the influence of initial values. Finally, to identify the significance of different views to the clustering, the extended versions are excavated with the assignment of view weights and the maximum entropy regularization technique is employed to optimize the weights. Experiments on various real-world multiview datasets verify the superiority of the presented approaches.},

  abstract     = {Clustering noisy, high-dimensional, and structurally complex data have always been a challenging task. As most existing clustering methods are not able to deal with both the adverse impact of noisy samples and the complex structures of data, in this article, we propose a novel robust and sparse possibilistic K-subspace (RSPKS) clustering algorithm to integrate subspace recovery and possibilistic clustering algorithms under a unified sparse framework. First, the proposed method sparsifies the membership matrix and the subspace projection vector under a dual-sparse framework to handle high-dimensional noisy data. This unifies dimensionality reduction and clustering using one objective function for which the optimization can be realized through synchronous iteration. Second, the reconstruction error of each sample in the local subspace is used as the distance metric for classification. That is, each sample itself is treated as a clustering prototype so as not to be affected by the structure of the overall data distribution. Therefore, the clustering prototype construction problem of the data with complex structures can be better addressed. Finally, to deal with nonlinear regions, our RSPKS method is further extended into a kernelized version, namely the kernelized RSPKS clustering algorithm. The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of clustering accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge-based clustering algorithms can improve traditional clustering models by introducing domain knowledge to identify the underlying data structure. While there have been several approaches to clustering with the guidance of knowledge tidbits, most of them mainly focus on numeric knowledge without considering the uncertain nature of information. To capture the uncertainty of information, pure numeric knowledge tidbits are expanded to knowledge granules in this article. Then, two questions arise: how to obtain granular knowledge and how to use those knowledge granules in clustering. To the end, a novel knowledge extraction and granulation (KEG) method and a granular knowledge-based fuzzy clustering model are proposed in this study. First, inspired by the concept of natural neighbors, an automatic KEG is developed. In KEG, high-density points are filtered from the dataset and then merged with their natural neighbors to form several dense areas, i.e., granular knowledge. Furthermore, the granular knowledge expressed by interval or triangular numbers is leveraged into the clustering algorithm, which is the framework of fuzzy clustering with granular knowledge. To concretize this model into clustering algorithms, the classical fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm has been selected to incorporate the granular knowledge produced by KEG. Then, the corresponding fuzzy C-Means clustering with interval knowledge granules (IKG-FCM) and triangular knowledge granules (TKG-FCM) are proposed. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IKG-FCM and TKG-FCM always achieve better clustering performance with less time cost, especially on imbalanced data, compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy rule interpolation (FRI) strongly supports approximate inference when a new observation matches no rules, through selecting and subsequently interpolating appropriate rules close to the observation from the given (sparse) rule base. Traditional ways of implementing the critical rule selection process are typically based on the exploitation of Euclidean distances between the observation and rules. It is conceptually straightforward for implementation but applying this distance metric may systematically lead to inferior results because it fails to reflect the variations of the relevance or significance levels among different domain features. To address this important issue, a novel transformation-based FRI approach is presented, on the basis of utilizing the Mahalanobis distance metric. The new FRI method works by transforming a given sparse rule base into a coordinates system where the distance between instances of the same category becomes closer while that between different categories becomes further apart. In so doing, when an observation is present that matches no rules, the most relevant neighboring rules to implement the required interpolation are more likely to be selected. Following this, the scale and move factors within the classical transformation-based FRI procedure are also modified by Choquet integral. Systematic experimental investigation over a range of classification problems demonstrates that the proposed approach remarkably outperforms the existing state-of-the-art FRI methods in both accuracy and efficiency.},

In this short article, an enhanced local stabilization of constrained N-TS fuzzy systems is investigated with the purpose of not only reducing conservatism but also relieving computational burden. To do this, a new class of threshold functions are established in order to achieve real-time online assessment of the variation of the normalized fuzzy weighting functions (NFWFs) at different sampling instants, i.e., the one-step-past one and the current one. Thus, a key alternative is proposed for eliminating all the involved terms containing the one-step-past NFWFs while their main information is retained. Since our obtained design criteria are merely dependent on the current NFWFs, the conservatism can be reduced at the expense of lighter computational burden. The benefits of our proposed results are validated by implementing several objective comparisons with those recent results.},

Thereby, we define an autoregressive-based noise model, localized per rule for being able to model different possible noise behaviors in different parts of the input space. Its predictions are added to the real fuzzy model predictions for noise correction purposes. This additive aspect leads to an extended version of the recursive fuzzily weighted least squares estimator (RFWLS-N = RFWLS with noise compensation), inheriting all its favorable convergence properties. For rule antecedent learning, we perform an evolving clustering process with the integration of a new forgetting strategy to be able to achieve more flexible updates in order to account for possible drifts. Therefore, a specific sample weighting concept is designed, with which different forgetting types can be achieved, ranging from (slow) logarithmic forgetting to (uniformly) linear forgetting and to (fast) exponential forgetting. The integration of the weights into the updates of rule centers and inverse covariance matrices is underlined with a theoretical analysis of their sample-wise contributions in the updates. Results on several noise-affected real-world datasets and system identification problems showed significantly improved model performances, compared to related evolving fuzzy methods, to the conventional RFWLS estimator and to the recursive correntropy approach. Antecedent forgetting helped us to improve the error trends in the case of abrupt drifts, while it never worsened the trends in the case of no drift.},

The behavioral decision theory modifies classic decision-making theories to make the new method more applicable. Regret theory, as one of the important components in behavioral decision theories, has been widely used in theories and applications. Based on regret theory, we establish a generalized three-way decision method on incomplete multiscale decision information systems with interval fuzzy numbers. First, we select an incomplete optimal subsystem for the incomplete multiscale information system, and convert the multiscale evaluation information into an interval fuzzy number by using a linguistic term set. Second, based on the probability distribution of evaluation values and tradeoff factors, we propose a target-dependent approximation estimation method for the incomplete interval fuzzy subsystem. Then, the regret–rejoicing preferences between objects are obtained. Finally, a tripartition and ranking method based on a max-bipartition and preference index is established. Moreover, the incompleteness experiments show that the decision-making results of our method can still maintain more than 97\% consistency in an incomplete information system with a missing rate of at most 20\%. In addition, the parameter analysis shows that the proposed method maintains an accuracy rate of more than 98\% and a classification error rate of no more than 0.6\%.},

All fuzzy $\beta$ -covering rough set models are constructed under a corresponding fuzzy $\beta$ -covering approximation space. However, fuzzy $\beta$ -covering is difficult to find directly from the real data. Fortunately, fuzzy information granulation provides a reasonable and effective way to obtain fuzzy $\beta$ -coverings from the real data. Since fuzzy information granulation is capable of generating multiple fuzzy $\beta$ -coverings, we introduce the notion of multifuzzy $\beta$ -covering approximation spaces. Fuzzy $\beta$ -covering approximation spaces are a special case of multifuzzy $\beta$ -covering approximation spaces. Besides, we employ fuzzy $\beta$ -neighborhood operators with reflexivity and symmetry to characterize the similarity between samples. In this article, we first present the definition of multifuzzy $\beta$ -covering approximation spaces and investigate some useful properties about fuzzy $\beta$ -covering. Second, several information measures are explored in the context of multifuzzy $\beta$ -covering approximation spaces. On this basis, a novel heuristic fuzzy $\beta$ -covering reduction method with the measure of monotone conditional entropy is proposed. Moreover, a general framework of attribute reduction based on fuzzy $\beta$ -covering reduction is also designed. Finally, through the comparative and experimental analyses with other four state-of-the-art attribute reduction methods, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are verified.},

Compared with the existing model of neural networks with distributed time-varying delay without kernel, a more general model containing a distributed delay kernel is considered. By utilizing the probability distribution of random communication delays, a distributed but deterministic delay model is established. In this model, the delay probability density function is treated as the distributed delay kernel. By developing a new Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional related to the distributed delay kernels and using an integral inequality, new sufficient conditions for the existence of a synchronization controller are presented. Finally, a numerical simulation and an application of encrypting the image are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed strategy.},

The UAVs dynamics model is described by the Newton–Euler formula, and the actuator faults are considered in the system model in the form of multiplicative factors and additive factors. Due to the underactuated characteristics of the UAVs, two objective attitude commands are generated by designing a virtual control signal, which are transmitted to the attitude subsystem, and then the position controller is solved. By constructing a distributed communication mechanism between UAVs, an adaptive formation control strategy is proposed, which can enable UAVs to update their position and speed online according to their neighbor information, and then achieve the required formation. In addition, a fuzzy adaptive sliding mode controller is designed to ensure that the tracking errors of UAVs converge to the neighborhood of the origin.

Previous research on telemedicine multicriteria decision making methods rarely consider the difference in responsibilities between remote experts and attending physicians. To show the difference precisely, this article first defines the intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (IHFLTS) as an extended mathematical expression of the fuzzy set. We propose two kinds of correlation measuring methods and related hesitancy degrees based on information energy and statistics with different application scenarios. Based on information entropy and distance measurement, two criterion weight determination methods are studied. To formally implement the joint decision-making process of remote experts and attending physicians, a telemedicine decision-making model is established for designing the teleconsultation decision support system. We apply the proposed methods to a sinusitis teleconsultation case to demonstrate their effectiveness. The weight determination methods are applied, and the influence of parameter variation in the distance-based method is analyzed. Finally, the rationality and applicability of the proposed methods are verified by comparisons. The results show that by considering the importance and differences between the two roles of teleconsultation, IHFLTS can obtain a more realistic result for the referral problems.},

First, a new layout coordinate system is defined to map Z-numbers to q-ROFSs. For convenience, Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS), a special form of q-ROFSs, is employed in this article. In this way, the parameters $A$ and $B$ in Z-numbers are transformed into the corresponding membership and nonmembership. At the same time, the genetic algorithm is adopted to derive the potential probability distribution. Next, an approach for calculating the weighted information entropy of Z-numbers is proposed, and the theorem proves the rationality. To integrate multiple Z-information, the linguistic Z-PFS weighted aggregation operator ( $LZPFSPWAO$ ) is presented. Also, a score function is defined with the help of curve length calculation formula in the coordinate system. Finally, a decision-making model is constructed based on the new solution. Two examples, UAV firefighting and energy investment selection, are adopted to demonstrate the validity. The comparison results show that the proposed method is effective and beneficial in solving Z-information.},

They have been successfully applied in the following fields: image processing, fuzzy rule-based systems, decision making, and computational brain interfaces. This notion of overlap indices is also necessary for applications in which type-2 fuzzy sets are required. In this article, we introduce the notion of type-$(2,k)$ overlap index ( $k \in \lbrace 0,1,2\rbrace$ ) in the setting of type-2 fuzzy sets. We describe both the reasons that have led to this notion and the relationships that naturally arise among the algebraic underlying structures. Finally, we illustrate how type- $(2,k)$ overlap indices can be employed in the setting of fuzzy rule-based systems when the involved objects are type-2 fuzzy sets.},

  abstract     = {Feature discretization algorithms of remote sensing images are often based on the assumption that a sample only belongs to a single category and cannot describe uncertainty caused by mixed pixels. Fuzzy rough models quantify uncertain information by introducing the memberships of pixels to each category. However, there are large errors in the decomposition model of mixed pixels, making the obtained memberships fuzzy. To overcome this weakness, we propose a feature discretization algorithm based on the generalized interval type-II fuzzy rough set for mixed pixels (GIT2FRSD). We use the fuzzy mean vector and the fuzzy covariance matrix to calculate the primary grades of pixels to each ground object and determine the secondary grades according to the distribution of pixels in the boundary region of the rough set. Then, we construct the fitness function using the magnitude of the reduction of the number of breakpoints and the average approximation precision of the generalized interval type-II fuzzy rough set and search for the best discrete breakpoints in all bands of the remote sensing image using an adaptive genetic algorithm. Our method further fuzzifies the abundance information, more accurately quantifying and evaluating the uncertainty caused by mixed pixels at a time complexity similar to that of the fuzzy rough model. The experimental results on GF-2 and Landsat 8 images show that compared with current mainstream discretization algorithms, our method has better search efficiency. It obtains the minimum number of discrete intervals while ensuring data consistency and achieves the highest classification accuracy.},

As such, a large amount of RDF data is readily available. Information in the real world is often uncertain, and uncertain RDF data models have been proposed and received increasing attention. Knowledge graph embedding is an effective way to perform vector projection of structured knowledge, after which we can infer a large-scale knowledge graph. Nowadays, knowledge graph embedding models are widely proposed, but most of them can only handle crisp information. In this article, we concentrate on modeling fuzzy RDF graphs in the vector space. We propose a fuzzy RDF knowledge graph embedding model (FRKGE), which can project the fuzzy entities and fuzzy relations with membership degree to the vector space. Our proposed model preserves the structure of the fuzzy RDF knowledge graph and the explicit expression of membership degree in the vector space, which provides a natural expression of fuzzy RDF tuples. Our experimental results demonstrate that the FRKGE model is competent for the task of representation learning for fuzzy RDF knowledge graphs.},

The new proposed DoS attack strategy has two main characteristics. First different from most of the existing DoS models, it is data-based, which mainly attacks the packets playing important roles in the system performance. Therefore, compared with the existing indiscriminate DoS attack approaches, the data-based DoS attack is more intelligent and can cause larger disruptions. Second, the proposed attack strategy is random, which has better concealment than the periodic or consecutive DoS attack models. Then, by using a stochastic method, the relationship among attack effect, attack probability, and attack parameter are analyzed and shown in Theorem 1 . Furthermore, if the attacks are energy-constrained, the relation between the attack rate threshold and the upper bound of the attack parameter is expressed analytically, which is shown in Theorem 2 . Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with some existing DoS models, the proposed stochastic data-based DoS attack strategy brings about greater destructiveness to the estimation quality of the systems, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed attack strategy from the attacker’s perspective.},

However, the lack of a decent quantitative relationship among categorical values makes traditional clustering approaches, which are usually developed for numerical data, perform poorly on categorical datasets. To solve this problem and boost the performance of clustering for categorical data, we propose a novel fuzzy clustering model in this article. At first, by approximating the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of a discrete distribution of data partition, a new fuzzy clustering objective function is designed for categorical data. The Bayesian dissimilarity measure is formulated in this objective to tackle the subtle relationships between categorical values efficiently. Then, to further enhance the performance of clustering, a novel Kullback–Leibler divergence-based graph regularization is integrated into the clustering objective to exploit the prior knowledge on datasets, for example, the information about correlations of data points. The proposed model is solved by the alternative optimization and the experimental results on the synthetic and real-world datasets show that it outperforms the classical and relevant state-of-the-art algorithms. We also present the parameter analysis of our approach, and conduct a comprehensive study on the effectiveness of the Bayesian dissimilarity measure and the KL divergence-based graph regularization.},

First, by constructing a dynamics-based feedback linearized robotic multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) system, an MPC-based WBC strategy is proposed for mobile manipulator. Such a strategy can provide the optimal control inputs with the specified optimization index and constraints. Thereafter, a primal-dual neural network effectively addresses the constrained quadratic programming (QP) problem over a finite receding horizon brought by the MPC. Then, in order to convert the intermediate control signals into the optimal control torques that can be executed by actuators, an adaptive FLS is employed to approximate the unknown dynamics. The novel elements of the current design control approach refer to the dynamics-based feedback linearized robotic MIMO system and the combination of an MPC module with an adaptive fuzzy controller. Finally, the trajectory tracking experiments performed on a mobile dual-arm robot demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The aptness of fuzzy clustering for data streams is further intensified given their concept evolving nature. Data streams can be clustered either by following clustering-by-variable approach or clustering-by-example approach. Most of the existing fuzzy clustering-by-variable methods are applicable to numeric data streams only. In this article, a fuzzy hierarchical clustering method is proposed for clustering multiple nominal data streams using clustering-by-variable approach. The fuzzy affinity of data streams to different clusters is calculated using normalized cosine similarity to the cluster centroids. It handles the concept evolution by updating the hierarchical clustering structure by either merging and/or splitting the nodes depending on the extent to which the node entropy changes. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed and compared to hierarchical clustering for multiple nominal data streams (HCND), semifuzzy online divisive-agglomerative clustering, and nTreeClus on synthetic as well as real-world web-browsing dataset where it has outperformed all three in terms of cluster quality as quantified by Dunn index, modified Hubert $\Gamma$ statistic, and adjusted rand index. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the proposed method is highly promising with regard to capturing fuzzy clusters as indicated by Xie-Beni index, partition coefficient, and partition entropy.},

The existing works considered only one of these cases for deterministic systems. In this article, the coexistence of both cases is considered with the help of Nussbaum functions and fuzzy logic systems, and the corresponding controllers and auxiliary variables are not only codesigned to solve the problem, but also extended to stochastic multiagent systems. Then, an improved switching threshold event-triggered mechanism is proposed to reduce the communication burden of the control channel. Furthermore, the leaderless asymptotic consensus control scheme for stochastic multiagent systems is proposed. The boundedness of all signals and leaderless asymptotic consensus control performance are guaranteed via the Lyapunov stability theorem.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the hierarchical synthesis of fuzzy fault-tolerant controllers for networked perturbed mechanical systems to solve the problem of finite-time multitarget surrounding, namely, encircling multiple moving targets in a finite time. Given the system with actuator failures, faults, and perturbations (namely, parametric uncertainties and external disturbances), we propose a hierarchical framework for synthesizing a cascade-form controller to stabilize the system state in a finite time, as well as decouple and solve the abovementioned problem. Specifically, the methods of fuzzy logic systems and finite-time adaptive laws are included within the synthesized controller to approximate the unknown perturbations, and meanwhile to compensate the negative effects of the actuator failures and faults. By employing the theories of perturbations and fault-tolerant analysis, we derive the sufficient conditions on control gains for finite-time convergence of the closed-loop system. Finally, we carry out several simulation experiments on a network of six 2-DOF robots and four moving targets to verify the performance of the synthesis method and the obtained controller.},

  abstract     = {Multicontext systems provide an effective representation and reasoning framework for integrating heterogeneous knowledge obtained from different sources and have been applied in different fields. Because many application fields in real life have to deal with uncertain and fuzzy knowledge, this article aims to combine the multicontext system and fuzzy logic theory effectively and systematically to deal with the representation and reasoning of uncertainty in heterogeneous contexts. The current research in this area is still relatively limited, especially in terms of systematic integration. Specifically, this article proposes a class of heterogeneous nonmonotonic fuzzy multicontext systems based on nonmonotonic multicontext systems, in which an abstract logic is proposed to capture different types of logic and is used as a theoretical basis for fuzzy multicontext knowledge representation and setting up bridging rules to integrate heterogeneous knowledge. Fuzzy equilibria are used to describe the semantics of fuzzy multicontext systems. The syntactic and semantic framework of heterogeneous nonmonotonic fuzzy multicontext systems is then systematically established. Finally, we show that the proposed fuzzy multicontext system not only extends the nonmonotonic multicontext system to fuzzy settings, but also could expand the probabilistic multicontext system and the possibilistic multicontext system in the similar way.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a novel composite learning framework for interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) to train regression models with a high accuracy performance and capable of representing uncertainty. In this context, we identify three challenges, first, the uncertainty handling capability, second, the construction of the composite loss, and third, a learning algorithm that overcomes the training complexity while taking into account the definitions of IT2-FLSs. This article presents a systematic solution to these problems by exploiting the type-reduced set of IT2-FLS via fusing quantile regression and deep learning (DL) with IT2-FLS. The uncertainty processing capability of IT2-FLS depends on employed center-of-sets calculation methods, while its representation capability is defined via the structure of its antecedent and consequent membership functions. Thus, we present various parametric IT2-FLSs and define the learnable parameters of all IT2-FLSs alongside their constraints to be satisfied during training. To construct the loss function, we define a multiobjective loss and then convert it into a constrained composite loss composed of the log-cosh loss for accuracy purposes and a tilted loss for uncertainty representation, which explicitly uses the type-reduced set. We also present a DL approach to train IT2-FLS via unconstrained optimizers. In this context, we present parameterization tricks for converting the constraint optimization problem of IT2-FLSs into an unconstrained one without violating the definitions of fuzzy sets. Finally, we provide comprehensive comparative results for hyperparameter sensitivity analysis and an inter/intramodel comparison on various benchmark datasets.},

The proposed reciprocally convex method encompasses some previous methods as exceptional examples by introducing a matrix-valued polynomial. Moreover, an asymmetric L–K functional with delay-product terms is proposed for the stability of the T–S fuzzy systems.

  abstract     = {A novel structure of reinforced two-stream fuzzy neural networks (TSFNNs) realized with the aid of fuzzy logic and transfer learning method is presented. This architecture consists of a TSFNN and a fusion strategy. TSFNN architecture consists of two combined networks of both fuzzy rules-based radial basis function neural networks (FRBFNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In the TSFNN architecture, one stream employs the deep CNN to extract the spatial information of images and effectively learn the high-level features and another stream uses the FRBFNN to analyze the distribution of data points over the input space and learn to capture complex relationships in data. In the fusion strategy, the outputs of two streams are concatenated by a softmax function, which normalizes the output to a probability distribution. A transfer learning method is considered to reconstruct new data representation as the inputs of CNN to mine potential spatial features of data. Moreover, L 2 -norm regularization is used to alleviate the possible overfitting and enhance the generalization ability. The proposed method not only inherits the advantages of FRBFNN and CNN such as global feature extraction ability, good local approximating performance, ability of handling uncertainty by fuzzy logic but also improves the classification performance under the synergy between two-stream architecture and the fusion strategy. Experimental results obtained for a diversity of datasets as well as partial discharge datasets be using in the real life of fault diagnosis and black plastic wastes datasets for recycling confirm the effectiveness of the proposed TSFNN. A comprehensive comparative analysis is covered. This design can simultaneously capture different level information of inputs and easing the insufficient problem of extracting features from a single steam. Especially, we show that the synergistic effect of FRBFNN, CNN, enabling deep learning for generic classification tasks and multipoint crossover, and L 2 -norm regularization can effectively improve the performance of the TSFNNs.},

  abstract     = {Kernel clustering has the ability to get the inherent nonlinear structure of the data. But the high computational complexity and the unknown representation of the kernel space make it unavailable for the data clustering in distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. To solve this issue, we propose a new series of random feature-based collaborative kernel clustering algorithms in this article. In the most basic algorithm, each node in a distributed P2P network first maps its data into a low-dimensional random feature space with the approximation of the given kernel by using the random Fourier feature mapping method. Then, each node independently searches the clusters with its local data and the collaborative knowledge from its neighbor nodes, and the distributed clustering is performed among all network nodes until reaching the global consensus result, i.e., all nodes have the same cluster centers. In addition, an improved version is designed with assignment of feature weights, which is optimized by the maximum-entropy technique to extract important features for the cluster identification. What’s more, to relief the impact of different kernel functions and related parameters on clustering results, the combination of multiple kernels rather than a single kernel is adopted for the low-dimensional approximation, and the optimized weights are assigned to provide the guidance on the choice of the kernels and their parameters and discover significant features at the same time. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed methods achieve similar and even better results than the traditional kernel clustering methods on various performance metrics, including the average classification rate, the average normalized mutual information, and the average adjusted rand index. More importantly, the low-dimensional random features approximated to kernels and the distributed clustering mechanism adopted in these methods bring the greatly lower temporal complexity.},

  abstract     = {The spread of electric vehicles (EVs) could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve sustainable travel patterns. However, the rapidly increasing charging demand will bring challenges to the operation of charging stations and power systems. Therefore, a two-stage EV management scheme is introduced in this article to overcome these challenges and promote sustainable transport. A charging dispatch model based on fuzzy multicriteria decision making is proposed in the first stage, where users&#39; preferences are in the form of intuitionistic fuzzy sets to address the fuzziness and uncertainty of subjective factors and human judgment. A $\sigma$ -cut similarity matrix is proposed to increase the users&#39; satisfaction by excluding options with lower similarity. In the second stage, a noncooperative game model is proposed to incentive EVs to participate in supplementary frequency regulation (SFR). A fuzzy set is employed to reflect users&#39; willingness to adjust charging power. The existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium are investigated. Moreover, a distributed proximal best response algorithm with linear convergence is employed to find Nash equilibrium. Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed method can reduce charging costs while meeting users&#39; preferences and facilitate EVs to participate in SFR.},

  abstract     = {Airports and their related operations have become the major bottlenecks to the entire air traffic management system, raising predictability, safety, and environmental concerns. One of the underpinning techniques for digital and sustainable air transport is airport ground movement optimization. Currently, real ground movement data is made freely available for the majority of aircraft at many airports. However, the recorded data is not accurate enough due to measurement errors and general uncertainties. In this article, we aim to develop a new interval type-2 fuzzy logic-based map matching algorithm, which can match each raw data point to the correct airport segment. To this aim, we first specifically design a set of interval type-2 Sugeno fuzzy rules and their associated rule weights, as well as the model output, based on preliminary experiments and sensitivity tests. Then, the fuzzy membership functions are fine-tuned by a particle swarm optimization algorithm. Moreover, an extra checking step using the available data is further integrated to improve map matching accuracy. Using the real-world aircraft movement data at Hong Kong airport, we compared the developed algorithm with other well known map matching algorithms. Experimental results show that the designed interval type-2 fuzzy rules have the potential to handle map matching uncertainties, and the extra checking step can effectively improve map matching accuracy. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated to be robust and achieve the best map matching accuracy of over 96\% without compromising the run time.},

We constructed the structural embedding by maintaining the relationship between the nodes based on the network structure and the neighbors of the nodes. This approach was then used to learn the latent representation based on the deviation points in the road network structure. We generated a set of sequences using a hierarchical multilayer network and a biased random walk. This research proposes a fuzzy contrast-based model that identifies deviation points using the deep network for weighted position nodes. This sequence is used to fine-tune the embedding of the nodes. We then averaged the embedding values of the nodes to obtain the travel embedding. Next, we extracted the embedding of the contrast set using a pairwise classification approach based on similarity metrics. Numerical studies show that the proposed learning trajectory embedding approach successfully captures the structural identity and outperforms competing strategies. The deep contrast set approach enables highly accurate detection of outliers in the trajectory and deviation locations.},

  abstract     = {The Chinese rail network has a fast-growing number of containers in service to promote intermodal transport service and to attract more freight demand to the railway for a sustainable transport system. The repositioning of empty containers induces a significant problem for the large-scale rail network, due to the spatial imbalance between freight supply and demand. Traditionally, the empty container repositioning (ECR) problem is solved with the estimated parameters of a given demand distribution, which may difficult known to decision maker. This article develops a data-driven framework for the ECR problem based on the large datasets available. This framework employs machine-learning algorithms to forecast the supply/demand of empty containers, and to draw parameters identifying the factors that can be hardly integrated into optimization models. Based on those parameters, two optimization models for different ECR modes are then proposed to explore the optimal ECR plan. An integrated weight coefficient is introduced into the objective functions, which minimizes the total kilometers that empty containers transported. The models are solved by CPLEX after constraints conversion based on triangular fuzzy supply/demand. The numerical results based on a real-world case show that the proposed solution method can yield the optimal empty container repositioning plan. The total container-kilometer may increase after data-driven parameters are introduced, as some of the empty container repositioning may no longer follow the shortest path, while the final plan becomes more practicable and executable.},

Then, the stability criteria are established by balancing the state divergence produced from the unstable mode and destabilizing switching behavior through the stabilizing switching behavior. The obtained results are suitable for the situation where all modes are unstable and applied to the design of the state feedback controller. The designed controller relaxes the stabilization assumption for the mode of the fuzzy system. Finally, the simulation illustrates the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method.},

This applies in particular to logistic data, which is used to predict costs, times, and organization of travel routes. Data anomalies may endanger the welfare and safety of transport users, goods, handling companies, and consumers. Moreover, they contribute to the overexploitation of the natural environment. Therefore, it is extremely important to find methods that are responsible for their effective detection. The desired approach may be the Choquet integral and its extensions, which in various applications have proven that with their help it is possible to efficiently increase the quality of the classification measured, for example, with the help of the accuracy. Due to the fact that the Choquet integral is resistant to data fluctuations and takes into account the quality (significance) of the information source, it appears to be an effective proposition for the final determination of what data, or more precisely, which records can be considered anomalous. The innovative approach to analyze transport data has not been used before. This article considers four publicly available databases covering different fields of application of transport systems. In a series of comprehensive numerical experiments, the Choquet integral-based approach has proven high efficiency for each of them. Moreover, we made a comparative analysis of the solutions before applying the Choquet integral and the results after its application.},

The high-density parking lots using parking robots can greatly improve space utilization. However, there is a great collision risk in the parking lot&#39;s tight space navigation. So, precise LIDAR localization and trajectory tracking control are the key technologies of autonomous driving along a predetermined path. Due to the laser points’ sparse character, the LIDAR points’ extracted features have distribution errors. In order to further optimize the LIDAR&#39;s localization, this article establishes the feature&#39;s error ellipsoid model, and the model&#39;s information and error entropies are calculated separately. The error entropy is utilized to optimize the feature-matching weight and improve the localization accuracy. Based on the higher localization result, a state-of-the-art lateral tracking model is proposed to address the challenges faced by the long parking robot. Then, the adaptive fuzzy control is designed to achieve precise control of wheel motion. Finally, an experimental platform is built to compare the effectiveness of different positioning and tracking algorithms. The comparison results show that the integration of laser evaluation localization and lateral tracking optimization algorithm can provides a collision-free improvement of 50\% in the parking lot&#39;s tight spaces.},

However, it is easy to fall into a local optimal and overfitting under partially observed environments. Because each agent lacks the information that plays a key role in decision making beyond the observation field. Even if communication is allowed, the received informations in communication channel have large noise due to the observations of other agents and strong uncertainty if the agent&#39;s policy is used as the communication information. To tackle this problem, two-stream fused fuzzy deep neural network (2s-FDNN) was proposed to reduce the uncertainty and noise of information in the communication channel. It is a parallel structure in which the fuzzy inference module reduces the uncertainty of information and the deep neural module reduces the noise of information. Then, we presented Fuzzy MA2C which integrates 2s-FDNN into multiagent deep RL to deal with uncertain communication informations for improving the robustness and generalization under partially observed environments. We empirically evaluate our methods in two large-scale traffic signal control environments using simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) simulator.

  abstract     = {As a key technology to perform sustainable development in transportation, electric vehicles have been largely welcomed due to their advantages in energy savings and low carbon emission. The main step in promoting these vehicles is the selection of the appropriate electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) site. EVCS site selection is a laborious task because it involves a series of conflicting quantitative and qualitative criteria from several dimensions. The quantitative criteria are usually expressed by numerical data, while qualitative criteria are commonly represented by linguistic terms. Furthermore, the linguistic terms generated by different decision makers are usually defined on multigranular linguistic term sets. In this article, we present a new decision-making framework to select sustainable EVCS sites within the context of heterogeneous information and multigranular linguistic terms. First, three information transformation mechanisms are defined to unify the heterogeneous information and multigranular linguistic terms into interval-valued belief structures. Afterward, shadowed sets theory is utilized to reflect the personalized individual semantics of linguistic terms. Then, with the aid of the evidential reasoning (ER) algorithm, a new information fusion method is proposed to generate the interval-valued expected utilities of alternatives. Subsequently, an improved minimax regret approach is developed to compare and rank the interval-valued expected utilities. The proposed decision-making framework is then implemented to solve a case study for EVCS site selection. Further analysis and comparisons with other methods are also conducted to show the applicability and feasibility of the current proposal.},

Integrating public transportation into the metaverse could improve services and collect user data. This article introduces a hybrid decision-making framework for prioritizing sustainable public transportation in Metaverse under q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS) context. In this regard, first, q-rung orthopair fuzzy (q-ROF) generalized Dombi weighted aggregation operators and their characteristics are developed to aggregate the q-ROF information. Second, a q-ROF information-based method using the removal effects of criteria and stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis models are proposed to find the objective and subjective weights of criteria, respectively. Then, a combined weighting model is taken to determine the final weights of the criteria. Third, the weighted sum product method is extended to q-ROFS context by considering the double normalization procedures, the proposed operators and integrated weighting model. This method has taken the advantages of two normalization processes and four utility measures that approve the effect of benefit and cost criteria by using weighted sum and weighted product models. Next, to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the presented method, a case study of sustainable public transportation in metaverse is presented in the context of q-ROFSs. The findings of this article confirms that the proposed model can recommend more feasible performance while facing numerous influencing factors and input uncertainties, and thus, provides a wider range of applications.},

This feature constitutes a considerable drawback in real-life scenarios, mainly when dealing with environmental and sustainable strategic problems. In this regard, sustainable transportation problems incorporate both technical variables and subjective assessments whose values can be strategically reported by experts. We extend a real-life study case accounting for the evaluations of several experts to demonstrate the importance of strategic incentives for the rankings obtained when implementing MCDM techniques.

Despite this limitation, the benchmarking of IOCs falls under the complex multicriteria decision making (MCDM) because of the use of several evaluation criteria and their varying datasets and the varying importance of these criteria. Moreover, the issues involving the use of imprecise, unclear, and ambiguous information remain unresolved in the existing multiattribute decision-making methods. The robustness of the multiobjective optimization on the basis of ratio analysis (MULTIMOORA, i.e., an updated version of MOORA) plus full-multiplicative form method and that of the fuzzy-weighted with zero inconsistency (FWZIC) method have been proven. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel benchmarking of oil companies by extending the linear Diophantine fuzzy rough sets (LDFRSs) into the MCDM methods to help build a sustainable transportation industry. The proposed methodology consists of two phases. The initial phase involves assigning values to the evaluation criteria of IOCs to formulate the evaluation decision matrix. The second phase involves the development of two fuzzy MCDM methods, namely, the LDFRS with the FWZIC method (hereafter called LDFRS–FWZIC) for weighting the criterion of each IOC and the LDFRS with the MULTIMOORA method (hereafter called LDFRS–MULTIMOORA) for benchmarking the IOCs. The IOCs were evaluated based on 2 criteria, 9 subcriteria, and 47 measurement items by 483 experts from 11 IOCs. Results revealed the following: 1) LDFRS–FWZIC can effectively weigh the evaluation criteria of IOCs. The highest final weight of 0.2594 was for “cost leadership” (C2-1), whereas the lowest weights of 0.1148 was for “priority of other external matters” (C1-2) and “insufficient supply”(C1-4), and 2) LDFRS–MULTIMOORA can successfully benchmark the IOCs. IOC11 ranked first, followed by IOC10 and IOC3 in the second and third ranks, respectively. IOC4 ranked the lowest (rank = 11 ). A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the robustness of the developed fuzzy MCDM methods.},

  abstract     = {Spatially synergizing the urban rail transit (URT) network integrated with its feeder transit system and the urban form plays an important role in improving the effectiveness of URT in mitigating traffic congestion, reducing air pollution, optimizing urban spatial structure, etc. This article mainly focuses on assessing the spatial synergy between the two parts by specifying the assessment criteria that can effectively characterize the spatial synergic mechanism between the two parts and developing a novel multicriteria large-scale group assessment (MCLSGA) model, in which basic uncertain linguistic information (BULI), as an extended form of fuzzy linguistic approach, is used to model and process the subjective assessment information (Assess-Inf) elicited by experts. In order to alleviate the computing complexity, an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm is introduced to cluster the Assess-Inf given by a huge number of experts as per the organizers’ expected discrimination level on reliability-related Assess-Inf. A method for weighting the clusters is then proposed to control the roles played by the items of the Assess-Inf, representing each cluster and having different reliability levels in their fusing process to tap into wisdom of crowds (WOC) while accommodating the organizers’ trust level in the reliability-related Assess-Inf given by experts. Afterward, the best–worst method is extended to the BULI-based large-scale group assessment context with the aim of accurately weighting the criteria by drawing on WOC. Finally, a case study on assessing the spatial synergy between Chongqing’s integrated URT system and urban form is conducted to validate the validity of the proposed MCLSGA model.},

This article proposes a new interpretable model based on graph community neural network and time-series fuzzy decision tree. This model can well capture the influence of spatiotemporal characteristics, train community structure, and multifactor in high-speed train station delay prediction. Besides, the time series fuzzy decision tree based on multiobjective optimization and reduced error pruning can mine potential decision rules to improve the model&#39;s interpretability, transparency, and high reliability. Finally, we prove that the prediction effect of the proposed model is superior than the other seven state-of-the-art models and our model is interpretable.},

It not only aims to help city logistics companies sustainably decarbonize urban freight distribution but also provide valuable practical guidelines. To evaluate zero-emission LMD solutions, this article presents a novel multicriteria group decision-making methodology with dual hesitant fuzzy (DHF) sets. First, we propose some improved operations on DHF elements and investigate their vital properties. Second, based on these operations, we develop DHF improved weighted averaging operator to overcome the drawbacks of the existing operators on DHF sets. Third, for measuring the weights of criteria, a new model called the cross-entropy-based optimization model (CEBOM) is developed. Fourth, for the rational aggregation of the preferences, we formulate a new method namely score-based double normalized measurement alternatives and ranking according to the compromise solution (SDNMARCOS). The proposed DNMARCOS method couples the linear and vector normalization techniques. It is composed of the complete compensatory model and the incomplete compensatory model. Thus, SDNMARCOS is more robust compared to the available state-of-the-art approaches. To exhibit the applicability of the proposed DHF-CEBOM-SDNMARCOS methodology in real-world settings, a case study for one of the largest Austrian logistics companies in Serbia is provided. The research findings show that electric light commercial vehicles are the best LMD solution. Also, it is recommended to consider electric cargo bikes as a viable mid-term solution. The superiority of the introduced methodology is demonstrated through the comparative investigation.},

However, the presence of many evaluation criteria, criteria tradeoffs, criteria conflict, and criteria importance categorize the evaluation and selection of pavement strategies under complex multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. To date, no study has presented an evaluation framework for selecting the most optimal pavement strategy to be utilized as a way to achieve sustainable transportation considering multicriteria evaluation of pavement strategies and sustainable solutions. This article presents a pavement strategy selection based on a new extension of fuzzy MCDM methods. The methodology is developed in two phases. First, the evaluation decision matrix is formulated on the basis of intersecting the “evaluation criteria” and “pavement strategies list.” Second, the proposed MCDM methods are developed: multilayer dual hesitant fuzzy weighted zero inconsistency (DH-FWZIC) to assign weights to the pavement&#39;s evaluation criteria followed by dual hesitant fuzzy decision by opinion score method (DH-FDOSM) for selecting the best pavement strategy. Four alternatives, namely, flexible/asphalt, rigid/concrete, reflective, and permeable alternatives pavement strategies, are evaluated on the basis of 30 criteria. Results show the following. 1) The multilayer DH-FWZIC method has weighted the pavement strategies’ evaluation criteria at three layers in a consistent manner, showing that a region&#39;s environment criterion has the highest final weight (0.1215) and the lowest importance value (0.0089) assigned for its windy criterion. 2) According to DH-FDOSM, the flexible/asphalt pavement achieved the first rank among the four pavement strategies. Finally, the robustness of the developed framework was assessed by conducting sensitivity analysis and comparison study.},

  abstract     = {Assigning shipping orders to the most appropriate driver in the shortest time but with the highest profit is one of the major concerns of transportation companies. Many studies have been conducted on transportation service procurement systems; however, due to the lack of a framework for modeling human interactions, none of them has used the concept of information diffusion for this purpose. In this article, a monoplex weighted drivers’ collaboration network is developed to model drivers’ relationships within the transportation system. Besides, to identify and track communities during a given time interval of the network, a new community detection algorithm, called dynamic overlapping community detection (DOCD) algorithm, is designed, which can identify viable leaders in each community. In addition to detecting community leaders, the algorithm is able to monitor, assess, and detect the durability of these community leaders over time, which other algorithms are not able to. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, it is compared with five different algorithms in terms of 14 evaluation measures. The results show the proposed DOCD algorithm outperforms the other algorithms with 88\% superiority in the evaluation measures. Then, a fuzzy profit maximization model is developed using information diffused by the identified communities’ viable leaders and information diffusion power of each community. Analyzing a real case study obtains two achievements in the form of “high-risk scenario” and “low-risk scenario” for well-known and novice transportation companies, respectively. Therefore, the obtained results show that transportation companies allocate orders to drivers based on their reputation and risk levels.},

  abstract     = {Transportation networks are essential to the operation of societies and economies. Protecting the privacy of sensitive information is a meaningful conception in sustainable transport when mining the transportation data. In data mining, differential privacy (DP) has provable privacy guarantees for releasing sensitive data by introducing randomness into query results. However, it suffers from significant accuracy loss of outputs when the query has high sensitivity (e.g., triangle counting). The reason is that the range of random perturbation to each query result in DP is too large. It consists of all possible output values for a query that forms a large or even unbounded interval. However, when impose perturbation only in a small neighborhood of the true query result, the similarity measure based on randomness in DP fails. Thereupon, we introduce fuzziness into DP to formulate new models which have smaller disturbance via fuzzy similarity measures. In this article, we establish a novel and general theory of private data analysis, fuzzy differential privacy (FDP). The new theory FDP aims to acquire a more flexible tradeoff between the accuracy of outputs and the privacy-preserving level of data. FDP combines DP with fuzzy set theory by introducing fuzziness into the query results and characterizing similarities between outputs via multiple fuzzy similarity measures. From this perspective, DP can be viewed as a special case of FDP with probabilistic similarity measure. Compared with DP, FDP has three superiorities: 1) most fuzzy similarity measures in FDP support sliding window perturbation strategies we proposed, which refer to perturbation in a small neighborhood of the query results; 2) FDP adds noise to the query results only according to a fraction of all possible neighboring datasets; and 3) the fuzzy similarity with valued in [0,1] quantifies the privacy protection level intuitively. These three points enable more accurate outputs while providing provable and intuitive privacy guarantees. As for subgraph counting, the state-of-the-art method is ladder framework in DP. We illustrate FDP mechanisms by applying them to a common application in subgraph counting–triangle/4-cliques counting. Experiments show that FDP is effective and efficient with smaller output errors than DP.},

Sustainable transport has gained widespread recognition by countries, local governments, cities, and transport authorities around the world to bring about positive change for the environment, ensure wider accessibility, and reduce carbon emissions. Many countries and cities have redesigned their transport systems to make them more sustainable. Road vehicles, such as cars, trucks, buses, and two-and three-wheeled vehicles, account for almost three-quarters of CO2 emissions in transport. Emissions from them continue to increase, and more international policy and cooperation focus is needed in these areas. Fuzzy decision systems are one of the most important advances in computational intelligence. The recent theoretical developments in the area of fuzzy decision systems provide novel perspectives for the key mechanisms of decision making and information processing that can handle uncertain, ambiguous, noisy, and missed input information in sustainable transport problems and decisions.},

That is, the membership grade is equal to the value of the fixed point ( $\nu$ ) of the underlying complement (negation) operator. The fixed point of the standard Zadeh negation is 0.5. In fuzzy set theory, the complement of a fuzzy set can be defined using a strong complement (negation) operator that differs from the standard Zadeh negation. In this case, the fixed point of the strong complement (negation) operator is not necessarily 0.5. In this short paper, we present the concept of a parametric fuzziness measure called the $\nu$ -maximal vagueness measure. This new measure may be regarded as a generalized fuzziness measure. Here, we present an operator system-dependent kernel, which we call the $\nu$ -maximal vagueness entropy, and using this, we construct a $\nu$ -maximal vagueness measure. The proposed vagueness entropy is based on a common generator function of a strict triangular norm and a strong negation operator. The $\nu$ -maximal vagueness entropy is flexible and operator-dependent, and it can be readily adapted to a continuous-valued logical system. Furthermore, the parameter $\nu$ has a clear semantic meaning.},

Therefore, in order to realize interference alignment, this work intends to characterize classical codes through the framework of fuzzy set theory for quantizing real-valued channel coefficients. Thenceforward, from the classical framework nested real lattice codes are constructed by using construction A of nested real ideal lattices and, therefore, through normal fuzzy subgroups this work shows that the constructed quotient groups of the nested real ideal lattices relative to normal fuzzy subgroups of these nested real ideal lattices are nested vector spaces and, consequently, such nested quotient groups have the structure of a linear code, are isomorphic to the nested real lattice codes and defined by linear fuzzy codes. Through such an isomorphism and the construction of the nested quotient groups relative to normal fuzzy subgroups, it is possible to conclude that the codewords of these nested linear fuzzy codes are in a one-to-one correspondence to membership vectors. Through the constructed nested quotient groups, that is, nested linear fuzzy codes, this work supplies how to quantize real-valued channel coefficients onto these nested quotient groups in order to realize interference alignment and, consequently, it is possible to encode an arbitrary real-valued channel coefficient by a codeword from a linear fuzzy code.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of quantitative trading, stock selection is an ongoing task that requires consideration of the characteristics of stocks and investment strategies. Fuzzy set theory is excellent for modeling and describing abstract characteristics to establish the link between stocks and strategies. In this article, we present our idea for a stock selection system called TripleS. It is based on the suitability index (SI) derived from fuzzy-set theory. The TripleS relies on the position size to extract the stock characteristics SI that describes not only the characteristics of each stock but also the extent to which they are suitable for certain strategies. Then, the SI undergoes a transformation process in the hands of the developed fuzzy-set modules for stock selection and investment. There are some other proposed methods for stock selection respectively called TripleS-T1, TripleS-T2, TripleS-T2U, TripleS-EF, and TripleS-EFT. Experimental results show that the proposed TripleS has minor improvement in precision but significant improvement in investment performance. The TripleS-EFT has outstanding profitability, the highest annual return in all strategies, and the highest Sharpe ratio in two of the four strategies, and achieves an annual return of 10.01\% and a Sharpe ratio of 1.032, which significantly outperform the benchmark system. The TripleS-EFT also significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art fuzzy-based system in measuring annual return and even has double the annual return in several strategies.},

  abstract     = {Compared with group decision making (GDM), it is more difficult to reach a consensus in large-scale group decision making (LSGDM) owing to the large number of decision makers (DMs). Moreover, studies on LSGDM under social trust networks are obviously fewer than those on GDM, and rarely utilize opinion dynamics to analyze the interaction of DMs. Therefore, in the context of multi-criteria large-scale group decision making (MCLSGDM), an MCLSGDM consensus decision framework and a bounded confidence-based consensus optimization model are proposed. First, a trust propagation method considering the relative importance of the trust degrees (TDs) is proposed. Then, a two-stage process of obtaining DMs’ opinions based on opinion dynamics is developed to analyze the interaction of DMs before clustering. Furthermore, a new method for determining the heterogeneous weights of DMs and subgroups is discussed. Finally, to consider the adjustment willingness of DMs, this study proposes a two-stage optimization consensus model based on bounded confidence. In addition, a numerical example is used to further elaborate the above methods and models, and highlight their rationality and superiority through a series of simulation experiments and comparative analysis.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale group decision making (LSGDM) is a common decision-making activity in which experts elicit their preferences through preference relations with consistencies based on additive properties. LSGDM has become a popular topic in decision making because of its necessity and applicability in multiple fields. In LSGDM, the consensus reaching process (CRP) ensures that decision makers (DMs) agree on the final decision-making results. Therefore, it is significant to investigate the CRP to improve the LSGDM process. In this article, a new method for LSGDM that includes a clustering algorithm, a weight determination method, and a CRP is developed. First, based on the consensus and the consistency of the additive preference relation, the DMs are classified into different subgroups by using the k -means clustering algorithm. Then, because different subgroups have distinct decision-making interests, a weight determination method based on a cooperative game is proposed. Furthermore, to measure the consensus of each subgroup more comprehensively, the intra- and interconsensus levels are defined. These consensus levels are divided into four scenarios (acceptable–acceptable, acceptable–unacceptable, unacceptable–acceptable, and unacceptable–unacceptable) according to predetermined thresholds. Furthermore, different feedback mechanisms based on multiobjective optimization models corresponding to different CRP scenarios are presented. Finally, an illustrative example and comparative analyses are provided to verify the feasibility and validity of the proposed method.},

The nonlinear plant with parameter uncertainties is represented as a class of IT2 T–S fuzzy systems, and a novel resilient adaptive event-triggered scheme (AETS) against stochastic sampling and DoS attacks is proposed. In the designing process of the fuzzy filter, a novel resilient switched IT2 T–S fuzzy filter that switches according to the DoS attacks is applied. Then, the switched stochastic delayed systems model with a favorable form is established for the filtering-error-system. Based on the Lyapunov–Krasovskii stability theory and switched stochastic delayed systems theory, the relaxed stability condition is derived, which can ensure that the filtering-error-system is stochastically exponentially stable (SES) where the decay rate is indicated, the maximum frequency of DoS attacks is revealed, and an $H_{\infty }$ disturbance attenuation performance is guaranteed. Also, the codesign algorithm is further developed to implement the codesign of fuzzy filter and resilient AETS.

Simultaneously, the positive definiteness constraint for the individual matrix in Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional can be further relaxed. Then, via constructing a novel fuzzy Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (FLKF) together with a fuzzy-dependent-switching scheme, the available features of fuzzy membership functions (FMFs) can be further taken into consideration to increase the design flexibility.

However, it suffers from some challenges, including the curse of dimensionality and the sensitivity to the choice of the optimizer. The former has been alleviated by our previously proposed high-dimensional TSK (HTSK) algorithm. In this article, we point out that the latter is caused by the gradient vanishing problem on the rule consequent parameters, which in turn is caused by the small magnitude of the normalized rule firing levels, especially when the number of rules is large. Thus, the rule consequents are easily trapped into a bad local minimum with poor generalization performance. We propose to use first layer normalization (LN) to amplify the small firing levels, and then rectified linear unit (ReLU) to discard rules far away from the current training sample. We evaluated our proposed HTSK-LN and HTSK-LN-ReLU on twelve regression datasets with various sizes and dimensionalities. Experiments demonstrated that they can significantly improve the generalization performance, regardless of the training set size, feature dimensionality, choice of the optimizer, and rulebase size.},

A novel fuzzy-based optimization and control method of soft exosuit is proposed to provide plantarflexion assistance for human walking by changing the human–robot interaction. In particular, a fuzzy neurodynamics optimization is developed to learn the unknown human ankle impedance parameters automatically. A fuzzy approximation technique is applied to improve the control performance of the exosuit when a human is walking with unknown human–robot interaction model parameters. This control scheme guarantees that the human–robot dynamics follows a target human ankle impedance model to obtain the compliant interaction performance. Experiments on different participants verify the effectiveness of the control scheme. Results show that a compliant human–robot interaction is achieved by learning the human–environment interaction parameters, i.e., the human ankle parameters. It indicates that our proposed method can facilitate exosuit control to achieve compliant robot–human–environment interaction.},

In the command filtered implementation approach, analytical computation of the fractional derivatives of the stabilizing functions is not necessary. Therefore, the controller and adaptive law of the systems are easier to derive and implement. Based on the proposed command filter, adaptive backstepping technique, and fractional Lyapunov’s direct method, a novel adaptive fuzzy finite-time controller is designed, which can guarantee that the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin in finite time, and other signals of the closed-loop systems are semiglobal uniform ultimate bounded. In the design process of the controller, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are employed to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, and an auxiliary function is adopted to compensate for the unknown external disturbance and approximation errors of FLSs.

First, a robust fuzzy rough approximation space is constructed by a neighborhood adaptive $\beta$ -precision fuzzy rough set model to enhance the robustness and antinoise ability of the fuzzy rough set model. Second, uncertainty measures in robust fuzzy rough approximation space are defined to analyze the interactivity and redundancy of pairwise features on graph structure. Then, a strategy of Interactive Retainment, Weakly Correlated Removal, and Max-Dependent Selection is devised to guide feature grouping and selection. Experiments are performed on 21 datasets to evaluate the performance of FGS-RFRAS and demonstrate its significance. The robustness test indicates that it is antinoise for mislabeling.},

  abstract     = {The law of total probability plays an essential role in Bayesian reasoning, which has been used in many fields. However, some experiments show the law of total probability can be violated. In recent years, researchers have tried to explain this paradox with the interference effect in quantum theory, and they think the main reason for interference effects is the uncertain information in the decision-making process. Therefore, how to effectively model and process the uncertain information in the decision-making process is very important to understand and predict the interference effects. Zadeh proposed the fuzzy set by considering the fuzziness of information. Later, Atanassov proposed the intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS). IFS better describes the fuzzy information from the view of membership, nonmembership than fuzzy sets, which can also more flexibly simulate human decision making. Hence, the article proposed the fuzzy Markov decision-making model (FDM) under the framework of IFS to explain and predict the interference effects of decision-making process. In FDM, intuitionistic fuzzy number can be generated by using the negation operation of probability. In addition, the transition matrix can be obtained by using the Kolmogorov equation, which can consider the evolution time in the decision-making process. The transition matrix establishes the relationship between different stages to get the fuzzy numbers of final states. Finally, the article used the Dempster–Shafer evidence theory to transform fuzzy number into the probability. In summary, the proposed FDM can provide a novel idea to explore and explain the interference effects in the decision-making process, which is helpful to promote the development of artificial intelligence.},

  abstract     = {The Choquet integral (CI) is an averaging aggregation function that has been used, e.g., in the fuzzy reasoning method (FRM) of fuzzy rule-based classification systems (FRBCSs) and in multicriteria decision making in order to take into account the interactions among data/criteria. Several generalizations of the CI have been proposed in the literature in order to improve the performance of FRBCSs and also to provide more flexibility in the different models by relaxing both the monotonicity requirement and averaging conditions of aggregation functions. An important generalization is the $C_{F}$ -integrals, which are preaggregation functions that may present interesting nonaveraging behavior depending on the function $F$ adopted in the construction and, in this case, offering competitive results in classification. Recently, the concept of d-Choquet integrals was introduced as a generalization of the CI by restricted dissimilarity functions (RDFs), improving the usability of CIs, as when comparing inputs by the usual difference may not be viable. The objective of this article is to introduce the concept of $dC_{F}$ -integrals, which is a generalization of $C_{F}$ -integrals by RDFs. The aim is to analyze whether the usage of $dC_{F}$ -integrals in the FRM of FRBCSs represents a good alternative toward the standard $C_{F}$ -integrals that just consider the difference as a dissimilarity measure. For that, we consider six RDFs combined with five fuzzy measures, applied with more than 20 functions $F$ . The analysis of the results is based on statistical tests, demonstrating their efficiency. Additionally, comparing the applicability of $dC_{F}$ -integrals versus $C_{F}$ -integrals, the range of the good generalizations of the former is much larger than that of the latter.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the problem of decentralized event-triggered fault-tolerant control (FTC) for a class of interconnected nonlinear systems with unknown strong coupling and actuator failures is considered. In order to enable each subsystem output to track the desired trajectory, a new decentralized adaptive control scheme is given. First, an event-triggering mechanism is introduced to reduce the signal transmission frequency between the controller and the actuator. Second, a fuzzy high-gain observer is designed for each subsystem to estimate unknown nonlinear functions and actuator efficiency factor. Third, a decentralized FTC strategy is proposed to compensate for the effects of actuator failures and achieve the desirable system tracking performance. With the aid of graph theory, it is shown that all the closed-loop signals are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the tracking error of each subsystem can converge to an arbitrarily small residual set by adjusting a design parameter. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by a practical interconnected system.},

Moreover, multiple actuators faults and external disturbance can also bring challenges to controller design. To solve these problems, we design different adaptive update laws to relieve the effects of unknown actuators faults, sensors faults, and external disturbance, respectively. Furthermore, the actual states can be estimated by combining sensors outputs with adaptive parameters. On this basis, the unknown nonlinear functions are approximated through the combining of fuzzy logic systems and the estimation of states. Then, a novel adaptive fuzzy tracking control algorithm is completed by the backstepping method. By employing the Lyapunov function, the presented novel fault-tolerant control algorithm can guarantee all signals of the system are bounded in spite of the occurrence of multiple faults.

The state matching aims at making the difference between the state trajectories of a redesigned sampled-data fuzzy observer and the given continuous-time fuzzy observer small enough. Thus, it is assumed that the continuous-time fuzzy observer was appropriately designed in advance. To solve the IDR problem, we propose the linear-matrix-inequality-based design condition that simultaneously guarantees both the state estimation performance and the state matching performance. In addition, the conservativeness of the design condition is relaxed by developing a novel integral inequality condition and a fuzzified time-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional.

  abstract     = {Multilabel feature selection (MFS) has received widespread attention in various big data applications. However, most of the existing methods either explicitly or implicitly assume that all labels are given in advance before feature selection starts; or that all labels are independent. In fact, in many practical applications, the available labels usually arrive dynamically, and they may be interdependent with each other. Moreover, labels may be generated dynamically in a minibatch manner, which makes it more difficult to explore label dependency. In this article, we propose a novel fuzzy mutual information-based multilabel feature selection approach MSDS, which is able to solve single streaming label, minibatch streaming labels, and exploit label dependency simultaneously. In specific, we first promote fuzzy mutual information to be suitable for multilabel learning. This model can effectively consider the relationship between two labels, and has good applicability for measuring the relationship between multiple labels. Then, we analyze feature relevance and feature redundancy based on the combination of label dependency and streaming labels, which helps to facilitate the selection of high-quality feature subsets. Finally, a feature conversion is designed to fuse the representative features of new arrival streaming labels. Comprehensive experiments on twelve multilabel datasets clearly reveal the superiority of the proposed method against two streaming labels based algorithms and five state-of-the-art static label space based algorithms.},

By using backstepping technique, the virtual control laws and the adaptive law are designed. Notice that compared to the reporting achievements, our proposed virtual control laws are second-order derivable by using the novel switch function, which avoids “singularity hindrance” problem.

In this article, the uncertain demand is assumed to possess fuzzy uncertainty instead of stochastic nature. In the case that the demand distribution information is partially available, this article proposes a new uncertainty distribution set to depict the demand distribution uncertainty based on the type-2 fuzzy theory. Then, a novel robust pricing game modeling framework is developed for the dual-channel green supply chain with the demand distribution varying in the proposed uncertainty distribution set. Finally, a new method is proposed for obtaining the robust equilibrium decisions of supply chain members. Numerical analysis and comparisons are conducted to demonstrate the impacts of the demand ambiguity on the manufacturer’s equilibrium channel choice strategy.

The stochastic parameters are generated by the semi-Markov process, whose transition rates depend upon the sojourn time. The nonlinear SMJS depicts real-time models subject to unpredictable structural changes, such as single-link robotic arm (S-LRA) systems. A key issue under consideration is how to design a fuzzy sampled-data controller to ensure stochastic stability for the nonlinear SMJS in the presence of actuator faults and state quantization. For this purpose, by using the weak infinitesimal operator of constructed FSLF, sufficient conditions are determined to realize the stochastic stability of the proposed nonlinear systems. Then, the stochastic stability conditions for the proposed sampled-data controller scheme can be derived under a linear matrix inequality framework. The validity of the theoretical findings is verified by Rossler’s chaotic systems. The S-LRA model is demonstrated to illustrate the applicability and efficacy of the proposed controller scheme.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a novel Lyapunov stability analysis for a class of switched nonlinear systems under the mode-dependent average dwell time (MDADT) switching signals. For the first time, a polynomial fuzzy model is used to describe the nonlinearity of the switched systems instead of a Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model, which can represent a wider range of nonlinear plants. As existing advanced results are relatively conservative and lead to that tighter bounds on the dwell time are not easy to be obtained, therefore, the stability analysis for switched systems is still quite challenging. In this article, to tackle this problem, by developing a polynomial multiple Lyapunov function (MLF) approach and exploring the feature of the membership functions, relaxed stability conditions are derived for the switched polynomial fuzzy-model-based control systems. In particular, the polynomial MLF is guaranteed radially unbounded by a two-step procedure, making traditional quadratic MLF a specific case, thereby improved stability conditions can be established in the form of sum-of-squares. Moreover, the new algorithm for multivariate Chebyshev membership functions based on linear programming is proposed to introduce the information of membership functions and further relax the stability conditions to obtain tighter bounds on MDADT. Finally, a simulation example demonstrates the effectiveness of the developed techniques.},
