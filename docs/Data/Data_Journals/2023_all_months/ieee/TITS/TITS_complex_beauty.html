  abstract     = {A rational approach to predict passenger car sales and analyze the current state of the passenger car sales market can contribute to the healthy development of the automotive industry. The number of features used to describe passenger car sales in real life is too redundant. The features of human empirical filtering and combination cause loss of time. In addition, explicit features are too homogeneous, which need to be complemented by implicit features. The fixed-parameter weights in the trained model cannot provide some estimates for unknown uncertainties. Therefore, in this work, we propose a DeepFM-based nonparametric model (DFMNP) for predicting passenger car sales in sustainable way. We use a big data platform to provide data for the DFMNP model. The DFMNP model uses feature engineering to expand the number of explicit features, a multilayer neural network to extract implicit features, and a Bayesian neural network to replace the neural network with fixed weights for inferring predictive values. In addition, a factorization machine is used in the prediction function to take into account the cross information of implicit features. The combination of the above improvement points can be used to improve the model’s expressive and predictive power for unknown data. Its prediction performance on two real passenger car sales datasets is as follows, RMSE values of 0.0825 and 0.116, and MAE values of 0.0482 and 0.0595. The above experimental results verify the superiority of the method proposed in this work.},

  abstract     = {Although connected mymargin autonomous vehicles (CAVs) hold great potential to improve driving safety and experience significantly, cybersecurity remains a critical concern. As the de-facto standard for in-vehicle networks, the Controller Area Network (CAN) carries messages and commands vital to the operation of the vehicle. However, due to a lack of security mechanisms, intruders are able to conduct devastating attacks on drivers and passengers over CAN. In order to safeguard CAVs, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be deployed to monitor CAN network activities and detect suspicious behavior resulting from an attack. This paper proposes a prediction-based IDS framework for detecting anomalies and attacks on a CAN bus using temporal correlation of message contents. Two candidates are introduced as the prediction module. The first network is an LSTM that predicts time series data separately for each CAN ID, and the second is a ConvLSTM that predicts messages using correlated data of several CAN IDs. An attack is classified according to prediction errors by a Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier. The proposed IDS is evaluated against other state-of-the-art one-class classifiers, including OCSVM, Isolation Forest, and Autoencoder, and three existing works, including ReducedInception-ResNet, NeuroCAN, and CANLite, using a real-world dataset, the Car Hacking Dataset. A comparison between the two suggested architectures and their use cases is given. Compared to baseline methods and related studies, the proposed method is shown to be more accurate and can achieve F-scores and detection accuracy of almost 100%.},

  abstract     = {As the recent rise of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), the sensing capability of vehicles has become crucial in realizing sophisticated intelligent transportation services. Collaborative sensing, an important approach to extend the sensing coverage of individual vehicles, has become an essential component of connected vehicle systems. However, due to challenges such as privacy concerns, frequent communication interruptions, customized models, and limited available data, the application of collaborative sensing in current ITS systems is still limited. In this paper, we propose BSL, a novel multi-exit split learning-based collaborative inference system. The key innovation of BSL is the introduction of multi-exit to the split network, enabling network training and collaborative inference between distributed device nodes and the cloud in a split manner. Specifically, BSL allows the device node to dynamically collaborate with the cloud by introducing the edge mode and collaboration mode, ensuring that intelligent services provided to the device will be sustained even if the communication is interrupted, which is crucial in ITS systems. We have implemented the system and evaluated it with public dataset on different embedded devices. The results demonstrate the promising performance of BSL.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of electric vehicles promotes the development of Internet of Vehicle (IoV). However, there are a series of security problems to be solved in the IoV. Firstly, how to allow vehicle users to find the nearest non-queuing charging pile without detours is a challenge. Secondly, applications in the IoV are delay-sensitive, while high communication delays caused by security mechanisms would bring serious consequences to vehicles. Thirdly, the verifiability and fairness between charging and payment are difficult to be guaranteed. Aiming at the efficiency and security problems of the charging service in the IoV, this paper proposes a blockchain-based intelligent and fair IoV charging service system. According to the multi-factor constraints between vehicles and charging piles, a multi-factor IoV branch and bound algorithm is proposed to intelligently recommend charging piles for vehicles and maximize the overall energy saving. We propose the cross-area consensus protocol to achieve low latency in vehicle communication. In addition, we ensure the fairness between charging and payment through a payment channel protocol based on verifiable encrypted signatures. Finally, we implement the proposed scheme, and we put the project prototype on an open source platform is available at: https://github.com/chenruonan/blockchain-based-intelligent-and-fair-IoV-charging-service-protocol . The experimental results demonstrate the low latency and energy-saving advantages of our proposal. When the payment is executed 250 times, the delay of our proposal is only 1.54% of the normal on-chain payment time.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are the backbone of the future intelligent transportation system (ITS). They are environmentally friendly and can also be integrated as distributed energy resources (DERs) into the smart grid using vehicle-to-grid (V2G) scheme. Specifically, utility companies can push back EV batteries into the electric grid to reduce the peak load. However, integrating EVs into the power grid efficiently requires accurate artificial intelligence (AI) mechanisms to forecast, coordinate, and dispatch the EVs into the grid. This paper proposes a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) mechanism that schedules the day-ahead discharging process of EV batteries to optimize the peak shaving performance of the electric grid. The proposed MARL overcomes the inaccuracy of energy prediction by allowing the agents, i.e. EVs, to make autonomous decisions. These agents are trained in a centralized fashion but make decisions locally to maintain autonomy and privacy. In particular, the model does not require that the EVs communicate with a centralized entity during the execution stage, which assures the model’s integrity and protects the EVs’ private information. To evaluate the model, a comprehensive series of experiments were carried out to prove the effectiveness of the MARL coordination and scheduling mechanism and to show that the model can indeed flatten the peak load.},

Configuring network settings in IoV environments has proven difficult due to their dynamic and self-organizing nature. To address this issue, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to configure IoV network settings automatically. Specifically, we use a collection of neural networks to convert the observations of a communication environment (channel power gain, cross-channel power gain, etc.) into key features, which are then supplied to a deep &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$Q$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; neural network (DQN) as input for training. Afterward, the DQN will select the optimal network configuration for vehicles in the IoV environment. In addition, our approach considers both centralized and distributed training strategies. The centralized training strategy conducts the DQN training process on a roadside server, while the distributed training strategy trains the DQN on vehicles locally. Through our designed IoV simulation platform, we evaluate the efficacy of our proposed approach, demonstrating that it can improve the quality of services (QoS) in the IoV environments concerning reliability, latency, and service satisfaction.},

Comparisons between CPLEX and the proposed algorithm suggest that the proposed algorithm can considerably improve computational efficiency. A comparative analysis shows the proposed model takes 21% less total cost than the alternative non-robust model.

To solve the aforementioned problems, a scale region recognition network (SRRNet) is proposed in this paper. It has two key components, termed scale level awareness (SLA) module and object region recognition (ORR) module. The SLA module aims to encode the representations at multiple scales, which are beneficial to address the scale variation. The ORR module is designed to suppress background interference through the visual attention mechanism. Extensive experimental results on four crowd counting datasets and five vehicle counting datasets have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed SRRNet in both counting accuracy and robustness compared with the mainstream competitors.

  abstract     = {Sea state estimation (SSE) is significant to the development of autonomous ships, which can enhance the sustainable development of maritime transportation. Traditional model-based methods are limited by their drawbacks, such as high costs and inaccurate estimations. The deep learning model shows superior performance, but it requires that the sample quantity for each sea state should be almost the same. Since the occurrence probability of each state is different, the ships mainly work in low sea states, and the collected ship motion data for different sea states are highly imbalanced. This work proposes a novel class-imbalanced ship motion data-based cross-scale model for SSE. The model consists of three major components: a multi-scale feature learning module, a cross-scale feature learning module, and a prototype classifier module. The multi-scale and cross-scale feature learning modules are designed to learn abundant coarse and fine-level features from the ship motion data. The prototype classifier is utilized to overcome the limitation of the conventional softmax classifier to produce better estimates. Our research highlights our model’s remarkable scalability and versatility with 30 publicly available datasets in time series classification, demonstrating superior performance over baseline methods in 21 cases. Notably, it outperformed ShapeNet by 5.72% and EDI by 26.3%. We further validated our model’s proficiency using ship motion datasets, consistently surpassing eight state-of-the-art baselines and five class-imbalanced learning methods. Ablation and sensitivity studies, emphasize the critical role of each model component. Our findings underscore the model’s robustness and its potential to advance time series classification in diverse domains.},

  abstract     = {In the past decade, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown prominence for semantic segmentation. Although CNN models have very impressive performance, the ability to capture global representation is still insufficient, which results in suboptimal results. Recently, Transformer achieved huge success in NLP tasks, demonstrating its advantages in modeling long-range dependency. Recently, Transformer has also attracted tremendous attention from computer vision researchers who reformulate the image processing tasks as a sequence-to-sequence prediction but resulted in deteriorating local feature details. In this work, we propose a lightweight real-time semantic segmentation network called LETNet. LETNet combines a U-shaped CNN with Transformer effectively in a capsule embedding style to compensate for respective deficiencies. Meanwhile, the elaborately designed Lightweight Dilated Bottleneck (LDB) module and Feature Enhancement (FE) module cultivate a positive impact on training from scratch simultaneously. Extensive experiments performed on challenging datasets demonstrate that LETNet achieves superior performances in accuracy and efficiency balance. Specifically, It only contains 0.95M parameters and 13.6G FLOPs but yields 72.8% mIoU at 120 FPS on the Cityscapes test set and 70.5% mIoU at 250 FPS on the CamVid test dataset using a single RTX 3090 GPU.

Scalable and customizable solutions to concentrate commuters for easy access to public transport hubs will be an important objective for enhancing efficiency in both energy consumption and travel within a smart city. This paper proposes a prognostics approach for sustainable micromobility management through optimization of appropriate V2I and V2V communication systems by using artificial intelligence for adaptive modulation and self-cognizant prognostics in order to solve the challenges associated with tackling parking and road congestion issues in a sustainable smart city environment.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing popularity of cab services such as Didi and Uber, cities are faced with the challenge of high carbon emissions and traffic congestion. Ride-sharing services, as a novel green mode of transportation, have emerged as a key technology in smart transportation for addressing these problems. The implementation of ride-sharing is predicated on an accurate ridership demand forecasting model, which can effectively prevent vehicle resource waste, alleviate traffic congestion, and reduce carbon emissions. In this paper, a periodic attentional graph convolutional spatio-temporal network model (PAG-TSN) is proposed to predict regional ridership demand. Specifically, the model is trained using a large amount of GPS data and user demand data collected by the travel service provider. PAG-TSN consists of two parts: the bicomponent attention graph convolution model (BAT-GCN) and the periodic attentional gated recurrent unit model (PA-GRU). The former uses GCN to extract spatial features from pointwise and edgewise graphs; the latter uses the spatial feature vectors extracted from the former with external information as input, and uses GRU to extract temporal features from feature data of different periods, and finally uses attention mechanism and POI requirement correlation to integrate the extracted spatio-temporal information to derive prediction results. Extensive experiments and evaluations on the CD2Date and XA2Date datasets show that PAG-TSN outperforms other baseline models in accurately predicting regional ridership demand, with MAPE and RMSE values of 0.1147 and 5.56, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) enable various capabilities and functionalities like automated driving assistance, navigation and path planning, cruise control, independent decision making, and low-carbon transportation in the real-time environment. However, the increased CAVs usage renders the potential vulnerabilities in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) environment, making it susceptible to cyberattacks. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a technique to report network assaults by potential Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) without encryption and authorization procedures for internal and external vehicular communications. This paper proposes an Intelligent IDS (IIDS) to enhance intrusion detection and categorize malicious AVs using a modified Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with hyperparameter optimization approaches for IoV systems. The proposed IIDS framework works in a 5G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) environment to effectively broadcast messages about malicious AVs. Thus IIDS aids in preventing collisions and chaos, enhancing safety monitoring in the traffic. The experimental results depict that the proposed IIDS achieves 98% accuracy in detecting attacks.},

  abstract     = {Sixth-generation networks and vehicular Ad hoc networks advancement brought us to the cusp of a new era. Autonomous Vehicles with a plethora of advanced applications require a substantially enhanced vehicle-to-everything communication network. The infrastructure should efficiently support hyper-fast, ultra-reliable, and low-latency massive data exchange. Roadside units were initially exploited as a promising communication solution to overcome this challenge. However, the challenging integration with the infrastructure led to the investigation of additional solutions. Unmanned aerial vehicles are one of the most dominant assistive solutions due to their inherent advantage of mobility. Moreover, air-to-air and ground-to-air networks are more efficient than ground-to-ground. Nevertheless, it is a prerequisite to leverage the potential of unmanned aerial vehicles to attain nationwide Vehicle-to-Everything connectivity. Therefore, we focused our research orientation on developing a strategy to optimize the network’s coverage within the intelligent transportation systems framework. In particular, we have deployed an innovative algorithmic technique that constructs Voronoi diagrams using circles. Besides, we applied the poison point process to determine the optimum locations of the transceivers’ establishment. Simulation results illustrate full network coverage for the tested area after the required iterations. Also, time complexity evaluation proved the simplicity of the proposed algorithm.},

However, a point cloud data set is large and sparsely distributed, hindering the success of vehicle-tracking algorithms. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a 3D vehicle object tracking algorithm based on bounding box similarity measurement. The algorithm includes state prediction, temporal association, trajectory management, state update, and other processes. Also incorporated is a vehicle object temporal association method based on a siamese encoder. The bounding box is encoded into a high-dimensional space, the feature distance is calculated as the time series association cost, and triplet loss was introduced to urge the encoder to learn the geometric similarity of the truth matching box. A 3D Kalman filter and greedy matching are used to effectuate 3D vehicle object tracking algorithm. The experimental results using a KITTI multi-object tracking dataset show that the proposed algorithm can achieve good vehicle tracking performance. In the case of frame loss of point cloud in the frequency reduction simulation, compared with the benchmark method AB3DMOT, the average multi-object tracking accuracy (AMOTA) and the average multi-object tracking accuracy (AMOTP) of the improved method are increased by 2.62% and 1.41% respectively, and the performance is better in the frame loss scene.},

  abstract     = {Mobility plays a fundamental role in modern cities. How citizens experience the urban environment, access city core services, and participate in city life, strongly depends on its mobility organization and efficiency. The challenges that municipalities face are very ambitious: on the one hand, administrators must guarantee their citizens the right to mobility and to easily access local services; on the other hand, they need to minimize the economic, social, and environmental costs of the mobility system. Municipalities are increasingly facing problems of traffic congestion, road safety, energy dependency and air pollution, and therefore encouraging a shift towards sustainable mobility habits based on active mobility is of central importance. Active modes, such as cycling, should be particularly encouraged, especially for local recurrent journeys (e.g., home–to–school, home–to–work). In this context, addressing and mitigating commuter-generated traffic requires engaging public and private stakeholders through innovative and collaborative approaches that focus not only on supply (e.g., roads and vehicles) but also on transportation demand management. In this paper, we present and end-to-end solution, called Play&amp;Go Corporate, for enabling urban cyclability and its concrete exploitation in the realization of a home-to-work sustainable mobility campaign (i.e., BIKE2 WORK) targeting employees of public and private companies. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solution we developed two analyses: the first to carefully analyze the user experience and any behaviour change related to the BIKE2 WORK mobility campaign, and the second to demonstrate how exploiting the collected data we can potentially inform and guide the involved municipality (i.e., Ferrara, a city in Northern Italy) in improving urban cyclability.},

Referring to the construction ideas of the Internet, this paper establishes the framework of TI, proposes the transportation router based on the transportation switching and routing models, and preliminarily forms a large-scale automatic transportation solution. Following the latest technologies of the Internet, this paper further presents the software-defined transportation (SDT) by separating the control plane and transport plane of the transportation router, which can enhance transportation routing and provide Internet-like capabilities such as centralized intelligent control, terminals plug-and-play, and open application ecology. The evaluation of the prototype system shows promising results. The software-defined signals (SDS) can save 36% energy compared to signal machines, and the software-defined vehicles (SDV) automatic driving can save 24% energy compared to manual driving.

  abstract     = {The safety monitoring system of intelligent transportation provides driving fatigue warning and risk control. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can directly reflect the neuronal activity of the brain. The detection and early warning of driving fatigue using EEG signals has important practical significance. However, because of the non-stationarity and timeliness of EEG signals, the single feature detection method is significantly impacted by data distribution differences. In this paper, in the framework of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy system, transferable TSK fuzzy classifier with multi-views (T-TSK-MV) is developed for EEG-based driving fatigue recognition in intelligent transportation. First, in view-specific consequent parameter learning, the view-specific consequent regularizer is designed based on technologies of ridge regression, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), and manifold regularization, which becomes the bridge to transfer the discriminative information from the related domain to the target domain. In addition, the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\ell _{2,1} $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -norm sparse constraint on consequent parameters is used to simplify fuzzy rules. Then multi-view learning is integrated into the consequent parameter learning, in which T-TSK-MV explores the view-shared consequent regularizer and adaptively assigns weights to each view. The &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\ell _{2,1} $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -norm sparse constraint on view-shared consequent regularizer can effectively exploit the local structure of multi-view data. Finally, the fuzzy classifier is constructed on view-specific regularizers and view weights. The experiment on real-word datasets shows that the proposed fuzzy classifier can significantly improve the driving fatigue recognition performance.},

  abstract     = {Remote monitoring is an important application of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). The combination of monitoring equipment and tracking algorithms can be used to automatically track moving targets. The tracking algorithm based on the Siamese network is both accurate and efficient, and its development potential is better than that of other algorithms. Its output is a detection map that reflects the probability that any position in the search area is the center of the target’s bounding box, and the maximum value of the detection map is the center of the target’s bounding box predicted by the algorithm. Owing to partial occlusion, target deformation, out-of-view, and background clutter, local maxima in the detection map may also be the center of the target’s bounding box. A tracker’s ability to make accurate judgments is currently limited. Furthermore, previous trackers extracted only the target features in the initial frame as the matching template. Although this matching template is highly reliable, it cannot effectively combine the target features available in the subsequent frames. Therefore, in this study, fuzzy inference is introduced into the tracking process to analyze the reliability of the detection map. When this map is reliable, the target feature of the search area is transformed into a substitute template; otherwise, multiple substitute templates are selected from the template pool for parallel matching as per the set rules. The optimal result is selected from multiple detection results, based on the priority of the detection results when the initial frame is used as the matching template. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that the proposed algorithm is superior to other similar algorithms in terms of multiple assessment metrics and can improve the robustness of remote monitoring tasks in ITSs.},

TSR systems based on deep learning have grown in popularity in recent years. However, since these models belong to the closed-world-oriented learning paradigm, they are only capable of accurately identifying traffic signs that are easy to collect and cannot adapt to the real world. Furthermore, the sample utilization of these methods is insufficient, the resource consumption of model training may become unbearable as the data scale grows. To address this problem, we propose a novel “knowledge + data” co- driven solution (i.e., Joint Semantic Representation algorithm, JSR) for TSR. JSR creates a hybrid feature representation by extracting general and principal visual features from traffic sign images. It also realizes the model’s reasoning ability to zero-shot TSR based on prior knowledge of traffic sign design standards. The effectiveness of JSR is demonstrated by experiments on four benchmark datasets and two self-built TSR datasets.},

We also provide a fresh methodology for the microsleep classification job that works with even less training data. Our proposed model exploits the attention-based mechanism that clubs the advantages available in Wavelet transform with Short Time Fourier Transform(STFT) Spectrogram. We also put forward a robust deep learning model that contains separate “time-dependent” and “time-independent” parts, which can record contexts from the sequence of features and simultaneously learn intra-epoch relations. A single-electrode EEG signal was employed for our analysis to accommodate such procedures’ social acceptance. For the task of microsleep detection on the MWT dataset, our model achieves fairly high accuracy rates (92% training and 89.9% testing accuracy), and an overall improvement in the kappa value by ≈ 42%, as compared to prior novel approaches.},

  abstract     = {In metropolitan environments, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with video surveillance equipment can monitor crowd behavior and maintain public safety. In high-traffic areas where humans are more likely to make mistakes, a smart city needs modern technology to forecast the behavior of its residents. In order to improve citywide traffic flow, urban transportation systems (UTSs) monitor and learn how people behave in crowds. Using UAVs for video surveillance in smart cities, our research describes a unique way to assess crowd condition, which expands the scope of human-vehicle interactions. Moreover, we use fuzzy logic ranking to improve the system’s ability to detect anomalies in crowds. In order to improve decision-making, a novel deep transfer learning (DTL) technique is applied to the UAV’s received frames. A 98.5% accuracy rate, satisfactory performance, and robustness to population behavior are all characteristics of the proposed integrated model. In UTSs and urban areas, our novel intelligent system analyzes human behavior based on vehicle-human interactions. In areas with low and high traffic congestion, the modified ResNet (mResNet) architecture predicts the crowd’s condition based on fuzzy logic (FLA). Through decision-making based on accurate crowd conditions, best general paths can be selected using the algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Training machine learning models in a decentralized way has attracted tremendous attention on intelligent Internet of Vehicles (IIoV). However, it is highly dynamic and asymmetric for the connections between vehicles in IIoV due to the mobility of vehicles and the complex communication environment, which poses great challenges on designing efficient distributed learning algorithms. To address this problem, we focus on the basic stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm and propose a decentralized parallel SGD algorithm (DPSGD-WB) for the complex IIoV. The algorithm is based on weight-balancing to overcome the difficulty caused by the dynamic and asymmetric connectivity in IIoV. With rigorous analysis, we show that DPSGD-WB converges on the optimal rate of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$O(1/\sqrt {Kn})$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , where &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$n$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is the number of vehicle terminals and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$K$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is the number of iterations.

  abstract     = {Each group in a data-driven automobile network has its cluster head. A group can communicate with each other and members of other groups once it has been founded. Vehicles belonging to each group near the other group allow intergroup communication. Because nodes in automotive networks move so quickly, routing in these networks is a complex problem to solve. Each cluster in hierarchical clustering can be partitioned into multiple sub-clusters. Put another way, and the data is stored in a cluster, which is then divided into more clusters. The data is stored directly in separate clusters in non-hierarchical approaches. A dendrogram is a type of hierarchical tree. We anticipate increasing information sharing in clusters by properly clustering vehicles on the road and establishing clusters of the desired size in the relevant dendrogram. We can select clusters of the necessary extent and compare the Quality of Service (QoS) network’s outcomes by breaking the dendrogram at different levels. The findings reveal that the suggested method outperforms AIVISN in delay, PDR, overhead, and Drooped packets compared to AIVISN, 7.12%, 12.21%,8.32%, and 7.34%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Influenced by the growing daily travel demand of citizens and extension of urban land, the construction of the urban railway transit (URT) system is gradually increasing nowadays. This situation implies more electricity consumption in URT and more challenges to URT operation stability. Therefore, based on the existing traction substation, this research proposes a configuration of multi-source traction system (MSTS) for URT with a coordinated control strategy according to power profile of the system. The proposed MSTS, including conventional traction system (CTS), renewable energy source (RES), and energy storage system (ESS), have been modelled first. After that, considering the system dynamic performance and ESS capacity, a coordinated control strategy is designed to manage the MSTS energy flow. The control strategy considers the substation voltage as control signal which is optimized by proposed performance index. The case study is conducted on a three-station railway route with two substations. The proposed MSTS with a coordinated control strategy is compared with normal CTS considering multi-train timetables with different departure intervals. The simulation result illustrates that the proposed MSTS can maintain the state of charge (SOC) of ESS and reduce the substation peak power and voltage fluctuation, which is verified both in short-term and long-term simulation. Meanwhile, it can improve the substation capacity by decreasing the energy consumption of CTS to deal with the increasing demand for URT. the case study denotes that the energy-saving rate can be up to 36.25%, and the peak power is reduced up to 46.32%.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are offering effective solutions to protect various types of cyber-attacks in different networks such as Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) network in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Deep learning models have largely been leveraged by these intrusion detection systems to achieve better effectiveness results. However, deep learning models are black boxes, which limits their acceptability in decision systems. Also, they require powerful processing capabilities such as GPU, which limit their deployments in resource-constrained devices in IoV environment. To deal with these issues, we propose a two-stage IDS in ITS to discover suspicious network activity of In-Vehicles Networks (IVN) and vehicles to everything (V2X) networks. Our proposed IDS system uses rule extraction methods from deep learning models, i.e., deep neural networks in two stages. In the first stage, we analyze network traffic to distinguish between normal and attack traffic. If the traffic is found malicious, the second stage is invoked to identify the type of attack. To this end, we propose three variants of rule extraction. The first and the second variants are homogeneous, and they apply &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$DeepRed$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$HypInv$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; rule extraction methods in both stages respectively. The third variant is heterogeneous, and it applies &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$HypInv$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; in the first stage to perform binary classification, and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$DeepRed$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; in the second stage to perform attack classification. The key idea is to combine the advantages of rule extraction technique and two-stage IDS architecture to resource consumption and improve classification accuracy. The proposed IDS model was tested using four benchmark datasets, i.e. ISCXIDS2012, CIC-IDS2017, and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets are used for external network communications and the car hacking dataset are used for in-vehicle communications. The evaluation results show that the homogeneous &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$DeepRed$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is the optimal one in all cases of IDS system with an accuracy scores ranging between 92.43%-98.32% under CIC-IDS2017 dataset, between 91.32%-99.46% under CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset, and between 96.05%-99.21% under Car-hacking dataset.},

  abstract     = {Vessels sailing in a single platoon could reduce resistance from the perspective of the whole platoon and the individual vessel, and contribute to improving energy benefits. Moreover, transportation energy costs and traffic efficiency are essential indicators for measuring waterborne transportation systems. We attempt to minimize transportation energy costs by coordinating platoon formation using a distributed framework of controllers. A large-scale coordinated vessel platooning program is proposed to minimize transportation energy costs and optimize traffic efficiency while guaranteeing safety. The control framework covers routing, energy consumption-dependent cooperative platooning decision and speed optimization based on graph search algorithm, cluster analysis, optimal control approach and model predictive control. Firstly, a local scheduling strategy combined with the leader vessel selection algorithm is adopted. Furthermore, we used cluster analysis to create a series of mergeable vessel platooning sets. Then, we used the mathematical planning method and a two-step hybrid optimal control approach to calculate the improvement and optimization of each vessel platoon’s path and speed. Finally, the scalability of the scheduling strategy is elucidated. In a simulation of large scale inland waterborne network, savings surpassed 3.5% when six hundreds vessels participated in the system. These simulation results reveal that the scheduling strategy coordinating vessels into vessel platooning, which improves transportation efficiency as well as descends cost, comparing to a fixed origin route in the waterway network.},

  abstract     = {Airport ground handling (AGH) offers necessary operations to flights during their turnarounds and is of great importance to the efficiency of airport management and the economics of aviation. Such a problem involves the interplay among the operations that leads to NP-hard problems with complex constraints. Hence, existing methods for AGH are usually designed with massive domain knowledge but still fail to yield high-quality solutions efficiently. In this paper, we aim to enhance the solution quality and computation efficiency for solving AGH. Particularly, we first model AGH as a multiple-fleet vehicle routing problem (VRP) with miscellaneous constraints including precedence, time windows, and capacity. Then we propose a construction framework that decomposes AGH into sub-problems (i.e., VRPs) in fleets and present a neural method to construct the routing solutions to these sub-problems. In specific, we resort to deep learning and parameterize the construction heuristic policy with an attention-based neural network trained with reinforcement learning, which is shared across all sub-problems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms classic meta-heuristics, construction heuristics and the specialized methods for AGH. Besides, we empirically verify that our neural method generalizes well to instances with large numbers of flights or varying parameters, and can be readily adapted to solve real-time AGH with stochastic flight arrivals.

There are limitless implementations that can take place in the metaverse. Integration of another technological innovation, which is autonomous vehicles to the metaverse, is at hand. There are numerous alternative uses of autonomous vehicles in the metaverse. In this study, three alternative implementation options for autonomous vehicles in the metaverse are investigated. These alternatives are evaluated using the proposed multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method under twelve different criteria, which are grouped under four main aspects, namely technological, societal, legal and ethical, and transportation. A novel hybrid model based on q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs) which consists of three stages is presented to express the framework definition, calculate the weight coefficients of the criteria, and rank various alternatives. In the first stage, the structure of the problem is created. In the second stage, q-ROFSs based OPA algorithm is used to calculate the weights of the criteria. In the last stage, q-ROFSs based RAFSI (Ranking of Alternatives through Functional mapping of criterion sub-intervals into a Single Interval) is applied to choose the best alternative among the three alternatives. Finally, we present a case study to verify our proposed method. The results of this study have the potential to be used as a guide by decision-makers of the metaverse while integrating autonomous vehicles into the transportation system.},

This research aims to boost the efficiency of solar energy plants by proposing a novel approach to optimize the total flying time of battery-based drone systems to enhance the performance of solar plant systems. The contribution of the proposed approach is to solve scheduling problems based on timing constraints to monitor the solar plant. The main objective of the proposed approach is to maximize the drone’s minimum total flying time, which will increase the availability and reliability of the solar plant monitoring system. Time to empty values is calculated based on battery degradation rates. This problem is proven to be NP-hard.

  abstract     = {The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 brings many unpredictable situations to human travel, such as temporarily closed highways, parking lots, etc. The scenarios mentioned above will lead to a large backlog of vehicles, and the requirements of Internet of vehicle (IoV) applications increase sharply in a period of short time correspondingly. Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a key enabling technology that can guarantee the diverse requirements of IoV applications through the optimization of resource scheduling. However, the sharp increasing in requirements of IoV applications caused by the congestion of highways or parking lots still bring great challenges to the deployment of traditional MEC. Therefore, in this paper, we construct an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled MEC system, in which the data generated from IoV applications is processed by offloading to UAVs with MEC servers to ensure the efficiency of data processing and the response time of IoV applications. In order to approximate real-world UAV enabled MEC system, we consider the stochastic offloading and downloading processing time. Moreover, the priority constraints of sensors from the same vehicle are taken into consideration since they have different importance degrees. Then, we propose an Markov network-based cooperative evolutionary algorithm (MNCEA) to search out the optimal UAV scheduling solution to guarantee the shortest response time, in which the solution space is divided into multiple sub-solution spaces with the help of MN structure and parameters. Finally, we construct multiple simulation experiments with different probability distributions to simulate uncertainty factors. The simulation results verify the validity of MNCEA compared with the state-of-the-art methods, which is reflected by the shortest response time of requirements of IoV applications.},

  abstract     = {An unprecedented prosperity in artificial intelligence promotes the development of Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Assisted by edge computing, vehicles enable to offload data to edge servers in close proximity to users for processing, thus making up for the shortage of local computing resources. However, due to the uneven space-time distribution of traffic flow, edge servers of a certain road segment may be overwhelmed by the surge of service requests. Furthermore, IoV system will incur significant additional energy consumption and time delay because of the absence of a proper computation offloading scheme between edge servers. To cope with above challenges, a computing offloading method for energy and delay trade-offs with traffic flow prediction in edge computing-enabled IoV is proposed. We first design the graph weighted convolution network (GWCN) that can fully excavate the connectivity and distance relation information between road segments to conduct traffic flow prediction. The short-term prediction results are utilized as the basis for adjusting the resource allocation of edge resources in different regions. Then, a computation offloading method driven by deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is leveraged to obtain an optimal computation offloading scheme for edge servers. Finally, extensive comparative experiments demonstrate the low prediction error of GWCN and superior performance of DDPG-driven method in reducing total time delay and energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Signal phase optimization at signalized intersection is of great importance to urban traffic control and management yet is very challenging. The traditional approaches for signal phase optimization heavily rely on the traffic engineering practitioners’ experience. To tackle these challenges, a novel data-driven method is proposed to realize signal phase optimization and recommendation solely using limited amount of real signalized intersection samples. Firstly, all of discrete features related to signal phase design, encoded by one-hot representation, are sampled by the Gumbel-SoftMax distribution, which is a continuous approximation to a multinomial distribution. With this approximation distribution, the generative adversarial network (GAN) is applied to produce the most acceptable signal phase samples among all acceptable choices, dealing with the problem of insufficient samples and uneven sample distribution in real word. Thirdly, a decision-tree based classifier is established to realize signal phase recommendation automatically. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed method on three cities in China, including Beijing, Tongxiang and Chaozhou. The experimental results showed that the proposed method could effectively improve the signalized intersection operation efficiency. Moreover, the proposed method has already been deployed in several cities, and it successfully keeps serving hundreds of signalized intersections. This confirms that SPSRec is a practical and robust solution for large-scale real-world signal control services.},

Lots of remarkable research outputs with respect to secure vehicular data interactions and user privacy preservation has been witnessed. However, the existing schemes all focus on the common vehicular communication scenarios where facilities are deployed, whereas the secure data exchange in the abnormal infrastructure-less vehicular environment has not been properly investigated. To deal with unpredictable abnormal situations caused by artificial or natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods, a distinctive vehicle-assisted aggregate authentication mechanism for infrastructure-less vehicular networks is presented in this paper. With assistance from the neighboring vehicles, the homomorphic signature involving all requesting vehicles is generated and forwarded to the remaining functional RSUs. Meanwhile, vehicular group communication among the validated entities is enabled. Additionally, the fault-tolerant verification method is adopted such that the ineffective entities can be easily distinguished and removed without interfering with other requesting vehicles. The security proofs and discussions regarding vital security properties are presented, while the performance analysis follows. Compared with the state-of-the-art, advantages in terms of security and performance properties can be proved.},

Past research has focused on air transportation networks (ATN), but this work considers the resilience of the air route network. This research work proposes a modified approach based on GRA-WSM, named MA (Modified Approach based on GRA-WSM) for the identification of critical edges that form the backbone of the Chinese air route network. MA is a two-step process: Initially, important nodes are identified using the proposed GRA-WSM, and second, a novel approach is used for the computation of critical edges. Previously, researchers have used edge betweenness centrality measure to identify vital edges. But it took into account the global information of a node. This research work considers different centrality measures as the multi-attribute of the network, to take advantage of each centrality measure. The proposed MA approach aims to minimize the robustness of the network after the removal of some edges and the result is the set of critical edges. The critical edges found by the proposed MA approach are different from the edges that are topologically more important. These findings provide new perspectives on how to better understand other real-world networks.},

However, existing cab-sharing systems mainly depend on the centralized authority to provide many services, increasing privacy concerns and facing the single point of failure issue. Also, these systems expose drivers’ or riders’ locations and personal information that increase security issues, and charge high fees for services due to the involvement of third-party providers. Therefore, this paper proposes a decentralized and secure cab-sharing system to provide ride-sharing services using blockchain technology without any trusted third party. The proposed system uses the blockchain structure to preserve the driver’s or rider’s information, such as personal details, travel price, pickup or drop-off locations, departure or arrival date, and time. Furthermore, it implements the reputation feature to rate drivers and riders based on their travel history or behaviors without any centralized authority that allows users to select them based on their past experiences on the system. The proposed architecture is deployed using the Ethereum platform and functionality is designed using smart contracts. The performance evaluation and experimental results show that the proposed system requires low computational overheads and provides an efficient cab-sharing platform.},

Age of Information is a critical metric in many applications of future networks including smart transportation systems as these networks require fresh updates from the various network entities for the successful delivery of their services. This paper considers smart vehicles in a vehicle-to-infrastructure network where each vehicle has a stream of data for transmission to the roadside unit (RSU). The information from vehicles is collected when they enter the communication range of an RSU and stay within the coverage area of that RSU for a particular time. During this time, the RSU attempts to receive information from each vehicle as timely as possible. This paper proposes a hybrid access mechanism consisting of both orthogonal and non-orthogonal multiple access that schedules the transmission of packets from vehicles to the RSU where each vehicle has a finite length queue. The transmission of the packets is modeled using a Markov decision process, where a specific cost function is optimized to collect maximum information from the vehicles in a minimum amount of time.},

In-network caching in ICN provides a realistic solution for vehicular communication due to storage of content replicas inside network vehicles. However, the challenge still exists while caching content replicas in resource constraint vehicles (such as limited power and cache capacity) to minimize the communication latency. To address the above mentioned challenge, this paper proposes EPC - an ICN based Energy efficient Placement of Content chunk that fits well in a vehicular environment. The proposed resource management strategy mainly aims to reduce the content fetching delay by caching content replicas towards the network edge router. The EPC strategy decides on placement of content chunks on each vehicle by jointly considering residual power of current vehicle, local popularity of content, and caching gain. The EPC supports efficient utilization of network available resources by allowing only vehicles with their residual power greater than threshold to perform chunk caching and hence, further offers reduced content duplication in the whole network. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is evaluated in Icarus- an ICN simulator for analyzing the performance of ICN caching and routing strategies. The EPC outperforms various state of the art caching strategies approximately by 30% when gets evaluated in terms of offered cache hit ratio, content retrieval delay, and the average number of hops utilized for fetching the requested content.},

In order to reduce the carbon emission in the scheduling process and make up for ignoring the energy consumption of each part in the scheduling when optimizing the carbon emission of the workshop and the factory. This paper first formulates a fuzzy random chance-constrained programming model of inverse scheduling problem (ISP) with energy consumption. A multi-strategy parallel genetic algorithm based on machine learning (RL-MSPGA) is proposed, which uses machine learning to improve the genetic algorithm. First, the parallel idea is developed to accelerate the process of evolution of genetic algorithm, and the initial population is divided into clusters by &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -means clustering algorithm. Second, similar individuals are evenly distributed to different sub-populations to ensure the diversity and uniformity of sub-populations. Third, in the process of evolution, the sub-populations communicate with each other, and extend the excellent individuals to replace the poor ones in other populations, so as to improve the overall quality of the population. Fourth, the self-learning of the crossover probability is realized by the self-learning of the self-sensing environment, which makes the crossover probability adapt to the evolutionary process according to experience. Finally, the real instance is used to validate the different algorithms. It can effectively adjust the completion time and the proportion of energy consumption, thus providing the possibility for the production of energy-saving enterprises.

Toward this end, we investigate collaborative task computing and on-demand resource allocation. The collaborative computing framework in VEC is provided to support deep collaboration and intelligent management of heterogeneous resources widely distributed in vehicles, edge servers and cloud. Based on this framework, the joint optimization problem of distributed task offloading and multi-resource management is formulated with the aim to maximize the system utility by making the optimal task and resource scheduling policy, the novelty of which lies in the exploration of available vehicle resources and the consideration of service migration. In view of the dynamics, randomness and time-variant of vehicular networks, the asynchronous deep reinforcement algorithm is leveraged to find the optimal solution.

  abstract     = {Traffic forecasting is essential in improving and maintaining safety and orderliness in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). As a deep learning approach, graph neural networks (GNN) based spatial-temporal association mining methods are promising in traffic forecasting. However, current GNN-based methods usually require a high number of training data, and when the sample volume is small, the performance of the model drops dramatically. The existing transfer methods can solve this problem by leveraging knowledge from other data-rich areas, but the domain adaption method with access to source data still faces the non-neglectable problem of private information leakage in the source area. A solution that can solve cross-area transfer without access to source data is still missing. In this paper, to fill the gap, we propose a Transferable Federated Inductive Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (T-ISTGNN) framework to transfer spatial-temporal dependency information in cross-area data to accomplish traffic state forecasting. First, we introduce a multi-source model aggregation scheme based on federated learning to retain the traffic information of the source areas. Second, we propose a transfer method between source and target areas based on hypothesis transfer learning to achieve domain adaption under source domain data protection. Third, we propose a GNN-based method called Inductive Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (ISTGNN) for traffic forecasting. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that T-ISTGNN is capable of cross-area traffic state forecasting under the restriction of preserving the privacy of source areas.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of the Internet of Vehicles has substantially boosted the prevalence of vehicular social networks (VSN). However, content security has gradually been a latent threat to the stable operation of VSN. The VSN is a time-varying environment and mixed with various real or fake contents, which brings great challenges to the sustainability of VSN. To establish a sustainable VSN, it is of practical value to possess a strong ability for fake content detection. Related works can be divided into the global semantics-based approaches and the local semantics-based approaches, though both with limitations. Leveraging these two different approaches, this paper proposes a fake content detection model based on the mixed graph neural networks (GNN) for sustainable VSN. It takes GNN as the bottom architecture and integrates both convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks to capture two aspects of semantics. Such a mixed detection framework is expected to possess a better detection effect. A number of experiments were conducted on two social network datasets for evaluation, and the results indicated that the detection effect can be improved by about 5%-15% compared with baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {In the Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System (C-ITS) paradigm, vehicles could communicate with roadside units to augment their traffic knowledge. Smart roadside units could provide second-order information (e.g., vehicle count) from raw first-order data (e.g., visual feed, point clouds), and this “smart” feature is usually provided using deep neural network models. However, implementing these useful models implies a cost for computational complexity that could hinder the future deployment of smart roadside units needed for sustainability in transportation systems. In this paper, we propose to use model compression on deep image processing models to promote its feasibility for usage in smart sensors. We formulated a controllable convolutional model compression (CCMC) algorithm that can perform filter-wise evolutionary pruning on image processing networks, along with a predefined compression ratio. CCMC is applicable for image processing networks, which have multiple possible traffic data sources (e.g., road camera surveillance). Furthermore, CCMC has a definable target compression ratio that is useful for controlling the trade-off between resource consumption and output performance. We tested our proposed method on depth estimation, which is useful for scene understanding and mapping the locations of objects in the 3D space. Our experiments show that the pruned model has minimal performance discrepancy from the original one, supporting the sustainability features needed for intelligent transportation systems.},

To solve the problems like small sample size and unbalanced dataset, this study used a deep data augmentation method, e.g. WGAN-GP network, to augment the original limited B-Scan GPR data of subgrade, and then carried out supervised learning for classification task. The detailed computation steps include the image processing, data augmentation and intelligent analysis. First, the dataset was initially enlarged through the traditional methods after noise filtering, gamma transform and other processing methods. Then, the WGAN-GP network was adopted to generate new high-quality B-Scan images.

There are advances in formal description and verification of operating systems in ITSs recently and they mainly focus on bottom-up proofs in which the source codes satisfy certain expected properties expressed by logic formulae. In this paper, we propose a layered object model for operating systems in ITSs. This model includes functionality layer, refinement layer and concrete layer. We consider the operating system object model as a logic system ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$L$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ) with variables representing the objects of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$L$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , and a series of logic formulae for security and functional configurations in security of ITSs. We establish a mathematical structure as a domain of discourse for operating system in ITSs and accordingly, construct a mapping from operating system objects to the domain. In this way, we propose a formal method to verify the operating system security properties and configurations in ITSs. We use the virtual memory management part of our self-designed operating system VSOS as an example to illustrate the model and show that the claimed security properties can be rigorously proven for ITSs. The evaluation and verification of VSOS indicate that the proposed model implementation is feasible and achieves the security goals.},

This article describes the 3D placement of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in an IIoT network that supports non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). UAVs act as decode and forward (DF) relays. The 3D UAV placement problem is formulated which is highly non-convex in the coordinates. Therefore, we employ an improved adaptive whale optimization algorithm (IAWOA) to handle the problem. Even with its improved performance, IAWOA is not suitable for real-time application. Hence, we propose path aggregation network (PANet) to handle the 3D UAV placement.

Numerical results show that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional one which directly trains with the practical data. Moreover, the performance of the proposed ANN under both partial and full optimum architecture are studied. The results depict that the gap between these architectures is negligible.

Among all the factors in traffic crashes, aggressive driving in which the driver usually makes excessive lane changes to overtake other vehicles is prevalent. As such, monitoring lane changes and providing real-time warnings is beneficial for improving transportation sustainability. This article presents BackWatch, a novel vehicle-mounted sensing system that uses a back view cabin camera monitoring the steering wheel rotations to track lane-change events. BackWatch consists of an encoder network to extract essential visual features of steering wheel rotations, and an inference network incorporating the visual and GPS speed features to recognize the resulting lane changes. Our system does not rely on precise coordinate alignment between the monitoring device and the vehicle, nor the wearables worn by the driver, and is robust against different drivers, vehicles, driving speeds, and environmental settings. We evaluate the system based on 16 hours of real-world on-road driving data collected from three pairs of cars and drivers under different traffic and environmental conditions. The results show that BackWatch achieves 0.952 of precision and 0.981 of recall on the detection of lane changes.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle authentication is an essential component validating the vehicle’s identity and ensuring the integrity of transformed data for intelligent transport vehicles (ITS) in the vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). Easy to deploy and operate privacy-enhancing vehicle authentication mechanisms are the mainstay for the widespread ITS in the VANET. Very recently, VANET security architectures are constituting by IEEE 1609.2 group, NoW project, the SeVeCom project. However, these approaches heavily depend on the consuming public key infrastructure (PKI) and certification authorities (CA). In this work, walking along the research line, we attempt to design authentication protocols with two diverse factors for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) networks, respectively, without depending on the stumbling block PKI/CA. In addition, a smooth projective hash function (SPHF) (a.k.a., a special case of the designated-verifier zero-knowledge proof system) guarantees any recipient can confirm the authenticity and integrity of the received messages without knowing the authentication factors. Thus, to optimize the communication round, SPHF is used to design a (group) two-factor authenticated key exchange (AKE) with low-interactive communication rounds. The proof-of-concept implementation indicates that the computation and communication overheads introduced by our solution are acceptable in real-world deployments. The security of the proposed approach is validated using Bellare-Pointcheval-Rogaway (BPR) model along with the experimental evaluation and the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Accurate traffic prediction is a critical yet challenging task in Intelligent Transportation Systems, benefiting a variety of smart services, e.g., route planning and traffic management. Although extensive efforts have been devoted to this problem, it is still not well solved due to the flexible dependency within traffic data along both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this paper, we explore the flexibility from three aspects, namely the time-varying local spatial dependency, the dynamic temporal dependency, and the global spatial dependency. Then we propose a novel Dual Graph Gated Recurrent Neural Network (DG2RNN) to effectively model all these dependencies and offer flexible (multi-step) predictions for future traffic flow. Specifically, we design a Dual Graph Convolution Module to capture the local spatial dependency from two perspectives, namely road distance and adaptive correlation. To model the dynamic temporal dependency, we firstly develop a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Layer to capture the forward and backward sequential contexts of historical traffic flow, then combine the derived hidden states with their various contributions learned by a temporal attention mechanism. Besides, we further design a spatial attention mechanism to learn the latent global spatial dependency among all locations to facilitate the prediction. Extensive experiments on three types of real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-arts. Results also show our model has more stable performance for the flexible prediction with varying prediction horizons.},

  abstract     = {The motorcycle is a common mode of transport in many countries. Although there exist abundant studies on emissions from internal combustion engine motorcycles, little is known regarding the emissions from electric motorcycles (EMs). Methods commonly used in emissions analysis for internal combustion engine motorcycles are not suitable for non-exhaust emissions produced from EMs. Computer vision could provide the opportunity to facilitate analysis of EMs’ emissions analysis by utilizing EM counts in traffic videos captured from surveillance cameras. The proposed approach incorporates computer vision-based counting of EMs and internal combustion engine motorcycles in combination with ambient pollutant concentration monitoring. The measured pollutant concentration could be apportioned to EMs based on its proportion in the traffic flow. Results show that coarse particle number and PM1.0 are associated to the number of EMs with P Values smaller than 0.001. We also assess the potential change in ambient pollutant concentration through sensitivity analysis on motorcycle fleet electrification. Replacing all internal combustion engine motorcycles with the EMs could potentially reduce urban pollutant emissions by 48.62% for fine particles, 23.54% for CO2, and 13.41% for CO. However, this leads to increase of 29.83% for coarse particles and 24.09% for PM1.0. Through collected real-world data, the contributions of this study are the utilization of EM counts in emission analysis and the quantification of emission reduction by motorcycle electrification. This study could be applied for exposure assessment to emissions and their related health impacts to commuters.},

  abstract     = {Electric buses (e-buses) are increasingly adopted in the transit systems for their benefits of reduced roadside pollution and better onboard experience. E-bus scheduling is a critical problem in the operation planning stage of transit management to ensure efficient and reliable transit service. In Chinese mega cities, the e-bus networks are operated with many bus routes characterized by high service frequency and long operation time, making the e-bus scheduling a large-scale problem. Besides, the transit agency requires the vehicle-depot constraint to limit the e-bus reposition since it is not cost-efficient. An efficient method to generate optimized schedules that meet the above requirements is desired by the transit agencies. In this paper, we address a large-scale multi-depot electric bus scheduling problem considering the vehicle-depot constraint and partial recharging policy. A mixed integer programming model and an efficient branch-and-price (BP) algorithm are developed to solve the problem. In the BP algorithm, we devise a heuristic method to generate good initial solutions and adopted heuristic decisions in the label setting algorithm to solve the pricing problem. In this way, the efficiency of the BP algorithm is achieved and the large-sized problem instances can be solved. We conduct extensive numerical experiments based on the fixed-route and multi-route operation cases in Shenzhen. The results show that the BP algorithm can generate provable high-quality solutions. Sensitivity analysis indicates that increasing battery capacity and charging rate can reduce the operational cost. The optimal charging schedules can also provide guide in determining the capacity of the charging facilities.},

  abstract     = {To date immunity to disruptions of multi-scale urban road networks (URNs) has not been effectively quantified. This study uses robustness as a meaningful - if partial - representation of immunity. We propose a novel Relative Area Index (RAI) based on traffic assignment theory to quantitatively measure the robustness of URNs under global capacity degradation due to three different types of disruptions, which takes into account many realistic characteristics. We also compare the RAI with weighted betweenness centrality, a traditional topological metric of robustness. We employ six realistic URNs as case studies for this comparison. Our analysis shows that RAI is a more effective measure of the robustness of URNs when multi-scale URNs suffer from global disruptions. This improved effectiveness is achieved because of RAI’s ability to capture the effects of realistic network characteristics such as network topology, flow patterns, link capacity, and travel demand. Also, the results highlight the importance of central management when URNs suffer from disruptions. Our novel method may provide a benchmark tool for comparing robustness of multi-scale URNs, which facilitates the understanding and improvement of network robustness for the planning and management of URNs.},

Our team is among the first to propose the idea of utilizing the nearly unlimited computational resources in cyberspace to construct a bottom-up and top-down combined artificial ITSs for testing, experimenting, representation, verification, and validation of physical ITSs. Especially, the parallel transportation has been developed for safer, smarter, greener, and more reliable transportation services. After three decades of research and field studies, the DeCAST in Transverse, i.e., Decentralized/Distributed Autonomous Operations/Organizations (DAO) in transportation systems, has been envisioned. In this paper, we introduce its architecture, operational processes, software and hardware platforms, and real world applications.

The proposed algorithm is able to detect the resonant frequencies, allowing the maximum power transfer under inductive, ohmic, or capacitive behaviour of the system. Simple, fast and cheap structure of the algorithm renders obtaining the resonant frequency in a wide frequency range. Moreover, once the resonant frequency of the inverter is obtained, switching loss is minimized by leveraging Zero Current Switching (ZCS). The numerical simulations of the control algorithm are performed in MATLAB/Simulink. Furthermore, a Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis is conducted by utilizing co-simulation of Ansys Maxwell 3D - Simplorer - MATLAB/Simulink.

In this paper, a novel vision-based scene-adaptive real-time dehazing method for continuous video frames is developed, and the enhanced frames are fed into a detector in order to assess the value of image enhancement for detection tasks. The defogging stage is established by importing scene adaptation in order to improve the effectiveness of continuous frames defogging. Considering the distribution of atmospheric light intensity within the frame, the positions of the frame’s key points are determined in order to distinguish the scene differences between frames. Then, an algorithm is proposed for the inter-frame perception of atmospheric light intensity based on key points (“inverted triangle”), which employs a dynamic updating to adjust the estimated update frequency of atmospheric light intensity in time based on the scene change. Further, frames are inverted to estimate the transmission map based on the scattering model, which can quickly recover free of fog. Finally, the adaptive region of interest is set based on the obtained key point of frames, and the enhanced image is fed to the detector. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively handle sudden scene changes, as the defogging accuracy can reach 98.58%, the average defogging time of each frame is only a few milliseconds, and the detection accuracy can be improved by 4.11%.},

  abstract     = {In the foreseeable future, a coexistence of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and connected automated vehicles (CAVs) is expected in traffic flow systems. Effectively controlling CAVs to improve overall traffic performance and stability is a crucial yet challenging issue, especially when considering the uncertain behavior of HVs. This study proposes an optimal CAV controller for mixed connected traffic based on the adaptive model predictive control (AMPC) method. To mitigate the instability of the mixed platoon, the concept of loose disturbance string stability (LDSS) is introduced and integrated into the controller. Instead of using a fixed platoon size, a platoon formation criterion is established to dynamically calculate the number of vehicles in a platoon, taking into account the uncertain behavior of HVs, such as sudden deceleration and lane changes. An adaptive parameter tuning approach is incorporated into the MPC-based control framework to enhance the control performance in terms of stability, accuracy and disturbance recovery ability. The effects of the proposed CAV controller on overall traffic performance are investigated through two simulation experiments. In the first experiment, the performance of the proposed controller and LDSS are verified under three scenarios: sudden deceleration, vehicle leaving, and vehicle cut-in. In the second experiment, the proposed AMPC method is compared with two existing models: the linear quadratic regulation -based and acceleration-based connected cruise control models. The comparison results demonstrate that the proposed control model ensures LDSS and outperforms the other two approaches in terms of disturbance mitigation, albeit with a slight sacrifice of traffic efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Domain generalization (DG), which doesn’t require any data from target domains during training, is more challenging but practical than unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Since different vehicles of the same type have a similar appearance, neural networks always rely on a small amount of useful information to distinguish them, meaning that is more significant to remove ID-unrelated information for vehicle re-Identification (re-ID). Therefore, it is the key to eliminating the interference of a large amount of redundant information for the generalizable vehicle re-ID method. To address this unique challenge, we propose a novel disentanglement learning method that encourages variational autoencoder (VAE) network to reduce ID-unrelated features of vehicles by minimizing image reconstruction errors and providing sufficient representation to vehicle labels. To capture the intrinsic characteristics associated with the DG task, our core idea is to build the identity information streaming framework to separate ID-related and ID-unrelated information at the image and feature levels. In contrast with the general decoupling methods, our method leverages the decoupling of joint image and feature levels to extract more generalizable features. Furthermore, we present a brand-new vehicle dataset of truck types named “Optimus Prime (Opri)”, which includes multiple images of each truck captured by cameras at different high-speed toll gates. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve promising results and outperform several state-of-the-art approaches. Our codes and models are available at JIFD.},

  abstract     = {Urban rail transit (URT) is an essential part of urban public transportation. Accurate ridership prediction is increasingly important for the safe operation and efficient management of URT. However, existing studies regard the URT stations with different intersecting subway lines as a whole, which ignores the internal spatial connections within the stations. In fact, URT stations are embodiments of spatial coupling between subway lines. Additionally, the intrinsic patterns of ridership are also neglected. To further improve the prediction accuracy, this study proposes a deep learning model based on graph convolutional network (GCN) and bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) with a non-parallel structure (D-BLGCN). At the beginning, this study decouples the URT stations according to the intersecting subway lines. On the basis of spatial decoupling, different patterns of ridership are diverged into tributaries. Then, a non-parallel structure in the proposed model is designed to capture the intrinsic spatio-temporal correlations of ridership. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the integration of internal spatial connections and ridership diverging is employed for URT ridership prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted on Beijing URT ridership data with different time granularities. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves better prediction performance compared with baselines.},

  abstract     = {Virtual coupling is proposed as an innovative solution to meet the growing transport demand and to further improve the service quality of railways. Nevertheless, obtaining the optimal driving strategy that enhances its transport capacity and energy efficiency remains a challenging task. In order to achieve these objectives, this paper presents a novel convoy optimization method that optimizes the recommended trajectories for virtually coupled trains. A resilience adjustment model is firstly proposed to evaluate the coupling process and generate candidate trajectories according to the adjustment rules. In addition, the convoy optimization problem is formulated as a two-stage programming model consisting of a multi-objective programming stage and a least-cost goal programming stage, which determine the optimal trajectories for trains. Taking into account the requirements of practical applications, the solution method is finally designed to solve the proposed model and achieve dynamic updates of the recommended trajectories throughout train operations. Based on the field data from the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed railway line, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method shows the best performance in terms of infrastructure utilization and energy consumption, and the spacing between virtually coupled trains is well maintained regardless of ideal or disturbing conditions.},

  abstract     = {Reliable path tracking control (PTC) method is essential for autonomous driving. However, existing PTC methods count on prior vehicle parameters to achieve good performance. This paper presents an optimal PTC method without requiring any prior vehicle parameters based on online modeling with strict parameter convergence ability. First, we build a virtual optimal control problem using adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) scheme to guide the data collection and solve two characteristic matrices containing parameter information. Then, the model construction method is derived using the solved matrices and the optimal PTC method is constructed using the constructed model. Finally, a fault-tolerant control scheme is further designed using the constructed model and the online modeling ability of the proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through co-simulation between Matlab/Simulink and high-fidelity vehicle dynamic simulation software CarSim® under both fault-free and fault-tolerant situations.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes HSV (hue, saturation, value) with three sectors (HSV-3S) and two-dimensional gradient descent algorithm (2D-GDA) for high-saturation low-light image enhancement in night traffic monitoring (NTM). The saturation of HSV-3S is defined as the ratio of the projection vector length and twice length of the sector start vector, which results in that the saturation of HSV-3S is smaller than that of HSV, and a saturation weakening model is proposed to further decrease the saturation of HSV-3S. The hue of HSV-3S is defined as the cosine value of the included angle between the projection vector and the sector start vector in each of three sectors. HSV-3S is more concise and faster than HSV. Then, 2D-GDA extends the gradient descent algorithm to 2D image domain. 2D-GDA employs the iteration matrix with variable step values (i.e., the step values of the dark regions are less than those of the bright regions), which can improve the pixel distribution of the 2D-GDA enhanced image. Finally, the HSV-3S+2D- GDA based RGB image can be obtained by performing 2D-GDA on the value of HSV-3S with transforming the processed HSV-3S to RGB. The experimental results on NTM (i.e., the brevity name of the database collected from real ITS), LOL, ExDark and SICE databases, indicate that HSV-3S+2D-GDA is fast and efficient for high-saturation low-light image enhancement.},

  abstract     = {Eco–driving (ED) can be used for fuel savings in existing vehicles, requiring only a few hardware modifications. For this technology to be successful in a dynamic environment, ED requires an online real–time implementable policy. In this work, a dedicated Branch and Bound (BnB) model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization part of an ED optimal control problem. The developed MPC solution for ED is based on a prediction model that includes velocity dynamics as a function of distance and a finite number of driving modes and gear positions. The MPC optimization problem minimizes a cost function with two terms: one penalizing the fuel consumption and one penalizing the trip duration. We exploit contextual elements and use a warm–started solution to make the BnB solver run in real–time. The results are evaluated in numerical simulations on two routes in Israel and France and the long haul cycle of the Vehicle Energy consumption Calculation Tool (VECTO). In comparison with a human driver and a Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle (PMP) solution, 25.8% and 12.9% fuel savings, respectively, are achieved on average.},

Serving all charging requests on-demand can endanger the safety of the electrical power distribution network. This creates the issue of fairly allocating the charging energy among electric vehicles while maintaining the system within safe operational margins. However, calculating efficient charging schedules for the charging stations bears a high computational burden due to the non-convexities of charging stations’ models. In this paper, we consider a tri-level system with electric vehicles, charging stations, and a power distribution system operator. The objective of each station is formulated as a max-min fairness, mixed-integer linear optimization problem, while the network constraints are modeled using a second-order conic formulation. In order to tackle the computational complexity of the problem, we decompose it and use a novel approximation method tailored to this problem. We compare the performance of the proposed method with that of the popular alternating direction method of multipliers. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed method achieves a near-optimal solution along with promising scalability properties.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory datasets have been widely used in transportation research, but the risk of privacy breach comes with data sharing. Privacy budget allocation is a key step of the differential privacy (DP)-based privacy-preserving data publishing (PPDP) algorithm development, as it directly impacts the data utility of the released dataset. Most prior research used simple logic to allocate privacy budgets, such as evenly distributing them among different tree levels, without theoretical support to reach optimality. This manuscript presents the development of an optimal privacy budget allocation algorithm for transit smart card data, with the goal of publishing non-interactive sanitized trajectory data under a differential privacy definition. To this end, the smart card trajectory data are first stored in a prefix tree structure, and a query probability model is developed to quantitatively measure the probability of a trajectory location pair being queried. Next, the privacy budget is optimized for each prefix tree node to minimize the query error, while satisfying the differential privacy definition. The Lagrangian relaxation method is adopted to derive the optimal privacy budget values, and several propositions on the solution property are proposed and proved. Real-life metro smart card data from Shenzhen, China that include a total of 2.8 million individual travelers and over 220 million records are used in the case study section. The developed algorithm is demonstrated to output a sanitized dataset with the highest utilities when compared with three benchmark algorithms. Sensitivity analysis shows that the resulting data utility remains stable when the privacy budget changes. The runtime of the proposed algorithm is less than 160 seconds in all experiments, exhibiting good computational efficiency.},

However, this task often requires significant time spent on interaction and communication between domain experts, who possess in-depth knowledge of safety requirements in a specific domain, and formal experts, who have the necessary skills to apply verification tools and techniques. To enhance time efficiency and productivity, we propose an approach to empower domain experts with formal methods for verifying safety requirements’ consistency. This involves transforming natural requirements into formal models and using formal methods for verification. The approach also localizes inconsistent requirements to provide feedback to domain experts. Communication between domain experts and formal experts can be facilitated through the pattern language SafeNL. By adopting this approach, domain experts can utilize formal verification without extensive consultation with formal experts. Two practical case studies with CASCO Signal Ltd. validate its effectiveness, practicality, as well as a significant reduction of time compared to traditional methods (at least 90% reduction). This reduction in time is primarily due to reduced communication needs and more efficient localization. Evaluations show that SafeNL is user-friendly and the approach performs well in modular systems while scalability is somewhat limited.},

  abstract     = {State of charge (SOC) and state of power (SOP) are two critical indices for lithium-ion batteries. Due to the complex operating environment in real applications, battery temperature can change significantly. This will lead to varied battery internal characteristics and pose a challenge for battery modelling and state estimation. This paper proposes an adaptive approach for battery online SOC and SOP co-estimation considering temperatures. First, a fractional-order multi-model system (FO-MMS) is constructed by integrating three sub-models at −5 Celsius, 20 Celsius, and 45 Celsius. To accommodate the battery current-voltage behaviors at different loads, SOCs, and temperatures, the contribution coefficient of each sub-model is adapted online through a temperature-embedded regularized moving horizon estimation algorithm. Second, a fractional-order multi-model proportional-integral observer (FO-MM-PIO) is designed for SOC estimation which achieves rapid convergence and suppresses external disturbances using the H-infinity criteria. Moreover, the nonlinear charge transfer dynamics of a battery under intense loads is simulated through the Butler-Volmer equation. An iterative approaching algorithm is then derived to estimate battery SOP in high fidelity. The experimental validations demonstrate that the proposed co-estimation method achieves the mean absolute error of less than 1.3% in SOC estimation and 2 W in SOP estimation, even at a sub-zero temperature (i.e., −5 Celsius).},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) network with moving ground users in constant-velocity trajectory. A global optimal trajectory design scheme is proposed including a continuous analytic solution as well as optimization condition, which is theoretically different from numerical schemes obtaining a discrete piece-wise solution with approximate optimality. However, it is challenging to maximize the performance over entire infinite time slots in moving-user scenarios. By projecting the trajectory onto a user-relative coordinate frame, we reduce the performance to a location-determined function, which is in physical equivalence to an artificial potential field (APF). Accordingly, the optimization problem is reformulated to the shape determination problem of a density-varying catenary in the APF. By performing force analysis, we describe the topology of the catenary via a second-order differential equation determined by a boundary, i.e., any three combination of the location, orientation and turning curvature at arbitrary waypoints. Equivalently, the representation of the continuous solution is minimized in ultra-low-dimension parameter space and offers a flexible and lightning-speed design practice. Through complexity analysis, we find that the complexity of the proposed analytic scheme is significantly lower than the traditional discrete schemes. Further, we also prove that the global optimality, existence and uniqueness of the solution holds under a condition of a strong applicability to general sensing and communications (S&amp;C) services. In simulation, the equivalence is confirmed and the results show global optimality, low-complexity and the high flexibility under avoidance, crossing and G-force limit.},

Recent deep learning detection models are focused on detection accuracy and require a large number of computing sources and long run times. However, highly efficient and accelerated models with acceptable accuracy in real-time pavement crack detection tasks are required but hard to achieve. In this work, we present a customized deep learning model architecture named Efficient Crack Segmentation Neural Network (ECSNet) for accelerated real-time pavement crack detection and segmentation without compromising performance. We introduce some novel parts, including small kernel convolutional layers and parallel max pooling and convolutional operation, into the architecture for crack information quickly extraction and model’s parameter reduction. We test latency and accuracy trade-offs of our proposed model using the DeepCrack Dataset. The results demonstrate strong performance in both accuracy and efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art models including DeepLabV3, FCN, LRASPP, Enet, Unet and DeepCrack. It is promising that ECSNet obtains the second place with an F1 score of (84.45%) and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 73.08%. Furthermore, our model gains the largest Frames Per Second (FPS) and lowest training time among all the models which is 73.29 and 5011 seconds, respectively.

However, the gender, skin color, age, and appearance of different drivers often have big differences, which will greatly interfere with the emotional recognition process. Besides, light intensity inside the vehicle varies with different time, weather, and location, which will also pose a challenge to driver emotion recognition. In this paper, a robust driver emotion recognition method based on feature separation is proposed to overcome the interference of individual differences and illumination changes. In order to realize the separation of expression-related features and irrelevant features, we design a high-purity feature separation (HPFS) framework based on partial feature exchange and the constraints of multiple loss functions. To verify that the proposed method can overcome the interference of illumination changes, we specifically create a multiple light intensities driver emotion recognition (MLI-DER) dataset and conduct a great deal of experiments on the dataset. In addition, to further demonstrate that our method can largely alleviate the interference of individual difference, some cross-subject emotion recognition experiments are conducted on two famous facial expression recognition datasets FACES and Oulu-CASIA and the experimental results are compared with that of some state-of-the-art methods.},

The proposed HR-Pix2Pix generative adversarial neural network involves a novel generator architecture for fusing multi-level semantic features. The generator is capable to automatically locate the pseudo-distress in the image and fill (generate) the region as normal pavement texture with reference to the pavement texture surrounding the pseudo-distress. To further improve the quality of the semantic distribution-enhanced images, a hybrid loss function is designed and used to train the network.

  abstract     = {Cities of all sizes around the world are facing increasing levels of congestion, which leads to increasing travel time and emissions, and ultimately affects the quality of life. Relevant research suggests that adaptive traffic light control systems can improve the traffic flow, but their impact on energy-efficiency of vehicle propulsion systems is not well understood. In this study, we use Proximal Policy Optimization, a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm, to develop an optimized adaptive traffic light control systems that controls three traffic lights simultaneously. For this purpose, we have created a microscopic traffic simulation of the city of Aachen, Germany, calibrated on the basis of traffic measurements, where the actual traffic light schedule, a green-wave, fixed-time control scheme, serves as a reference. The traffic simulation is coupled with detailed, physics-based powertrain models of both conventional and electric vehicles, which are validated against chassis dynamometer measurements. By analyzing the complex interactions between traffic light control, the resulting vehicle trajectories and the powertrain components, we show that Reinforcement Learning-based adaptive control can significantly improve the traffic flow, with a 41% increase in average velocity, without any drawbacks in CO2 emission (−1%). Furthermore, we find that maximizing traffic flow and minimizing CO2 emissions are not necessarily contradictory objectives, and identify an increased energy saving potential at low traffic densities. Thus, we prove that adaptive traffic light control can make traffic not only more time-efficient, but also more sustainable.},

  abstract     = {In-vehicle network security plays a vital role in ensuring the secure information transfer between vehicle and Internet. The existing research is still facing great difficulties in balancing the conflicting factors for the in-vehicle network security and hence to improve intrusion detection performance. To challenge this issue, we construct a many-objective intrusion detection model by including information entropy, accuracy, false positive rate and response time of anomaly detection as the four objectives, which represent the key factors influencing intrusion detection performance. We then design an improved intrusion detection algorithm based on many-objective optimization to optimize the detection model parameters. The designed algorithm has double evolutionary selections. Specifically, an improved differential evolutionary operator produces new offspring of the internal population, and a spherical pruning mechanism selects the excellent internal solutions to form the selected pool of the external archive. The second evolutionary selection then produces new offspring of the archive, and an archive selection mechanism of the external archive selects and stores the optimal solutions in the whole detection process. An experiment is performed using a real-world in-vehicle network data set to verify the performance of our proposed model and algorithm. Experimental results obtained demonstrate that our algorithm can respond quickly to attacks and achieve high entropy and detection accuracy as well as very low false positive rate with a good trade-off in the conflicting objective landscape.},

  abstract     = {Reliability-based global path planning incorporates reliability constraints into path planning to ensure that off-road autonomous ground vehicles can operate reliably in uncertain off-road environments. Current two-stage reliability-based path planning methods involve separate stages for surrogate modeling of mobility prediction and global path planning, resulting in a large number of unnecessary mobility simulations that makes the approaches computationally expensive. To tackle this challenge, this work proposes a novel efficient reliability-based global path planning approach, named ER-RRT*, which couples adaptive surrogate modeling with the rapidly-exploring random tree star (RRT*) algorithm. Firstly, a surrogate model for vehicle mobility prediction is used to guide the exploration of random trees subject to a mobility reliability constraint. Subsequently, the exploration trees and reliability assessment are employed to inform mobility simulations for the surrogate model refinement. These steps are implemented iteratively and thereby drastically reducing the required mobility simulations for path planning through the integration of adaptive surrogate modeling with global path planning. With a focus on the uncertainty in the slope map and soil properties of deformable terrain, we demonstrate ER-RRT* using a case study and compare it with the current two-stage approach. The results show that ER-RRT* is much more efficient than the current method in both computational time and the required number of mobility simulations for surrogate model construction. In addition, the path identified by ER-RRT* exhibits a comparable cost in distance to its counterpart obtained using the two-stage method.},

However, due to the volatile nature of traffic flow, obtaining long-term traffic flow information (e.g., one week in advance) is challenging, particularly for multiple neighbored sites. To address this issue, this work establishes a deep learning prediction framework called Spatiotemporal Periodic Network (STPNet), which utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture. The STPNet incorporates a spatiotemporal and periodic pattern learning technique, and leverages the advantages of convolutional long short-term memory units (ConvLSTM) to quantify the uncertainty of traffic flow. Furthermore, to improve the performance of traffic flow prediction, a spatiotemporal series decomposition strategy based on Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) is employed, and a spatiotemporal PI performance-based loss function is creatively developed in this work. Then, the PIs of the EV charging demand are obtained based on the predicted traffic flow information and an M/M/C/K queuing model. Validated using a real-world dataset, the proposed model has been demonstrated to exhibit effectiveness in generating high-quality EV charging demand PIs for multiple locations.},

Such tasks require the artificial perception of the railway environment through the data acquired from different types of sensors, including cameras, LiDARs, wheel encoders, GNSS receivers, and inertial measurement units. However, testing new algorithms and solutions that use such sensory data requires the availability of a large amount of labeled data, acquired in different scenarios and operating conditions, which are difficult to obtain in a real railway setting, due to strict regulations and practical constraints in accessing the trackside infrastructure and equipping a train with the required sensors. To cope with such difficulties, this paper presents a visual simulation framework able to generate realistic railway scenarios in a virtual environment and automatically produce a variety of labeled datasets from different types of emulated sensors, including cameras, LiDARs, and inertial measurement units. Such scenarios and datasets can be used for testing innovative algorithms, as well as for training and testing deep neural networks for a variety of tasks, as image segmentation, object detection, visual odometry, track discrimination, etc. The proposed framework is particularly relevant for the railway domain, considered the lack of similar datasets and the difficulty of reproducing critical situations in a real environment.

  abstract     = {The Resource Constrained Shortest Path Problem (RCSPP) seeks to determine a minimum-cost path between a start and a goal location while ensuring that one or multiple types of resource consumed along the path do not exceed their limits. This problem is often solved on a graph where a path is incrementally built from the start towards the goal during the search. RCSPP is computationally challenging as comparing these partial solution paths is based on multiple criteria (i.e., the accumulated cost and resource along the path), and in general, there does not exist a single path that optimizes all criteria simultaneously. Consequently, the search needs to maintain and explore a large number of partial paths in order to find an optimal solution. While a variety of algorithms have been developed to solve RCSPP, they either have little consideration about efficiently comparing and maintaining the partial paths, which reduces their overall runtime efficiency, or are restricted to handle only one resource constraint as opposed to multiple resource constraints. This paper develops Enhanced Resource Constrained A* (ERCA*), a fast A*-based algorithm that can find an optimal solution while satisfying multiple resource constraints. ERCA* leverages both the recent advances in multi-objective path planning to efficiently compare and maintain partial paths, and techniques from the existing RCSPP literature. Furthermore, ERCA* has a functional parameter to broker a trade-off between solution quality and runtime efficiency. The results show ERCA* often runs several orders of magnitude faster than an existing leading algorithm for RCSPP.},

The huge volume of trajectory data causes high cost and poses a great challenge to data storage, network transmission, query and analysis. Therefore, the compression of trajectory data becomes a crucial issue. This paper proposes an online trajectory compression algorithm based on vector extraction (VOLTCom), which aims to achieve efficient data compression while retaining more effective information, and is mainly applied to trajectory recording and analysis in the traffic field. VOLTCom first generates vectors for trajectory data according to customized vector features, and then performs real-time vector extraction to achieve online trajectory compression. The vector extraction of the trajectory data ensures the stability of the compression time per unit and achieves efficient compression. Experiments on real datasets show that VOLTCom can retain the information of object velocity variation by vector density and outperforms traditional algorithms in terms of error, compression rate, and execution time.

  abstract     = {The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) is a parsimonious modelling tool for monitoring and controlling urban traffic networks. MFD can be derived based on traffic data (empirical or simulation), or approximated analytically. Deriving the MFD based on traffic data is rather challenging due to difficulties in acquiring adequate data in large-scale urban networks. Previous studies have attempted to estimate the MFD based on probe vehicle trajectories assuming an a priori penetration rate, which is unlikely to be known in reality. This assumption was relaxed in other studies incorporating loop detector observations which provide the total number of vehicles on the links. The present study aims to estimate the MFDs using only probe vehicle trajectories where the probe penetration rate is not known a priori nor constant over time and space. Our approach relies on queue lengths at signalised intersections that can be inferred from probe vehicle positions. Considering the number of probe vehicles in a given cycle and the queue length inferred from probe vehicle positions, a penetration rate can be estimated for each approach of signalised intersections. We also define neighborhood penetration rates to account for spatial variability of the penetration rate as well as to estimate the penetration rate of links that are not connected to signalized intersections.},

Although many efforts have been done on this topic, there are still many challenges, including accumulated prediction errors, insufficient training data usage, and future-past incompatibility. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory prediction method, called CSIR, which consists of a cascaded sliding conditional variational autoencoder (CS-CVAE) module and an iterative future-past social compatible rethinking (I-SCR) module. The CS-CVAE module reduces the accumulated prediction errors by using cascaded prediction models for the early future time steps. In this way, the training losses of the early time steps are separately considered and minimized from the later losses. For the following time steps in CS-CVAE, a sliding prediction model with a longer observation time span is used and additional data from the future time span can be collected for training. On the other hand, the I-SCR module generates offsets to improve the predictions iteratively by checking the interaction compatibility between the predicted trajectories and the past trajectories, which resembles with the human rethinking mechanism in motion planning. Experiments results on two widely explored pedestrian trajectory prediction datasets, Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD) and ETH/UCY, show that the proposed method surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods by notable margins.},

  abstract     = {Rapid growth in the number of electric vehicles (EVs) calls for research on traffic equilibrium in urban transportation networks (UTNs). As a result of the interaction of EVs and fast charging stations (FCSs), traffic flow is influenced by EV drivers’ charging preferences. However, little research investigates the impact of heterogeneous charging preferences across EV drivers on the traffic flow at traffic equilibrium. This paper establishes a traffic model where the heterogeneity across EV drivers is reflected in the monetary value of time and sensitivity to electricity prices. Based on the traffic model, we propose a Stackelberg game to model the interaction of EVs and FCSs while ensuring the user equilibrium of UTN. The game features a hierarchical structure. At the higher level, FCSs play a non-cooperative game by strategically setting electricity prices with imperfect information of other FCSs. At the lower level, EVs play an evolutionary game to charge at FCSs with the lowest cost. An adaptive step control method is designed to prevent potential oscillations near the Nash equilibrium. Numerical results show that the difference in EV flow on the road can reach 18.42% without considering heterogeneity and considering heterogeneity. The proposed framework can illustrate how the heterogeneity across EVs influences the formation of traffic flow in traffic equilibrium calculation.},

We first develop an intelligent AUV system, which includes binocular cameras for short-distance obstacle avoidance, sonars for long-distance detection, and modems for acoustic communication with buoys. For such system, the parallax angles from AUV to obstacles are utilized to construct an optimal motion planning problem by integrating our previously proposed channel estimation approach. In order to solve the above problem, a deep learning method called depth deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is developed to minimize the cost function, such that a collision-free path can be planed for AUV while maintaining the communication quality. Note that the advantages of our solution are highlighted as: 1) balance the communication quality and motion stability over the disk model-based methods; 2) improve the collision-avoidance efficiency in path lengths and control efforts as compared with the distance-based methods. Finally, simulation and experimental studies are both provided to verify the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract     = {3D perception is an essential capability of autonomous vehicles. Most state-of-the-art stereo matching networks pursue higher prediction accuracy at the cost of the inference speed. However, high demand on computational resource pushes the cost of hardware, hindering practical applications of stereo matching. In this paper, we propose RMCNet, a novel re-parameterized coarse-to-fine network for stereo matching. RMCNet achieves real time on edge devices while outputs accurate disparity maps. To reduce the computing complexity of 3D convolution in cost aggregation, we propose Mixed Cost Volumes that consist of 4D and 3D cost volumes, enabling efficient optimization of the initial disparity map for real-time inference. An Efficient Feature Matching module is proposed to provide absolute disparity candidates for 3D cost volume. To increase the reliability of 4D and 3D cost volumes, we propose a simple but efficient 3D cost aggregation module and a pyramid 2D cost aggregation module for the aggregation of Mixed Cost Volumes. Moreover, we propose a Re-parameterized Channel Sensing module and a Re-parameterized Disparity-Aware module to replace 2D and 3D convolutional blocks with residual connections. Being evaluated on KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015, the comprehensive performance of the proposed network is improved by the re-parameterization approach. Outstanding trade-off between accuracy and speed on edge devices over existing SOTA works is achieved. With fast average inference speed on NVIDIA Jetson Nano of 33.74 FPS, the accuracy in terms of 3px-all on KITTI 2012 test set and D1-all on KITTI 2015 test set are 3.01% and 3.41%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In a traffic monitoring system, users report their driving data (e.g., routes and timestamps) to a server, aggregating them to acquire the information of interest and provide services, e.g., traffic flow prediction. Such systems have considerable promise for improving the quality of life and decreasing environmental pollution and economic losses. However, the threat to individual privacy is a critical problem that hinders the further development of such systems; e.g., the server can abuse the spatio-temporal metadata in the reports to infer sensitive user information, such as the home address. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving aggregation framework called secure Publish Aggregate Subscribe Data ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$s$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; PASD) for traffic monitoring that can protect spatio-temporal metadata during driving data aggregation. The framework is built upon a trusted execution environment and two cryptographic tools: additive homomorphic encryption and oblivious RAM. It takes a hierarchical structure that boosts batch processing efficiency, making it more appropriate for traffic monitoring scenarios. Furthermore, we provide a cost model to derive the optimal settings from the efficiency perspective. Security analysis demonstrates that &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$s$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; PASD can protect individual privacy by hiding spatio-temporal information during aggregation. Moreover, we implement the proposed framework in Python and evaluate it together with other competitive methods over a real-world dataset. The experiment results verify the accuracy of the proposed cost model and show that the proposed framework can gain a 51.39% saving on computation cost.},

  abstract     = {Fast charging has the potential to address range anxiety and facilitate the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). However, the distinct characteristics of public fast charging, such as short dwell times, diverse EV charge curves, and uncertain battery management systems (BMS), makes accurate coordination challenging while using traditional EV charging scheduling algorithms. This paper proposes a charge curve and BMS aware EV charging scheduling framework for capacity-constrained fast charging stations (FCSs) with a heterogeneous customer mix. The proposed framework involves a lexicographic mixed-integer optimization problem that is solved using a receding horizon scheme. The main contributions are: 1) an EV charge curve model that accurately reflects fast charging characteristics and can be efficiently incorporated into an optimization problem; 2) the introduction of two customer types to ensure high and fair quality of service (QoS) among customers with diverse preferences and EV specifications; 3) a four-criteria lexicographic optimization formulation that yields a pareto-optimal solution and provides additional benefits such as increased intermediate state-of-charge levels and reduced charge ramps; and 4) the adoption of a receding horizon scheme and a bounding heuristic that effectively addresses uncertainties associated with EV arrivals and BMS actions. Extensive case studies reveal that the proposed framework consistently outperforms the three benchmark methods by achieving a charge fairness improvement of up to 10.41% compared to the second best performer, while maintaining over 90% fairness score even under various BMS uncertainties and remaining computationally efficient for practical use in fast charging stations.},

  abstract     = {To improve the reliability of autonomous vehicles, open-set fault diagnosis is indispensable to jointly detect known and unknown faults, in which unknown faults only appear in the testing set. However, in learning the representations for open-set diagnosis, the extracted representations lack hierarchy to preserve high-level and genuine representations, and the final representations utilized for diagnosing lack distinctiveness to separate unknowns from knowns. In addition, in the stage of testing, the open-set diagnosis models are error-prone when unknowns are similar to knowns. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a Multi-hop Attentive Graph Variational Autoencoder (MAGVA) model for open-set fault diagnosis in this paper. First, a multi-hop attentive graph convolutional network is developed to adaptively extract hierarchical representations and eliminate unknown fault misidentification. Then, to avoid unknown faults occupying the same region as known faults and identify known faults, structural representation constraints are designed by jointly conducting reconstruction with an intra-class constraint and classification with an inter-class constraint. Finally, combining the distinguishable representations learned by MAGVA, a generative distance-based open-set diagnosis algorithm is proposed, in which the procedures of estimating class-conditional distributions are designed, and a relative generative distance is then presented to derive diagnosis results under the class-conditional distributions. Experiments on three commonly used bearing datasets for vehicles demonstrate that the proposed MAGVA consistently outperforms the compared models in open-set, closed-set, and unknown fault diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Facts proved that obeying traffic laws keeps the promise to promote the safety of self-driving vehicles. Current self-driving vehicles usually have fixed algorithms during autonomous driving, however the traffic laws may differ or change in different regions or times, e.g., tidal lanes. It raises a crucial requirement to make self-driving vehicles adapt to the newly received traffic laws. The challenges are that traffic laws are usually semantic and manually designed, but the original algorithms may not always contain the pre-designed interface to adapt to emerging laws. To this end, this work proposes a traffic law adaptive decision-making platform, which uses the linear temporal logic (LTL) formula to consistently describe the semantic traffic laws. Then, an LTL-based reinforcement learning framework is designed to estimate the probability of illegal behavior under different traffic laws. Finally, a law-specific backup policy is designed to maintain the performance threshold by monitoring the probability of illegal behavior. This work takes three typical scenarios where the traffic laws differ for instance to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach, i.e., law amendment presented by the government, law difference between different regions, and temporary traffic control. The results show that the proposed method can help the original decision-making algorithms adapt to the traffic laws well without pre-defined interfaces. This method provides a way to administer on-road driving self-driving vehicles.},

To solve the OFD problem, a predictive-reactive optimization framework with feedback-based knowledge distillation is presented by organically combining deep learning technology and operational research method. In the prediction phase, a deep learning model is designed to predict future information which can reflect the delivery efficiency of dispatching results. To improve model performance, a feedback-based knowledge distillation is proposed which balances the diversity and effectiveness of the ensembled models by adaptively controlling learning weights. In the optimization phase, to avoid myopic decisions and obtain high-quality solutions for long-term objectives, a greedy heuristic with a multi-stage decision-making strategy is designed by employing the predicted future information to assist in making decisions. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world datasets to test the performance of the proposed model and heuristic. Besides, the simulation results illustrate the superiority of the proposed framework for solving the OFD problem in both delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we observed that a nonlinear line could be expressed with a set of linear lines. We propose a novel lane detection method with polyline-based reconstruction based on this hypothesis. We define the optimal principal points with a new metric, the principal score, to generate the polyline. According to the principal score, we select principal points having a high influence on lane reconstruction and simply reproduce the target lane by connecting them. Additionally, conventional methods predict a fixed number of parameters to express each lane. However, this can limit an ability to represent a lane curvature and cause inaccurate detection results. Therefore, we set the number of principal points to be dynamically changed depending on the lane curvature to solve this problem. This allows the model to make flexible detection results reflecting the characteristics of each lane. We also propose a training strategy with a new piece-wise linear equation-based loss function. With this strategy, the model is fine-tuned to predict the principal points representing the curved parts of the lane well. Last, we propose a spatial context-aware feature flip fusion module to exploit the symmetric property of road images. This module helps the model selectively utilize the spatial context in the flipped feature map based on the lane density. We effectively reduce the adverse effects, especially the false positives of the existing feature flip fusion module misaligned on asymmetrical images. The experiments show that the proposed method provides competitive lane detection results compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

However, semantic segmentation remains challenging in poor illumination and inclement weather. Thermal camera, highly invariant to light and highly penetrating to rain and fog, enables semantic segmentation to work under challenging conditions. Thus, this paper explores semantic segmentation in thermal videos to broaden the scope of the application of road scene understanding. We offer the first thermal video semantic segmentation dataset TVSS including 1695 thermal videos with 50850 frames in road scenes. It is available at: https://xzbai.buaa.edu.cn/datasets.html . TVSS is finely annotated by 17 categories at the frame rate of 1fps, with a labeled pixel density of 98.9%. Existing video semantic segmentation methods rely on the amount of labels and the representation power of backbones, which cannot achieve ideal results on thermal videos. Thus, we introduce a multi-granularity contrastive learning based thermal video semantic segmentation model (MGCL), which explores the abundant unlabeled frames to boost the supervised segmentation. Specifically, MGCL constructs multi-granularity self-supervised signals on unlabeled thermal videos by contrastive learning, including the intra-frame context generalization loss, the intra-clip temporal consistency loss, and the inter-video category discrimination loss. In addition, a hard anchor sampling strategy is introduced to focus on hard-classify pixels for further performance improvement. Extensive experiments on TVSS demonstrate the superior performance of MGCL in both accuracy and efficiency. Compared to the 12 state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods, MGCL achieves 2.8% to 8.1% gains in mIoU performance while maintaining the inference speed.},

However, few studies have focused on modeling the lateral vehicle control behaviors of distracted drivers for HSS. The current study models this type of behavior in a series of high-fidelity driving simulator experiments with 18 participants. Two experimental conditions for a double lane change task are tested: HGT-Constant (haptic guidance torque with a constant gain) and HGT-Adaptive (haptic guidance torque with an adaptive gain). A gated recurrent unit (GRU) network is used to model lateral control behavior during driving. The effectiveness of the GRU network-based lateral control model of distracted drivers is benchmarked using a state-of-the-art long short-term memory network, a back propagation network, an extreme learning machine, and a traditional two-point visual model with neuromuscular dynamics. Experimental results indicate that the GRU network has the highest accuracy in terms of root mean square error, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and determination coefficient. In addition, a simulation model of the driver-vehicle-road closed-loop system demonstrates that the proposed model predicts driver behavior with acceptable lateral position error.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new approach to scale-aware monocular visual odometry (VO) and extrinsic calibration using constraints on camera motion by vehicle kinematics. Main idea is to utilize the Ackermann steering model to observe absolute metric scale in turning motion. To describe motion of the camera attached to the vehicle, we first estimate unknown camera-vehicle relative pose by the proposed extrinsic calibration method. To stably observe scale, we detect turn regions and design an observer to estimate the absolute scale as a function of the camera rotation and direction of translational motion during turning. Using the observed scale, we propose an absolute scale recovery to estimate the unknown scale between turns. Because the proposed scale observer becomes singular near zero rotation, we conduct sensitivity analysis on the scale observer, and investigate appropriate conditions for stable scale estimation. For quantitative evaluation of the extrinsic calibration and the absolute scale recovery, we randomly generate synthetic driving datasets with various noise conditions, and evaluate the performance of each module statistically by Monte-Carlo simulations. To evaluate the overall performance, we implement our method and state-of-the-art monocular and stereo VO methods in the public outdoor driving KITTI dataset, and our method shows competitive scale recovery performance with no external sensor and no assumption on surroundings such as planar ground landmarks. To show promising applicability, we collect real-world driving datasets in two multi-floor underground parking lots, and demonstrate the accurate absolute scale recovery performance of our method in indoor driving situations.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) method for path tracking control of autonomous vehicles under network-induced delays while taking into account the roll dynamics to improve both the driving safety and the passenger comfort. The steering control is directly applied to the front wheels, while the anti-roll moment is exerted by an active suspension. The asynchronous phenomenon caused by the sampling process and the time-varying vehicle speed are explicitly taken into account in the control design using a polytopic linear parameter-varying (LPV) control approach. Moreover, to avoid using costly vehicle sensors and complex control structures, a static output feedback (SOF) control scheme is considered. An effective event-triggering mechanism is also proposed to alleviate the communication burden of the vehicle networked control system. Based on augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, the control design conditions are derived to guarantee the vehicle closed-loop stability under the effects of transmission delays, event-triggered control signals and time-varying parameters. The design procedure is reformulated as an iterative optimization problem involving linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints, which can be effectively solved with available numerical solvers. The proposed event-triggered SOF controller is evaluated with the vehicle dynamics simulation software CarSim under several dynamic scenarios. A comparative study with related vehicle control results is performance to emphasize the effectiveness of the control method in terms of path tracking performance, driving safety and comfort, and data communication efficiency of the vehicle networked control system.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous pedestrian-aware navigation in shared human-robot environments is a challenging problem. Here we consider a common situation in which a large crowd of pedestrians moves together in a limited space. Traditional planners struggle to find collision-free paths in such situations since the free space is limited and always changing. To solve this problem, we proposed a flow map-based RRT* method (FM-RRT*) containing a velocity layer and a minimally-intrusive layer. The proposed method models the velocity of the pedestrian flow and the area where the robot is less invasive to pedestrians. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive bias sampling, which drives the robot considering relative velocity, or minimal intrusion, according to the pedestrian flow. The evaluation is conducted in the Crowdbot Challenge simulator. The results show that our method can find a feasible path considering collision risk while simultaneously avoiding intrusive human movement.},

  abstract     = {Due to the rapid growth of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and the rise of multimedia services, IoV networks’ servers and switches are facing resource crises. Multimedia vehicles connected to the Internet of Things are increasing; there are millions of vehicles and heavy multimedia traffic in the IoV network. The network’s scarcity of resources results in overload, which, in turn, leads to a degradation of both Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE). Conversely, when resources are abundant, it leads to unnecessary energy wastage. Managing IoV network resources optimally while considering constraints such as Energy, Load, QoS, and QoE is a complex challenge. To address this, the study proposes a solution by decomposing the problem and designing a modular architecture named &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\textit {ELQ}^{\vphantom {D^{j}}2}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; . This architecture enables simultaneous control of the mentioned constraints, effectively reducing overall complexity. To achieve this objective, Network Softwarization and Virtualization concepts are employed. This modern architecture allows dynamically adjusting of the scale of the resources on demand, effectively reducing energy usage. Additionally, this architecture provides some other potentials, such as “the distribution of multimedia traffic among servers”, “determining the route with high QoS for traffic”, and “selecting a media with high QoE”. A real test field is provided by Floodlight Controller, Open vSwitch, and Kamailio Server tools to evaluate the performance of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${ELQ}^{2}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; . The findings suggest that the utilization of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${ELQ}^{2}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; holds promise in reducing the count of active servers and switches via effective resource management. Additionally, it demonstrates enhancements in various QoS and QoE parameters, encompassing throughput, multimedia delay, R Factor, and MOS, accomplished through load balancing strategies. As an illustration, the deployment of flows has achieved a commendable success rate of 95% owing to the utilization of SDN-based and comprehensive management practices encompassing all network resources.},

We address this urgent issue by proposing a systematic distributed SA consensus scheme, including a distributed optimization-based consensus reaching model, dual-loop decision-making framework, and novel coordination algorithm.

  abstract     = {In an urban environment, the accurate prediction of congestion levels is a prerequisite for formulating traffic demand management strategies reasonably. Current traffic forecasting studies mostly focus on the road topological network and assume that the spatial linkages of road segments is fixed, thus ignoring associated congestion level changes between road segments. This study introduces a fusion-based graph convolutional network called the F-GCN. The model aims to capture the dynamic correlations of the congestion levels among road segments while constructing the static topology of the road network. In particular, the entropy-based grey relation analysis method is first implemented in the dynamic graph convolutional network (GCN) module to measure the potential correlations among the observed congestion levels. Then, spatio-temporal blocks that integrate GCN layers, spatial attention mechanisms, and long short-term memory layers are built for both the static and dynamic GCN modules. Finally, the F-GCN model is developed by fusing the static GCN and dynamic GCN module. The numerical experiments on Beijing taxies demonstrated that the proposed F-GCN model achieved a significant 5.47%, 5.64%, and 8.14% improvements for the 15-, 30-, and 45-min prediction tasks in the weighted mean absolute percentage error compared to the state-of-the-art baseline models. This improvement highlights the effectiveness of the model in predicting congestion levels, demonstrating its superiority and potential in capturing the dynamic potential correlations among the congestion levels of road segments.},

Pixel-wise semantic segmentation of RGB images can be advanced by exploiting complementary features from the supplementary modality ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${X}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -modality). However, covering a wide variety of sensors with a modality-agnostic model remains an unresolved problem due to variations in sensor characteristics among different modalities. Unlike previous modality-specific methods, in this work, we propose a unified fusion framework, CMX, for RGB-X semantic segmentation. To generalize well across different modalities, that often include supplements as well as uncertainties, a unified cross-modal interaction is crucial for modality fusion. Specifically, we design a Cross-Modal Feature Rectification Module (CM-FRM) to calibrate bi-modal features by leveraging the features from one modality to rectify the features of the other modality. With rectified feature pairs, we deploy a Feature Fusion Module (FFM) to perform sufficient exchange of long-range contexts before mixing. To verify CMX, for the first time, we unify five modalities complementary to RGB, i.e., depth, thermal, polarization, event, and LiDAR. Extensive experiments show that CMX generalizes well to diverse multi-modal fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performances on five RGB-Depth benchmarks, as well as RGB-Thermal, RGB-Polarization, and RGB-LiDAR datasets. Besides, to investigate the generalizability to dense-sparse data fusion, we establish an RGB-Event semantic segmentation benchmark based on the EventScape dataset, on which CMX sets the new state-of-the-art. The source code of CMX is publicly available at https://github.com/huaaaliu/RGBX_Semantic_ Segmentation.},

The proposed method solves the energy imbalance and mitigates random power fluctuations through day-ahead scheduling and intraday adjustment, respectively. In day-ahead scheduling, a load power model based on berth-quay crane (B-QC) scheduling is presented. Furthermore, to optimize the operation economy of ports in consideration of carbon emission cost, a day-ahead transportation-electricity scheduling method combined with B-QC is presented, which realizes the integrated demand-side management of port transportation and power load. In intraday adjustment, a variable structure scenario tree prediction model of random power is formulated, and a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) strategy is proposed to reduce the power disturbance to the main grid. Simulation results based on historical data show that in sunny and cloudy scenarios, compared with no collaborative operation, the operation cost under the proposed method is reduced by 31.9% and 7.5%, respectively, and the total carbon emissions are reduced by 9.4% and 3.8%, respectively. The average power fluctuation of the main grid is lower under the SMPC strategy.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is gradually becoming mature, but at the same time, the scale of intelligent vehicles on the road will increase rapidly, and the traditional cloud computing architecture cannot meet the requirements of low delay of IoV system. As a supplement to cloud computing, mobile edge computing (MEC) can effectively solve the problem of long-distance transmission, bring the computing location close to the network edge of the mobile terminal, and improve the quality of service (QoS) of IoV. However, in the face of a large number of computing data, the congestion and waiting of the system can not be ignored. Finding the best offloading position of the task can effectively alleviate the above problems. Therefore, this paper proposes a joint on-board task offloading and job scheduling method based on cloud-edge computing (JVTR). Firstly, based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle location information, the task transmission route is obtained, and the offloading location is found. Then, the MEC server implements task scheduling and job scheduling according to the current status of virtual machines (VMs). We use ant colony optimization (ACO) to achieve multi-objective optimization, find the optimal offloading strategy, and evaluate the objective function with simple additive weighting (SAW) and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). Finally, the effectiveness of JVTR is proved by experiments.},

To effectively calibrate trust, it becomes crucial to accurately measure drivers’ trust levels in real time, allowing for timely interventions or adjustments in the automated driving. One viable approach involves employing machine learning models and physiological measures to model the dynamic changes in trust. This study introduces a technique that leverages machine learning models to predict drivers’ real-time dynamic trust in conditional AVs using physiological measurements. We conducted the study in a driving simulator where participants were requested to take over control from automated driving in three conditions that included a control condition, a false alarm condition, and a miss condition. Each condition had eight takeover requests (TORs) in different scenarios. Drivers’ physiological measures were recorded during the experiment, including galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR) indices, and eye-tracking metrics. Using five machine learning models, we found that eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) performed the best and was able to predict drivers’ trust in real time with an f1-score of 89.1% compared to a baseline model of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$K$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -nearest neighbor classifier of 84.5%.

The designed event-triggered condition is derived based on the local communication among robots by the best use of nonholonomic property of NNMRs, which can fully guarantee to exclude the Zeno behavior before the desired formation configuration is achieved. Finally, the theoretical results are validated through simulation analysis, and then implemented on experimental platform for real-time physical NNMRs. Moreover, both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the key feature of the ETM integral formation scheme, it can effectively reduce communication resource usage and save energy while still providing comparable performance compared with the conventional periodic communication mechanism (PCM).},

Since the estimate of the slope is related to the vehicle mass, an online co-estimation of the road slope and vehicle mass is proposed based on neural network and least square algorithm. The control lines are adjusted according to the estimation results, and the optimization of power allocation is conducted to achieve the optimal braking torque split among the front motor, rear motor, and hydraulic braking system. Finally, the control scheme of regenerative braking is proposed and evaluated by comparing with the Economic Commission of Europe (ECE)-based strategy and the I-curve strategy. The presented strategy provides better braking performance and higher energy recovery compared with that the traditional methods. The results indicate that energy recovery can be improved by up to 9.62% under certain driving conditions.},

  abstract     = {We study the joint battery charging and replenishment scheduling of a battery swapping charging system (BSCS) considering random electric vehicle (EV) arrivals, renewable generation, and electricity prices. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process with an objective to minimize the expected sum of the operation cost (battery charging and replenishment cost) and the waiting cost of EV customers. The joint scheduling problem is challenging due to the stochasticity in EV arrivals, renewable generation, and electricity prices, as well as the curse of dimensionality in the system state and action spaces. To reduce the dimension of the action space, we propose to integrate structural properties into BSCS operation, i.e., the threshold-charging (TC) and least demand first (LDF) structures into the charging policy, and the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$(s, S)$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; structure into the replenishment policy (when the number of fully-charged batteries at a battery swapping station is below &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$s$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , the inventory is replenished to a higher threshold &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$S$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ).

  abstract     = {Traffic flow forecasting on a large-scale sensor network is of great practical significance for policy decision-making, urban management, and transport planning. Recently, several prediction methods based on graph convolution have been put forward. However, they are limited to small-scale analyses because of high computation complexity and fail to integrate spatial-temporal dependencies sufficiently between sensors with a large topological distance in multiple time steps. To address these issues, we propose a novel deep framework called PFNet to perform large-scale traffic forecasting. PFNet captures temporal correlations using deep multi-view sequence encoders (DMVSE) and spatial correlations using graph embedding technologies on transportation networks. Spatial-temporal dependencies are more comprehensively fused using cascaded progressive attention (CPA) modules due to the full use of latent temporal and spatial representation. Experiments are conducted on two large-scale traffic datasets (LondonHW and ManchesterHW) from England Highway. The results demonstrate that PFNet outperforms several existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

The center point motion feedback control system proposed utilizes individual wheel torque actuation assuming all wheels are individually driven. The approach presented is an alternative to the various direct optimization-based traction force/torque allocation schemes. The proposed system has many benefits, such as significant reduction of the algorithm complexity by merging most traction system functionalities into one. Such a system enables significant simplification, unification, and standardization of powertrain control design. Moreover, many signals needed by conventional traction force allocation methods are not required to be measured or estimated with the proposed approach, which are among others vehicle mass, wheel loading (normal force), and vehicle center of gravity location. Vehicle center point trajectory setpoints and measurements are transformed to each wheel, where the tracking is ensured using the wheel torque actuation. The proposed control architecture performance and analysis are shown using the nonlinear twin-track vehicle model implemented in Matlab &amp; Simulink environment. The performance is then validated using high fidelity FEE CTU in Prague EFORCE formula model implemented in IPG CarMaker environment with selected test scenarios. Finally, the results of the proposed control allocation are compared to the state-of-the-art approach.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a dramatic change in the demand composition of restaurants and, at the same time, catalyzed on-demand food delivery (OFD) services—such as DoorDash, Grubhub, and Uber Eats—to a large extent. With massive amounts of data on customers, drivers, and merchants, OFD platforms can achieve higher efficiency with better strategic and operational decisions; these include dynamic pricing, order bundling and dispatching, and driver relocation. Some of these decisions, and especially proactive decisions in real time, rely on accurate and reliable short-term predictions of demand ranges or distributions. In this paper, we develop a Poisson-based distribution prediction (PDP) framework equipped with a double-hurdle mechanism to forecast the range and distribution of potential customer demand. Specifically, a multi-objective function is designed to learn the likelihood of zero demand and approximate true demand and label distribution. An uncertainty-based multi-task learning technique is further employed to dynamically assign weights to different objective functions. The proposed model, evaluated by numerical experiments based on a real-world dataset collected from an OFD platform in Singapore, is shown to outperform several benchmarks by achieving more reliable demand range forecasting.},

  abstract     = {Traffic congestion represents a prevailing challenge encountered in urban areas due to the substantial volume of vehicles. To alleviate traffic congestion during rush hours, an improved vehicle rerouting strategy designed for vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is proposed in this paper. Prior studies have predominantly relied on the number of hops upstream from a congested road to select vehicles to be rerouted away from traffic congestion. Selecting vehicles in this way causes the distance between the selected vehicles and the congested road to become sensitive to the network topology, especially when the road lengths vary significantly. Different from the previous research, the proposed vehicle rerouting strategy considers travel time, which is a dynamic traffic information, in selecting vehicles to be rerouted. Furthermore, to achieve collaborative rerouting among vehicles, the proposed vehicle rerouting strategy updates the remaining capacity of roads each time a new route is assigned to a selected vehicle. This is to ensure that the roads are not overutilized and become congested in the near future. The performance of the proposed rerouting strategy is compared with other state-of-the-art strategies in terms of average travel time, average carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, and average fuel consumption through traffic simulations in two transportation networks, which are simple grid network and real-world Kuala Lumpur (KL) network. Based on the simulation results, the proposed vehicle rerouting strategy outperforms other strategies by at least 4.39% in Kuala Lumpur (KL) network in terms of average travel time.},

The introduction of the distributed edge-centric framework has recently helped the IoT-enabled MTS to meet these requirements by manipulating the tasks at the edge of the networks. Despite the fact that MTS leverages mobile subscribers by overcoming inherent cloud computing limitations, data security and user privacy requirements in establishing the MTS setup are still non-trivial challenges. In this article, we develop a key agreement solution for mobile users to realize mutual authentication in a single round. Our protocol offers user anonymity to maintain user privacy, and it can prevent physical attacks by physically unclonable functions. Initially, the security analysis is conferred to substantiate our protocol’s security persistence or strength. Later, its performance correlation is observed under the assumption of diverse metrics in a predefined empirical setup. The meticulous performance correlation endorses the precedence of our protocol over specified related protocols.},

  abstract     = {Communication efficiency and flocking stability are two basic requirements for the application of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in maritime transportation systems. Although they are closely related, most existing flocking approaches focus on the control techniques and ignore the influence of communication efficiency. This paper presents a joint design solution to the channel estimation and flocking control for multi-AUV-based maritime transportation systems, with the consideration of path loss, shadow and multipath fading channels. A value iteration-based reinforcement learning (RL) estimator is first designed to predict the channel quality of AUVs in positions that have not yet visited. With the predicted channel quality, we construct an integrated optimization problem for the co-design of communication and flocking strategies. Along with this, a value iteration-based RL flocking controller is developed to achieve the co-design of channel estimation and flocking control for AUVs. It is worth mentioning that, the value iteration-based RL estimator in this paper can avoid local optimal in traditional least-squares methods, and meanwhile the flocking controller in this paper can make a balance between flocking stability and communication efficiency for AUVs. Finally, simulation and experimental results reveal that the proposed approach in this paper has superior performances by comparing with the other works. As such, our approach is more useful for marine engineer to understand and explore the maritime transportation system from the communication and control view points.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which is an extension of traditional vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), ensures the provision of safe and efficient vehicular communications. However, the burgeoning IoV faces several challenges in terms of traffic information security and vehicle identity privacy during wireless transmission. Generally, vehicles move faster on the highway necessitating the use of reliable technology to communicate with infrastructure on the roadside efficiently and securely. Lately, researchers have proposed several different message dissemination methods for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. However, they suffer from different concerns (i.e., security weaknesses, computationally heavy, and high communication/storage overhead); therefore, they are unreliable for delay-sensitive communications. To cope with this, we come up with an enhanced certificateless and identity-based offline/online heterogeneous signcryption (CIOOHSC) protocol for V2I communications in edge computing-based IoV to simultaneously achieve confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation, and identity anonymity in a logically single step. The CIOOHSC protocol allows a vehicle in certificateless cryptography to transmit a message to an edge node in identity-based cryptography. In the online phase, there are no point multiplication operations as they are already carried out in the offline phase. This reduces the computational load considerably in the online phase. Furthermore, our protocol enables the edge node to aggregate multiple messages and process them simultaneously to boost performance. The CIOOHSC protocol’s security is proved in the random oracle model under the hard problems’ assumptions. Our protocol outperforms recent similar schemes in terms of computational complexity, communication/storage overhead, and average transmission delay, according to the performance evaluation findings.},

  abstract     = {Lane reservation optimization is important in intelligent transportation systems. Most existing studies are carried out under deterministic road conditions by assuming constant road travel time. However, road conditions vary due to various factors, resulting in uncertain road travel time. This work addresses a new reliability-based lane reservation and route design problem by considering uncertain road travel time with its known mean and covariance matrix. It aims to decide which road segments in a network should implement reserved lanes and to design routes for special time-crucial transportation tasks. The objective is to maximize transportation service reliability (i.e., the probability of completing the special tasks on time). For this problem, a novel distributionally robust optimization model is first established. To solve it, this work proposes i) an adapted sample average approximation-based approach and ii) a two-stage hierarchical heuristic algorithm based on second-order cone programming. Experimental results on an illustrative example and a real-world case demonstrate that the latter is more effective and efficient than the former. In addition, we conduct a series of parameter sensitivity analysis experiments to reveal the factors affecting lane reservation and provide optimal solutions given different parameter settings.},

Considering the effects of sensor faults, stochastic passenger mass and modeling errors on DDEB active safety control, an augmented system consisting of DDEB states and associated sensor faults is firstly constructed, where the disturbances caused by passenger mass and modeling errors are merged as unknown input vector. Then, by decoupling partial disturbances, an unknown input observer is developed to estimate the augmented system states, while a linear matrix inequality and an estimated states correction method are introduced to further attenuate the effects of residual disturbances and thus guarantee the accuracy of the estimation. Finally, the validity of the proposed RFTE method is evaluated by a Trucksim-Simulink co-simulation platform and a hardware-in-the-loop platform. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed RFTE method can achieve effective estimation in the presence of stochastic disturbances and sensor faults, exhibiting better robustness and reliability than existing baseline estimation method.},

Considering the non-stationary properties of real-time sensor faults and the mapping relationship between sensors and feature variables, the proposed method decomposes the sensor fault diagnosis analysis problem into an online data stream classification and feature ranking problems. To detect and identify faults, a clustering-based data stream classification approach is developed to continuously capture and classify non-stationary sensor faults for autonomous cars with little intervention from human experts. An effective active learning method is extended and embedded into the proposed framework to minimize the need for prior knowledge about faults and enable the continual learning capability to adapt to and handle the non-stationary properties of sensor faults. Moreover, the proposed framework addresses the parameter optimization issue of existing machine learning based fault analysis techniques and employs feature ranking analysis to systematically analyze the possible source(s) of sensor faults. CAR Learning to Act (CARLA), a well-known realistic autonomous driving simulator, is used as the benchmark to perform the sensor fault injection and online data stream collection to evaluate the efficacy of OLFA.

  abstract     = {This paper mainly addresses the issue of designing safety Petri net-based controllers to prevent vehicle flow deadlocks at intersections. The designed controller can monitor the flow of vehicles at an intersection and guide them to pass an intersection safely without causing deadlocks. This study begins by investigating the intersection deadlock scenarios, analyzing the physical size of the “right-of-way” cells with the discretization of the interior area of an intersection, and developing the intersection initial Petri net (PN) model based on simple sequential processes with resources (S3PR). Then, based on the initial PN model, we propose a deadlock prevention strategy for controller design to control the vehicle flows to ensure that the vehicle flows in different directions do not result in deadlocks. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is illustrated by examples and theoretical proof. This study contributes to the advancement of the state-of-the-art in the design of safety controllers for self-driving vehicles passing through intersections.},

Considering the uplink transmission of grant-free based vehicular networks, vehicular devices sporadically access the base station, the joint active device detection (ADD) and channel estimation (CE) problem can be addressed by compressive sensing (CS) recovery algorithms due to the sparsity of transmitted signals. However, traditional CS-based algorithms present high complexity and low recovery accuracy. In this manuscript, we propose a novel alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm with low complexity to solve this problem by minimizing the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\ell _{2,1}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; norm.

  abstract     = {Truck platooning is a promising technology that enables trucks to travel in formations with small inter-vehicle distances for improved aerodynamics and fuel economy. The real-world transportation system includes a vast number of trucks owned by different fleet owners, for example, carriers. To fully exploit the benefits of platooning, efficient dispatching strategies that facilitate the platoon formations across fleets are required. This paper presents a distributed framework for addressing multi-fleet platoon coordination in large transportation networks, where each truck has a fixed route and aims to maximize its own fleet’s platooning profit by scheduling its waiting times at hubs. The waiting time scheduling problem of individual trucks is formulated as a distributed optimal control problem with continuous decision space and a reward function that takes non-zero values only at discrete points. By suitably discretizing the decision and state spaces, we show that the problem can be solved exactly by dynamic programming, without loss of optimality. Finally, a realistic simulation study is conducted over the Swedish road network with 5,000 trucks to evaluate the profit and efficiency of the approach. The simulation study shows that, compared to single-fleet platooning, multi-fleet platooning provided by our method achieves around 15 times higher monetary profit and increases the CO2 emission reductions from 0.4% to 5.5%. In addition, it shows that the developed approach can be carried out in real-time and thus is suitable for platoon coordination in large transportation systems.},

Second, five meta-heuristics are employed and improved to solve the concerned problems. Based on the feature of UTLSP, five local search operators are developed to improve the exploitation performance of the meta-heuristics. Third, two Q-learning-based ensemble strategies are designed to select the premium local search operators during the meta-heuristics’ iterations. Finally, experiments are conducted on 10 cases with different scales. A total of 26 algorithms are compared for validation. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed ensemble strategies.

Social interactions among vehicles are considered to contribute to enhancing the efficiency of vehicular content delivery because social relationships among vehicles are generally long-term and vehicles sharing more social attributes have a higher chance of meeting each other. Therefore, we are motivated to exploit the social attributes of vehicles to address the issue of content delivery failures in the sparse vehicular content-centric network. Based on the idea, we propose a social attributes based content delivery framework for the sparse vehicular content-centric network, and aim to improve content delivery success rates and alleviate costs. The framework leverages the social metrics of vehicles to deliver contents and to perform in-network caching. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in terms of content delivery success rates and costs.},

  abstract     = {Testing and evaluation are expensive but critical steps in the development of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). In this paper, we develop an adaptive sampling framework to efficiently evaluate the accident rate of CAVs, particularly for scenario-based tests where the probability distribution of input parameters is known from the Naturalistic Driving Data. Our framework relies on a surrogate model to approximate the CAV performance and a novel acquisition function to maximize the benefit (information to accident rate) of the next sample formulated through an information-theoretic consideration. In addition to the standard application with only a single high-fidelity model of CAV performance, we also extend our approach to the bi-fidelity context where an additional low-fidelity model can be used at a lower computational cost to approximate the CAV performance. Accordingly, for the second case, our approach is formulated such that it allows the choice of the next sample in terms of both fidelity level (i.e., which model to use) and sampling location to maximize the benefit per cost. Our framework is tested in a widely-considered two-dimensional cut-in problem for CAVs, where Intelligent Driving Model (IDM) with different time resolutions are used to construct the high and low-fidelity models. We show that our single-fidelity method outperforms the existing approach for the same problem, and the bi-fidelity method can further save half of the computational cost to reach a similar accuracy in estimating the accident rate.},

Meanwhile, to increase driving reliability under distinct scenarios, it is important to handle unforeseen weather events in the training dataset, which is known as an Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) problem, for autonomous driving algorithms. In this paper, we consider those two aspects and propose an end-to-end multi-modal domain-enhanced framework, namely CrossFuser, to meet the safety orientated driving requirements. CrossFuser first integrates both image and lidar modalities to generate a robust environmental representation through conjoint mapping, elastic disentanglement, and attention mechanism. Further, the perception embedding is used to calculate corresponding waypoints by a waypoint prediction network, consisting of Gate Recurrent Units (GRUs). Finally, the final control commands are calculated by low-level control functions. We conduct experiments on the Car Learning to Act (CARLA) driving simulator involving complex weather conditions under urban scenarios, the results show that CrossFuser can outperform the state of the art.},

  abstract     = {An increasing number of vehicles cause the deteriorating congestion problem, which leads to the excessive time spent in commuting. Thus, finding fast driving paths gathers growing interest from travelers and governments. However, effective route planning in traffic networks is deemed to be a considerable challenge due to the complex variations of traffic conditions. The existing traffic state aware routing strategies include two main categories: trip planning based on the traffic state before departure or short-term traffic prediction. The former may incur newly emerged jams because of the rapid en-route evolution of traffic state. The nonnegligible prediction errors would make the latter method deviate from the optimal paths. Moreover, these two deterministic routing strategies may easily result in late arrival for important events. To address this nontrivial problem, we propose a sophisticated route planning approach. Specifically, our method employs empirical observations of traffic prediction results to develop statistical models of error distributions. Then, the empirical error distributions are incorporated with the speed prediction values to constitute the stochastic and time-varying (STV) road network model. Thirdly, the least expected time (LET) routing problem in this STV network is defined. To determine the LET paths, we develop the time-varying K-fastest paths algorithm to generate the candidate paths and the discrete numerical method to compare their expected travel time. Finally, we collect the real-world traffic speed and trajectory data for experiments. The comparison results validate that our approach achieves the best performance and the improvement over other baselines is significant in peak hours.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring dependable quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) for computation-intensive and delay-sensitive applications in vehicles can be a challenging task that impacts performance. While multi-access edge computing (MEC) based vehicular edge computing network (VECN) and vehicular cloudlets (VC) enable task offloading, but their prompt and optimal accessibility is another challenge. The conventional wireless technologies may not suffice to meet the stringent ultra-low latency and cost constraints of such applications. Nonetheless, the combination of different wireless technologies can enhance network performance and satisfy these requirements. Focusing on the computational efficacy of VECN, this paper proposes a mobility, contact, and computational load-aware (MCLA) task offloading scheme for heterogeneous VECN. The MCLA scheme dynamically considers the mobility, contact, and computational load of vehicles for making task offloading decisions. To optimize the performance, the MCLA scheme integrates the Mode-1 and Mode-2 of the 5G-NR-V2X standard, along with mmWave communications. The MCLA scheme provides an opportunistic switching mechanism between these modes and heterogeneous radio access technologies (RATs) to reduce communication delays and costs. Moreover, the MCLA scheme leverages public vehicles (i.e., public buses), in proximity by using their computational power to manage computational latency and cost. Furthermore, it also considers the shareable computations from passengers’ mobile equipment within the public vehicle to improve the computation capacity of the public vehicles. Extensive evaluations and numerical results show that the proposed MCLA scheme significantly improves the task turnover ratio by 4%–15% with 4.7%–29.8% lower transmission and computation costs.},

To address the challenge of safe exploration in autonomous driving tasks, a novel safe RL method called Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient based on Approximate Safe Action (TD3-ASA) is proposed in this paper. In TD3-ASA, the action output by the current policy during the exploration process is modified to obtain an approximate safe action, and then the approximate safe action is utilized to train a safe policy for deployment. TD3-ASA offers several advantages: 1) TD3-ASA is sample efficient and does not need any prior knowledge; 2) TD3-ASA enhances safety both during training and deployment; 3) TD3-ASA introduces an adjustable safety correction factor that enables a tradeoff between exploration and safety. Experimental results conducted on both the MetaDrive and SpeedLimit autonomous driving test platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of TD3-ASA. TD3-ASA exhibits more than triple safety during training on MetaDrive compared to the current state-of-the-art RL method, achieving a high success rate and low deployment risk.},

  abstract     = {How to effectively extract identifiable information from human mobility data and distinguish different agents is a significant topic for location-based services and intelligent transportation systems, which is described as the Human Mobility Signature Identification problem. A deeper understanding of the identifiable information underlain in human mobility can help us lay the foundation for applications such as irregular user behavior detection and privacy protection. However, human mobility comprises a mixture of different mobility patterns, traditional methods usually pay more attention to spatial-temporal features, while pattern dimension feature is usually ignored, which makes the result very dependent on the population agglomeration degree. To bridge the research gap, in this paper, we propose a novel Life-Travel pattern-based learning module (LTP-Net), in which spatial-temporal-pattern dimension features are embedded together to provide more comprehensive information for individual identification. A real-world mobile phone location dataset is utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed LTP-Net and traditional methods.

  abstract     = {In recent years, ride-sharing has gained popularity as a daily means of transportation. The primary challenge for large-scale online ride-sharing platforms is to design an efficient fleet management policy that reallocates vehicles to appropriate regions to receive orders, thereby improving the platform’s cumulative revenue and order response rate. Combinatorial optimization algorithms and reinforcement learning methods are commonly employed for this task, but they typically learn a unified repositioning policy for all regions. However, different regions, such as hot and cold zones, may require different repositioning policies due to varying travel patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent mixed hierarchical reinforcement learning approach, called MIX-H, for efficient large-scale fleet management by formulating it as a Markov decision process. MIX-H adopts multi-level controllers, including a leader controller and follower controller, for multi-level action learning. The leader controller plans the goal to be executed by the follower controller. Additionally, to improve the algorithm’s stability, we introduce a MIX module to compute the total value of joint action. Finally, experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communication is a significant technology in 6G communication. In order to cope with the dynamic trajectory optimization problem of the air-ground network, the interaction between entities is modeled as a Markov game firstly. Then, the model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is adopted to optimize individual decision-making. This enables agents to learn the mobile patterns of others, so as to optimize their own mobile strategy. However, there are some common issues when executing the benchmark MARL algorithms, such as biased estimation and local optimum. To solve these problems, an enhanced multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm is proposed with policy clipping and average evaluation to guarantee the fast convergence and accurate estimation. Simulations demonstrate that this method produces superior convergence than the benchmark algorithms. It allows the UAV base station, ground users and the aerial jammer to adopt the optimal mobile strategies to achieve their respective maximum cumulative rewards. In addition, the stable strategies of agents constitute the approximate Nash equilibrium for the UAV-assisted communication Markov Game.},

We propose a vehicular detection architecture for abandoned objects to achieve task-based AI technology for large-scale road maintenance in mobile computing circumstances. To improve detection accuracy and reduce repeated detection rates in mobile computing, we propose a detection algorithm that combines a deep learning network and a deduplication module for high-frequency detection. Finally, we propose a location estimation approach for abandoned objects based on the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) coordinate system and an affine projection model to accurately compute the positions of abandoned objects. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 99.57% and 53.11% on the two datasets, respectively. Additionally, our whole system achieves real-time detection and high-precision localization performance on real roads.},

Considering the diverse quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of different types of links, age of information (AoI) is adopted as a new metric to evaluate the information freshness performance of T2T links. With the objective to maximize the sum data rate of T2I links, we formulate a resource allocation problem under the minimum data rate constraints of T2I links and the maximum average AoI constraint of T2T links. As the problem with a set of binary variables, it is intractable to be solved directly. Thus, we propose an AoI-aware power control and subcarrier assignment (AoI-PCSA) scheme, which decomposes the optimization problem into a power control subproblem and a subcarrier assignment subproblem. More specifically, we derive the optimal analytical solutions of power control for each T2I-T2T subcarrier reusing pair with algebraic methods. Then, we transform the subcarrier assignment subproblem into a weighted bipartite matching problem and obtain the optimal reusing pattern based on the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can achieve a sum data rate gain of up to 19.94% on average for T2I links as compared with other benchmark schemes.},

However, most existing unsupervised monocular methods haven’t fully exploited the extracted information from both local geometric structure and visual appearance of the scenes, resulting in degraded performance. In this paper, a novel geometry-aware network is proposed to predict the camera’s ego-motion by learning representations in both 2D and 3D space. First, to extract geometry-aware features, we design an RGB-PointCloud feature fusion module to capture information from both geometric structure and the visual appearance of the scenes by fusing local geometric features from depth-map-derived point clouds and visual features from RGB images. Furthermore, the fusion module can adaptively allocate different weights to the two types of features to emphasize important regions. Then, we devise a relevant feature filtering module to build consistency between the two views and preserve informative features with high relevance. It can capture the correlation of frame pairs in the feature-embedding space by attention mechanisms. Finally, the obtained features are fed into the pose estimator to recover the 6-DoF poses of the camera. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves promising results among the unsupervised monocular deep learning methods on the KITTI odometry and TUM-RGBD datasets.},

  abstract     = {For autonomous driving, one of the major challenges is to predict pedestrian crossing intention in ego-view. Pedestrian intention depends not only on their intrinsic goals but also on the stimulation of surrounding traffic elements. Considering the influence of other traffic elements on pedestrian intention, recent work introduced more traffic element information into the model to successfully improve performance. However, it is still difficult to effectively capture and fully exploit the potential dynamic spatio-temporal interactions among the target pedestrian and its surrounding traffic elements for accurate reasoning. In this work, inspired by neuroscience that human drivers tend to make continuous sensory-motor driving decisions by progressive visual stimulation, we propose a model termed Progressive Interaction Transformer (PIT) for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. Local pedestrian, global environment, and ego-vehicle motion are considered simultaneously in the proposed PIT. In particular, the temporal fusion block and self-attention mechanism are introduced to jointly and progressively model the dynamic spatio-temporal interactions among the three parties, allowing it to capture richer information and make prediction in a similar way to human drivers. Experimental results demonstrate that PIT achieves higher performance compared with other state-of-the-arts and preserves real-time inference.},

Existing scene text detection methods often adopt multi-scale feature learning strategies to extract informative feature representations for covering objects of various sizes. However, the sampling operation inherent in multi-scale feature generation can easily impair high-frequency details (e.g., textures and boundaries), which are critical for text detection. In this work, we propose an innovative Hybrid Feature Enhancement Network (dubbed HFENet) to explicitly improve the quality of high-frequency information for detecting texts in scenes and traffic panels. To be concrete, we propose a simple yet effective self-guided feature enhancement module (SFEM) for globally lifting feature representations to highly discriminative and high-frequency abundant ones. Notably, our SFEM is pluggable and will be removed after training without introducing extra computational costs. In addition, due to the challenge and importance of accurately predicting boundaries for text detection, we propose a novel boundary enhancement module (BEM) to explicitly strengthen local feature representations in the guidance of boundary annotation for accurate localization. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets (i.e., MSRA-TD500, CTW1500, Total-Text, Traffic Guide Panel Dataset, Chinese Road Plate Dataset, and ASAYAR_TXT) verify the state-of-the-art performance of our method.},

This paper proposes a robustly integrated design method to address the issues. Firstly, a Taguchi robust design (TRD) method considering the noise of components, stochastic vehicle mass and historical driving cycles is proposed to find the robust design parameters that are suitable for different component matching and can resist the noise disturbance. Then, a component matching design zone reduced work is finished through analyzing the mechanism of action between components and the evaluation index, based on the TRD theory and the Sensitivity analysis method (SAM). Finally, a robust component matching design method is investigated by considering the noises, based on the Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) theory. The simulation results demonstrate that the TRD and DFSS methods are reasonable and applicable in the integrated design of PFCEB, where the robust component matching can be found; the energy economy of the proposed adaptive Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle (A-PMP) based energy management strategy is better than the rule-based control strategy.},

In particular, information about the timing of traffic lights and surrounding vehicles can be exchanged between traffic vehicles and in conjunction with vehicle state information, to improve the fuel economy of HEVs significantly. To this end, we propose a multi-lane hierarchical optimization (MLHO) algorithm based on a predictive control framework. The dynamic behaviors of the surrounding vehicles are first predicted, and then the traffic light information (e.g., signal phasing and timing) and vehicles’ state information are utilized in the design. MLHO is a two-level strategy wherein a multi-lane speed planning method for a host vehicle is formulated to plan the optimal speed and lane-change behaviors by considering vehicle power demand, driving comfort, and safety in the upper level. In the lower level, dynamic programming is adopted to devise energy management by tracking the optimal speed. Simulation results under real routes using the traffic simulation software Simulation of Urban Mobility show that the fuel economy of MLHO is improved by 32% on average compared to speed profile driven by a human driver model. In addition, traffic efficiency is enhanced significantly, i.e., different traffic occupancy results on the road indicate that the proposed MLHO is less affected by the traffic flow density. With different traffic densities, the maximum fuel consumption difference under the three considered scenarios is only 0.645L/100km.},

There are several ways to mimic traffic dynamics. However, realistic modeling traffic has a clear trade-off between accuracy and simulation processing time. Obviously, the more detailed traffic dynamics are sought, the more calculation is needed. The paper offers a compromise solution introducing a novel mesoscopic traffic simulation framework applicable on an arbitrary network level. The mathematical background of the simulation is provided as the extension of the shockwave profile model (SPM), distinguishing three continuous traffic states on a link. Extension of the model is done by means of a weighted directed graph where the dynamic edge weights are the queue lengths on each link. The model can handle both signalized and unsignalized road links. An important opportunity of the proposed network SPM approach is the analysis of traffic jam propagation and bottleneck detection. The presented mesoscopic simulator is validated based on both synthetic and real-world traffic networks using fleet traffic data. The simulated queue length in the mesoscopic simulation accurately matches the microscopic traffic simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is popularly used to implement secure and accurate access control of disseminated information in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Nevertheless, how to improve the policy generation of CP-ABE for accurate information dissemination in the dynamic VANETs remains a challenge, as there are several access control policies rising from moving vehicles and road side units (RSUs) with different sensing boarder regarding to a specific event, such as moving vehicles and road side units (RSUs). To solve this problem, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based information dissemination policy generation scheme in VANETs, named RLID-V. The scheme firstly combines multiple attribute-based access control policies and resolves policy conflicts between vehicles and RSUs. Then, a manual feedback policy construction method is designed by applying decision tree to the collected feedback from all receivers. Finally, we employ reinforcement learning to dynamically update the confidence weights of different policy sources. The experiments are conducted in two classic VANETs scenarios, traffic guidance and accident warning, demonstrating that RLID-V achieves better performance in the accuracy and effectiveness of information dissemination compared with three existing schemes. Otherwise, RLID-V outperforms the compared schemes in robustness with 20% error feedback and takes a negligible cost of less than 1% of the overall delay overhead for policy generation.},

  abstract     = {The all-electric ship (AES) with DC-grid configuration has demonstrated advantages compared to the traditional AC system and has become the state-of-the-art for ships with electric propulsion in the low to medium power range during the past decade. However, the integration with different power sources, such as fuel cells, batteries and diesel gen-sets, increases the system complexity and requires an advanced power management system (PMS) to handle vessel operation and to achieve optimal power control. This paper presents an optimized power management strategy to reduce the total cost of ownership of such vessels, considering not only the fuel cost and emission penalty, but also the power device degradation and equipment replacement cost. In this study, Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based PMS control methods are approached respectively. In order to demonstrate the performance of MPC and RL techniques, a typical tugboat load profile is simulated. The testing results are also compared with a traditional rule-based power management control.},

  abstract     = {Lane detection is crucial for vehicle localization which makes it the foundation for automated driving and many intelligent and advanced driving assistant systems. Available vision-based lane detection methods do not make full use of the valuable features and aggregate contextual information, especially the interrelationships between lane lines and other regions of the images in continuous frames. To fill this research gap and upgrade lane detection performance, this paper proposes a pipeline consisting of self pre-training with masked sequential autoencoders and fine-tuning with customized PolyLoss for the end-to-end neural network models using multi-continuous image frames. The masked sequential autoencoders are adopted to pre-train the neural network models with reconstructing the missing pixels from a random masked image as the objective. Then, in the fine-tuning segmentation phase where lane detection segmentation is performed, the continuous image frames are served as the inputs, and the pre-trained model weights are transferred and further updated using the backpropagation mechanism with customized PolyLoss calculating the weighted errors between the output lane detection results and the labeled ground truth. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that, with the proposed pipeline, the lane detection model performance on both normal and challenging scenes can be advanced beyond the state-of-the-art, delivering the best testing accuracy (98.38%), precision (0.937), and F1-measure (0.924) on the normal scene testing set, together with the best overall accuracy (98.36%) and precision (0.844) in the challenging scene test set, while the training time can be substantially shortened.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian safety has become a critical issue due to the increase in pedestrian crashes every year, while proactive traffic safety management based on surrogate safety measures (SSMs) has been considered one of the key approaches to improving pedestrian safety. However, existing SSMs are developed based on the assumption that road users will maintain constant speed and direction. Risk estimations based on this assumption are less stable and more likely to be exaggerated. Considering the limitations of existing SSMs, this study has proposed a probabilistic framework for estimating the risk of pedestrian-vehicle conflicts at intersections. The proposed framework works by predicting the trajectories of vehicles and pedestrians using Gaussian process regression models and incorporating these results with the probability of vehicles making different maneuvers. The proposed framework has been evaluated using both simulated and real-world data collected at an intersection. The simulation results validated an increased estimated risk given time-critical pedestrian-vehicle conflicts, as well as a higher probability of the vehicle maneuver that led to such conflicts. This observation remained even when multiple conflicts arose from different directions. Moreover, experimental results using real-world data suggested that the proposed framework outperformed traditional time-to-collision (TTC) in terms of conflict prediction, quantification, and localization. For example, the proposed framework had a sensitivity of 0.92 in terms of conflict prediction, while TTC had a sensitivity of 0.62. Furthermore, the proposed framework required much less computation time compared to deep learning methods, which made it an optimal choice for proactive pedestrian safety solutions at intersections.},

  abstract     = {Since vehicles are not restricted by lane lines when driving inside intersections, they travel freely and their paths have many possibilities, which are related to the traffic order of other road users. It is necessary to understand and describe vehicle paths through intersections. Previous studies on modeling vehicle paths through intersections have predominantly been limited to vehicles turning in one single direction or specific intersections, ignoring the application universality. This study set out to establish a unified model to describe non-conflict paths of vehicles through intersections. An entrance lane-based coordinate system with geometric parameters was established to describe the position relationships of entrance and exit lanes. Three-order Bezier curves with control parameters were used to describe vehicle paths. By extracting the parameter values from driving simulator-based experiments, the entrance and exit lane-based vehicle path model was proposed to represent the relationship between geometric and control parameters. Actual path data captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle were used for model validation, and results show the validity of the proposed model with a mean Root Mean Square Error of 0.4613 m between observed and fitted paths. More validation considering position distributions of path origins and destinations and angle deviations when entering and leaving intersections was performed. Cases from HighD open dataset also demonstrated the model’s potential for lane-changing scenarios. This study provides an exciting opportunity to commonly describe vehicle paths without conflicts at geometrically regular and irregular intersections and is hoped to have the possibility of planning local paths for autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Great efforts have been devoted to solving the crowd counting problem based on vision or other fine-grained measurements. Popular vision and WiFi channel state information based approaches, though are able to achieve relatively high accuracy, suffer from limited scalability. In contrast, passive WiFi sensing-based approaches are capable of supporting large surveillance areas, but often rely on certain global linear or approximately linear regression models, which cannot accurately capture the complex mapping relationship between WiFi sensing data and the corresponding crowd count, especially in a large surveillance area during a long period of time. This paper addresses the issue from the following three aspects. Firstly, in order to combat with these coarse-grained regression models, the large surveillance is partitioned into grids, such that either a local linear model or other implicit local models can be built with respect to each grid. Secondly, sequential WiFi spatial-temporal matrix (SWSTM) is defined in alignment with grids to encode the spatial-temporal information of crowds based on passive WiFi localization and a sliding time window mechanism. Thirdly, the spatial-temporal correlations among crowd features of different grids are mined to better regress such local models by using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with SWSTMs as inputs. Extensive experiments are conducted in a real campus road network with an area of about &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$4000m^{2}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , and demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the counting error rate from 22.54% to 13.44% compared to several state-of-the-art methods.},

The fidelity of the traffic model is thus the key to achieving effective and efficient simulation test results. However, high-fidelity traffic modeling remains a challenge due to the complexity of vehicle movement and the dynamic spatiotemporal interactions among vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel system-based traffic modeling approach that considers traffic as a whole, or a collection of all vehicles’ movement and their interactions involved simultaneously. In addition, a long short-term memory (LSTM) encoding-decoding framework with a multi-head self-attention mechanism is proposed to capture the temporal dependency of vehicle motion and represent the vehicle-vehicle interaction. Furthermore, some traffic data are collected and used for model training purposes. A metric representing one of the traffic attributes, as the criterion for data screening, is proposed to describe the traffic complexity and disorder, or chaos. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model has achieved better performance compared with others from the literature.},

In this work, we propose a new distillation method called Focal Distillation to bridge the gap between high-resolution detector (teacher model) and low-resolution detector (student model). It consists of three essential components: focal classification distillation (FCD), focal regression distillation (FRD) and focal feature distillation (FFD). Taking the low-resolution data as input, the student model can learn discriminative features and produce more accurate results with the assistance of the teacher model trained on high-resolution data. We conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of Focal Distillation. Evaluated on the KITTI validation set, a typical SECOND model trained with Focal Distillation outperformed its non-distilled counterpart by 3.37%, 7.52%, 11.35% mAP on the category Car, Pedestrian, and Cyclist of moderate level, respectively. Moreover, the remarkable improvements observed on different models and different datasets further demonstrate the generalization ability of our proposed method.},

The anomaly detection performance of RX-ADS was compared against the state-of-the-art approaches on these datasets: HIDS and GIDS. The RX-ADS approach showed comparable performance to the HIDS approach on OTIDS dataset and outperformed HIDS and GIDS approaches on Car Hacking dataset. Further, the proposed approach was able to generate explanations for detected abnormal behaviors arising from various intrusions. These explanations were later validated by information used by domain experts to detect anomalies. Other advantages of RX-ADS include: 1) the method can be trained on unlabeled data; 2) explanations help experts in understanding anomalies and root course analysis, and also help with AI model debugging and diagnostics, ultimately improving user trust in AI systems.},

  abstract     = {Trust establishment among vehicles is essential for vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) as it directly impacts the security and privacy of vehicular communication. Many trust estimation approaches have been introduced, however, they often suffer from ensuring effective trust for vehicles. In fact, existing approaches do not involve all malevolent properties of vehicles in trust computation and can not properly handle the content tampering attack, which eventually affect the accuracy of the estimated trust. Moreover, most of them do not consider the uncertainty of VANET arising from vehicles’ mobility, their inaccurate/incomplete data dissemination, and the wireless communication channels, which also affects the reliability of the trust estimation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a fuzzy logic-based approach to estimate vehicles’ trust. The new approach considers three trust factors, captured by fuzzy sets, to model malicious properties of a vehicle. Further, it involves a new data-centric parameter to capture the impact of content tampering on trust evaluation. In addition, the new approach includes an inter-edge trust transfer mechanism to carry forward a vehicle’s trust when it switches to a new edge server to ensure a seamless operation in VANETs. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme against the state-of-the-art approaches using both synthetic and real-world datasets. The experimental results reveal that it outperforms existing schemes in detecting malicious vehicles with higher recall, precision, and accuracy. Further, the new scheme reduces end-to-end delay and messages per data packet compared to other schemes.},

  abstract     = {Greedy routing efficiently achieves routing solutions for vehicular networks due to its simplicity and reliability. However, the existing greedy routing algorithms have mainly considered simple routing metrics only, e.g., distance based on the local view of an individual vehicle. This consideration is insufficient for analysing dynamic and complicated vehicular communication scenarios which inevitably degrades the overall routing performance. Software-Defined Vehicular Network (SDVN) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) can overcome these limitations. Thus, this paper presents a novel GCN-based greedy routing algorithm (NGGRA) in the hybrid SDVN. The SDVN control plane trains the GCN decision model based on the globally collected data. Vehicles with transmission requirements can adopt this model for inferring and making the routing decisions. The proposed node-importance-based graph convolutional network (NiGCN) model analyses multiple correlated metrics to accurately evaluate the dynamic vehicular network is available at: https://github.com/a824899245/NiGCN . Meanwhile, the SDVN architecture offers a global view for model training and routing computation. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that NiGCN outperforms popular GCN models in training efficiency and accuracy. In addition, NGGRA can improve the packet delivery ratio and substantially reduce delay compared with its counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle re-identification aims to identify vehicles from different cameras and has drawn much attention in the multimedia community. In recent years, significant achievements in vehicle re-identification have been made due to the development of neural networks and deep feature representations. However, existing deep models are regarded as “black box” methods considering the lack of explaining where they focus. With Class Activation Mapping (CAM), we can localize the discriminative image regions by utilizing convolutional feature maps. After answering the “where” question, the question of “how” to generate reasonable features appears to be substantial. In this paper, we propose the novel Spatially-Regularized Features (SRF) that can be extracted from discriminative regions in an explainable way. Specifically, we first provide an evaluation mechanism called Peak-to-Sidelobe Ratio (PSR) to measure the distribution of the convolutional feature maps. PSR outputs the strength of a matrix peak and can be used to indicate the attention intensity of a specific region. Moreover, we propose a spatially regularized loss to make the deep models focus on more reasonable and discriminative image regions. Note that no additional manual annotation data is involved in the training process, making the SRF an efficient and effective approach. Extensive subjective and objective experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three large-scale vehicle re-identification datasets.},

  abstract     = {Long-term pedestrian trajectory prediction in crowds is highly valuable for safety driving and social robot navigation. The recent research of trajectory prediction usually focuses on solving the problems of modeling social interactions, physical constraints and multi-modality of futures without considering the generalization of prediction models to other scenes and objects, which is critical for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a general framework that makes trajectory prediction models able to transfer well across unseen scenes and objects by quickly learning the prior information of trajectories. The trajectory sequences are closely related to the circumstance setting (e.g. exits, roads, buildings, entries etc.) and the objects (e.g. pedestrians, bicycles, vehicles etc.). We argue that those trajectory information varying across scenes and objects makes a trained prediction model not perform well over unseen target data. To address it, we introduce MetaTraj that contains carefully designed sub-tasks and meta-tasks to learn prior information of trajectories related to scenes and objects, which then contributes to accurate long-term future prediction. Both sub-tasks and meta-tasks are generated from trajectory sequences effortlessly and can be easily integrated into many prediction models. Extensive experiments over several trajectory prediction benchmarks demonstrate that MetaTraj can be applied to multiple prediction models and enables them generalize well to unseen scenes and objects.},

  abstract     = {The wide appeal of fuel-efficient transport solutions is constantly increasing due to the major impact of the transportation industry on the environment. Platooning systems represent a relatively simple approach in terms of deployment toward fuel-efficient solutions. This paper addresses the reduction of fuel consumption in platooning systems attainable by dynamically switching between two control policies: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC). The switching rule is dictated by a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) technique to overcome unpredictable platoon disturbances and to learn appropriate transient shift times while maximizing fuel efficiency. However, due to safety and convergence issues of DRL, our algorithm establishes transition times and minimum periods of operation of ACC and CACC controllers instead of directly controlling vehicles. Numerical experiments show that the DRL agent outperforms both static ACC and CACC versions and the threshold logic control in terms of fuel efficiency while also being robust to perturbations and satisfying safety requirements.},

Existing studies either require a large amount of labeled data or suffer from hand-crafted features, thus hindering the practical application of these methods. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a driving style recognition approach from the perspective of brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing and semi-supervised learning. Specifically, raw sensor signals are treated as multivariate time series which are encoded by hyperdimensional computing, thus generating a large holistic feature representation. Then, considering the high dimension of the resulting representation, we put forward a semi-supervised twin projection vector machine (SSTPVM) model that can take full advantage of unlabeled data and jointly optimize multiple projection directions tailored for dimension reduction. In addition, a heuristic method based on particle swarm optimization is developed for the parameter selection of SSTPVM. Finally, extensive experiment comparisons with other related methods are performed on naturalistic driving style data. The results show that hyperdimensional computing is rather suitable for semi-supervised learning while our proposed SSTPVM can significantly improve recognition performance even with a small portion of labeled data.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale urban scene 3D mapping has urgent demands and wide applications in many areas, where sensor pose globalization remains its fundamental problem and critical step. As the street-view images and vehicle-borne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) points contain complementary advantages in urban scene 3D mapping, it is desirable to make the most of both to facilitate this task. Most existing methods make strong assumptions of strict synchronization, and even further, exact calibration between the vehicle-borne cameras and LiDARs, which are hard to guarantee in practice. To deal with this, we propose a novel pipeline for vehicle-borne camera and LiDAR temporal and spatial pose globalization with the guidance of Global Navigation Satellite System/Inertial Measurement Unit (GNSS/IMU), where both of the assumptions on strict synchronization and exact calibration are loosened. Specifically, the global poses of both cameras and LiDARs are first initialized by leveraging GNSS/IMU signals and multi-sensor pre-calibrations, and then refined by a global optimization scheme. To perform the global pose optimization, image-based, LiDAR-based, and cross-domain data association and constraint construction are conducted. Among them, the cross-domain ones, which are achieved by LiDAR point projection, image feature back-projection, and spatial point association, provide key clues for associating these two kinds of data with significant differences. Comprehensive experiments on both of a self-collected and the KITTI Odometry datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on multi-sensor pose globalization for large-scale urban scene 3D mapping.},

  abstract     = {The increasingly intense cyber-attacks have always been a crucial issue to the communication-based train control (CBTC) system due to exposed wireless channels. Both cyber-attack intrusion detection and defense policy calculation demand substantial computing resources. Combined with high capacity and reliability 5G technologies, edge intelligence (EI) is believed to help empower CBTC systems in terms of security and efficiency. This paper proposes an EI-enabled structure for CBTCs to defend against cyber-attacks, where the EI server provides real-time intelligent computing services for trains to derive real-time defense policies. We formulate the cyber-attack and defense process in EI-enabled CBTCs as a two-level game model, where system security and edge computing resource allocation are jointly optimized. In the lower-level game, we model interactions between the cyber attacker and system defender as a discrete repeated security game (DRSG), which is also a non-zero sum and incomplete information game. The fictitious play (FP) is introduced to derive a Nash equilibrium (NE) based optimal defense scheme. In the upper-level game, considering that the EI server cannot simultaneously update the optimal defense scheme for all trains due to the limited computation resources, we construct a multi-stage computation resource allocation game (MCRAG). We derive the optimal computation resource allocation scheme by the neural fictitious self-play (NFSP), where a deep Q-learning network (DQN) and a supervised learning network are jointly built to learn the strategy. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed EI-enabled CBTC system and the two-level game model can effectively defend against various attacks.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of the economy, the increasingly diversified and personalized needs of consumers, the timeliness of logistics distribution has attracted more and more attention of enterprises and customers. However, modern logistics enterprises need to consider the emergence of several dynamic demands in the distribution process to realize the dynamic planning of the routes. This paper puts forward an adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) with the elastic strategy to solve the dynamic vehicle routing problem with time windows (DVRPTWs), and the proposed algorithm is denoted as AGA-ES-TW. Firstly, AGA designs a population initialization method considering time windows, and designs an adaptive local search strategy that realizes the adaptive local adjustment of different individuals. Meanwhile, AGA develops adaptive crossover and mutation operators, which could adaptively adjust the probability of evolution for different individuals. The experiments prove the better performance of AGA on the traditional vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTWs). Then, AGA cooperates with an elastic strategy to deal with DVRPTWs. This paper major considers four types of dynamic demands: the increase of distribution nodes, the decrease of distribution nodes, the change of distribution road conditions, and the change of time windows. The proposed AGA-ES-TW could detect the types of different demands, and adaptively adopt diverse strategies to deal with the corresponding demands, then plan reasonable routes. The experiments on benchmark data sets indicate that AGA-ES-TW performs well on solving DVRPTWs. Furthermore, this paper constructs the distribution information of 100 SF express stations in Xi’an based on actual information, and employs AGA-ES-TW to solve the actual DVRPTWs.},

  abstract     = {Many existing advanced deep learning-based autonomous systems have recently been used for autonomous vehicles. In general, a deep learning-based visual perception system heavily relies on visual perception to recognize and localize dynamic interest objects (e.g., pedestrians and cars) and indicative traffic signs and lights to assist autonomous vehicles in maneuvering safely. However, the performance of existing object recognition algorithms could degrade significantly under some adverse and challenging scenarios including rainy, foggy, and rainy night conditions. The raindrops, light reflection, and low illumination pose a great challenge to robust object recognition. Thus, A robust and accurate autonomous driving system has attracted growing attention from the computer vision community. To achieve robust and accurate visual perception, we target to build effective and efficient augmentation and fusion techniques based on visual perception under various adverse conditions. The unpaired image-to-image (I2I) synthesis is integrated for visual perception enhancement and effective synthesis-based augmentation. Besides, we design a two-branch architecture to utilize the information from both the original image and the enhanced image synthesized by I2I. We comprehensively and hierarchically investigate the performance improvement and limitation of the proposed system based on visual recognition tasks and network backbones. An extensive experimental analysis of various adverse weather conditions is also included. The experimental results have demonstrated the proposed system could promote the ability of autonomous vehicles for robust and accurate perception under adverse weather conditions.},

  abstract     = {The development of autonomous driving technology will lead to a transition period during which human-driven vehicles (HVs) will share the road with autonomous vehicles (AVs). Understanding the interactions between AVs and HVs is critical for traffic safety and efficiency. Previous studies have used traffic/numerical simulations and field experiments to investigate HVs’ behavioral changes when following AVs. However, such approaches simplify the actual scenarios and may result in biased results. Therefore, the objective of this study is to realistically model HV-following-AV dynamics and their microscopic interactions, which are important for intelligent transportation applications. HV-following-AV and HV-following-HV events are extracted from the high-resolution (10Hz) Waymo Open Dataset. Statistical test results reveal significant differences in calibrated intelligent driver model (IDM) parameters between HV-following-AV and HV-following-HV. An inverse reinforcement learning model (Inverse soft-Q Learning) is proposed to retrieve HVs’ reward functions in HV-following-AV events. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach - soft actor-critic (SAC) - is adopted to estimate the optimal policy for HVs when following AVs. The results show that, compared with other conventional and data-driven car-following models, the proposed model leads to significantly more accurate trajectory predictions. In addition, the recovered reward functions indicate that drivers’ preferences when following AVs are different from those when following HVs.},

  abstract     = {Vehicles with adaptive cruise control, i.e., SAE Levels 1 and 2 automated vehicles (AVs), have been operating on roads with a significant and rapidly growing penetration rate. Identifying these AVs is critical to understanding near-future mixed traffic characteristics and managing highway mobility and safety. This study identifies adaptive cruise control-equipped vehicles from human-driven vehicles (HVs) by constructing a set of learning-based models using car-following trajectories in a short time window. It is extendible to Level 3 and + AV identification when data is available. To compare model performance and draw physical insights, two physics-based models are proposed based on the premise that, in general, the car-following behavior of an AV is less volatile than an HV. Four car-following datasets, including AV makes from different manufacturers, are mixed to build a comprehensive identification model. Results show that physics-based approaches identify more than 80% AVs and 70% HVs. The identification accuracy of learning-based models is even higher. For example, the cluster-aware long short-term memory network identifies 98.79% of AVs and 95.45% of HVs. Learning-based identification models developed by this study can be integrated with the existing infrastructure (e.g., surveillance cameras), which have been used to extract car-following trajectories, to detect AVs in mixed traffic streams. This opens unparalleled data-driven opportunities to analyze and control mixed traffic to enhance safety (e.g., notifying surrounding traffic of the presence of AVs) and mobility (e.g., opening AV dedicated lanes when the percentage is great enough).},

Existing studies focus on autonomous vehicle group cooperation in closed and highway scenes only. Their outcomes cannot be directly applied to an urban scene because of its complex road conditions, incomplete cooperation properties, and lack of a vehicle group size control strategy. In this work, we formulate a cooperation model for autonomous vehicle groups in such scene. First, we analyze cooperation criteria based on the non-colliding aggregate motion of flocks and deduce the connectivity, coupling, timeliness, evolvability, and adaptivity of a vehicle group, based on which we propose a cooperation model. Next, we solve our model by using a modified distributed evolutionary multi-objective optimization method, prove its convergence, and analyze its computational complexity. Finally, we conduct simulations on synthetic and real roads to show its performance in terms of average connectivity, coupling, timeliness, evolvability, and adaptivity of vehicle groups.},

  abstract     = {The fast advancement of urban transportation systems in the recent decades has on one hand improved efficiency in traffic control and management, yet on the other hand brought new obstacles and interferences in audio related services in transportation systems, which is one of the dominating components in urban transportation systems, such as end-to-end Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) communications, risk alerting, and personalised recommendation services. The movement of vehicles/trains and the growing complexity of transportation infrastructures has become a big threat to the audio related services. Hence it is crucial to evaluate the Quality of Experience (QoE) of audio related services. Different from traditional algorithms which use digital signal processing to evaluate the QoE of mobile users, in this paper, we propose a two-stage brain-alike neural network aided graph learning algorithm to evaluate the QoE of audio signals with the aid of EEG feature extraction. The results are evaluated by newly-collected on-site data in public transportation environments and are examined by a branch of human experts to show that our algorithm outperforms other benchmark algorithms in term of human perception and accuracy of classification.},

  abstract     = {High-precision pose adjustment for the self-charging of mobile robots remains a significant challenge. Permanent magnet (PM)-based magnetic tracking technique is a promising technical solution, with occlusion-free and simultaneous positioning and orientation tracking. However, the superposition of the geomagnetic vector and the magnetic field vector generated by the PM leads to the degrading of magnetic tracking performance. Thus, a magnetic tracking technique with real-time geomagnetic vector separation is investigated in this study. Firstly, the environmental magnetic field is accurately modeled, consisting of the PM field, uniform disturbance field, and non-uniform disturbance field. For the uniform disturbance field, we combine it with the PM pose as unknown parameters to be estimated. For the non-uniform disturbance field, a robust kernel function is employed to diminish its influence on positioning performance. Finally, the PM pose and geomagnetic vector are simultaneously estimated by optimization algorithms. A docking experiment for self-charging mobile robots was carried out based on the proposed tracking technique. The robot can successfully recharge its battery with only one alignment operation, where the repeat parking accuracy at the anchor point is 1.38 mm and ±1.27°, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Traffic prediction is a very important mechanism in intelligent transportation systems for applications including routing planning and traffic control. In order to infer multifarious traffic information, one/two-relational traffic data in the vector/matrix form need to be expanded to multi-relational traffic data in an arbitrary tensor form. However, none of the existing approaches is capable of performing traffic prediction by characterizing and tracking the inherent nonlinear dynamics which are often encountered in realistic time-series analysis. Although the extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been proven to be quite promising in inferring nonlinear dynamics from time series, but the current EKF approach still suffers, unfortunately, from a serious drawback that state variables have to be represented in vector form. In fact, the characteristics of multi-relational states in practice can never been manifested accurately in practice and the performance of an EKF would be greatly restricted thereby. In this work, we introduce a new tensor extended Kalman filter (TEKF) approach to accommodate arbitrary input, output, and state variables all in arbitrary tensor forms. We also propose a new tensor-based expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the nonlinear state-transition and observation-model mappings. The computational and memory complexities of the proposed TEKF approach are also studied in this paper. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the traffic prediction performance of the proposed new TEKF approach over the simulated and realworld traffic datasets in comparison with three other existing deep-learning prediction methods.},

  abstract     = {Reliable object detection using cameras plays a crucial role in enabling autonomous vehicles to perceive their surroundings. However, existing camera-based object detection approaches for autonomous driving lack the ability to provide comprehensive feedback on detection performance for individual frames. To address this limitation, we propose a novel evaluation metric, named as the detection quality index (DQI), which assesses the performance of camera-based object detection algorithms and provides frame-by-frame feedback on detection quality. The DQI is generated by combining the intensity of the fine-grained saliency map with the output results of the object detection algorithm. Additionally, we have developed a superpixel-based attention network (SPA-NET) that utilizes raw image pixels and superpixels as input to predict the proposed DQI evaluation metric. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on three open-source datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed evaluation metric accurately assesses the detection quality of camera-based systems in autonomous driving environments. Furthermore, the proposed SPA-NET outperforms other popular image-based quality regression models. This highlights the effectiveness of the DQI in evaluating a camera’s ability to perceive visual scenes. Overall, our work introduces a valuable self-evaluation tool for camera-based object detection in autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Couriers’ package pick-up route prediction is a fundamental task in the emerging intelligent logistics systems. It is beneficial for order dispatching and arrival-time estimation by leveraging the predicted routes to improve those downstream tasks. However, the package pick-up route prediction problem is challenging since couriers’ behaviors are affected by both strict Spatial–Temporal Constraints (STC) and personalized spatial-transfer patterns (STP). Specifically, couriers have to consider explicitly spatial-temporal requirements such as the locations of packages and the promised pick-up time when selecting future routes. In addition, couriers have personalized mobility patterns between different locations, which are implicit patterns hidden behind couriers’ historical trajectories and cannot be ignored to precisely depict their behaviors. This paper proposes a novel framework, named CP-Route, to predict a specific courier’s future package pick-up route under strict spatial-temporal constraints, and enhance the prediction performance by learning the spatial-transfer patterns (i.e., the routing patterns) of couriers. A sophisticated encoder is designed to capture the STC and STP, and a mixed-distribution-based decoder is designed to simultaneously consider the influence of spatial-temporal constraints and routing patterns on couriers’ final decisions. Extensive experiments conducted on an industry-scale logistics dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against the existing baseline methods. The online A/B test shows our contribution to the improvement of arrival time prediction.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, end-to-end imitation learning-based deep neural networks (DNN) have been successfully applied to several autonomous driving tasks. Meanwhile, however, the large uncertainties with respect to the reliability of the DNN’s decision-making mechanism significantly limit the application of DNN-based approaches in the safety-critical domain of autonomous driving. In this work, a comprehensive analytical method of the DNN’s decision-making mechanism is proposed for developing a reliable imitation learning-based end-to-end visual solution for automated lane keeping on the highway in a co-simulation environment. During the mechanism analysis, three progressive and crucial questions covering from the DNN’s decision-making basis to decision itself can be explicitly answered using the modified algorithms of Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and the theoretical knowledge of vehicle dynamics; During the model development, the DNN’s architecture is stepwise improved based on the intermediate analytical and test results in the imperfect and failure cases, aimed at increasing the DNN’s lane keeping imitation accuracy and robustness from a superficial point of view as well as enhancing the reliability of the DNN’s decision-making mechanism from an essential point of view. The DNN’s lane keeping performance is quantitatively evaluated based on a proposed evaluation method considering 3 vital perspectives regarding vehicle dynamics. The ultimate test results show that the final proposed DNN model, which has a reliable decision-making mechanism, achieves a satisfactory lane keeping performance with a high imitation accuracy and robustness, and outperforms the state-of-the-art lane keeping approaches based on the end-to-end DNN models and the traditional modular solution.},

However, due to the severe distortion of the fisheye images, it is hard for such systems to extract and match features to predict an accurate depth. In this work, on the basis of a multi-fisheye system, we present a novel end-to-end deep learning architecture for omnidirectional depth estimation: 1) to capture the reliable features of the distorted fisheye image, a multi-scale feature extraction and aggregation module is improved, which can adaptively obtain the global context information to represent the features; 2) to leverage more aligned features, especially those in the overlap between multi-fisheye images, we construct a fusion cost volume to combine similarity and semantic information, which can enhance the feature discriminability; and 3) to refine the omnidirectional depth map efficiently, a cascaded cost regularization architecture is proposed. Instead of several costly 3D convolutions, the 3D BSConv based on intra-kernel correlations is introduced to regularize the cost. The proposed method can incrementally predict the depth map from coarse to fine, and reduce the network computational complexity significantly. The experiments in several public indoor and outdoor synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art methods in terms of a synthesis of accuracy and speed, with fewer model parameters.},

  abstract     = {Crash detection is of great significance for traffic emergency management. Video-based approaches can effectively save the manpower monitoring cost and have achieved promising results in recent studies. However, they sometimes fail to correctly identify crashes in congested traffic. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a novel appearance-motion network for improving video-based crash detection performance in congested traffic. The appearance-motion network utilizes two paralleled convolutional networks (i.e., an appearance network and a motion network) to extract both appearance features and motion features of crashes. To learn discriminative appearance features for differentiating crashes in congested traffic scene (CCT) with non-crashes in congested traffic scene (NCCT), an auxiliary network combined with a triplet loss are introduced to train the appearance network. To better capture crash motion features in congested traffic, an optical flow learner is built in the motion network and trained to extract more fine-grained motion information. Moreover, a temporal attention module is applied to enable the motion network to focus on valuable frames. Experimental results show that the proposed network achieves a state-of-the-art result on crash detection and the introduction of the three components (i.e., the auxiliary network, the optical flow learner and the temporal attention module) effectively reduces false alarm rate by 28.07% and miss rate by 27.08% on crash detection in congested traffic.

To maintain consistent performance as a vehicle driving around different cities, it is crucial to adapt to changing traffic circumstances and achieve lifelong trajectory prediction model.

In this paper, a divergence measurement method based on conditional Kullback-Leibler divergence is proposed first to evaluate spatiotemporal dependency difference among varied driving circumstances. Then based on generative replay, a novel lifelong vehicle trajectory prediction framework is developed. The framework consists of a conditional generation model and a vehicle trajectory prediction model. The conditional generation model is a generative adversarial network conditioned on position configuration of vehicles. After learning and merging trajectory distribution of vehicles across different cities, the generation model replays trajectories with prior samplings as inputs, which alleviates catastrophic forgetting. The vehicle trajectory prediction model is trained by the replayed trajectories and achieves consistent prediction performance on visited cities. A lifelong experiment setup is established on four open datasets including five tasks. Spatiotemporal dependency divergence is calculated for different tasks. Even though these divergence, the proposed framework exhibits lifelong learning ability and achieves consistent performance on all tasks.},

That is, all lateral flows between lanes due to lane changes are ignored. This assumption does not accurately reflect the traffic behavior since every lane behaves differently depending mainly on the intensity of lane changes, especially close to bottleneck locations. Treating a multi-lane roadway as a single lane by the VSL controllers may fail to utilize the full motorway capacity when the bottleneck is active. In this paper, every lane is treated as a separate stream using a multi-lane CTM, where the net lane-changing flow is modeled as an additional unknown term in the conservation equation. The unknown net flow is estimated in real-time, and its estimate at each time is used in calculating the VSL command for each lane. Then, a Lane Change (LC) controller is combined with the VSL to prevent creating a queue in the vicinity of the bottleneck. The stability properties of the closed-loop system are analyzed, where the integrated control scheme guarantees that the lane traffic density operates within the free-flow region of the fundamental diagram. Microscopic simulations based on the commercial software PTV Vissim are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {An improved power management strategy for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) is proposed in this paper. This strategy combines long-term power management with a short-term intelligent controller. In long-term power management, the motor and diesel engine torque are optimized using a chaotic improved generalized particle swarm optimization technique (CIGPSO). In order to reduce the computation time, a five-mode rule-based control system is employed, where the CIGPSO estimates the optimal values for the motor and engine torque in a hybrid mode, which manages the power between the motor and engine following a multi-objective cost function. This cost function reduces fuel usage as well as the drawn current from the battery, taking into account the process of the battery aging. Moreover, the CIGPSO is able to obtain the state of charge (SOC) curve of the battery during the charging and discharging of the battery throughout the trip. The short-term controller is designed using an interval type-2 fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (IT2TSK) algorithm, which depends on human experts to overcome the uncertainties of the driving conditions. Lyapunov stability theory for the online controller is achieved. Furthermore, the SOC of the battery is estimated using an adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF). The performance of CIGPSO has been compared to the performance of the current state of art and resulted in saving up to 19.03%, 12.54%%, and 7.14% in terms of engine torque, motor torque, and battery SOC, respectively. The simulation results for the engine, motor, and battery are performed using real data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with comparative results.},

Aiming at high-accuracy collision risk modeling, a twisted Gaussian risk model using both longitudinal and lateral motion states for TV behavior description is proposed. Firstly, the HV-TVs system is treated as the superposition of multiple HV-TV units, and a Gaussian risk model is adopted for the collision risk description of the HV-TV unit. Then, by expanding the variances, TV longitudinal and lateral velocities are considered. At last, a twisted Gaussian risk model considering TV yaw rate is constructed based on the projection of the Gaussian risk model. With this twisted Gaussian risk model, TV longitudinal-lateral motion states are considered simultaneously, and TV behaviors can be described for HV-TVs collision risk modeling. For HV trajectory planning, trajectory candidates generated by the maneuver-inspired method are evaluated via the proposed risk model, and the safe and efficient trajectory is selected. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experimental results show that the proposed method considering TV longitudinal-lateral motion states allows HV to operate more safely and efficiently than the conventional method.},

  abstract     = {The Underwater sensor network (UWSN), also known as Marine Sensor Network (MSN), is gaining increasing attention due to its applications in the monitoring of the marine environment and assisting Marine Intelligent Transportation Systems (MITS). Such systems provide in-vehicle assistance services (i.e., traffic monitoring and driver alerts) by gathering transportation and environmental information. Though very promising, there are several barriers to developing energy-efficient communication protocols for heterogeneous MSN, including selecting optimal routing paths twinned with the lifetime of these sensor nodes along the path, which are restricted due to the limited energy storage capacity. Hereby, the selection of an optimal route path also necessitates harvesting and management of the sensor nodes’ energy. To facilitate this, the current work presents REER-H, a Reliable Energy Efficient Routing protocol with Harvesting for cluster-based MSN capable of multi-source energy harvesting and an incorporated energy management technique. Incorporating three separate layers of the protocol stack, namely, network, MAC, and physical layers, REER-H uses its proposed adaptive scheduling technique to support collision-free data transmission by assigning adaptive time slots based on demand and data load. Also, the proposed integrated energy harvesting and management solves the energy hole problem and enhances the overall network lifetime. In comparison to the existing cooperative and cluster-based energy-efficient routing protocols for underwater maritime communication, the simulated results using Network Simulator-3 (NS3) reveal that the proposed scheme remarkably enhances the overall network performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, throughput, lifetime energy consumption, and end-to-end delay for MSN.},

  abstract     = {The optimization-based energy management strategy (EMS) enables expertise to improve the performance of fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). Ongoing efforts are mostly focused on optimizing a centralized EMS using a variety of high-computing technologies without offering appropriate scalability and modularity for the onboard powertrain components. In real-time applications, the time-accomplishment capability of EMSs is crucial; hence, decentralized EMSs with low-cost components and limited processing capability are necessary. Local units handle the computation load on a modular platform. In addition, the decentralized system’s plug-and-play functionality minimizes the total cost. This paper presents a decentralized model predictive control (D-MPC) based on the consensus-based alternating direction method of multipliers (C-ADMM) that explicitly considers the coordination of the dynamic reactions of powertrain components and future driving profiles. In addition, a decentralized learning method is proposed to seek the optimal policy for the moving horizon dimensions in the D-MPC using the federated reinforcement learning (FRL) algorithm in order to improve processing time. Due to the deployment of a fully modular system in the proposed learning technique, agents are restricted from sharing their trajectories. Using a highly dynamic module-to-module communication layer in a fully decentralized arrangement, the powertrain components utilize the multi-step method to attain the global optimum. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated with regards to its precision, convergence speed, and scalability. The results of numerical simulation and implementation demonstrated that the proposed method is superior to the centralized and fixed-horizon MPC approaches.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is an autonomous vehicle-following technology that allows groups of vehicles on the highway to form in tightly-coupled platoons. This is accomplished by exchanging inter-vehicle data through Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) wireless communication networks. CACC increases traffic throughput and safety, and decreases energy consumption. However, the surge of vehicle connectivity has brought new security challenges as vehicular networks increasingly serve as new access points for adversaries trying to deteriorate the platooning performance or even cause collisions. In this manuscript, we propose a novel anomaly detection scheme that leverage real-time sensor/network data and physics-based mathematical models of vehicles in the platoon. Nevertheless, even the best detection scheme could lead to conservative detection results because of unavoidable modelling uncertainties, network effects (delays, quantization, communication dropouts), and noise. It is hard (often impossible) for any detector to distinguish between these different perturbation sources and actual attack signals. This enables adversaries to launch a range of attack strategies that can surpass the detection scheme by hiding within the system uncertainty. Here, we provide risk assessment tools (in terms of semi-definite programs) for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) to quantify the potential effect of attacks that remain hidden from the detector (referred here as stealthy attacks). A numerical case-study is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our methods.},

The Res-UNet+ neural networks was designed by adapting two prevalent deep learning architectures, which significantly improved the performance of the STMap-based vehicle detection and tracking. The DMD model provides many interesting insights for understanding the evolution of underlying spatial-temporal structures preserved by the STMap. The model outputs were compared with the previous image processing model and baseline semantic segmentation neural networks. After thorough evaluations, this solution is accurate and robust against many challenging factors. Finally, this work addresses data quality issues by correcting erroneous trajectories obtained from computer vision tools.

To distinguish from existing surveys, this paper proposes the security challenges and security properties of VANETs from the perspective of builders and attackers, respectively. Then, we present the necessary and important characteristics of a VANET’s security system including the authenticity of nodes and information, the availability of network systems, the integrity and confidentiality of information, and the non-repudiation of information after transmission. Specifically, attack methods and detection schemes for these characteristics are highlighted in detail and analyzed in terms of their advantages and limitations, which fill the gaps in the existing survey. More importantly, we focus on the authentication schemes proposed in recent years, reporting the latest advances in VANETs. These schemes are analyzed and compared in depth in terms of the security characteristics and attack resistance of authentication, as well as in terms of overhead and efficiency.

  abstract     = {The fine-grained prediction of traffic anomalies is crucial for Traffic Management Bureau to alleviate congestion and avoid public safety incidents. While in practice, the fine-grained prediction is very challenging due to two issues. 1) Data sparsity. At the fine-grained setting, missing data is inevitable and widespread on spatial and temporal dimension. Existing methods have weak performance as they do not handle missing data properly. 2) Data distribution mutation. At the fine-grained setting, the traffic conditions of adjacent road segments are sometimes completely different, invalidating existing spatiotemporal smoothing-based methods. This paper proposes GMAT-DU, a novel model that aims to predict traffic anomaly from sparse data in fine-grained manner. To solve the first issue, we propose a Decay Unrolling (DU) mechanism to make the model applicable to sparse datasets. The performance will be progressively enhanced by the spatiotemporal unrolling of high-impact neighbors. For the second issue, we combine the meta-features of roads with correlations between roads, which are learnt from road semantic information and historical spatiotemporal data, and make the model focusing on the high-impact neighbors by a Graph Meta-features based ATtention (GMAT) mechanism. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. The experiment results show the significant advantages against the state-of-the-art models.},

In this paper, we developed an effective approach to traffic flow monitoring under daytime conditions by applying machine learning and computer vision techniques to extract motion traffic data parameters from the videos captured by the static surveillance camera installed and fixed at the intersection. We address the issue of video camera vibration and jittering by applying image-matching algorithms. In order to calculate the vehicle speed, we utilize the projective transformation to compute the real object distance from an image taken by a single camera installed at the road intersection. We adapt and employ state-of-the-art object detectors, transfer learning, and analytical computer vision methods to detect and track vehicles and measure moving speed and vehicle volume from a predefined detection area extracted from monocular videos. The developed approach is proven to be effective in estimating vehicle speed and vehicle volume using video sequences captured from a stationary camera. Experimental results obtained during the study prove the efficiency of the proposed method under strong vibration conditions. The proposed framework achieved promising tracking performance on custom-labeled test video clips with a small absolute error of 3.97% for traffic flow average speed estimation. An additional test on a video from BrnoCompSpeed Dataset shows that the proposed method can reduce the average speed estimation error by 51.8%.},

  abstract     = {With the ubiquitous connectivity in internet of vehicles, secure transmission is of vital importance for intelligent vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. However, in order to effectively guarantee the secrecy performance, once the short-term statistics of channel quality are low, which frequently happens because of the high mobility of vehicles, the throughput performance can be weakened by using the existing either cryptography techniques or physical-layer security (PLS) technique. To improve the throughput of secure data transmission, we propose the concept of statistical security, which utilizes the time-sensitive characteristics of information, such as the position of mobile vehicles, in V2X communications. Specifically, the time-sensitive information has its own outdated rate. As long as the information leakage rate is less than the information outdated rate, the eavesdropper still cannot obtain any useful information. Then, we use a queue system to characterize the eavesdropping process, where the queue-length violation probability indicates the level of secure transmission. Under this statistical security model, we investigate the throughput maximization problem and give the optimal power allocation scheme for the legitimate vehicular users. Furthermore, since the service’s security QoS requirements and wireless environments are both varying in V2X communications, we propose a unified cross-layer policy-adaption approach to guarantee the varying security QoS requirements meanwhile improving the throughput. Simulation results verify that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the existing baseline schemes.},

  abstract     = {Ramp merging represents a bottleneck scenario that causes traffic congestion, accidents, and increases emissions. Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) can realize the coordinated control of ramp merging through vehicle-to- infrastructure (V2I) for relieving above problems. Considering the previous studies on centralized ramp merging only involved single mainline, this paper proposes a multi-lane centralized collaborative control strategy using cooperative game. First, the merging rules of different lanes of vehicles in the merging area are defined, so that the vehicles can achieve the cooperative merging safely. Second, driving efficiency, comfort, and fuel consumption in the merging control zone are used as the cost function. The best merging sequences of vehicles in different lanes are solved by cooperative game. Finally, analytical solution of longitudinal optimal control for all vehicles is obtained by applying the Pontryagin principle. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulation under random traffic conditions. Compared to other centralized control algorithms, it can significantly improve driving efficiency and reduce fuel consumption. At the same time, the applicability of the method is verified by comparing with ExiD datasets, and some advantages are obtained in terms of fuel consumption.},

However, its feasibility depends heavily on the sharing willingness, how to incentive selfish vehicles in such decentralized architecture is a vital problem. In this paper, we jointly consider the pricing strategy and the users’ concerns about security and privacy to incentive more participants. We first construct a P2P resource trading system based on consortium blockchain to build trust between strange vehicles and guarantee transaction security and user privacy without an authority center. To overcome the resource constraint on blockchain deployment and enhance the scalability of blockchain, the proposed system is built on edge-terminal architecture and improves the consistency algorithm. In addition, the V2V trading process is formalized as a two-stage Stackelberg game model to maximize the utility of both requesters and providers. The optimal pricing and trading volume strategy are derived from efficient optimization algorithms. Finally, we conduct a security analysis to show the performance of the trading process in terms of security and privacy.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the task assignment problem for one truck and one drone to deliver packages to a group of customer locations. The truck, carrying a large number of packages, can only travel between a group of prescribed street-stopping/parking locations to replenish the drone with both packages and batteries. The drone can carry multiple packages simultaneously to serve customers sequentially within its limited operation range. The objective is to reduce the amount of time it takes the drone to deliver the necessary package to the last customer while taking into account its operation range and loading capacity. First, the package delivery task assignment problem is shown to be an NP-hard problem, which guides us to design heuristic task assignment algorithms. Secondly, based on graph theory, a lower bound on the minimum time for the drone to serve the last customer is achieved to approximately evaluate the performance of a task assignment algorithm. Third, several decoupled heuristic algorithms are designed to sequentially plan the routes for the drone and the truck. Two coupled heuristic algorithms, namely the improved nearest inserting algorithm and the improved minimum marginal-cost algorithm, are proposed to simultaneously plan the routes for the drone and the truck. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the improved minimum marginal-cost algorithm reduces the total service time by 14.93% and 14.06% on average compared with the existing decoupled two-phase algorithm TPA and the coupled greedy algorithm, respectively. In the best case, it reduces the total service time by 41.71% and 40.11% compared with the TPA and the coupled greedy algorithm, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent transportation infrastructure is essential to intelligent transportation system (ITS). With the continuous development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, remote monitoring has become a critical part of ITS. However, due to the limitations of network transmission, production cost, and other factors, some video monitoring can obtain only low-resolution (LR) video. LR video features are seriously lost, thus affecting the performance of ITS. In this paper, based on the research of existing super-resolution algorithms, we focus on improving the reconstruction quality of video frame sequences by aiming at the insufficient utilization of inter-frame information and low reconstruction quality of existing video super-resolution algorithms. This paper proposes a video super-resolution algorithm based on inter-frame information utilization, which can effectively improve the performance of ITS. First, a novel U-shaped feature extractor is designed to fully extract the feature expression of video frame sequences. Second, a deformable inter-frame alignment module based on residual learning is constructed to make the inter-frame alignment more accurate and thus promote the mutual utilization of inter-frame information. Finally, an up and down sampling residual block is proposed to extract features that better match the upsampling reconstruction requirements. The experimental results show that the method has better reconstruction quality for monitoring video and is advanced and applicable compared to mainstream video oversampling methods.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) provides a promising solution to meet the requirements of data privacy and security in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which enables edge devices and road side units (RSUs) to collaboratively train learning models without exposing the raw data. However, the deep leakage from gradients (DLG) still leads to the risk of divulging the original data. Meanwhile, the existing gradient protection methods based on secure multi-party computation (SMC) result in huge communication overheads and latency, which are difficult to satisfy the real-time demands of both FL and the diverse services in ITS. Focusing on improving edge data security in ITS, this paper proposes an enhanced federated learning (FL) model (SemBroc-RF) with reinforcement learning, which considers the advantages of both end-to-end homomorphic encryption (HE) and SMC. To reduce communication overheads and strengthen data security in RSUs and end devices simultaneously, a partially encrypted secure multi-party broadcast computation algorithm (SemBroc) is designed, which achieves the time complexity O(n) by constructing the decoding function and sharing the gradients among the local models. To improve the model accuracy by gradients aggregation, a FL algorithm (GreFLa) with reinforcement learning is proposed based on the adaptive assigned weight of the local gradients. Theoretical analysis and detailed simulation results verify that SemBroc-RF can effectively prevent gradient leakage. On the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, compared with the benchmark, the accuracy of SemBroc-RF is increased by 3.63% and 1.35%, and the training round of SemBroc-RF is reduced by 70.8% and 45.6%, respectively.},

To implement and evaluate our proposed contrast enhancement method on nighttime images, we consider a scenario of using a camera-based Internet of Things (IoT)-edge computing device for traffic and road surveillance. Edge-computing and IoT technology enable significant amounts of novel studies to advance traffic system monitoring, sensing, control, and management. Considering multiple metrics of image enhancement quality, the proposed nighttime image contrast enhancement method outperforms some existing well-performing CLAHE-based methods. To provide accurate vehicle detection under nighttime conditions and different challenges, including vehicle overlapping, low-light conditions, camera vibrations, and image distortion, must be addressed. For this purpose, a deep neural network based on YOLOv5 architecture has been designed and trained using our custom-labeled dataset. The developed neural network is proven to be effective in the detection of different vehicles under low-light ambient conditions using video captured from a stationary camera. Experiments on our dataset show that the proposed contrast enhancement method greatly improves the detection performance of the trained YOLOv5 model under low-environment-light conditions compared with the model trained using unenhanced images. The model trained with enhanced images can provide an improvement of 5.7% on F1 score, 6.3% on mAP0.5, and 3.4% on mAP0.5:0.95 under specific conditions.},

The research results demonstrate that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of trajectory prediction shows a certain downward trend with the increase of network neurons. At the same time, the average value of systematic errors continues to increase.

To this end, the vehicle steering behavior is measured at the turning point using the tire tilt angle of the vehicle at the turning point.

To this end, this work innovatively constructs the IoT system combined with UAVs to satisfy the user’s communication experience and allocate channel resources simultaneously. Finally, a UAV-assisted IoT resource allocation and control model is constructed and tested through experiments on the simulation software to analyze its performance. The results indicate that the transmission delay of the model reported here is significantly lower than that of other algorithms with the increased number of end users and the proportion of tasks. When the number of users is 500, the transmission delay of data resources is 47.5s. Besides, it requires lower energy consumption and shorter task completion time while maintaining lower throughput. At the same time, the uplink transmission rate of the model is generally stable at 3.10bps; the uplink transmission rate of the entire wireless communication system shows an increasing trend with the increase of the transmit power. Therefore, it is found that the model constructed here has strong robustness and achieves an excellent data resource allocation effect while ensuring lower data delay.

In this work, an EEMR (Energy Efficient Multi-hop Routing) is designed for the intelligent transportation wireless sensor network. In the EEMR algorithm, the base station runs the IAP clustering algorithm for network clustering after receiving the information of all surviving nodes. A method called ACRR (Adaptive Cluster-head Round Robin) is proposed for local dynamic election of cluster heads. In addition, the deep learning-based stochastic gradient descent algorithm and its evolution algorithm are sorted out, and its application in practical scenarios is analyzed. Due to the disadvantages of the adaptive algorithm in the current data processing process, the gradient optimization algorithm based on deep learning is adopted and the concept of adaptive friction coefficient is applied to the Adam algorithm to obtain a new adaptive algorithm (TAdam). The simulation experiment reveals that the proportion of network surviving nodes of the EEMR algorithm is still as high as 90% in 1,500 rounds of data collection. This shows that the EEMR algorithm achieves the energy balance of the network nodes as much as possible while minimizing the system energy consumption. In application scenario 1, when the network surviving nodes of the four data collection algorithms compares dropped below 40%, the number of surviving nodes in the EEMR algorithm is still as high as 97.6%. On the PTB (Penn Tree Bank) test data set, the TAdam algorithm shows the fastest convergence speed and the best generalization performance. The TAdam algorithm based on deep learning discussed in this work was of great significance for improving the transmission and sharing efficiency of intelligent transportation data.},

  abstract     = {The purpose is to optimize the Beetle Antenna Search (BAS) algorithm and apply it to the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) to process traffic data in time and solve traffic congestion. This work studies the development status of ITS and the application status of the BAS algorithm. It optimizes BAS to converge to local optimization prematurely in high-dimensional space, affecting the prediction accuracy. Then, combined with the Least Squares Support Vector Machine Algorithm (LSSVM), the algorithm with quadratic interpolation optimization is proposed. The proposed algorithm is named the Quadratic Interpolation Beetle Antenna Search (QIBAS). On this basis, a traffic flow prediction model based on QIBAS-LSSVM is established. Finally, the improved QIBAS algorithm and Traffic Flow Prediction (TFP) model are verified. The results show that the test Mean Square Error (MSE) of the TFP model based on QIBAS-LSSVM increases by 4.28%, 7.38%, and 18.23%, respectively compared with the other three models. The test Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) increases by 0.09%, 0.06%, and 0.36% respectively. The proposed QIBAS algorithm has a good effect and high accuracy in short-term TFP. The research has important reference value for the digital transformation of transportation systems in modern smart cities.},

Meanwhile, UAV’s ability of autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance becomes more and more critical. This paper focuses on filling up the gap between deep reinforcement learning (DRL) theory and practical application by involving attention mechanism and hierarchical mechanism to solve some severe problems encountered in the practical application of DRL. More specifically, in order to improve the robustness of DRL, we use averaged estimation function instead of the normal value estimation function. Then, we design a recurrent network and a temporal attention mechanism to improve the performance of the algorithm. Third, we propose a hierarchical framework to improve its performance on long-term tasks. Some realistic simulation environments, as well as the real-world, are used to evaluate the proposed UAV autonomous navigation method. The results demonstrate that our DRL-based navigation method performs well in different environments and outperforms the original DrQ algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle Edge Computing (VEC)-assisted computational offloading brings cloud computing closer to user equipment (UEs) at the edge of the access network by delivering various services to the UEs with limited processing power and battery. However, in fifth-generation and beyond 5G (B5G) networks, where UEs’ service requests and locations change dynamically, the deployment of static edge server deployments may lead to an increase in latency and total energy consumption. This paper presents a latency-energy-aware, efficient task offloading scheme for connected autonomous vehicular networks. Firstly, vehicles are assembled into clusters, in which vehicle can transmit tasks to the other vehicle, while on the other hand, the VEC server is used for processing the data. We developed a joint resource allocation and offloading decision optimization problem to minimize network latency and total energy usage. Due to the non-convex character of the optimization issue, we employed the Markov decision process (MDP) to convert it to a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. Then, we used a soft-actor critic-based scheme to achieve the optimal policy for resource allocation and task offloading to reduce the total latency and energy consumption for connected autonomous vehicles. Simulation analysis reveals that the proposed scheme attains 46.6% and 17.2% lesser delay, and 28.8% and 20.0% consumes less energy than the Hybrid DRL with Genetic Algorithm (HDRL-GA) and DRL based collaborative Data Scheduling (DRL-CDSS) state-of-art schemes.},

Aiming at the uncertain capacity and unbalanced load in the car-hailing platform, this work innovatively introduces the EC to unload, constructs an EC-based online car-hailing resource allocation and pricing optimization model by combining with factors such as the number of users and reputation in the network, and further analyzes the performance of the resource allocation and pricing optimization model in the constructed car-hailing platform through simulation experiments. The experimental results show that with the increase in the number of vehicles with computing tasks, the amount of resources purchased from various car-hailing vehicles also increases, the cost of paying is showing an increasing trend, and the utility function of NCH platforms and operators has declined. In the task resource analysis, the average unloading utility of the algorithm in this work is the highest, and the average unloading utility is basically stable at about 70% when the number of vehicles is 98. With the increase of the delay weight, the delay is smaller and the energy consumption is lower. Therefore, the model constructed in this work can minimize the average cost and consumes less energy while the delay is small. It can provide a reference for intelligent pricing and resource allocation of the online car-hailing platform in the later period of intelligent transportation.},

It is crucial for IoT applications to select high-quality services to boost their reliability and efficiency. The prediction for Quality of Service (QoS) can be used to address this issue. Although a number of QoS prediction approaches have been proposed, their performance may be limited in the IoT environment where context features can significantly impact QoS predictions. Based on the historical QoS records of services, this paper proposes a collaborative QoS prediction approach using self-attention representation and deep factorization machine. The approach first leverages the global and local contextual information of services and users to learn personalized representations. Then, based on the personalized representations, it utilizes a deep factorization machine to make QoS predictions. Extensive experiments conducted on a real-world dataset show that the proposed QoS prediction approach significantly outperforms the other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Device positioning has generally been recognized as an enabling technology for numerous vehicular applications in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). The downlink time difference of arrival (DL-TDOA) technique in cellular networks requires range information of geographically diverse base stations (BSs) to be measured by user equipment (UE) through the positioning reference signal (PRS). However, inter-cell interference from surrounding BSs can be particularly serious under poor network planning or dense deployments. This may lead to a relatively longer measurement time to locate the UE, causing an unacceptable location update rate to time-sensitive applications. In this case, PRS muting of certain wireless resources has been envisioned as a promising solution to increase the detectability of a weak BS. In this paper, to reduce UE measurement latency while ensuring high location accuracy, we propose a muting strategy managed by positioning functions that utilizes a combination of optimized pseudo-random sequences (CO-PRS) for multiple BSs to coordinate the muting of PRS resources. The original sequence is first truncated according to the muting period, and a modified greedy selection is performed to form a set of control sequences as the muting configurations (MC) with balance and concurrency constraints. Moreover, efficient information exchange can be achieved with the seeds used for regenerating the MC. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional random and ideal muting benchmarks in terms of measurement latency by about 30%, especially when dealing with severe near-far problems in cellular networks.},

  abstract     = {The future Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) will rely heavily on the advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT). Indeed, the IoT infrastructure paves the way toward connecting vehicles for various benefits including traffic monitoring, crowdsourcing, energy trading, and other ITS services. One of the use cases of the IoV is Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) energy charging/discharging, which is expected to be an integral part of the ITS. In V2V paradigm, Electric Vehicles (EVs) with bidirectional chargers can communicate with a grid edge network or directly with another EV using low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) or 5G wireless connection to offer or demand energy. V2V energy exchange allows EV owners to make money from selling their battery’s excess energy to other EVs. One of the main challenges for the wide adoption of V2V is the development of mechanisms that maximize the benefits for participants. In the V2V paradigm, energy providers and suppliers require mechanisms that ensure maximal matching for the optimal social welfare of the users. In this paper, we propose a double-sided auction mechanism that matches EVs by pairing bids and asks such that the traded volume and the utilities are maximized. Through theoretical analysis, we show that the proposed model can indeed be truthful, individually rationale, and computationally efficient. Finally, we evaluate the proposed model based on real data and provide performance analysis.},

In traffic areas specifically for the much-anticipated Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), UAVs can coordinate with the ground internet of things infrastructure, such as the Road Side Unit (RSU), to perform 3D data collection and processing, improving traffic safety and transportation efficiency. In ITS, decision-making is crucial and relies heavily on proper and timely processing and transmission of the massive amounts of data generated by ubiquitous sensors, especially in emergency disposal scenarios. In this paper, the latency incurred from RSU-aided data offloading and UAV-aided data relay plays a decisive role, characterized by both the average and risk performance metric, Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), for quantifying the risk incurred from the latency violation over a certain threshold in probability. Specifically, the peak Age of Information (AoI) with its distribution is adopted to underlying the CVaR analysis in relay latency. Besides, the matching algorithm to coordinate the mutual transmission between UAVs and RSUs is proposed, achieving low computation complexity and minimum risk for both sides. The system performance is validated through analysis, simulation, and field experiments.},

  abstract     = {Knowing why people travel is meaningful for human mobility understanding and smart services development. Unfortunately, in real-world scenarios, trip purpose cannot be automatically collected on a large scale, thus calling for effective prediction models. Nevertheless, since passengers’ trip purposes in the city are diverse and complicated, the prediction is very difficult especially at a fine-grained level. Worse still, the informative data sources and real purpose-labels about trips are commonly limited for model learning. To resolve the dilemma, we propose a semi-supervised deep embedding framework for predicting fine-grained trip purposes on a large scale. Specifically, we first derive augmented trip contexts from the vehicle’s GPS trajectory and public POI check-in data, then convert POI contexts into the graph structure. We further establish a D ual- A ttention G raph E mbedding Network with A utoencoder architecture (DAGE-A) to accomplish prediction and reconstruction simultaneously, in which category-aware graph attention networks are devised to model the POI semantics at trip’s origin/destination and extract complementary knowledge from unlabeled trips; and soft-attention is employed to aggregate different trip semantics appropriately for the final prediction. We conduct extensive experiments in Beijing and Shanghai, and results show our framework outperforms state-of-the-arts and could reduce labelling efforts by up to 20%. We also find that our model is generalized at different times and locations, and the performance varies for different trip purposes.},

In this paper, a new system known as Secure and Intelligent System for the Internet of Vehicles (SISIV) is developed. A deep learning architecture based on graph convolutional networks and an attention mechanism are implemented. In addition, blockchain technology is used to protect data transmission between nodes in the IoV system. Moreover, the hyperparameters of the generated deep learning model are intelligently selected using a branch-and-bound technique. To validate SISIV, experiments were conducted on four networked vehicle databases dealing with prediction problems.

  abstract     = {The advent of 5G opens up hitherto unimagined opportunities for delivering the much-anticipated Internet of Vehicles (IoV). There are two typical types of services in IoV, i.e., safety service and non-safety service. However, the existing IoV framework cannot efficiently support the differentiated IoV services. In addition, maximizing the number of accessed vehicles/users is another critical issue in IoV, especially in the dense urban area. To address these problems, in this paper, we utilize the emerging network slicing technology to support different services and employ Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access technology (NOMA) to help increase the connectivity. In particular, for the safety service, we take advantage of the finite blocklength capacity to correctly record the delay. Our goal is to maximize the connectivity of users by jointly considering the user association and their beamforming vectors, under the restrictions of limited physical resource. The problem is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming problem (MINLP). To tackle the intractable MINLP, we propose a two-stage scheme. Firstly, we exploit efficient approaches to solve the beamforming problem, i.e., successive convex approximation, semidefinite relaxation and second-order cone programming. Secondly, we propose a low-complexity Greedy User Association (GUA) algorithm to solve the user association problem. Finally, comprehensive simulations verify that our proposed GUA algorithm is close to global optimal solution and outperforms the benchmark schemes.},

However, it is a very challenging task for modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies, since the traffic data belongs to highly periodic multivariate time series which makes it hard to model accurate spatial dependencies only from time series and observed geolocation information of road segments. The existing research mainly focuses on finding ways of capturing dynamic spatial dependencies of road segments while neglecting the importance of periodicity, and few studies have explored a pure embedding-driven method that is robust to corrupted data to model periodicity. In this paper, we propose an embedding-driven multi-hop spatio-temporal attention network for traffic prediction (PIANOFORTE), which mainly focuses on leveraging the multi-scale periodicity of traffic data. Specifically, the proposed network applies a designed Fourier-series-based embedding, to capture the periodicity, which is more in line with real-world facts. Driven by the designed embedding, both local and global temporal dependencies are modeled properly by combining the attention-based methods and the convolution-based methods. Besides, we implement a trial that can hardly be seen in the existing traffic prediction works to combine the graph self-attention mechanism with a multi-hop diffusion process to explore the large-scale structural information on a designed set of graphs. Experiments on two real-world traffic datasets which contains traffic speed data for months show the effectiveness of our proposed methods. The experiments also suggest the methods can provide stable reasonable and smooth predictions for completely corrupted data.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT)-based intelligent transportation is attracting more and more attention. As a key component of intelligent transportation, traffic video monitoring is very important, in which vehicle and pedestrian detection on the road is a crucial task. Although vehicle and pedestrian detection through deep learning (DL) may achieve high accuracy, it tends to require high computing resources, which hinders its use on IoT devices. As an important class of IoT devices, digital signal processor (DSP) has the characteristics of low energy consumption, small size, and strong performance, which has been widely used in intelligent transportation. In order to use DL on DSP for accurate vehicle and pedestrian detection, we first propose a series of general tactics to optimize the object detection convolutional neural network (CNN) model, including convolution layer optimization, cache optimization, compiler optimization, intrinsics optimization and direct memory access (DMA) acceleration, and then a parallel scheme to extend the model to run on multicore, and further quantize the implementation of the model. We evaluate it on UA-DETRAC and KITTI datasets. Experimental results show that our method achieves a faster speed than running the same CNN model on a mainstream desktop CPU, with only 0.06% accuracy loss.},

The simulation experiment analysis suggests that the DBA algorithm takes the balance of travel distance into account and effectively improves task quality. The Utility Function in B-DBA and the Biological Heuristic Search Algorithm in Pareto Ant Colony Optimization play a critically important role in enhancing the overall task quality. In addition, a Transmission based on Privacy Protection (TPP) algorithm is designed to protect the attribute-based privacy information in the traffic information transmission system. This algorithm ensures that the real-time traffic information processing system resists various attacks from malicious nodes.

Because Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) reduces the complexity of non-inferior sorting genetic algorithm and is characterized by fast running speed and good convergence, it is deeply improved. NSGA-II algorithm based on Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA) (M-NSGA-II) is proposed. In terms of the solution of the stability of the optimal values of four target functions, including distribution cost, customer satisfaction, fuel conservation, and carbon emission, the lowest distribution costs of M-NSGA-II algorithm in ten experiments were all lower than those of other three standard algorithms. The solution duration of M-NSGA-II algorithm was 85.2s and the corresponding average frontier value amounted to 20.

  abstract     = {Advances in IoT and IoV technology have made connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) data sources. Using CAVs as data sources and in incident management algorithms can create faster, more reliable, and more effective algorithms. This paper proposes a modified standard normal deviation (MSND) incident detection algorithm that uses CAVs as data sources and considers multiple traffic parameters. MSND is utilized in conjunction with two other incident detection algorithms, Standard Normal Deviation (SNS) and California (CAL), in a method of incident management known as Variable Speed Limits (VSL). SUMO Traffic Simulation Software is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. A 10.4-kilometer road network is developed. Numerous scenarios are simulated on this road network, with variables including traffic demand, autonomous vehicle penetration rate, incident location, incident length, and incident lane. On the effectiveness metrics of detection rate, false alarm rate, and mean time to detect, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the SND and California methods. In terms of detection rate, the MSND algorithm performs the best, with a 12.27% improvement over the SND algorithm and a 21.99% improvement over the California method. After integrating all incident detection algorithms with the VSL traffic management method and simulating each combination, it was determined that the MSND-VSL integration reduced average density in the critical region by 19.73 percent, followed by SND-VSL with a 13.94 percent reduction and CAL-VSL with a 9.9 percent reduction.},

Implementing such IoT-driven fire detection systems can significantly reduce the corresponding ecological, social, and economic destruction; they can also provide smart monitoring for intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). However, deploying these systems requires lightweight and cost-effective convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for real-time processing on artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted edge devices. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient and lightweight CNN architecture for early fire detection and segmentation, focusing on IoT-enabled ITS environments. We effectively utilize depth-wise separable convolution, point-wise group convolution, and a channel shuffling strategy with an optimal number of convolution kernels per layer, significantly reducing the model size and computation costs. Extensive experiments on our newly developed and other benchmark fire segmentation datasets reveal the effectiveness and robustness of our approach against state-of-the-art fire segmentation methods. Further, the proposed method maintains a balanced trade-off between the model efficiency and accuracy, making our system more suitable for IoT-driven fire disaster management in ITSs.},

However, in the process of transportation, the shape control of deformable objects has attracted extensive attention because deformable objects have been widely used in intelligent tasks such as packing and sorting cables before transportation. Restricted by the super-degrees of freedom and nonlinear dynamic models of deformable objects, planning the action trajectories to control the shape of deformable objects is a challenging task. In this work, we use contrastive learning to solve the shape control problem of deformable objects. The method jointly optimizes the visual representation model and dynamic model of deformable objects, maps the target nonlinear state to linear latent space which avoids model inference for deformable objects in infinite-dimensional configuration spaces. Furthermore, to extract effective information in the latent space, we construct an encoder with a multi-branch topology to improve the representation ability of the model. Experimentally, we collect dynamic trajectory data for random shape control task involving cloth or rope in a simulated environment. Then we apply it to train the proposed offline method to obtain latent dynamic models for shape control of deformable objects. In comparison with other baseline methods, our proposed method achieves substantial performance improvements.},

  abstract     = {Offloading task to roadside units (RSUs) provides a promising solution for enhancing the real-time data processing capacity and reducing energy consumption of vehicles in the vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET). Recently, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based offloading approaches have been widely used for task offloading in VANET. However, existing MADRL-based approaches suffer from offloading preference inference (OPI) attack, which utilizes the vulnerability in the policy learning process of MADRL to mislead vehicles to offload tasks to malicious RSUs. In this paper, we first formulate a joint optimization of offloading action and transmitting power with the objective of minimizing the system cost, including local and edge costs, under the privacy requirement of protecting offloading preference during offloading policy learning process in VANET. Despite the non-convexity and centralized of this joint optimization problem, we propose a privacy-aware MADRL (PA-MADRL) approach to solve it, which can allow the offload decision of each vehicle to reach the Nash Equilibrium (NE) without leaking offloading preference. The key to resisting the OPI attack is to protect the offloading preference by 1)elaborately constructing the noise based on ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\beta,\Phi $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; )-differential privacy mechanism and 2) adding it to the action selection and policy updating process of vanilla MADRL. We conduct a detailed theoretical analysis of the convergence and privacy guarantee of the proposed PA-MADRL, and extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness, privacy-protecting capacity, and cost-efficiency of PA-MADRL approach.},

Moreover, sharing the information requires huge networking resources such as high data rate, low latency, and low packet loss. Federated learning provides privacy-preserving model training on the vehicle without sharing the information. However, due to poor annotation mechanisms, federated learning may suffer from imperfect labels. This paper proposes a federated learning approach for ITS that can handle imperfect labels in the datasets of the participants. The approach also uses a Long-Range network to provide communication efficient connectivity. The approach initially estimates class-wise centroids of the datasets at the participants and server and then identifies participants with imperfect labels using similarity scores. Such participants demand the fraction of the correctly annotated dataset at the server to improve performance. We further derive the expression for the optimal fraction of the dataset requested by a participant.

  abstract     = {There has been a notable increase in the research and development of Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) to efficiently and safely manage large amounts of traffic. Such networks are, however, also prone to various cyber threats to data integrity, privacy, authentication, and network availability, and given the potential risk to life under the event of a malfunction and misinformation, it is important to provide security measures against such threats. This paper presents the Multi-branch Reconstruction Error (MbRE) Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for edge-based anomaly detection in VANETs for data integrity, network availability and user authentication-based misbehaviors without the need to train on them. Vehicular data is first sequenced and separated into three data branches - frequency (F) derived from the message timestamps, pseudo-identities (I), and the motion data (M) i.e. position and velocity. The proposed model comprises of three Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based reconstruction models trained to reconstruct normal F-I-M vehicular behavior. The IDS classifies each branch of a sequence as 0/1 based on the reconstruction error threshold for the respective branch and, therefore, has the ability to detect 8 possible binary encoded behaviors for each sequence of vehicular data. These results are then used to find the overall behavior of each vehicle using carefully selected detection thresholds. MbRE is able to classify frequency, identity and motion-based behavior samples with an accuracy of 100%, 98.5-100%, and 95.4-100%, respectively, without the need to train on such behaviors. The study also emulates the IDS on Google Colaboratory and Jetson Nano to show its practicality in cloud and edge environments.},

  abstract     = {In today’s world, interconnected Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET) and intelligent transportation systems have become more popular. Although IoV can bring many benefits for the smart cities and provide comforts for the passengers, however, the increasing needs for keeping the QoS and QoE at an acceptable level in time sensitive applications seems crucial and needs to be investigated deeply. Also, allocating the right number of resources to avoid congestions and fill the deficiencies in a distributed manner is a challenging issue. So, with the increase in users, attention must be given to Quality of Service (QoS) and resource allocation. As the vehicle network provides information to provide safety, comfort, and entertainment to drivers and passengers, they are one of the most compelling research topics in intelligent transportation systems. TDMA protocol is used in this study to increase the efficiency of the network and the quality of service it provides. To solve the synchronization problem, the Markov method predicts the size of slots and frames. The scenario field is used in the Markov application section to better predict TDMA gaps on solving the synchronization problem. Accordingly, the higher the quality of service, the lower the latency of the network, and the better the allocation of resources. Optimizing allocation and quality of service is further motivated by reducing collision between packets. In terms of its implementation, this method is divided into two components, the first being the database proposal for constructing the Markov matrix and the second being the simulation on VanetMobisim and implementation of the network in NS2. The proposed method performed better in different scenarios in terms of computational complexity, PDF, latency, and overhead, as shown in the results section.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is expected to play a revolutionary role in improving users’ driving experience and urban traffic governance. By widely absorbing emerging technologies including cloud computing, the future IoV evolution is leading towards providing more flexible and diversified data services. However, the publicly accessible IoV environment arouses the user’s concerns about the leakage of data and personal privacy. Despite some cryptographic solutions have been proposed, they still raise challenges on privacy, efficiency and usability. To cope with these challenges, this paper first presents an efficient scheme PH-ABE-DS, which attains the full policy hiding by implementing the access control with the inner product. Besides, we design an efficient indirect revocation mechanism, to enable the cloud and users to update the ciphertext and user secret key with slight storage and computational overheads. On this basis, we then present the EA-PH-ABE-DS scheme, by resorting to edge computing, it further reduces the overheads of resource-constrained devices. We design a deployment model for EA-PH-ABE-DS in IoV to discuss its usability. Rigorous security proof and security properties analysis show that our proposal is secure and reliable. Finally, through detailed comparisons on theoretical and experimental, both our two schemes show their superiority over the latest related works in terms of functionality and performance. The simulation evaluates and demonstrates the practicality of our solutions in practical IoT scenarios.},

Through integrating EI and computer vision technology, video surveillance systems in ITS can improve the processing capability of traffic information, which improves traffic efficiency and ensures traffic safety. Accordingly, first, we propose an edge intelligence-based improved-YOLOv4 vehicle detection algorithm, introducing an efficient channel attention (ECA) mechanism and a high-resolution network (HRNet) to enhance vehicle detection ability. Second, an edge intelligence-based improved DeepLabv3+ image segmentation algorithm is proposed, replacing the original backbone network with MobileNetv2 and using the softpool method, thus reducing the network size while improving the segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that our proposed model has a higher average precision (AP) and can improve vehicle detection accuracy from 82.03% to 86.22%. The mean intersection over union (mIOU) of the image segmentation model improves from 73.32% to 75.63%.},

Vehicular edge computing (VEC), as an emerging paradigm, enables the vehicles to utilize the resources of the edge servers to reduce the data transfer burden and computing stress. Although the utilization of VEC is a favourable support for IoV applications, vehicle mobility and other factors further complicate the challenge of designing and implementing such systems, leading to incremental delay and energy consumption. In recent times, there have been attempts to integrate deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches with IoV-based systems, to facilitate real-time decision-making and prediction. We demonstrate the potential of such an approach in this paper. Specifically, the dynamic computation offloading problem is constructed as a Markov decision process (MDP). Then, the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm is utilized to achieve the optimal offloading strategy. Finally, findings from the simulation demonstrate the potential of our proposed approach.},

Besides, with the rapid growth of different types of autonomous vehicles, it becomes challenging to facilitate the heterogeneous requirements of ITS. To meet the above needs, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) are introduced to vehicular communications and ITS, containing the reflecting elements that can intelligently configure incident signals from and to vehicles. As a novel vehicular communication paradigm at its infancy, it is key to understand the latest research efforts on applying IRS to 6G ITS as well as the fundamental differences with other existing alternatives and the new challenges brought by implementing IRS in 6G ITS.

  abstract     = {Automotive-Industry 5.0 will use beyond fifth-generation (B5G) technologies to provide robust, computationally intelligent, and energy-efficient data sharing among various onboard sensors, vehicles, and other devices. Recently, ambient backscatter communications (AmBC) have gained significant interest in the research community for providing battery-free communications. AmBC can modulate useful data and reflect it towards near devices using the energy and frequency of existing RF signals. However, obtaining channel state information (CSI) for AmBC systems would be very challenging due to no pilot sequences and limited power. As one of the latest members of multiple access technology, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has emerged as a promising solution for connecting large-scale devices over the same spectral resources in B5G wireless networks. Under imperfect CSI, this paper provides a new optimization framework for energy-efficient transmission in AmBC enhanced NOMA cooperative vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. We simultaneously minimize the total transmit power of the V2X network by optimizing the power allocation at BS and reflection coefficient at backscatter sensors while guaranteeing the individual quality of services. The problem of total power minimization is formulated as non-convex optimization and coupled on multiple variables, making it complex and challenging. Therefore, we first decouple the original problem into two sub-problems and convert the nonlinear rate constraints into linear constraints. Then, we adopt the iterative sub-gradient method to obtain an efficient solution. For comparison, we also present a conventional NOMA cooperative V2X network without AmBC. Simulation results show the benefits of our proposed AmBC enhanced NOMA cooperative V2X network in terms of total achievable energy efficiency.},

In this paper, we innovatively introduce a novel UAV-enabled multi-hop collaborative fog computing (FC) system model, in which several moving UAVs with unpredictable locations provide effective and efficient communication and computation services for ground user equipments (UEs). With this model, we mathematically formulate a joint user association, UAV association, task offloading, transmission power, computation resource allocation, and UAV location optimization problem, which is a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and challenging to deal with.

  abstract     = {With the deep integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology and the increase of computational power and memory, vehicles can also serve as the infrastructures for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), e.g., as fog nodes. However, when connecting vehicles to the internet, alongside with the benefits it brings, it also opens many new challenges such as security attacks. Controller Area Network (CAN) is one of the main in-vehicle communication protocols in modern cars. Its lack of sender verification mechanism makes CAN particularly vulnerable to cyber-attacks including masquerade attack. Fingerprinting Electronic Control Units (ECUs) based on hardware characteristics has been proved feasible and effective on defending CAN buses. However, most state-of-the-art works exploited the supervised learning algorithm to identify the transmitter based on the signal characteristics. This makes the decision process hard to understand, and it also limits the deployment on proprietary CAN bus without prior knowledge. To solve this, we design a novel clock-skew-based approach capable of pinpointing the sender and detecting intrusion on proprietary CAN bus. We take a single CAN frame as the object for measurement, and adjust the measuring process such that our approach can be independent of the transmission time of frames. Based on the statistical analysis of data from real vehicles, we propose a novel box-plot algorithm based on score mechanism to filter the raw data. Finally, the clock skews are estimated and accumulated to build a linear model for representing the transmitter ECU. The evaluation results on one CAN prototype and two production vehicles show that our approach is able to well identify and differentiate ECUs on the bus without prior knowledge. The data processed by the proposed box-plot algorithm can describe the hardware characteristics of ECUs precisely. We also show the ability of our approach to protecting the CAN bus against the masquerade attack.},

  abstract     = {As a promising enabler for edge intelligence, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have become more and more important in Mobile Edge Computing Networks (MECN), such as communication, computation, collection and control service supply. Although Age of Information (AoI) minimization is indispensable for fresh information collection and computation in the UAV-aided MECN, some attackers can launch attacks to deteriorate the availability of precious channel resources, such as revealed channel access attacks (CAAs). Moreover, recent research has not considered the system’s active probability and security issues concurrently, e.g., CAA, in the average AoI minimization process. In this paper, to deal with this problem, we consider an AoI-oriented channel access problem under CAA with a game theory viewpoint. Firstly, to obtain a MECN-based AoI indicator under CAA, the system model with active probability consideration is established. Next, the channel access-based AoI minimization problem is formulated from the viewpoint of the Ordinary Potential Game (OPG). Furthermore, two algorithms called AACSD and DCASD are proposed to determine channel access strategies, by which the Nash Equilibrium (NE) solution of the OPG could be reached. Finally, experiments are conducted under homogeneous and heterogeneous parameter settings, and the simulation results evaluate the correctness and effectiveness of our proposals.},

In order to better find potential security vulnerabilities and improve security of the vehicle system which applied SIMON block cipher, in this paper, a novel Differential fault attack (DFA) method is presented. By inducing a random bit fault in &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$L^{T-4}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; (the fourth round from the last), we first demonstrate the process of identifying the fault-induced position. Then, on the basis of the determined position, we describe how to retrieve three rounds of keys by inducing only one round of faults. For retrieving the SIMON family, compared with previous DFAs under the random bit fault model, the lowest numbers of fault-induced and fault locations (or rounds) are required by our attack. In particular, when the key words &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is 2 or 3, the proposed attack only needs to induce one round of faults.

Recently, transfer learning methods and lightweight networks have been used to realize efficient distress identification without large amount of human-labor work. This paper proposed an engineering approach that integrated transfer learning with lightweight models to classify and detect concrete bridge distresses. Two datasets named Distress Dataset of Asphalt Pavement (DDAP) with 2500 asphalt pavement distresses images and Distress Dataset of Concrete Bridge (DDCB) with 906 concrete bridge distresses images were used. The lightweight models MobileNet and MobileNet-SSD were employed to conduct 6 comparative experiments for exploring the model performance with different transfer learning modes (Mode I and II) and procedures (one-step and two-step procedure) in classification and detection tasks. Based on the comparison of the results, the optimum model for two tasks was respectively recognized. For classification task, the model directly transferred specific parameters of partial convolution layers from ImageNet-based model achieved the highest accuracy of 97.8%. For detection task, the two-step transfer learning model using an intermediate transfer learning step trained by DDAP reached a mean average precision of 87.16%. The proposed approach has the application potential for practical road inspection work in intelligent transportation infrastructure maintenance.},

The heterogeneous interconnections are required for uninterrupted resource sharing. Spontaneous resource availability due to vehicle speed and infrastructure connectivity disturb prompt service utilization. In this manuscript, a Permissible Service Selection and Allocation (PSSA) method is proposed to address spontaneous issues in vehicular communication and connection. This method considers vehicle displacement and minimum interconnection factors in accessing a cloud service. Both factors and their balancing impact are analyzed throughout the vehicle’s service requesting interval. In this process, random forest learning is induced to identify the balancing factors’ adjustments. The service access is probed through the active infrastructure based on the balancing factor. The ordering process of the learning intervals provides ease of service selection and allocation. In this process, reallocation is not preferred due to the random displacement of the vehicles. Therefore, the interval dropouts are reduced in both handoff and non-handoff communication scenarios. Further metrics such as service ratio, delay, and connectivity are used in validating the proposed method’s performance.},

This paper proposes an IoT positioning technology based intelligent delivery system by introducing blockchain system and location information encryption, which overcomes three fatal problems of traditional IoT positioning technology based system: different party shares all information, location information interaction is too exposed and the system is unattractive to recipients. A set of analysis with real case experiment about efficiency improvement, incentive effect and security are conducted to validate the robustness of the system. Compared with previous research, the proposed system not only has high accuracy by utilizing real-time location information instead of unreliable prediction results, but also possesses high security.},

  abstract     = {Wheelset fault detection with high accuracy is challenging due to poor image quality. Specifically, the wheelset images are collected dynamically outdoors and suffer from diffuse reflection and environmental interference. Thus, the images contain light stripe adhesions (light flairs) and local fractures to be inpainted. The existing inpainting models are inapplicable to restore grayscale wheelset images. They are also too heavy to be deployed in an embedded wheelset monitoring equipment. In this paper, we propose a lightweight high-precision inpainting model that consists of a recurrent similarity network with the ghost convolution (RSG-Net) to remove light flairs and repair local fractures. RSG-Net replaces standard Pconv (partial convolutional) layers with soft-coding ones that can improve the feature representational ability. To reduce the influence of the background region features on image restoration, an asymmetrical similarity measure is designed to calculate not only the angle difference between the target and the source feature vectors but also the activation of the source ones. The multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) loss term is introduced to precisely guide the structural information restoration, such as the stripe edges. Moreover, the ghost convolution is introduced in RSG-Net to realize the model compression that can retain the core features of wheelset images and remove the redundant features. We conduct three groups of experiments that demonstrate the accuracy superiority of the proposed RSG-Net over the baseline methods, and the number of parameters is reduced by about 50%.},

MeTS-10 features traffic speed information at all street levels from main arterials to local streets for Antwerp, Bangkok, Barcelona, Berlin, Chicago, Istanbul, London, Madrid, Melbourne, and Moscow. The dataset leverages the industrial-scale floating vehicle Traffic4cast data with speeds and vehicle counts provided in a privacy-preserving spatio-temporal aggregation. We detail the efficient matching approach mapping the data to the OpenStreetMap (OSM) road graph. We evaluate the dataset by comparing it with publicly available stationary vehicle detector data (for Berlin, London, and Madrid) and the Uber traffic speed dataset (for Barcelona, Berlin, and London). The comparison highlights the differences across datasets in spatio-temporal coverage and variations in the reported traffic caused by the binning method. MeTS-10 enables novel, city-wide analysis of mobility and traffic patterns for ten major world cities, overcoming current limitations of spatially sparse vehicle detector data. The large spatial and temporal coverage offers an opportunity for joining the MeTS-10 with other datasets, such as traffic surveys in traffic planning studies or vehicle detector data in traffic control settings.},

  abstract     = {Motion prediction modules are crucial for autonomous vehicles to forecast the future behavior of surrounding road users. Failures in prediction modules can mislead a downstream planner to make unsafe decisions. Currently, deep learning technology has been widely used to design prediction models due to its impressive performance. However, such models may fail in long-tail driving scenarios where the training data are insufficient or unavailable, which represents the so-called epistemic uncertainty of prediction models. This paper proposes a risk-aware decision-making (RADM) framework to handle the epistemic uncertainty arising from training the prediction model on insufficient data. First, a multi-agent prediction network with epistemic uncertainty quantification is proposed. This network uses the historical states of nearby road users, map information, and traffic lights as inputs. Then, the RADM utilizes model predictive control technique to not only process the multi-agent prediction results but also to consider the epistemic uncertainty of the prediction model. In addition, the accuracy of the established prediction model is verified on real-world driving datasets. Furthermore, the proposed RADM is evaluated on the log-replay data obtained from real-world driving logs and using the SUMO simulator, considering multiple challenging cases where pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles cross the intersection illegally. The experimental results demonstrate that RADM can reduce the driving risk and improve driving safety and supplementary videos are provided at https://github.com/SOTIF-AVLab/RADM .},

  abstract     = {An efficient operation of the electric shared mobility system (ESMS) relies heavily on seamless interconnections among shared electric vehicles (SEV), electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), and the grid. Nevertheless, this interconnectivity also makes the ESMS vulnerable to cyberattacks that may cause short-term breakdowns or long-term degradation of the ESMS. This study focuses on one such attack with long-lasting effects, the Delayed Charge Attack (DCA), that stealthily delays the charging service by exploiting the physical and communication vulnerabilities. To begin, we present the ESMS threat model by highlighting the assets, information flow, and access points. We next identify a linked sequence of vulnerabilities as a viable attack vector for launching DCA. Then, we detail the implementation of DCA, which can effectively bypass the detection in the SEV’s battery management system and the cross-verification in the cloud environment. We test the DCA model against various Anomaly Detection (AD) algorithms by simulating the DCA dynamics in a Susceptible-Infectious-Removed-Susceptible process, where the EVSE can be compromised by the DCA or detected for repair. Using real-world taxi trip data and EVSE locations in New York City, the DCA model allows us to explore the long-term impacts and validate the system consequences. The results show that a 10-min delay results in 12-min longer queuing times and 8% more unfulfilled requests, leading to a 10.7% ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\$ $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; 311.7) weekly revenue loss per driver.

  abstract     = {The automatic identification system (AIS) and video cameras have been widely exploited for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways. The AIS data could provide vessel identity and dynamic information on vessel position and movements. In contrast, the video data could describe the visual appearances of moving vessels without knowing the information on identity, position, movements, etc. To further improve vessel traffic surveillance, it becomes necessary to fuse the AIS and video data to simultaneously capture the visual features, identity, and dynamic information for the vessels of interest. However, the performance of AIS and video data fusion is susceptible to issues such as data spatial difference, message asynchronous transmission, visual object occlusion, etc. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based simple online and real-time vessel data fusion method (termed DeepSORVF). We first extract the AIS- and video-based vessel trajectories, and then propose an asynchronous trajectory matching method to fuse the AIS-based vessel information with the corresponding visual targets. In addition, by combining the AIS- and video-based movement features, we also present a prior knowledge-driven anti-occlusion method to yield accurate and robust vessel tracking results under occlusion conditions. To validate the efficacy of our DeepSORVF, we have also constructed a new benchmark dataset (termed FVessel) for vessel detection, tracking, and data fusion. It consists of many videos and the corresponding AIS data collected in various weather conditions and locations. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method is capable of guaranteeing high-reliable data fusion and anti-occlusion vessel tracking. The DeepSORVF code and FVessel dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/gy65896/DeepSORVF and https://github.com/gy65896/FVessel , respectively.},

  abstract     = {Lane detection is critical for intelligent vehicles to sense drivable areas. Compared to general objects, lane lines are slender-shaped, easily occluded, or defaced. Therefore, the lane detection network requires a more robust ability for local detail extraction and global semantic information modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel lane detection network (FLAMNet) with a flexible line anchor mechanism, which constantly corrects the position of line anchors to improve detection performance and computational efficiency. Specifically, we utilize the Patch Pooling Aggregation Module (PPAM) to aggregate multi-scale semantic features extracted by the backbone network. The multi-scale features are subsequently inputted into DSAformer, which utilizes decomposed self-attention to establish global long-distance dependencies. The detection head leverages fused features of multi-scale global and local details to accurately fit the lane line by correcting the anchor position. Moreover, we propose the Horizontal Information Aggregation Module (HIAM) to expand the receptive field of line anchors horizontally, enhancing the line anchor representation ability to the topological structure of complex lane lines. The experimental results on mainstream lane detection benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed FLAMNet outperforms existing methods. We have uploaded the code and demo of FLAMNet on GitHub at: https://github.com/RanHao-cq/FLAMNet .},

  abstract     = {Cooperative trajectory planning of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) generally admits strong nonlinearity and non-convexity, rendering great difficulties in finding the optimal solution. Existing methods typically suffer from low computational efficiency and poor scalability, which hinder the appropriate applications in large-scale scenarios involving an increasing number of vehicles. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel decentralized iterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR) algorithm by leveraging the dual consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). First, the original non-convex optimization problem is reformulated into a series of convex optimization problems through iterative neighbourhood approximation. Then, the dual of each convex optimization problem is shown to have a consensus structure, which facilitates the use of consensus ADMM to solve for the dual solution in a fully decentralized and parallel architecture. Finally, the primal solution corresponding to the trajectory of each vehicle is recovered by solving a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem iteratively, and a novel trajectory update strategy is proposed to ensure the dynamic feasibility of vehicles. With the proposed development, the computation burden is significantly alleviated such that real-time performance is attainable. Two traffic scenarios are presented to validate the proposed algorithm, and thorough comparisons between our proposed method and baseline methods (including centralized iLQR, IPOPT, and SQP) are conducted to demonstrate the scalability of the proposed approach.},

Considering the inherent difference of different traffic risks, the risk quantification and standardization is conducted first. Then several risk field models are constructed to quantify the impacts of multi-source traffic risk superposition on mega-events. Then a time-series generative adversarial networks (TimeGAN) is used to predict the evolution of superposition risk. We select 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics as a case to explore the superposition effects of different traffic risks on the convoy entrance of this mega-event. The results illustrate the superposition risks are significantly associated with the strength of each traffic risk, and the distance from the traffic risk location to the convoy entrance. Furthermore, the temporal evolutions for different traffic risks and their superposition are forecasted using TimeGAN. The results show the unexpected traffic congestion risk presents the highest predictive performance (i.e., the average error for RMSE, MAE, and MSE is 0.135%) and the superposition traffic risks present the lowest predictive performance (the average error is 0.536%). Comparison between different methods demonstrates TimeGAN outperforms other methods in predicting both single traffic risks and superposition risks.

This paper assesses the energy footprint of commercially implemented adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems and human drivers in car-following formation via different models using empirical observations on very similar driving cycles and/or routes. Most importantly, it initiates a critical discussion of the findings under the behavioral properties of each mode. Findings show that: ACC systems propagate an increasing energy consumption upstream, while human drivers do not; they succeed in maintaining a constant time-headway policy, operating very reliably; they develop a strong bond with their leader compared to their human counterparts; the two modes (humans and ACCs) are operating in different phase-space areas with room for improvement. Overall, findings show that ACC systems must be optimized to achieve a trade-off between functional requirements and eco-driving instructions.},

We evaluate the proposed method on a level-2 AV to perceive the interactive vehicles at unsignalized intersections. Using Extended Kalman Filter, the trajectory of the human drivers’ gaze and the anchor boxes from AV object detection are fused. Results reveal that with human-vehicle visual fusion, the actual trajectory of interactive vehicles can be predicted more accurately than separately using human gaze or object detection algorithm. The findings show that human-vehicle visual fusion improves the perception accuracy and robustness of interactive objects in complex traffic environment. The method has the potential to enhance the attention mechanism of AV vision.},

  abstract     = {Drillships and semi-submersible platforms (SSPs) are used for oil and gas offshore exploration and production activities in seas deeper than 300 meters. These SSPs must be maintained in a predefined position at a predetermined location to complete their offshore tasks. They must have a way to generate forces and angular momentum to balance out external factors (wind, currents, and waves). Actually, the offshore support vessel (OSV) is assisted by dynamic positioning systems (DPSs) in all of its operations, including transit, survival, and station maintenance, and there are significant differences in propulsion systems. In this paper, we suggested a path planning robust adaptive fuzzy-free fault-tolerant control (RAFFFTC) for SSPs with actuator constraints to improve the robust performance and quality of the control system. Accordingly, the adaptive fuzzy controller with adaptive law has been created to change the membership function of the fuzzy controller, and the Lyapunov theory for system stability analysis has been used to illustrate the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$H_{\infty} $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; performance of robust tracking, reduced errors in the path planning control of the SSP in the cases of thrusters and disturbance-free fault-tolerant.

Deep learning has shown promise in computer vision for pixel-wise crack detection, but existing methods still suffer from limitations such as information loss, insufficient feature fusion, and semantic gap issues. To address these challenges, a novel pavement crack segmentation network, called PAF-Net, is proposed, which incorporates progressive and adaptive feature fusion. To mitigate information loss caused by feature downsampling, a progressive context fusion (PCF) block is introduced to capture context information from adjacent scales. To better capture strong features from local regions, a dual attention (DA) block is proposed that leverages both global and local context information, reducing the semantic gap issue. Furthermore, to achieve effective multi-scale feature fusion, a dynamic weight learning (DWL) block is proposed that enables efficient fusion of feature maps from different network layers. Additionally, a multi-scale input unit is incorporated to provide the proposed segmentation network with more contextual information. To evaluate the performance of PAF-Net, we conduct experiments using four common evaluation metrics and compare it with multiple mainstream segmentation models on three public datasets. The proposed PAF-Net demonstrates superior segmentation accuracy for pixel-level crack detection compared to other segmentation models, as evident from qualitative and quantitative experimental results.},

  abstract     = {The advanced 5G and mobile edge computing promote the development of the intelligent high-speed railway and enable computing-intensive and latency-sensitive tasks. Mobile edge computing can effectively release the pressure of tasks on on-board computing resources by migrating communication, computing, and storage to edge servers. However, the fluctuation of data transmission and task processing duration exists in practical projects. The current work assumes that the traditional communication model is ideal and that the latency can be derived as a fixed value, which is the most conservative bound. Obviously, there will be some system performance loss because the transmission latency is usually much shorter than this conservative bound. Therefore, an offloading strategy is proposed to maximize the task completion rate, considering the fluctuation of transmission latency and processing time in this paper. First, the stochastic network calculus is adopted to evaluate the fluctuation and probability of the transmission latency. Additionally, the task processing duration is regarded as an exponential distribution that is affected by the computing resource. Then, the task offloading model is generated based on the potential game to maximize the task completion rate. Moreover, the Nash Equilibrium and best response are derived. A reinforcement learning algorithm combined with a game is proposed to reach the Nash Equilibrium and obtain the task offloading strategy. Finally, extensive theoretical analysis and simulations are illustrated to prove the effectiveness of the model.},

Parallel computing is introduced with synchronous updates, task division and multiprocessing calculation mechanisms. The movement model is split into the smallest and independent computational units. The field model for simulating the crowd movement has also been improved in terms of weighted multi-direction choice and multi-field environment division. The experiments confirmed that the parallel synchronous algorithm has a significant advantage at the computational scale of more than 10,000 pedestrians. The speedup ratio of the parallel approach can be more than 5 times when simulating one million pedestrians. This framework can help to establish the essential methods for multi-modal transportation systems that require fast simulations for a large-scale crowd. It would also help future digital twin systems to evaluate and validate any potential management strategies when applied in metro stations, railway stations, and other transportation hubs.},

  abstract     = {Camera image simulation is integral to the virtual validation of autonomous vehicles and robots that use visual perception to understand their environment. It also has applications in creating image datasets for training learning-based vision models. As camera image simulation takes into account a wide variety of external and internal parameters, achieving a high-fidelity simulation is a computationally expensive process. Recently, several neural network-based techniques have been proposed to reduce the computational complexity of image rendering, a critical element of the camera simulation pipeline. However, the existing methods are tailored for monocular camera images and are not optimised for stereo images, which are widely used in autonomous driving applications. To address this, we propose a technique based on Stereo Super Resolution (SSR) to speed up the simulation of stereo images. The proposed method first simulates stereo images at a lower resolution, then super-resolves them to their original resolution using our introduced SSR model, ETSSR. We evaluated the performance of our technique using the CARLA driving simulator and created our own synthetic dataset for training ETSSR. The evaluations indicate that our approach can speed up stereo image simulation by a factor of up to 2.57 over various resolutions. Moreover, it shows that our ETSSR achieves on-par or superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art models, using significantly fewer parameters and FLOPs. We have made our source code and dataset available at https://github.com/hamedhaghighi/ETSSR .},

  abstract     = {With the burgeoning of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), as well as the emergence of fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) and plug-in hybrid electricity/hydrogen vehicles (PH2EVs), the synergistic effect of electricity, hydrogen, and transportation networks should be investigated. To enhance the security of the coupled network and ensure the reliability of the charging/refueling services of EVs, a vulnerability assessment is required to assist in system contingency planning as well as post-contingency measures. In this paper, a vulnerability assessment strategy is formulated for coupled transportation and multi-energy networks. First, a novel graph representation for the coupled transportation and multi-energy networks is proposed. Then, a critical asset identification tool is applied to find the vulnerability point of the coupled networks, and the transfer margin ratio (TMR) is put forward to assess the dynamic vulnerability level under cascading contingencies. Finally, a vulnerability envelope (the lower bound and upper bound of vulnerability) is found based on a bi-level optimization problem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, case studies are performed on the IEEE 39-bus electricity network coupled with a 25-node transportation network and a 50-node hydrogen/gas network. It is verified that the vulnerable point of the coupled network can be found. Besides, it is concluded that the penetration of FCVs and PH2EVs can enhance energy flexibility through the energy substitution effect and thus mitigate the system vulnerability.},

  abstract     = {Railway turnout is the key infrastructure for trains to change their routes. In order to ensure the smoothness and safety of the train’s passing through turnouts, the insufficient displacement (ID) of switch rails after their conversions must be controlled within a permitted range. During design stage, it is quite important for the reduction of the ID to reasonably arrange the tractive points. In the existing literature, a feasible tractive layout is commonly suggested through the manual analysis using the finite element model of the switch rail. However, as the design space may explode for long rails with multiple tractive points, it is time-consuming for such labor-intensive methods to search a feasible tractive layout, and the result may be non-optimal. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an efficient method to arrange the tractive points optimally in order to minimize the ID. To this end, we propose a physics-informed optimization method for the design of the tractive layout. First, a tailored direct stiffness method is introduced to accurately estimate the ID given any tractive layout and frictions. On this basis, we establish an optimization model for the selection of the tractive locations with the objective of minimizing the expectation of the ID. To address the sparsity issue of the decision variable, an Encoding Rule with a hierarchical indexing method is proposed to improve the efficiency of genetic algorithm. Next, the number of tractive points is determined. Finally, several sets of experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which decreases the ID by 25.61% and 12.7% in terms of the maximal and mean values for the case with the switch of length 44.1m.},

The time modulated antenna arrays are first introduced into the positioning system, avoiding mutual coupling between antennas and greatly reducing the hardware cost of the vehicle terminal. The auxiliary positioning framework for the smart vehicle is advocated in conjunction with existing radio frequency signals. To take full advantage of the multiple auxiliary sources around the road net, Doppler shifts embedded into the received signals are unearthed, and a smoothed block sparse reconstruction is developed for directly locating the vehicle, providing significant enhancements of degrees of freedom and the localization accuracy. Additionally, the proposed direct localization method is robust to multichannel gain and phase mismatch in practice, and the array perturbations can be estimated and compensated without any calibration source. Extensive simulation results corroborate that the proposed system and method achieves superior localization accuracy (approximately 0.22 m error at SNR of 10 dB), outperforming its state-of-the-art counterparts.},

This study proposes a dynamic speed control system for a two-lane scenario to reduce collision risks near freeway bottlenecks for mixed traffic flow, consisting of both CAVs and human driven vehicles (HDVs). The control system includes two major strategies, the dynamic deceleration strategy and uniform lane-changing strategy. The core idea of dynamic deceleration is to command the CAVs to slow down proactively and form moving barriers to guide the following HDVs to slow down before the bottleneck. The establishment of uniform lane-changing strategy aims to improve the uniform coefficient of CAVs for each lane in the mixed traffic flow, and three different solving methods are applied for uniform lane-changing strategy to further improve safety. Simulation experiments are designed, and the performance of the system is investigated in terms of its safety and efficiency. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out on the length of the area where uniform lane-changing strategy is implemented. The results indicate that: (1) dynamic deceleration strategy based on CAVs can effectively reduce collision risks; and (2) the uniform lane-changing strategy can further improve the performance of the dynamic deceleration strategy.},

  abstract     = {Recently, deploying sensors such as LiDARs on the roadside to monitor the passing traffic and assist autonomous vehicle perception has become popular. However, unlike autonomous vehicle systems, roadside sensor systems involve sensors from different subsystems, resulting in a lack of synchronization in both time and space between the sensors. Calibration is a critical technology that enables the central server to fuse data generated by different location infrastructures, which vastly improves sensing range and detection robustness. Regrettably, existing calibration algorithms frequently assume that LiDARs have significant overlap or that temporal calibration has already been achieved. However, since these assumptions do not always hold in real-world scenarios, the calibration results obtained from existing algorithms are frequently unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose TrajMatch - the first system that can automatically calibrate roadside LiDARs in both time and space. The main idea is to automatically calibrate the sensors based on the result of the detection/tracking task, rather than relying on extracting special features. Furthermore, we propose a novel mechanism for evaluating calibration parameters that align with our algorithm, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments. This mechanism can also guide parameter iterations for multiple calibrations, further enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of our calibration method. Finally, to evaluate the performance of TrajMatch, we collected two datasets, one simulated dataset LiDARnet-sim 1.0 and one real-world dataset. The experimental results show that TrajMatch can achieve a spatial calibration error of less than &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$10cm$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; and a temporal calibration error of less than &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$1.5ms$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; .},

Besides, four payoff indicators and personalized payoff function are designed with the consideration of driving efficiency, safety and comfort requirement. The advantage of proposed method is that it not only reduces the complexity of game mode and improves the effectiveness at the same time, but also fully considers the personalized driving preferences to realize human-like driving and personalized decision while the existing methods usually neglect the difference among the drivers and its influence. Five different typical scenarios at the unsignalized intersection are given under co-simulation environment of Matlab and Prescan.

However, the rapid variation of channel brings great challenges to channel estimation of V2V communication. In recent years, the channel estimation based on deep learning can learn the nonlinear characteristics of the channel, while requires a large amount of training data, which cannot guarantee the low latency data processing. Addressing this challenge, machine learning algorithm including sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) and Gaussian process regression (GPR), are proposed to accurately estimate V2V channel, so as to ensure the low complexity of real-time computation and greatly improve the reliability of system transmission. Our algorithm consists of two stages: 1) For pilot symbols, the channel estimation is converted into sparse basis coefficients recovery problem by basis expansion model (BEM), and then a sparse prior-based SBL (SP-SBL) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. 2) The estimated pilot is used as the training set of GPR, and the Bessel function reflecting channel correlation is designed as the kernel function to accurately track the channel. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the deep learning based channel estimation algorithm, which ensures the URLLC of NR-V2V data transmission.},

A hierarchical block algorithm is employed to identify areas in the environment where UGV formations can spread out to meet time and budget constraints. Additionally, we introduce a novel control scheme that allows each UGV to generate a local steering force to dodge any static and mobile obstacles based on the closest safe angle. Results from simulations and real UGV experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a higher coverage percentage than rule-based and reactive swarming approaches without planning.

Then, we apply the protocols to construct a privacy-preserving distributed ORH matching scheme named pdRide. Geographically distributed road-side unit (RSU) and computation service provider (CSP) collaborate to securely select the matching driver for the requesting rider within a range. Specifically, SESDC can effective calculate the Euclidean square distances between multiple drivers and requesting rider over the encrypted location information with different keys. SMDS can select the driver with the minimum distance for the requesting rider on the encrypted distances.

In this way, the behavior can be better interpreted and predicted by other traffic participants, in order to prevent misunderstanding, and in the worst case, accidents. With this purpose, more and more human-driven trajectories in real traffic are recorded, making it possible to learn human-like driving styles. In this paper, we extend our previous behavior cloning approach, which has been successfully applied to highway driving, to generate high-level decisions for unsignalized intersections that are challenging during urban driving. Unlike many other approaches that utilize neural networks, either for end-to-end behavior cloning or for approximating Q-functions in reinforcement learning, where their decisions are intractable to understand, the output decisions of our approach are interpretable and easy to track. Meanwhile, the driving decisions are provably safe under reasonable assumptions by generalizing the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) concept to complex intersections. Simulation evaluations show that our learned policy produces a more human-like behavior, and meanwhile, balances driving efficiency, comfort, perceived safety, and politeness better.},

To understand the benefits of CAVs on traffic incidents, this paper models the impacts of CAVs with joint consideration of microscopic CAV driving behaviors and macroscopic traffic assignment in mixed traffic environment comprising both CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Firstly, a generic traffic assignment model with mixed traffic is proposed to analyze the mixed traffic process from the macroscopic perspective. Then, we incorporate the traffic assignment model with bottleneck delays and incident effects from the microscopic perspective, to model the dynamic road system with incident effects in mixed traffic environment. Furthermore, cooperating with the mixed traffic assignment model, dynamic signal control policies are presented according to different incident severities, and the conditions for equilibrium existence, uniqueness and stability of the road system are derived. The analytical results indicate that road system stability with incident effects is closely related to the incident severity, signal control policy as well as penetration rate and spatial distribution of CAVs. Finally, simulation results are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed incident management policy in improving the recovery rate and system stability of road networks.},

  abstract     = {Reasonable planning of passenger evacuation routes can directly improve evacuation efficiency in the metro station. Considering the effect of traffic capacity at the node such as gate and stair/escalator, a multi-objective optimization model aimed at minimizing the maximum evacuation time of heterogeneous passengers in different segmentation areas is established, which achieves local optimization on the basis of global optimization of the evacuation route. Node traffic capacity is assessed based on the combination of BP neural network and atomic orbital search algorithm, which is conducive to improving the calculation accuracy of total evacuation time. The simulation results indicate that the performance of the established prediction model of node travel time is good, and the mean square error can be as low as 0.2555. Meanwhile, the proposed route strategy can improve the overall evacuation efficiency by 21.85%, and passengers’ choices of evacuation routes are more reasonable. The sensitivity analysis of factors affecting evacuation through a random forest algorithm shows that the number of passengers with person attribute E has the greatest impact on evacuation time, which should be the focus of attention in the evacuation process.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) is a critical task in intelligent transportation, aiming to match vehicle images of the same identity captured by non-overlapping cameras. However, it is difficult to achieve satisfactory results based on RGB images alone in darkness. Therefore, it is of great importance to consider multi-modality vehicle re-identification. Currently, the proposed works deal with different modality features through direct summation and fusion based on heat map, which however ignores the relationship between them. Meanwhile, there is a huge gap between the different modalities, which needs to be reduced. In this paper, to solve the above two problems, we propose a Graph-based Progressive Fusion Network (GPFNet) using a graph convolutional network to adaptively fuse multi-modality features in an end-to-end learning framework. GPFNet consists of a CNN feature extraction module (FEM), a GCN feature fusion module (FFM), and a loss function module (LFM). Firstly, in FEM, we employ a multi-stream network architecture to extract single-modality features and common-modality features and employ a random modality substitution module to extract mixed-modality features. Secondly, in FFM, we design an efficient graph structure to associate the features of different modalities and adopt a progressive two-stage strategy to fuse them. Finally, in LFM, we use GCN-aware multi-modality loss to constrain the features. For reducing modality differences and contributing better initial mixed-modality features to FFM, we propose random modality substitution as a data enhancement method for multi-modality datasets. Extensive experiments on multi-modality vehicle Re-ID datasets RGBN300 and RGBNT100 show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

Therefore, fault detection (FD) of incipient faults is a challenge. This paper proposes a new FD scheme using a novel manifold learning method named local linear generalized autoencoder (LLGAE). The prominent characteristics of the LLGAE-based FD method are three-fold: 1) it can realize FD for electric drive systems even without the physical model or expertise; 2) it still has good results for non-Gaussian electrical drives; 3) it entirely takes into account the locally linear structure of samples. Mathematical derivations have proved the proposed method. Through an experimental platform of high-speed trains, the proposed method is validated.},

  abstract     = {Contemporary vehicles have undergone numerous transformations to become fully computerized machines. This computerizing process is intended to provide safety and convenience for drivers; however, there have been many studies demonstrating how to remotely maneuver a vehicle by compromising its in-vehicle electronic control units (ECU). As a countermeasure, automotive intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have also been extensively explored as potential remedies. The clock-based IDS was one of the most promising methods for an automotive IDS, but researchers have recently determined it to be insufficient, as adversaries can emulate the clock skew. In this paper, we propose a novel automotive IDS that leverages the residuals—which have traditionally been considered an error that should be removed from analysis—of average and actual timestamp intervals of two consecutive controller area network (CAN) messages. Thus, we present a rationale as to why large residuals occur in a real in-vehicle CAN network. Our method analyzes transmission periodicity so closely that any minuscule change can be detected in the event of an intrusion. We show that our method detects a vehicle intrusion with a low false-alarm rate, and that it can detect a new sophisticated attack which emulates the clock skew of an original transmission. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach analyzing transmission time to detect the frequency masquerading attack with clock skew emulation. Finally, our method enables the sharing of parameters determined in a vehicle with other like models, which is meaningful for manufacturers in terms of scalability.},

A conventional approach in line with the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) principle is introduced, following the generation of two types of flight plans (i.e., linear and area operations) with uncertainty buffers further taken into account. This approach is based on iteratively checking the availability of the shared airspace volumes. Next, an optimisation model is formulated, using the same common airspace representation, aiming at minimising the overall delay and deviation to the equivalent FCFS solution (i.e., fairness concern), subject to operational constraints including a time-based separation minima. Some potential implementations are also envisioned for the optimisation model under plausible operational scenarios. Finally, simulation experiments are performed where five case studies are designed, including FCFS and optimisation, as well as their hybrid and batch uses depending on the flight plan submission time. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the impact of some specific model assumptions. Results suggest that, compared to FCFS, a notable delay reduction can be achieved with optimisation incorporated, which is due to the FCFS prioritisation scheme that is often not efficient.},

  abstract     = {To improve the routing decisions of individual drivers and the management policies designed by traffic operators, one needs reliable estimates of travel time distributions. Since congestion caused by both recurrent patterns (e.g., rush hours) and non-recurrent events (e.g., traffic incidents) leads to potentially substantial delays in highway travel times, we focus on a framework capable of incorporating both effects. To this end, we propose to work with the Markovian velocity model, based on an environmental background process that tracks both random and (semi-)predictable events affecting the vehicle speeds in a highway network. We show how to operationalize this flexible data-driven model in order to obtain the travel time distribution for a vehicle departing at a known day and time to traverse a given path. Specifically, we detail how to structure the background process and set the speed levels corresponding to the different states of this process. First, for the inclusion of non-recurrent events, we study incident data to describe the random durations of the incident and inter-incident times for different periods of day. Second, for an estimation of the speed patterns in both incident and inter-incident regime, loop detector data for each of these periods is studied. In numerical examples that use road network detector data of the Dutch highway network, we obtain the travel time distribution estimates that arise under different traffic regimes, and illustrate the advantages compared to deterministic travel time prediction methods, or methods that only take recurrent patterns into account.},

  abstract     = {The logistics industry is a major source of global carbon emissions and energy consumption. Cooperative logistics and split delivery are effective methods for reducing carbon emissions and improving distribution efficiency, respectively. However, prior research on pollution routing problems (PRP) has primarily focused on centralized cooperation and has not fully explored the potential of split delivery as a strategy for addressing PRPs. This study fills this gap by integrating decentralised cooperation and split delivery to the PRP domain, offering an innovative approach to the problem. A bi-objective mixed integer linear PRP model with split delivery and request selection is put forward for the problem.

Nonetheless, their training time, sample efficiency and the feasibility of the learnt behaviors remain key concerns. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning-based decision-making architecture for learning left-turn policies at unsignalized intersections with feasibility guarantees. The proposed technique is comprised of two layers; a high-level learning-based behavioral planning layer which adopts soft actor-critic (SAC) principles to learn high-level, non-conservative yet safe, driving behaviors, and a low-level motion planning layer that uses Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to ensure feasibility of the two-dimensional left-turn maneuver. The high-level layer generates reference signals of velocity and yaw angles for the ego vehicle taking into account safety and collision avoidance with the intersection vehicles, whereas the low-level motion planning layer solves an optimization problem to track these reference commands taking into account several vehicle dynamic constraints and ride comfort. While training the behavioral SAC-based planning layer, We develop an adaptive entropy regularization technique that results in faster convergence, higher mean rewards, and lower collision rates. We validate the proposed decision-making scheme in simulated environments and compare with other model free Reinforcement Learning (RL) baselines. The results demonstrate that the proposed integrated framework possesses better training and navigation capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Oil is of great significance in the key components like the hydraulic damper of high-speed trains and its leaks suggest that some key components may malfunction, bringing potential danger to the safety of the train. It is indispensable to diagnose oil leakage timely and faults can be discovered by detecting oil stains to avoid possible accidents caused by the breakdown. But it is challenging to discover the oil stains due to their irregularity of shape and diversity of size in complex environments. To deal with these intractable problems, we propose the Multifaceted Feature Aggregation Network (MFANet) which is composed of Multifaceted Refinement Feature (MRF) module, Cross Layer Feature Attention (CLFA) module, and Cross Layer Feature Enhancement (CLFE) module. The MRF solves the limitation of the single convolution method’s inability to catch changeable oil stains better and captures more expressive features. The CLFA and the CLFE obtain richer information and compensate for the shortcomings of insufficient information on single-layer features. Furthermore, we propose a loss function to guide the learning of our network in the case of the unbalanced dataset, which surpasses the useful Binary Cross-entropy loss. We conduct experiments based on four widely used backbone networks and achieve cutting-edge performance with fewer FLOPs and Parameters compared with many advanced methods. In addition, we perform our MFANet on several challenging saliency detection datasets, the rail surface defects detection dataset, and the COCO-Stuff segmentation dataset, which outperforms some progressive approaches and demonstrates powerful generalization capability and adaptation.},

  abstract     = {Real-time machine learning object detection algorithms are often found within autonomous vehicle technology and depend on quality datasets. It is essential that these algorithms work correctly in everyday conditions as well as under strong sun glare. Reports indicate glare is one of the two most prominent environment-related reasons for crashes. However, existing datasets, such as the Laboratory for Intelligent &amp; Safe Automobiles Traffic Sign (LISA) Dataset and the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark, do not reflect the existence of sun glare at all. This paper presents the GLARE (GLARE is available at: https://github.com/NicholasCG/GLARE_Dataset ) traffic sign dataset: a collection of images with U.S-based traffic signs under heavy visual interference by sunlight. GLARE contains 2,157 images of traffic signs with sun glare, pulled from 33 videos of dashcam footage of roads in the United States. It provides an essential enrichment to the widely used LISA Traffic Sign dataset. Our experimental study shows that although several state-of-the-art baseline architectures have demonstrated good performance on traffic sign detection in conditions without sun glare in the past, they performed poorly when tested against GLARE (e.g., average mAP0.5:0.95 of 19.4). We also notice that current architectures have better detection when trained on images of traffic signs in sun glare performance (e.g., average mAP0.5:0.95 of 39.6), and perform best when trained on a mixture of conditions (e.g., average mAP0.5:0.95 of 42.3).},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian detection remains a crucial technology for applications such as autonomous driving and gait recognition and continues to be a prominent research area. Despite the development of advanced pedestrian detection techniques, the challenge of detecting pedestrians in low-resolution images persists in real-life scenarios where low-quality imaging devices are still in use. The objective of this study is to enhance the detection of pedestrians in low-resolution (LR) images by improving image quality through super-resolution techniques. To achieve this goal, we propose an end-to-end Multi-scale Structure-Enhanced Super-Resolution (MsSE-SR) method to enlarge LR images into high-resolution (SR) images and utilize Yolov4 for detection, effectively addressing the issue of low detection performance in LR images. To generate an SR image that can accurately distinguish between foreground and background elements while emphasizing pedestrian characteristics, we employ the stationary wavelet transform (SWT) to decompose the image into low and high-frequency sub-images. These sub-images are then processed through different network structures, enabling the network to reconstruct high-frequency details and low-frequency structures with greater precision. Moreover, we propose a high-to-low subnetwork information transfer (H2LSnIT) that incorporates high-frequency edge information into the low-frequency image structure during the reconstruction process, leading to a more detailed reconstruction of the low-frequency structure. We also propose a novel loss function that leverages the characteristics of wavelet decomposition to enhance the network’s focus on reconstructing the image structure, further improving detection performance. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MsSE-SR method in significantly enhancing pedestrian detection performance.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle performance metrics analyze data sets consisting of subject vehicle’s interactions with other road users in a nominal driving environment and provide certain performance measures as outputs. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the vehicle safety performance metrics research dates back to at least 1967. To date, there still does not exist a community-wide accepted metric or a set of metrics for vehicle safety performance assessment and justification. This issue gets further amplified with the evolving interest in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and Automated Driving Systems. In this paper, the authors seek to perform a unified study that facilitates an improved community-wide understanding of vehicle performance metrics using the lead-vehicle interaction operational design domain as a common means of performance comparison. In particular, the authors study the diversity (including constructive formulation discrepancies and empirical performance differences) among 33 base metrics with up to 51 metric variants (with different choices of hyper-parameters) in the existing literature, published between 1967 and 2022. Two data sets are adopted for the empirical performance diversity analysis, including vehicle trajectories from normal highway driving environment and relatively high-risk incidents with collisions and near-miss cases. The analysis further implies that (i) the conceptual acceptance of a safety metric proposal can be problematic if the assumptions, conditions, and types of outcome assurance are not justified properly, and (ii) the empirical performance justification of an acceptable metric can also be problematic as a dominant consensus is not observed among metrics empirically.},

  abstract     = {A dual mode traction power supply system (TPSS), as a high-efficiency transportation approach, is composed of a mainline railway (AC traction power supply system) and an urban railway (DC traction power supply system). However, due to the neutral sections, the power from the two systems has been isolated, resulting in a low utilization rate of regenerative braking energy (RBE). The power flow from the two systems can not be managed cooperatively, causing high electricity bills. Therefore, this paper proposes a dual mode based energy router (DMER), which provides a path for energy interaction between two systems through multi-terminal converters. The proposed DMER integrates a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) and an energy feedback system (EFS) to recycle RBE. Moreover, a hierarchical control strategy is presented. The upper control layer is an optimized operation model, which takes the state of charge (SoC), energy conservation, and the other parameters as constraints to utilize more RBE and achieve the minimum daily operation cost of substations. The lower control layer identifies the control strategy for multiple converters to ensure the stable operation and dynamic response of DMER. Finally, the effectiveness of the topology and control strategy is verified using field load data and experiments.},

Sharing data among intelligent vehicles not only enriches vehicle services but also improves traffic safety and efficiency. However, due to the specific nature of vehicular networks, security and privacy concerns prevent data providers from participating in the data sharing process. In addition, the quality of the data shared in the vehicular network is uneven and unreliable, and the reliability and authenticity of data sharing need to be further improved. In this paper, we propose a novel consortium blockchain-based trust model in vehicular networks (COBATS) to achieve secure storage and data sharing. To improve the quality of data sharing, we also design a trust management model capable of filtering malicious recommendations, which reduces the hazard of malicious nodes and ensures high-quality data sharing among vehicles. Moreover, we present a consensus mechanism with joint Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) to reduce resource consumption and improve the algorithm’s efficiency. The simulation results show that COBATS can improve the security and quality of data sharing. Furthermore, our model also can effectively handle certain attacks.},

Since the driver’s reaction affects the surrounding traffic conditions, an analysis of the effects of the CV application is required in terms of traffic stream performance. This study compared the differences in driving behaviors of CVs depending on whether V2V-based forward collision warning information was provided. The driving characteristics of CVs based on the analysis of probe vehicle data (PVD) were defined, and a methodology was proposed to simulate the driving behaviors of CVs in VISSIM environments. Additionally, the effectiveness of improving mobility and traffic safety by various market penetration rates (MPRs) of CVs in an accident situation was identified by evaluating the average travel speed and time-to-collision (TTC)-based crash risk. The simulation results for the two-lane blocking accident scenario indicated that the average speed increased by 23.18% with an MPR of 100%, and the TTC-based crash risk decreased by 18.34% compared with an MPR of 0%. It has been demonstrated that V2V-based warning information is useful for not only safety benefits but also mobility improvement. The results of this study could be employed as fundamentals to establish various policies to expedite the implementation of CV systems in practice. In addition, it is suggested that the outcome of this study will be useful for developing traffic flow management strategies technology to improve traffic safety.},

  abstract     = {Understanding human drivers’ intentions and predicting their future motions are significant to connected and autonomous vehicles and traffic safety and surveillance systems. Predicting multimodal vehicular trajectories at urban unsignalized intersections remains challenging due to dynamic traffic flow and uncertainty of human drivers’ maneuvers. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive trajectory prediction framework that combines a multimodal trajectory generation network with inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and risk aversion (RA) modules. Specifically, we first construct a multimodal spatial-temporal Transformer network (mmSTTN) to generate multiple trajectory candidates, using trajectory coordinates as inputs. Accounting for spatio-temporal features, we formulate the IRL reward function for evaluating all candidate trajectories. The optimal trajectory is then selected based on the computed rewards, a process that mimics human drivers’ decision-making. We further develop the RA module based on the driving risk field for optimal risk-averse trajectory prediction. We conduct experiments and ablation studies using the inD dataset at an urban unsignalized intersection, demonstrating impressive human trajectory alignment, prediction accuracy, and the ability to generate risk-averse trajectories. Our proposed framework reduces prediction errors and driving risks by 25% and 30% compared to baseline methods. Results validate vehicles’ human-like risk-averse diverging-and-concentrating behavior as they traverse the intersection. The proposed framework presents a novel approach for forecasting multimodal vehicular trajectories by imitating human drivers and incorporating physics-based risk information derived from the driving field. This research offers a promising direction for enhancing the safety and efficiency of connected and autonomous vehicles navigating urban environments.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the scheduling problem of a fleet of electric vehicles, providing mobility as a service to a set of time-specified customers, where the operator needs to solve the routing and charging problem jointly for each EV. We consider incentive-aware customers and propose that the operator offers monetary incentives to customers in exchange for time flexibility. In this way, the fleet operator can arrive at a routing and charging schedule with lower costs, whilst the customers receive monetary compensation for their flexibility. Specifically, we first propose a bi-level optimization model whereby the fleet operator optimizes the routing and charging schedule accounting for the spatio-temporal varying charging price, jointly with a monetary incentive to reimburse the delivery time flexibility experienced by the customers. Concurrently the customers choose their own time flexibility by minimizing their cost. Second, we cope with the computational burden coming from this nonlinear bi-level optimization model with an accurate reformulation approach consisting of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions, a Big-M-based linearization method, and the zero duality gap of convex optimization problems. We thus convert the proposed problem into a single-level optimization problem, which can be solved by a strengthened generalized Benders decomposition method holding a faster convergence rate than the classic generalized Benders decomposition method. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mathematical model, we carry out numerous simulation experiments by using the VRP-REP data of Belgium. The numerical results showcase that the proposed mathematical model can reduce the delivery fees for the customers together with the cost of operation incurred by the fleet operator.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the reliable shortest path (RSP) problem in stochastic transportation networks. State-of-the-art RSP solutions usually target one specific RSP problem; moreover, the corresponding algorithm’s computational complexity scales at least linearly with the size of the underlying transportation network. While in this paper, we propose a graph embedding and deep distributional reinforcement learning (GE-DDRL) method, which serves as a universal and scale-free solution to the RSP problem. GE-DDRL uses deep distributional reinforcement learning (DDRL) to estimate the full travel-time distribution of a given routing policy, and improves the given routing policy with the generalized policy iteration (GPI) scheme. Further, in order to achieve the generalization ability to new destination nodes, we employ one of the canonical graph embedding techniques (Skip-Gram) to compress the nodes’ representation into &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$d$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -dimensional real-valued vectors. With the properly compressed node features, GE-DDRL is able to generalize its estimation of the routing policy’s travel-time distribution to untrained destination nodes, and hence achieve the ‘all-to-all’ navigation functionality. To the best of our knowledge, GE-DDRL serves as the first RSP planner, which applies simultaneously to almost all RSP objectives and in the meanwhile, is scale free with the size of the transportation network in terms of the online decision-making time and memory complexity. Experimental results and comparisons with state of the arts show the efficacy and efficiency of GE-DDRL in a range of transportation networks.},

  abstract     = {Noise barriers play a critical role in reducing noise and preventing foreign object from invading railway. Noise barrier structural defects such as rusted column, deteriorated mortar layer and other damages make its structure unstable, thereby threatening seriously railway operation safety. Unfortunately, existing noise barrier inspection methods still rely heavily on manual inspection, which are low-efficiency, subjective and difficult to detect the external structure of noise barriers. To solve these problems, this study proposes an automatic inspection manner for noise barrier using UAV images, and develops a fully convolutional network (FCN)-based noise barrier defect detection approach named skip connection YOLO detection network (SCYNet), which focuses on three aspects: network structure, loss function and data augmentation. First, a skip-connected feature structure Simi-BiFPN is incorporated into the network to fully fuse the features extracted from various scale layers without adding much computational overhead. Second, a NoiseIoU loss for bounding box regression is designed to improve existing IoU-based losses and get better performance on small dataset. Thirdly, a mixed sample data augmentation method named AutoFMix is proposed to eliminate the over-fitting issue caused by excessive similarity between samples, and further improve the detection accuracy. Finally, experiments conducted on the UAV railway noise barrier dataset show that the proposed SCYNet model achieves 92.2 mAP and 78.7 FPS, respectively, which outperform other models in terms of accuracy and processing speed. The fast-processing speed and high detection accuracy can quickly turn UAV images into useful information to assist railway maintenance, thereby improving the safety of train operation.},

However, LiDAR-camera fusion is non-trivial. An existing problem for this type of detector is that the scale and receptive field of LiDAR point features and image features are not matched, leading to information deficiency or redundancy in fusion. This paper proposes a Point-based Pyramid Attention Fusion (PPAF) module for LiDAR-camera fusion to solve the problem. The PPAF module learns corresponding image features of LiDAR points with a matched scale based on the image feature pyramid and attention mechanism for a better effect of fusion. Furthermore, based on the PPAF module, a new LiDAR-camera fusion-based 3D object detector named FS-Net is proposed, a two-stage detector with LiDAR voxel-based RPN and refinement network based on enriched LiDAR-camera features.

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicle (AV) platoons, especially those with the bidirectional communication topology, have significant practical value, as they not only increase link capacity and reduce vehicle energy consumption, but also reduce the consumption of communication resources. Small gaps between AVs in a platoon easily lead to emergency braking or even collisions between consecutive AVs. This paper applies barrier Lyapunov functions to collision avoidance between AVs in a bidirectional platoon during trajectory tracking. Based on backstepping technique, an adaptive collision-free platoon trajectory tracking control algorithm is developed to distributedly design control laws for each AV in the platoon. The control algorithm does not need to introduce additional car-following models to simulate AV driving, and only needs to integrate the position trajectories of consecutive AVs to avoid inter-vehicle collisions. Two sign functions are introduced into the control laws of each AV to ensure strong string stability for bidirectional AV platoons. Moreover, uncertainties and external disturbances in vehicle motion are effectively compensated by introducing adaptation laws. Strong string stability is rigorously proved. CarSIM-based comparison simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm in avoiding inter-vehicle collisions, compensating for uncertainties in vehicle motion, and suppressing the amplification of spacing errors along the platoon.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel hybrid rolling-horizon strategy to address the dynamic rebalancing problem in large-scale, free-floating bike-sharing systems (FFBSSs). The problem involves determining the rebalancing routes and the quantity of bikes to be loaded and unloaded at various locations to minimize vehicle rebalancing costs and to reduce the degree of imbalance in the system. The proposed strategy consists of two stages: a preplanning stage that solves the preplanned scheme based on the historical data, and a real-time stage that compute a dynamic rebalancing operation over a rolling horizon. We propose the candidate grid cell to decrease solution time and enhance solution quality in the real-time stage. The preplanned scheme is adjusted during the real-time stage to maintain its validity in dynamic environments. By controlling both temporal and spatial parameters, the approach achieves a balance between solution complexity and accuracy. A numerical study based on the Shanghai FFBSS demonstrates that the proposed strategy outperforms two existing methods in terms of solution quality and CPU time, highlighting its potential for effectively managing dynamic rebalancing in FFBSSs.},

  abstract     = {Traffic missing data imputation is a fundamental demand and crucial application for real-world intelligent transportation systems. The wide imputation methods in different missing patterns have demonstrated the superiority of tensor learning by effectively characterizing complex spatiotemporal correlations. However, interval-wise missing volume scenarios remain a challenging topic, in particular for long-term continuous missing and high-dimensional data with complex missing mechanisms and patterns. In this paper, we propose a customized tensor decomposition framework, named the data fusion CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (DFCP) tensor decomposition, to combine vehicle license plate recognition (LPR) data and cellphone location (CL) data for the interval-wise missing volume imputation on urban networks. Benefiting from the unique advantages of CL data in the wide spatiotemporal coverage and correlates highly with real-world traffic states, it is fused into vehicle license plate recognition (LPR) data imputation. They are regarded as data types dimension, combined with other dimensions (different segments, time, days), we innovatively design a 4-way low-n-rank tensor decomposition for data reconstruction. Furthermore, to deal with the diverse disturbances in different data dimensions, we derive a regularization penalty coefficient in data imputation. Different from existing regularization schemes, we further introduce Bayesian optimization (BO) to enhance the performance in the non-convexity of the objective function in our regularized hyperparametric solutions during tensor decomposition. Numerical experiments highlight that our proposed method, combining CL and LPR data, significantly outperforms the imputation method using LPR data only. And a sensitivity analysis with varying missing length and rate scenarios demonstrates the robustness of model performance.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been regarded as an efficient approach for collecting data in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), benefited from their mobility and flexibility. In this work, we investigate the data collection problem in UAV-assisted WSNs. In order to improve data collection efficiency, we first propose a multi-scenario parallel data collection scheme which allows data packets being transmitted through various modes/links simultaneously. Then, addressing the importance of completing data collection within a short time duration, we formulate a constrained optimization problem which minimizes the data collection time of the sensor nodes (SNs) by jointly designing UAV flight trajectory, cluster head mode selection, SN clustering strategy and UAV velocity. To resolve the optimization problem, we first consider the data transmission performance between SNs and present an SN clustering scheme based on a modified K-means algorithm. Given the clustering strategy, the optimization problem is then converted into three sub-problems, i.e., CH mode selection, UAV trajectory design, and flight velocity optimization. Firstly, jointly considering the data collection time of the cluster heads in various transmission modes and the spectrum resources of the sink node, we propose a greedy method-based CH mode selection scheme. Then, we map the UAV trajectory optimization problem as a traveling salesman problem and propose a simulated annealing-based algorithm to determine the flight trajectory for the UAV. Finally, by applying discrete time segment scheme, the UAV velocity optimization subproblem is transformed into a sequence of convex flight time minimization problems and a segment optimization-based flight velocity control strategy is presented.

HRG groups each kind of road agent and calculates their interaction adjacency matrix based on an effective collision risk metric. HSG of the driving scene is modeled by inferring the relationship between road agents and road semantic layout aligned by the road scene grammar. Based on this formulation, we can obtain effective trajectory forecasting in driving situations, and comparable performance to other state-of-the-art approaches is presented by extensive experiments on the nuScenes, ApolloScape, and Argoverse datasets.},

Path planning in 3-D urban environments is critical to drone delivery. The paper proposes a novel tangent-based (3D-TG) method for UAV path planning in 3-D urban environments. When a drone encounters an obstacle, a tangent graph is constructed to generate three sub-paths from both sides and above to bypass an obstacle, one of which is selected according to sophistically designed heuristic rules. The selected sub-path would be constantly adjusted its direction via tangent graph to avoid obstacles until the path can extend to the goal without obstacle collision. To avoid moving obstacles, velocity obstacle is incorporated in the 3D-TG. The experimental results on synthetic and realistic scenarios illustrate that 3D-TG performs well under static, unknown and dynamic environments. More significantly, 3D-TG can also generate a collision-free path for a drone to navigate through simple mazes efficiently, within a reasonable time.},

  abstract     = {Pixel-level crack segmentation is widely studied due to its high impact on building and road inspections. While recent studies have made significant improvements in accuracy, they typically heavily depend on pixel-level crack annotations, which are time-consuming to obtain. In earlier work, we proposed to reduce the annotation cost bottleneck by reformulating the crack segmentation problem as a weakly-supervised problem— i.e. the annotation process is expedited by sacrificing the annotation quality. The loss in annotation quality was remedied by refining the inference with per-pixel brightness values, which was effective when the pixel brightness distribution between cracks and non-cracks are well separated, but struggled greatly for lighter-colored cracks as well as non-crack targets in which the brightness distribution is less articulated. In this work, we propose an annotation refinement approach which takes advantage of the fact that the regions falsely annotated as cracks have similar local visual features as the background. Because the proposed approach is data-driven, it is effective regardless of a dataset’s pixel brightness profile. The proposed method is evaluated on three crack segmentation datasets as well as one blood vessel segmentation dataset to test for domain robustness, and the results show that it speeds up the annotation process by factors of 10 to 30, while the detection accuracy stays at a comparable level. We believe that our work is a step toward providing safe transportation systems at a minimal operational cost.},

However, due to the dynamically changing and widely distributed Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), data sharing still faces challenges in security, efficiency, and reliability. In this paper, we propose a secure and reliable data-sharing scheme (SDSS) for edge-enabled IoV networks. It assigns multiple attribute authorities to alleviate the management burden and support a large attribute universe catering to the various services in IoV. To enhance efficiency and flexibility, edge computing is introduced for quickly responding to vehicles’ requests and assisting resource-constrained vehicle computation. And an online/offline mechanism is designed to further alleviate the computational pressure of sharing data online. In addition, we put forward a cooperative key generation approach to guarantee the security of users’ private keys. The security analysis proves that SDSS ensures resistance to collusion attacks and indistinguishability under chosen-ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA). Moreover, it can avoid the single point of failure and resist denial of service (DoS) attacks with the help of multiple distributed edge nodes. The experiment demonstrates SDSS is practicable for IoV data sharing.},

This study aims to develop a novel and tangible method to measure port congestion by investigating ship behaviors between different zones in port waters. Different port zones have varying ship densities because ships moor in the anchorage area randomly but dock at berths in an orderly and close fashion. This observation leads us to apply the density-based clustering method for port zone identification and differentiation. In order to ensure the method is globally applicable and accurate, we develop a new clustering algorithm, an iterative, multi-attribute DBSCAN (IMA-DBSCAN), which incorporates an iterative process, together with both spatial information and domain knowledge. The necessary input data for the algorithm is extracted from the Automatic Identification System (AIS), a satellite-based tracking system with real-time ship positioning and sailing data. An illustrative case suggests that our algorithm can rapidly and precisely identify anchorage areas and individual berths (even in a port with complicated geographic features), while other methods cannot. The algorithm is applied to measure congestion at 20 major container ports in the world. The results show a significant increase in congestion at the Port of Los Angeles from August to December 2020, which matches the realistic statistics and proves the efficiency and practical applicability of the proposed algorithm.},

It is however challenging to alarm impending crashes accurately as the volume of non-crash data dominates that of crash data. Most existing studies formulate the crash prediction as retrospective study and a binary classification problem, which offers the limited capacity of alarming crashes in advance. To fill such gap, this paper proposes a crash alarm model for vehicles (CAMV) developed via learning vehicle operational data. First, a non-crash learning block (NCLB) is developed to process time slices of operational data with a fixed length. It aims to model the inter-feature correlations and the temporal dependencies jointly. Next, a novel coarse-to-fine strategy is developed to selectively generate and calibrate alarms. Specifically, a statistical process control (SPC) module is developed at the coarse step to generate preliminary alarms with crash scores under an abnormal pattern. A self-calibration module (SCM) is next developed to eliminate false alarms and confirm the ultimate crash alarm. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed CAMV with crash data collected from Internet of Vehicles. Meanwhile, comparative experiments based on a set of benchmarking methods are conducted to verify the superiority of our proposal.},

However, the existing vehicle-road environment perception technology based on vision mainly focus on the conditions of good illumination and weather and rely on visible light imaging equipment, which is not highly adaptable to special environments. In this paper, the key technologies of low-visibility vehicle-road environment perception are deeply studied by combining multi-mode visual imaging and deep learning, and a model of Multi-Branch Input Encoding-Decoding Network (MBINEDN) is proposed. In this model, the polarized degree image and infrared image of the same road scene are input simultaneously in the coding stage, and two branch networks are used to extract the multi-mode features. The lightweight network MobileNetV2 is used as the feature extractor to reduce the amount of model parameters, so as to retain the polarization and infrared feature of the image to the maximum extent. Finally, the two are combined and output in the decoding stage. Experiments show that using MBINEDN model to process two images can effectively improve the segmentation effect. At the same time, it shows that the effect of vehicle-road environment semantic segmentation based on multi-modal visual features is better than that of single modal features. Therefore, the application of multi-mode visual images to the segmentation of low-visibility vehicle-road scenes can provide a strong guarantee for the visual perception technology of vehicle safety driving assistance system.},

  abstract     = {3D Multi-object tracking (MOT) ensures consistency during continuous dynamic detection, conducive to subsequent motion planning and navigation tasks in autonomous driving. However, camera-based methods suffer in the case of occlusions and it can be challenging to track the irregular motion of objects for LiDAR-based methods accurately. Some fusion methods work well but do not consider the untrustworthy issue of appearance features under occlusion. At the same time, the false detection problem also significantly affects tracking. As such, we propose a novel camera-LiDAR fusion 3D MOT framework based on Combined Appearance-Motion Optimization (CAMO-MOT), which uses both camera and LiDAR data and significantly reduces tracking failures caused by occlusion and false detection. For occlusion problems, we are the first to propose an occlusion head to select the best object appearance features multiple times effectively, reducing the influence of occlusions. To decrease the impact of false detection in tracking, we design a motion cost matrix based on confidence scores which improve the positioning and object prediction accuracy in 3D space. As existing multi-object tracking methods always evaluate each category separately and do not consider the mismatch between objects of different categories, we also propose to build a multi-category cost to implement multi-object tracking in multi-category scenes. A series of validation experiments are conducted on the KITTI and nuScenes tracking benchmarks. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 79.99% HOTA and the lowest identity switches (IDS) value (23 for Car and 137 for Pedestrian) among all multi-modal MOT methods on the KITTI test dataset. And our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among all algorithms on the nuScenes test dataset with 75.3% AMOTA.},

  abstract     = {The connected automated vehicles (CAVs) are envisioned to be implemented most likely on electric vehicles, while traditional fuel-powered manually-driven vehicles (MVs) would probably still dominate the automobile market in the next decade. In this context, this paper addresses urban eco-driving of CAVs in mixed traffic and heterogeneous power conditions. The paper aims to develop a practical and deployable eco-driving strategy for CAVs in mixed traffic flow of CAVs and MVs under realistic and complex traffic conditions. Several typical eco-driving scenarios were studied in detail. In a nutshell, the eco-driving strategy for each CAV was determined by solving a typical two-point boundary value problem with minimum electric energy consumption in urban traffic conditions with small market penetration rates (MPRs) of CAVs. A rolling-horizon scheme was applied to implement the eco-driving strategy to handle uncertain/unpredictable disturbances of preceding MVs and the interference of junction queues to the eco-driving maneuvers of CAVs. The paper also studied how eco-driving for electrified CAVs would affect MVs’ fuel consumptions. Simulation studies were carried out on urban arterial roads of multiple signalized intersections in various scenarios of demand and MPR to verify the energy savings effect of the proposed eco-driving strategy. The results showed that via eco-driving electrified CAVs each had a potential of reducing energy consumption by 40%-61%, meanwhile leading to 5%-34% fuel savings on average for each following MV. Further issues concerning the energy saving mechanism of electrified CAVs, impacts of MVs cut-in from adjacent lanes, and passenger comfort were also examined.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous autonomous vehicle (HAV) coordinated motion planning must guide each vehicle out of the conflict zone based on the differences in vehicle platform characteristics. Decomposing complex driving tasks into primitives is an effective way to improve algorithm efficiency. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to complete the coordinated motion planning tasks through offline driving behavior primitive (DBP) library generation, online extension and selection of DBPs. The proposed algorithm applies dynamic movement primitives and singular value decomposition to learn driving behavior patterns from driving data, integrates them into a model-based optimization generation method as constraints, and builds a DBP library by fusing driving data and vehicle model. Based on the generated DBP library and primitive association probabilities learned from labeled driving segments via stochastic context-free grammar, the planning method completes the independent DBP extension of each vehicle in the conflict zone, generates an interaction DBP tree, and uses the mixed-integer linear programming algorithm to optimally select the primitives to be executed. This study demonstrates that the generated DBP library not only expands the types of primitives, but also distinguishes the characteristics of HAVs. We also present how to utilize the DBP libraries to obtain coordinated motion planning results with spatiotemporal information in the form of DBP extension and selection. The results obtained by real vehicle platforms and simulation show that the proposed method can accomplish coordinated motion planning tasks without relying on specific scene elements and highlight the unique motion characteristics of HAVs.},

  abstract     = {Automatic overtaking is a challenging task for self-driving vehicles. Traditional rule-based methods for overtaking in autonomous driving heavily rely on many predefined rules and are difficult to apply in complex driving scenarios. Learning-based methods usually use convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and multilayer perceptrons, etc., to extract features from environments, but they fail to effectively represent geometric and interactive information among traffic participants. Classic graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have the ability of represent graph-structural information but are limited to stable relationship representation due to the fixed adjacency matrix when applied in autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic graph learning method based on a graph convolutional network with a trainable adjacency matrix (TAM-GCN) to enable the learning of dynamic relationships among different nodes in an ever-changing driving scene. In addition, we develop a planning method for overtaking strategy in autonomous driving, where the proposed TAM-GCN is used to extract the spatial graph-structural features, select appropriate overtaking time, and generate efficient overtaking actions. The proposed model is trained using the imitation learning method. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both closed-loop and open-loop testing in the CARLA simulator and compare our method with state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves better accuracy, safety and overtaking performance than existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge of passenger flow underpins any optimal public transport application, such as new facilities design and operations. The interactions between passengers and sensors may provide the foundation to measure this flow and dismiss users and staff from the measures’ validation loop. Removing humans and their errors may impact significantly and improve measures’ cost and quality. The literature considered smartphones the leading enabler due to market penetration and embodied sensors. Smartphones allow users’ localization, identification, authentication, and billing. Via Bluetooth, smartphones detect short-range implicit interactions, device-to-device. We model passenger states on buses, either be-in or be-out (BIBO). The BIBO use case identifies a fundamental building block of continuously-valued passenger flow, which this paper describes through a Human-Computer interaction experimental setting involving two autonomous buses and a proprietary smartphone-Bluetooth sensing platform. The resulting dataset of 14,000 observations/sensors contains two ground-truth levels: the first is the passengers’ validation; the second is validation by video cameras surveilling buses and tracks. This study verifies separately classification based on Bluetooth and GPS signals, as well as an inertial navigation system, evaluating signals and related machine learning (ML) classifiers against measurement and ground-truth noise. The paper contributes a Monte Carlo simulation of labels-flip to emulate human errors in the labeling process, as in smartphone surveys, and a novel unsupervised variational auto-encoder classifier. Experimental results indicate error-free human validation is unlikely. The impact of mistakes on model performance bias can be significant. This use case supports the potential substitution of human validation with independent Bluetooth validation.},

Secondly, a quantum potential well, an average estimator and a minimum estimator are introduced into swarm evolutionary mechanisms with an oscillation weight, such that quantum-behaved cooperative navigation (QBCN) scheme is proposed as a guidance strategy, where the average estimator and the minimum estimator are designed depending on distributed consensus theory. Subsequently, we put forth a formation behavior consisting of leader-follower tactics, obstacle avoidance tactics and motion optimization tactics, which not only provides a practical collision/obstacle measure, but also increases the coverage area for the objective. Afterwards, a performance analysis for the proposed policy is executed on the convergence and computational complexity, which ensures the accuracy and timeliness of source localization in theory.

  abstract     = {Customized bus (CB) is a kind of demand-responsive and one-stop transit service for commuters with similar travel demands. In actual applications, the bus companies identify commuter demands including origin-destination (OD) flow and departure time using online surveys, and manually plan the CB routes, which is inefficient and costly. This study aims to identify spatial patterns of travel demands using a clustering algorithm based on vehicle trajectory data, and automatically extract the potential CB route from each cluster. The clustering algorithms are based on similarity measurements. However, the existing measurements cannot be used to synchronously identify the multiple characteristics of vehicle trajectories, such as OD location, direction, and multiple sub-sequences. To address this issue, we propose a comprehensive similarity (CS) to simultaneously evaluate all the characteristics. Subsequently, we utilize the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) to divide the trajectories into several groups, and determine the trade-off parameters in the DBSCAN using vlseKriterijumska optimizacija i kompromisno resenje (VIKOR), which means a multi-criteria optimization and compromise solution. Then, a case study is conducted based on one-week taxi trajectory data collected in Suzhou, China. The extracted results are compared to the existing routes designed by bus companies, providing a coverage rate of 66.7%. Finally, the advantages of the proposed method were discussed from the two perspectives of clustering algorithm and trajectory similarity measurement. The proposed method can help traffic management authorities and bus companies to plan and design new CB routes.},

Cooperative localization based on multi-vehicle information fusion will be the core component in VANET in the near future. This paper strives to enhance the localization accuracy using the fusion of GNSS and relative range information in static scenes. The formulation following the Maximum-Likelihood strategy is a quadratic non-convex programming, which is NP-hard. An iterative localization algorithm is proposed, where an approximate quadratic programming with linear constraints is solved in each iteration. Additional inspection steps and correction step are designed to ensure the convergence and feasibility of the proposed algorithm. The theoretical analysis shows that the limit of the proposed algorithm must be a global optimal solution of the formulated problem and the mean squared error can reach the Cramér-Rao lower bound. In terms of localization accuracy, the proposed method outperforms the existing linearized weighted least-squares method and semidefinite relaxation method, while exhibiting moderate computational complexity.},

Firstly, the GK-Module is proposed to extract geometric vectors and to construct a two-stage judgment mechanism, with the purpose of dealing with frame redundancy and improving the efficiency of JHPFA-Net structure. Secondly, distinguished with existing methods, the FF-Module is proposed to synthesize photo-realistic frontal faces, which can be used for capturing the facial actions under arbitrary poses. Finally, the HF-Module is proposed to fuse head pose attributes and facial modalities together, for the purpose of achieving pose-invariant detection and improving accuracy. Extensive experiments show that the proposed JHPFA-Net achieves state-of-the-art results comparing with some representative methods on the public YawDD benchmark, and it performs well in real-time application.},

  abstract     = {Roadside monitoring Lidars (RMLs) will be a crucial part of the future intelligent transportation system. Current approaches for optimizing RMLs’ placement at intersections work in hypothetical environments which do not well reflect real-world situations. This article proposes a new virtual method (VM) for optimizing the deployment of RMLs at as-built intersections. The proposed VM operates in a virtual environment where both static background and dynamic agents are modeled by dense point clouds. The agents are driven by real-world motion data. Using RMLs’ parameters as inputs, a coarse-to-fine subsampling approach is developed to generate laser scans in the virtual world. An objective function is then defined by comparing the agents’ points in the generated laser scan sequences against their original models. Bayesian optimization is applied to maximize the objective function by setting the RMLs’ positions and poses as decision variables. Besides, batch processing strategy and parallel computing are used to accelerate the optimization process. The effectiveness of the proposed VM is demonstrated in a case study. The VM shall help road administrators make decisions on RMLs’ deployment at as-built intersections.},

Firstly, a dual-unscented Kalman filter is presented, which can simultaneously track the robot and the speaker. Then, the interacting multiple models are adopted for the different motion dynamics of a robot and a speaker in space. To avoid the underdetermined condition when only the acoustic information is available, a small number of static microphone arrays are employed. Finally, the moving robot’s and speaker’s positions are estimated by the D-IMM-UKF algorithm. It can obtain the trajectories of the robot’s and speaker’s movements smoothly with good tracking accuracy. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Link progression speed is a key characteristic of urban traffic flow and is essential to developing effective signal coordination schemes. Typically, it is empirically determined as a fixed value regardless of its stochastic nature. Previous studies have proposed both analytical and simulation models to investigate the vehicle progression delay caused by different sources (i.e., midblock traffic, pedestrian crossing, and on-street parking). However, these models need explicit modeling efforts and an intensive collection of traffic data. This paper provides a practical approach that is easy to implement and accurate enough to characterize link-specific progression speed and its uncertainty. The pure input is the low-frequency probe vehicle data which is the most widely available and large-scale data source to provide spatiotemporal traffic information. By assuming the effects of progression delay are relatively stable during the same period of a day, the instantaneous speed of probe vehicles is aggregated to calculate progression speed at different locations of a link. To describe the continuous vehicle progression process and capture realistic driving behaviors, two latent progression states (i.e., normal and cautious driving states) and their spatial correlation are encoded to each cell of a link and formulated in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated using field data, and the concept of reliable green bandwidth is also demonstrated to discuss the application of the proposed method to enhance the reliability of signal coordination.},

To provide reliability and security for Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled maritime transportation systems (MTSs), in this paper we propose an outlier detection method based on the neighborhood rough residual network (NRRN). We calculate the neighborhood approximation accuracy and neighborhood conditional entropy to obtain the neighborhood combined entropy describing the discrimination ability of the condition attribute subset to the information system. We then delete the redundant attributes according to the attribute combination importance derived from the neighborhood combined entropy. The data after attribute reduction are used to train the convolutional neural network, and the residual network (ResNet50) is used to avoid the degradation of model performance caused by the increase in the number of network layers. The proposed method is compared with mainstream outlier detection algorithms on a fishing vessel operation dataset. Experiments show that the proposed method can greatly improve the accuracy of outlier detection while taking into account interpretability and computational efficiency, thereby ensuring the data integrity of IoT-enabled MTSs.},

More specifically, these factors are driving performance requirements, e.g., moving safety, smoothness comfort, fast passing, and surrounding space, as well as diversified driving styles suitable for different driver groups. Meanwhile, to improve the reasonability of automated driving and reduce the complexity of multi-vehicle games, switchable game modes are established to realize the dynamic adjustment mechanism.

  abstract     = {Lane-change decision-making for vehicles is a challenging task for many reasons, including traffic rules, safety, and the stochastic nature of driving. Because of its success in solving complex problems, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been suggested for addressing these issues. However, the studies on DRL to date have gone no further than validation in simulation and failed to address what are arguably the most critical issues, namely, the mismatch between simulation and reality, human-likeness, and safety. This paper introduces a real-world DRL framework for decision-making to design safe and human-like agents that can operate in the real world without extra tuning. We propose a new learning paradigm for DRL integrated with Real2Sim transfer, which comprises training, validation, and testing phases. The approach involves two simulator environments with different levels of fidelity, which are parameterized via real-world data. Within the framework, a large amount of randomized experience is generated with a low-fidelity simulator, whereupon the learned skills are validated regularly in a high-fidelity simulator to avoid overfitting. Finally, in the testing phase, the agent is examined concerning safety and human-like decision-making. Extensive simulation and real-world evaluations show the superiority of the proposed approach. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first application of DRL lane-changing policy in the real world.},

  abstract     = {Usually, image- and radar-based data are used to perform environmental characteristics related tasks in autonomous cars, while the use of valuable sensor data from the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus has been limited. The vehicle’s CAN bus data consist of multivariate time series data, such as velocity, RPM, and acceleration, which contain meaningful information about the vehicle dynamics and environmental characteristics. The ability to use these data to sense the environment, along with the sight sense (from image-based data), can prevent a single point of failure when image- or radar-based data are missing or incomplete, and contribute to increased understanding of the vehicle’s environment. Moreover, a solution that does not rely on image- or radar-based data also addresses concerns about privacy and the use of location-based data. We present DeepCAN, a novel hybrid method for road type classification that utilizes solely vehicle dynamics data and combines two main approaches for time series classification. In the end-to-end approach, a long short-term memory autoencoder (LSTM AE) is trained, and the learned embedding serves as the input to a fully convolutional network autoencoder (FCN AE), while the feature-based approach utilizes an XGBoost classifier with aggregated time series feature representation. In our comprehensive evaluation on two real-world datasets, we assessed the performance of each model component as an independent solution, as well as a model integrating all of the components in a hybrid solution. The results demonstrate DeepCAN’s efficiency and accuracy and provide a solid basis for its future use by the automobile industry.},

Firstly, we develop a vision-based bearing, distance and velocity model based on a wide-field optical imaging system. Secondly, optical information is used to construct the micro-characteristic imaging model of ship navigation signals. Thirdly, we have solved the problem between a large field-of-view (FOV) and high-resolution imaging in vision-based marine navigation. Finally, an improved Adaboost algorithm is designed for the intelligent recognition of an open-sea target (ship types and light patterns). The proposed method has been verified by extensive experiments in a practical environment, and the results show that it can effectively and efficiently identify the navigation signal of a target ship.},

Based on the field experimental data, two new lower-level control models are developed and compared with two widely used ones. The comparison results show that the proposed models outperform the two previous models in capturing the observed actual acceleration, especially the troughs of the acceleration time series.

While being navigated by PSO, robots are easily trapped into U-shape-like concave obstacles such that they move back and forth cyclically and fail to locate a correct source. Existing obstacle avoidance strategies perform well when robots have information about all obstacles. Yet in many real scenes, robots have no prior information. This work proposes a novel PSO based on Tabu Search (PSO-TS) for robots to locate multiple sources. Instead of traditionally setting obstacles as tabu objects, PSO-TS innovatively sets trapping areas as tabu objects such that robots do not need prior knowledge or expensive hardware and much time to obtain obstacle information. The weighted average velocity of a robot is employed to determine if it is stuck inside an obstacle-induced area. If so, a rectangular tabu area is set to push robots out of the area and prevents robots from searching the same area again. The proposed method can be embedded into various source location algorithms to improve their performance. Its obstacle avoidance capability is proved. Finally, experimental results show the algorithmic compatibility, environmental adaptability and obstacle avoidance performance of the proposed method.},

To capture the dynamic nature of scheduling decisions, we model the problem using dynamic programming techniques. Our model accounts for the spatial and temporal heterogeneities of charging and driving costs for different truck trips. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conducted an empirical study at the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach. Specifically, we aimed to fulfill 5% of the daily 20-foot equivalent unit containers using electric drayage trucks. Our model identified the optimal number of electric trucks, charging stations, and truck schedules required to meet the container throughput requirement. We also analyzed the cost per container as a function of daily throughput level for various scenarios. Our findings provide insights on how to determine charger supply based on daily throughputs at ports, and how to choose the appropriate ratios of electric trucks and battery sizes in the truck fleet under different throughput and electric price cases.},

  abstract     = {The change of space environment at the tunnel entrance which the light changes from bright to dark will lead to frequent traffic accidents. To explore whether the connected vehicle environment will improve the driving performance and traffic safety at the tunnel entrance, this paper first of all designed a driving simulation experiment and provided driving aids through the Human-Machine Interface (HMI). Then 35 drivers were invited to take a driving simulation under two different driving conditions: traditional driving environment (HMI-OFF) and connected vehicle environment (HMI-ON). Finally, the effectiveness and safety of HMI can be evaluated from two aspects of driver response efficiency and deceleration process, and further explore the causes of driving behavior changes by Cox model. The results show that the driver’s response efficiency and deceleration behavior are both improved in the connected vehicle environment. The warning information provided by in-vehicle HMI enables the driver to know the road conditions ahead earlier and adjust the speed through more gentle acceleration so that the vehicle can enter the tunnel at a more stable speed. At the same time, there are significant differences in the brake-movement time of different driving ages, which the brake-movement time increases with the driving age. This indicates that experienced drivers usually adopt a soft way to adjust the speed, so that the vehicle speed change process is more stable on the premise of ensuring driving safety, so as to avoid the potential danger brought by drastic speed change. In this paper, a validity evaluation method based on survival analysis is proposed for tunnel entrance scenarios, which provides a reference for the realization of connected vehicle evaluation.},

Although data-driven methods are widely used for human driver behavior learning, there have been fewer studies on realizing human-like trajectory planning by using the generation mechanism of driving behavior, especially under curve conditions, where the lane centerline has been denoted as a reference trajectory. In this paper, thirty-two skilled drivers were recruited to collect data under different curve conditions on a self-designed driver-in-the-loop system. The collected data are processed by dynamic time warping, trajectories with different lengths are warped and the abnormal data are removed. Based on the warped data, common characteristics and differences between left and right turning trajectories are compared and explored from the perspectives of drivers’ demand for turning performance and their visual attention mechanism. Then, by introducing the driver preview mechanism, two features with a strong ability to represent the generation mechanism of the driver’s curve driving behavior are introduced. Finally, the preview-based human-like trajectory planning model (PHTPM) is proposed, and it is verified and analyzed by comparative tests and generalizability tests. The results show that the introduction of the driver preview mechanism enables PHTPM to match the characteristics of skilled drivers accurately on left turnings and outperform them on right turnings.},

  abstract     = {Tracking multiple objects through time is an important part of an intelligent transportation system. Random finite set (RFS)-based filters are one of the emerging techniques for tracking multiple objects. In multi-object tracking (MOT), a common assumption is that each object is moving independent of its surroundings. However, in many real-world applications, objects interact with one another and the environment. Such interactions are rarely considered within the tracking process. In this paper, we present a novel approach to incorporate target interactions within the prediction step of a RFS-based multi-target filter, i.e. labeled multi-Bernoulli (LMB) filter. The proposed method is capable of explicitly incorporating the effect of target interactions within the filtering process, with little to no changes made for specific applications. We have developed the proposed filter for two practical applications, i.e. tracking a coordinated swarm and vehicles. The method has been tested for a complex vehicle tracking dataset and compared with the PHD filter and LMB filter through the OSPA metric, and with the LMB filter through OSPA(2) metric and cardinality error. The results demonstrate that the proposed interaction-aware method depicts considerable performance enhancement over the other methods in terms of the selected metrics.},

  abstract     = {Reliable and accurate velocity prediction can significantly contribute to the quality of connected vehicle control applications. Existing efforts focus on the velocity prediction without considering vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication interruption. Hence, a stochastic velocity prediction method for connected vehicles considering V2V communication interruption is put forward for the first time. The missing V2V communication data are addressed by the piecewise cubic Hermite spline interpolation. Then, the processed data are used as the input variables of the best conditional linear Gaussian (CLG) prediction model. Specifically, the best CLG model is obtained by analyzing the influence of different input variables on the velocity prediction without V2V communication interruption. The results demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of CLG-based model is acceptable if the communication interruption time is less than 5 s compared to the non-interrupted V2V communication case. The sensitivity study of the best CLG model under multiple vehicles scenario indicates that choosing appropriate historical data substantially improve the prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the CLG-based predictor is proved to be an effective method to achieve higher prediction accuracy in two test road networks when compared with the Back-propagation and Long Short-Term Memory network.},

  abstract     = {On-ramp merging is a challenging task for autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in mixed traffic where AVs coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). In this paper, we formulate the mixed-traffic highway on-ramp merging problem as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem, where the AVs (on both merge lane and through lane) collaboratively learn a policy to adapt to HDVs to maximize the traffic throughput. We develop an efficient and scalable MARL framework that can be used in dynamic traffic where the communication topology could be time-varying. Parameter sharing and local rewards are exploited to foster inter-agent cooperation while achieving great scalability. An action masking scheme is employed to improve learning efficiency by filtering out invalid/unsafe actions at each step. In addition, a novel priority-based safety supervisor is developed to significantly reduce collision rate and greatly expedite the training process. A gym-like simulation environment is developed and open-sourced with three different levels of traffic densities. We exploit curriculum learning to efficiently learn harder tasks from trained models under simpler settings. Comprehensive experimental results show the proposed MARL framework consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Estimating Arterial Travel Time distributions from high-resolution loop detector data (signal events and vehicle detection events) is a challenging task. Even though high-resolution loop detector data for several years may be available, the lack of other data modes and ground-truth labels, hinders approaches that rely on additional information. Among the approaches relying exclusively on loop detector data, are deterministic physics-based approaches (which use the mechanics of a virtual probe moving down a signalized arterial) and cost-minimization approaches (which estimate travel times from detector counts directly). In this work, we propose and evaluate a hybrid model that uses virtual probe trajectories to indicate probable arrival and departure windows, within which we apply a sequence alignment algorithm on high-resolution loop detector data to match platoons. We generate a broad range of traffic conditions and signal timing plans using SUMO traffic simulator and evaluate our approaches. We also verify our approach using real-world data collected along a 5-intersection signalized corridor. We show that virtual probe trajectories can be replaced by data collected from real probes (when available), thereby improving accuracy. Results show that our approaches enable us to calculate a good estimate of the arterial travel time distribution and are robust to noise. Thus, our methods can be used both with standalone archived loop detector data and in conjunction with data from connected vehicles.},

By selecting the distance from the center of gravity to the center of percussion as the preview length, the effects of the lateral rear-tire force are decoupled and cancelled out, and then the preview error, which represents the path-following performance, can be only commanded by the front-tire force. To further address the issue of unknown tire-road friction limits, a modified ASM-FTC strategy is presented to improve the path-following performance as the lateral tire force is saturated.

In this regard, this paper systematically reviews different methods proposed in the literature for modelling pedestrian trajectory prediction in presence of vehicles that can be applied for unstructured environments. This paper also investigates specific considerations for pedestrian-vehicle interaction (compared with pedestrian-pedestrian interaction) and reviews how different variables such as prediction uncertainties and behavioural differences are accounted for in the previously proposed prediction models. PRISMA guidelines were followed. Articles that did not consider vehicle and pedestrian interactions or actual trajectories, and articles that only focused on road crossing were excluded. A total of 1260 unique peer-reviewed articles from ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus databases were identified in the search. 64 articles were included in the final review as they met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. An overview of datasets containing trajectory data of both pedestrians and vehicles used by the reviewed papers has been provided. Research gaps and directions for future work, such as having more effective definition of interacting agents in deep learning methods and the need for gathering more datasets of mixed traffic in unstructured environments are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Self-driving cars, believed to be on track to become a seven trillion-dollar industry by 2050, are likely to be a popular mode of transportation in the near future, as the technology promises safety and efficiency. Significant advances have been made to achieve these objectives. However, the idea of a self-driving car completing its goals without human intervention in the presence of uncertainties is still posed with challenges. These challenges mostly relate to decision-making under uncertainties that could arise from transient faults or deliberate attempts to disrupt the system in favor of adversarial motives. Traditional schemes of hardening the system against known compromises will not suffice primarily because of the sophistication adversarial attempts have come to achieve and the rate at which new attacks are being devised. The problem demands a solution that is resilient to attacks and that would allow a self-driving vehicle to complete its designated task in the presence of attacks or faults. Several attempts have been made towards achieving resilience in autonomous vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to give a thorough review on the resilient approaches adopted in the context and presents a taxonomy of such approaches. The paper also includes a brief introduction to the architecture of self-driving vehicles and its vulnerabilities in the presented context. This paper also discusses a novel approach using N-version programming for resilience.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneously and accurately predicting trajectories of multiple heterogeneous agents is crucial for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications, e.g., connected and autonomous vehicles. Existing model-based and data-driven methods can achieve good prediction accuracy, but most of them neglect the domain shift issue and prevalent imperfect data problems, i.e., few-shot learning and zero-shot learning issues. To address these issues, we propose a multi-source transfer learning (TL) framework, transferable hierarchical Siamese Transformer network (T-HSTN), for trajectory prediction of multiple heterogeneous agents, e.g., vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians, at urban unsignalized intersections under small data conditions. Specifically, by extending the self-attention mechanism and exploring feature representations of traffic scenes, a Transformer-based network that hierarchically extracts temporal/spatial features and map features is introduced as the basic prediction model. Moreover, a TL framework with adaptive learning and feature alignment modules is built to explore the feature representations of unfixed traffic scenes and align both statistical and deep features to learn domain-invariant knowledge. More challenging trajectory prediction experiments are designed, corresponding to newly-built or badly-instrumented intersections under real-world scenarios. Experimental results verify the proposed method’s high accuracy, transferability, and generability. Our work fills the gap in solutions and benchmarks for TL tasks in trajectory prediction for heterogeneous agents. The conducted TL experiments provide a more practical setting of considering imperfect data problems in trajectory prediction.},

We hypothesize that a heterogeneous data fusion framework can enhance information coverage and quality for traffic models, increasing the efficiency and reliability of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications. Our hypothesis was verified through two applications that utilized traffic estimation and incident classification models. DataFITS collected four data types from seven sources over nine months and fused them in a spatiotemporal domain. Traffic estimation models used descriptive statistics and polynomial regression, while incident classification employed the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Wasserstein metric as distance measures. Results indicate that DataFITS significantly increased road coverage by 137% and improved information quality for up to 40% of all roads through data fusion.

  abstract     = {A data-driven spatial adaptive terminal iterative learning predictive control (SATILPC) scheme with actuator saturation is proposed for automatic stop control of the subway train. Considering the outstanding repetitive operation pattern and the unavailable accurate model of a subway train, the unknown train dynamics is firstly transformed into a nonlinear discrete form in spatial domain via the spatial differential operator. Since the train automatic stop control (TASC) only concentrates on the tracking performances of the terminal position and terminal speed, an iterative dynamic linearization approach considering the terminal operation point is devised to formulate the relationship of the train input and output (I/O) into a linear affine form. Then, a terminal iterative learning prediction mechanism is introduced to reconstruct the developed train data model to forecast the future train behaviors through rolling optimization process. As a result, by removing the constraints on the unimportant points, the optimal control input (braking force) can be obtained by minimizing the objective function through terminal I/O data. Further, actuator saturation is considered to address the passenger comfort and the reliable operation of the train. The proposed SATILPC approach is a pure data-driven iterative learning control scheme and no model information is involved in the whole design processes. By utilizing a newly space-based contraction mapping method, the convergence of the proposed approach is strictly proved. Finally, the simulation results further demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Predicting how long a trip will take may allow travelers plan ahead, save money, and avoid traffic congestion. The journey time estimation model should take into account three crucial factors: (1) individual travel preference, (2) dynamic spatio-temporal correlations, and (3) the association between long-term speed forecast and travel time estimate. In order to overcome these challenges, this study proposes a unique parallel architecture called the multi-task spatio-temporal attention network (MT-STAN) to estimate journey times. To extract the dynamic spatio-temporal correlations of the road network, we first develop a traffic speed prediction model based on spatio-temporal block and bridge transformer networks, combining the road, timestamp, and traffic speed information into hidden states. Second, we offer a personalized model for estimating journey times that makes use of cross-network, holistic attention, and semantic transformer. In this approach, travel preferences extraction through cross-network, holistic attention permits correlations between the dynamic road network’s hidden states and individual journey characteristics, which are subsequently transformed into global semantics by the semantic transformer; preferences and semantics are integrated during the estimate phase. Finally, a multi-task learning component is included, which combines both traffic speed prediction and individual journey time estimate, via the sharing of underlying network parameters and the improvement of the contextual semantic knowledge of the latter job. Evaluation experiments are carried out using a highway dataset collected in Yinchuan City, Ningxia Province, China. The proposed prediction model outperforms state-of-the-art baseline approaches in experiments.},

  abstract     = {Urban mobility plays a crucial role in maintaining seniors’ well-being and quality of life, with urban transit systems serving as their primary mode of travel. This study focuses on revealing seniors’ travel patterns and activities and predicting their demands in transit systems. We propose a spatio-temporal travel pattern model that extends the structural topic model from text mining, to detect senior mobility patterns from trip sequences at the rail station level and discover their activities hidden in passively collected data from a probabilistic generative procedure. The proposed model can incorporate a wide range of spatio-temporal covariates that help estimate the relative importance of travel patterns across stations and over time. Numerical experiments are conducted using transit smart card data collected in Nanjing, China. The results demonstrate that our proposed methodology successfully transforms massive mobility records into informative travel patterns, each of which characterizes a distinct distribution of trip attributes. We combine land use characteristics of station areas with detected patterns to explore seniors’ behavioral strategies and activities at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, by applying prior detected patterns to the station-level ridership prediction, we significantly improve the predictive performance of direct ridership models. This study contributes to detecting seniors’ travel patterns, discovering latent activities, predicting station-level travel demands, and creating senior-friendly mobility systems.},

  abstract     = {Traffic counts (or link counts) are defined as cumulative traffic in the lanes between two consecutive intersections on a road network. Established methods of link count estimation assume the availability of count data at a set of basis links: a minimum subset of all the links of a network that still allow complete network traffic count estimation. If traffic count data are missing even at some basis links, current research must introduce additional assumptions, on path flow or historical data, to compensate. In this research, we present an approach to estimate the missing basis link count without the need for historical data or path-flow information, thereby overcoming the limitations of state-of-the-art estimation approaches. We develop a stochastic method using a canonical correlation analysis-based constrained minimization problem for estimation purposes. The proposed method has been validated with real-world link count data collected in Melbourne, Australia, between 2016 to 2019. The validation results indicate that we can achieve an accuracy of up to 90% in the real world, despite the unknown traffic patterns of the estimation period. Depending on the time of day, the modelling strategy selected, and the consistency of input data available at the road intersection, the estimation accuracy varies. The proposed methodology is useful when there is a general shortage of data since there is inadequate infrastructure for data collection in many major cities around the world.},

However, the flight distance of drones is often constrained due to the limited battery capacity. To address this challenge, this paper designs a multi-drones-assisted commercial parcel delivery system, which supports long-distance delivery by a generalized service network (GSN). Each node of the GSN is equipped with charging piles to provide a charging service for drones. Given the limited number of charging piles at each node and the limited battery capacity of a drone, to ensure the efficient operation of the system, the flight planning problem of drones is converted into a large-scale optimization problem by a priority-based encoding mechanism. To solve this problem, an enhanced backtracking search algorithm (EBSA) is reported, which is inspired by the characteristics of the considered flight planning problem and the weak ability of the backtracking search algorithm to escape from a local optimum. The core components of EBSA are the designed comprehensive learning mechanism and local escape operator. Experimental results prove the validity of the improved strategies and the excellent performance of EBSA on the considered flight planning problem.},

Such systems must efficiently analyze the continuous stream of incoming ship movement data to provide an up-to-date picture of the situation at sea. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a software technology dedicated to the analysis of data streams in real time and seems to be promising for maritime surveillance as well. CEP is based on rules that usually have to be formulated manually by domain experts. Recently, several approaches of learning CEP rules have been proposed. However, all these approaches are limited to standard CEP rule languages which are not well suited for describing maritime situations. In this paper, we extend Bat4CEP, an innovative bat-inspired approach to automatic CEP rule learning, to meet the specific needs of the maritime domain. In particular, we extend the rule language of Bat4CEP to include temporal-spatial operators and domain-specific functions. This extended rule language makes it possible to express complex maritime facts in a simple and understandable form. Furthermore, it is shown how the proposed rule language extensions can be integrated into the Bat4CEP learning approach. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments with real maritime data streams.},

Recent advances following the coarse-to-fine manner show promising potential in point cloud registration. However, existing methods rely on good superpoint correspondences, which are hard to be obtained reliably and efficiently, thus resulting in less robust and accurate point cloud registration. In this paper, we propose a novel network, named RDMNet, to find dense point correspondences coarse-to-fine and improve final pose estimation based on such reliable correspondences. Our RDMNet uses a devised 3D-RoFormer mechanism to first extract distinctive superpoints and generates reliable superpoints matches between two point clouds. The proposed 3D-RoFormer fuses 3D position information into the transformer network, efficiently exploiting point clouds’ contextual and geometric information to generate robust superpoint correspondences. RDMNet then propagates the sparse superpoints matches to dense point matches using the neighborhood information for accurate point cloud registration. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple datasets from different environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in all tested datasets with a strong generalization ability.},

This paper proposes a planning and decision making framework for intersection left-turning which considers the interaction between autonomous vehicles and human drivers as well as pedestrians to address this issue. The proposed framework considers interactions mathematically by formulating the problem as a linear quadratic differential game. Through solving the Nash equilibrium of the game, the autonomous vehicle is able to properly interact with surrounding traffic participants. Under the differential game framework, the accuracy of the interaction formulation is closely related to the behavior model of human drivers. Therefore, real-world human behavior is extracted and evaluated from naturalistic driving dataset to help establish more realistic modeling and estimation of various kinds of traffic participants, including aggressive, neutral and conservative traffic participants. The simulation results show that the autonomous vehicle is able to properly estimate the types of traffic participants by observing their behavior using the proposed technique. Then the autonomous vehicle behave according to the types of those traffic participants to enable interactive and human-like planning and decision making at intersections.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) is a promising paradigm that provides cloud computing services closer to vehicular users. In VEC, vehicles and communication infrastructures can form pools with computational resources to meet vehicular services with low-latency constraints. These resource pools are known as Vehicular Cloud (VC). The usage of VC resources requires a task scheduling process. In this case, depending on its complexity, a vehicular service can be divided into different tasks. An efficient task scheduling needs to orchestrate where and for how long such tasks will run, considering the available pools, the mobility of nodes, and the tasks deadline constraints. Thus, this article proposes an efficient VC task scheduler based on an approximation heuristic and resources prediction to select the best VC for each task, called MARINA. MARINA aims to analyze the behavior of vehicles that share their computational resources with the VC and make scheduling decisions based on the mobility (VC availability) of these vehicles. Simulation results under a realistic scenario demonstrate the efficiency of MARINA compared to existing state-of-the-art mechanisms in terms of the number of tasks scheduled, monetary cost, system latency, and Central Processing Unit (CPU) utilization.},

  abstract     = {This research explores the inherent vulnerability of nonlinear vehicle platoons characterized by the oscillatory behavior triggered by external perturbations. The perturbation exerted on the vehicle platoon is regarded as an external force on an object. Following the mechanical vibration analysis in mechanics, this research proposes a vibration-theoretic approach that advances our understanding of platoon vulnerability from two aspects. First, the proposed approach introduces damping intensity to characterize vehicular platoon vulnerability, which divides platoon oscillations into two types, i.e., underdamped and overdamped. The damping intensity measures the platoon’s recovery strength in responding to perturbations. Second, the proposed approach can obtain the resonance frequency of a nonlinear vehicle platoon, where resonance amplifies platoon oscillation magnitude when the external perturbation frequency equals the platoon’s damping oscillation frequency. The main contribution of this research lies in the analytical derivation of the closed-form formulas of damping intensity and resonance frequency. In particular, the proposed approach formulates platoon dynamics under perturbation as a second-order non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation, enabling rigorous derivations and analyses for platoons with complicated nonlinear car-following behaviors. Through simulations built on real-world data, this paper demonstrates that an overdamped vehicle platoon is more robust against perturbations, and an underdamped platoon can be destabilized easily by exerting a perturbation at the platoon’s resonance frequency. The theoretical derivations and simulation results shed light on the design of reliable platooning control, either for human-driven or automated vehicles, to suppress the adverse effects of oscillations.},

As a potential remedy, we propose a novel unified Transformer with semantically contrastive learning for image dehazing, dubbed USCFormer. USCFormer has three key contributions. First, USCFormer absorbs the respective strengths of CNN and Transformer by incorporating them into a unified Transformer format. Thus, it allows the simultaneous capture of global-local dependency features for better image dehazing. Second, by casting clean/hazy images as the positive/negative samples, the contrastive constraint encourages the restored image to be closer to the ground-truth images (positives) and away from the hazy ones (negatives). Third, we regard the semantic information as important prior knowledge to help USCFormer mitigate the effects of haze on the scene and preserve image details and colors by leveraging intra-object semantic correlation. Experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world hazy photos fully validate the superiority of USCFormer in both perceptual quality assessment and subjective evaluation.

Experiments demonstrate that the proposed Sparse U-PDP outperforms the present state-of-the-art multi-task model in terms of accuracy. The primary contributions of this work are as follows: First, we present the approach to unified multi-task representation. We abstract the multi-task into the “dynamic convolution kernels” representation form to build a highly unified multi-task decoder. Second, we use the proposed dynamic interaction module to establish different feature sampling pipelines for various task features. Lastly, our model is verified on the BDD100K dataset, where we achieve an AP50 of 84.1 in the “vehicle” category, 32.0 IoU in the lane detection, and 93.0 mIoU in the drivable area segmentation with the helper of CSP-Darknet.

In many applications, lots of targets need to be covered, but the budgets of both deployment and maintenance are limited. Therefore, how to maximize total weighted target coverage while prolonging network lifetime is of great significance. This work investigates the maximum weighted target coverage deployment of a rechargeable visual sensor network charged by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in 3D space, which should ensure network permanence and satisfy the budgets of both deployment and maintenance. In this problem, since UAV has a limited energy capacity, it is allowed to return to the depot for energy replenishment more than once in each charging period of wireless nodes so as to increase target coverage. After formulating this problem as a mixed integer nonlinear program, this work proposes a greedy heuristic and a particle swarm optimizer to approximately solve this NP-hard problem. Extensive simulation results reveal that the latter can deliver a better solution despite consuming more time than the former.},

Then, a measurement model was developed to evaluate driver trust, driver attention, and traffic safety. Subsequently, we examined the corresponding causal relationships. On the one hand, latent hazard notification significantly improves driver attention (i.e., more fixations on latent hazards, less engagement in non-driving-related tasks, and faster notice of immediate risks), which significantly enhances traffic safety. On the other hand, latent hazard notification significantly increases driver trust, which lowers driver attention and consequently impairs traffic safety. This causality reveals driver behavioral adaptation, although driver trust does not directly affect traffic safety. Overall, we find that latent hazard notification for highly automated driving can improve traffic safety, but the consequent driver behavioral adaptation impairs 15.12% of the expected safety benefits.},

  abstract     = {The dual-clutch transmission (DCT) was developed to increase the transmission efficiency and the shift performance. However, in a DCT, due to uncertainty related to the actuator, the tie-up phenomenon can arise, in which two clutches engage together or the clutch torque control performance deteriorates. Especially, the actuator uncertainty increased when using a special mechanism to increase controllability and efficiency. Among them, the ball-ramp DCT (BR-DCT), which uses a self-energizing mechanism, can reduce the consumption of actuator energy while also reducing the tie-up effect. However, the nonlinearity of the actuator must be considered, such as friction between parts and change in friction coefficient. Among the methods by which this type of uncertainty is estimated, the nonlinear disturbance observer is most effective when used to estimate the unmodeled nonlinearity of an actuator and time-varying uncertainty. In order to execute disturbance rejection control to improve the performance of the shift controller using the estimated uncertainty, it is necessary to configure disturbance compensation input. However, because the BR-DCT powertrain includes mismatched disturbances and nonlinearity of the actuator, it is difficult to apply the existing methods on the composite control law to shift controller. Therefore, in this study, we propose a composite control law to guarantee integrated stability in nonlinear systems such as a BR-DCT powertrain. The proposed method was verified through a powertrain test bench equipped with a BR-DCT. Finally, the proposed composite control law was able to converge both the tracking error and the disturbance estimation error.},

However, the existing lane detection methods developed for common road scenarios cannot meet the high-precision and robust all-weather requirements of RTG autonomous driving. In this article, we propose an Adaptive Edge-based Lane Detection and Tracking method considering RTG lanes’ characteristics in this paper. First, the candidate edges of lane lines are detected and paired based on the enhanced gradient features. Next, inverse perspective mapping is employed to search the right edges, followed by an adaptive sliding-window method. Ultimately, we develop an adaptive Kalman filter to track lane lines robustly, detecting confidence weighting by relaxing the constraint of lane line width. The proposed method is tested in an actual container yard, the lane centerline’s average position error is 2.051 pixels, and the detection success rate is close to 100%.},

  abstract     = {Accurate trajectory prediction is essential for safe and efficient autonomous driving in complex traffic environments. While artificial intelligence has shown great promise in improving prediction accuracy, its inherent uncertainty and lack of explainability may lead to unpredictable failures, creating challenges for safety-critical decision-making. This study aims to address these challenges by exploring the impact of traffic environment on prediction algorithms. The study proposes a trajectory prediction framework with epistemic uncertainty estimation ability to output high uncertainty when facing unforeseeable or unknown scenarios. The framework analyzes the environmental effect on the trajectory prediction by considering scenario features and shifts. Features are divided into kinematic features of a target agent, features of surrounding traffic participants, and other scenario features. Feature correlation and importance analyses are performed to study their influence on prediction error and epistemic uncertainty. The impact of unavoidable distributional shifts in the real world on trajectory predictions is investigated using multiple intersection datasets. The results indicate that deep ensemble-based methods have advantages in improving robustness while estimating epistemic uncertainty. Consistent conclusions were obtained from the correlation and importance analyses, indicating that kinematic features of the target agent have relatively strong effects on both prediction error and epistemic uncertainty. Finally, the study analyzes the accuracy deterioration caused by distributional shifts and the potential of the deep ensemble-based method. Through deep ensemble, the errors of the prediction methods based on GRIP++ and Trajectron++ have been improved by 6.4% and 10.8% in the same-dataset test, and 6.3% and 10.8% in the cross-dataset test.},

  abstract     = {Highly-dynamic (HD) map is an indispensable building block in the future of autonomous driving, allowing for fine-grained environmental awareness, precise localization, and route planning. However, since HD maps include rich, multidimensional information, the volume of HD map data is substantial and cannot be transmitted frequently by several vehicles over vehicular networks in real-time. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a data source selection scheme for effective HD map transmissions in vehicular named data networking (NDN) scenarios. To achieve our goal, we created a vehicular NDN environment for data collection, processing, and transmission using the CARLA simulator and robot operating system 2 (ROS2). Next, due to our vehicular NDN’s dynamic and complex nature, we formulate the data source selection problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it using a reinforcement learning approach. For simplicity, we termed our proposed scheme data source optimization with reinforcement learning (DSORL), which selects suitable vehicles for HD map data transmission to MEC servers. The experiment results indicate that our suggested method outperformed existing baseline schemes, such as RLSS, Pro-RTT, and HDM-RTT, across all performance criteria in the evaluation. For instance, the system throughput increases by &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$65\%-72.68\%$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; compared to other baseline systems.

Recently, many deep learning models have been proposed for spatial-temporal dependency modeling. While numerous deep learning models have been developed for spatial-temporal dependency modeling, most rely on different types of convolutions to extract spatial and temporal correlations separately. To address this limitation, we propose a novel deep learning framework for traffic prediction called GraphSAGE-based Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (DST-GraphSAGE), which can capture dynamic spatial and temporal dependencies simultaneously. Our model utilizes a spatial-temporal GraphSAGE module to extract localized spatial-temporal correlations from past observations of a node’s spatial neighbors. Meanwhile, the attention mechanism is incorporated to dynamically learn weights between traffic nodes based on graph features. Additionally, to capture long-term trends in traffic data, we employ dilated causal convolution as the temporal convolution layer. A series of numerical experiments are conducted on five real-world datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our model for spatial-temporal dependency modeling.},

To address the above problem, this study aims to build connections between sequence scheduling and motion planning in mixed traffic, where individual CAVs, CAVs platoons, and mixed platoons coexist. First, optimal control strategies are presented for vehicles with flexible merging points based on Pontryagin’s minimum principle (PMP), and the final vehicle states in variable conditions are summarized in a phase diagram. Subsequently, the optimal final-state phase diagram is introduced into the passing sequence tree search process, which is designed for different vehicle groups in mixed traffic. Heuristic pruning rules are added to the depth-first search strategy to facilitate finding the optimal solution. Finally, an event-triggered receding horizon optimization algorithm is developed for continuous implementation. The numerical simulations are conducted in multiple traffic volumes, and the simulation results reveal that our proposed algorithm significantly improves the overall traffic efficiency and reduces vehicle-passing delays compared with the traditional FIFO-based cooperation method.},

However, due to privacy-preserving protocol and unaccessible annotation, it emerges as a novel problem in federated learning scenarios whether unsupervised pre-training based transfer learning (UPTL) is available for semantic segmentation. In this work, we define federated transfer learning (FedTL) in the absence of source domain label, and track research progress on pavement crack benchmark. The main challenges of FedTL include: i) a privacy-protecting distributed training framework that extends UPTL to the constraints of federated settings, and ii) a self-learning semantic segmentation approach that develops self-supervised learning paradigm to simultaneously learn category and shape representations. Motivated by that, we propose a FedCrack model to absorb feature disentanglement and prototype clustering into vision Transformer, which obtains the pre-trained encoder on source domain without accessing annotation. Thereafter, a fine-tuning stage is presented to learn decoder with scaling attention on target domain for fine-grained crack segmentation. The effectiveness of proposed FedCrack can be demonstrated with superior performance of 82.14% on mIoU and 9.85 FPS on speed in extensive experiments. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work in FedTL to gain weights of unsupervised pre-training representations on source domain locally, gradients of which are then aggregated to a federated central model that also fine-tunes the transferable parameters by target domain.},

Deep learning-based methods have shown great potential in this field compared to traditional methods that rely on hand-crafted features. However, deep learning-based methods for railway point clouds still face typical challenges that need to be addressed. In this regard, we propose a novel learning framework named SALAProNet, which consists of a set of effective and concise modular solutions. The first challenge addressed is the massive data scale of railway point clouds, which makes it difficult to directly process large-scale point clouds due to memory limitations. To solve this problem, we adapt efficient random sampling in the network and propose the Self-Attentive Aggregation (SAA) module based on an attention mechanism to greatly expand the receptive field, which covers the unsampled points and successfully retains information in a high-dimensional feature space. The second challenge is fine-grained segmentation, where we propose the Local Geometry Embedding (LGE) module to embed local geometry. With the help of context information provided by SAA, the network can perform fine-grained segmentation for railway infrastructures. The third challenge is the insufficient generalization ability of the network, where we propose a Prototype Guided Regularization (PGR) method to guide the network to segment the point cloud among railways with different construction standards. This method enhances the network’s interpretability and improves its generalization ability. We have validated our proposed framework through experiments on different datasets, and it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Private and public transportation will be dominated by Autonomous Vehicles (AV), which are safer than regular vehicles. However, ensuring good performance for the autonomous features requires fast processing of heavy tasks. Providing each AV with powerful computing resources may result in increased AV cost and decreased driving range. An alternative solution is to install low-power computing hardware on each AV and offload the heavy tasks to powerful nearby edge servers. In this case, the AV’s reaction time depends on how quickly the navigation tasks are completed in the edge server. To reduce task completion latency, the edge servers must be equipped with enough network and computing resources to handle the vehicle demands, which show large spatio-temporal variations. Thus, deploying the same resources in different locations may lead to unnecessary resource over-provisioning. In this paper, we leverage simulations using real traffic data to discuss the implications of deploying heterogeneous resources in different city areas to sustain peak versus average demand of edge-assisted AVs. Our analysis indicates that a reduction in network bandwidth and computing cores of up to 60% and 50%, respectively, is achieved by deploying edge resources for the average demand rather than peak demand. We also investigate how the peak-hour demand affects the safe travel time of AVs and find that it can be reduced by approximately 20% if they would be rerouted to areas with a lower edge-resource load. Thus, future research must consider that traditional turn-by-turn navigation systems may not provide the fastest routes for edge-assisted AVs.},

  abstract     = {The third generation BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS-3) can provide high-accuracy service for vehicle-borne positioning and navigation. The performance of BDS-3 in terms of accuracy, continuity, and reliability, however, are significantly degraded in environments with weak satellite observability. To improve the positioning performance of BDS-3 around the partial and complete signal-blocked areas, this paper presents a multi-sensor and analytical constraints tightly augmented BDS-3 Real-time Kinematic (RTK). The Non-holonomic Constraint (NHC), vehicle-odometer, and dual-antenna-based attitude constraints applied to restrain the drift of the position estimate from Inertial Measurement Units (IMU). Compared to previous work, it’s the first time to reveal that the Ambiguity Resolution (AR) performance of RTK can be augmented by integrating these measurements. To validate the performance of this proposed method, the drifts of position and attitude during the poor satellite observability and the impacts of those sensors and constraints on ambiguity fixing are analyzed based on an urban vehicle-borne test. The test results illustrate that the presented model brought 52.73%, 55.56%, and 49.44% positioning accuracy improvements in the north, east, and vertical components compared to the RTK mode. Meanwhile, 10.87% and 57.20% attitude accuracy enhancements in roll and heading were obtained compared to the traditional RTK/IMU tight integration mode.

  abstract     = {Rather than reducing losses after an accident, identifying critical accident factors is a better approach because it can be used to prevent accidents. Hazard materials (HAZMAT) road transportation is a complex sociotechnical system that involves three major procedures. Staff, vehicles, and tanks directly participate in this transport system, while different companies and government departments manage or supervise personnel and equipment. Moreover, all these stakeholders must obey ten types of industrial standards or regulations. The accident investigation reports contain the critical factors of the accident. Specifically, using a series of natural language processing (NLP) technologies, the accident causes in 137 Chinese reports are extracted, classified, and formatted. Then, a Bayesian network (BN) is constructed using the structural restrictions learning algorithm based on structured accident data from the reports. Finally, critical accident factors are revealed through sensitivity analysis of the BN. The results show that inadequate or delayed operation, which includes subordinate management factors and supervision factors, is the most critical factor among the five factors grouped. Actual accident data can explain the results. Combining the actual data and accident model, the accident analysis approach proposed in this paper considers the structural relations and frequency of accident factors.},

The proposed approach estimates the ship speed and heading in three steps, including ship detection, tracking, and data fusion. First, the ship target, together with its center coordinate, is detected by introducing the background subtraction detector in each radar image. Second, the ship position in one frame is mapped to the consecutive frame, and ship trajectory distribution is established using the Kalman filter and Hungarian algorithms. Third, fuzzy logic is introduced to fuse data from radar and AIS. Specifically, input variables include two parameters, which are the ship speed/heading difference in consecutive frames using radar and AIS, respectively. The variance of ship speed distribution is 1.30 at 10s sampling frequency, and the variance of ship heading distribution is 26.53, the experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can accurately estimate ship speed and heading in the radar sequential images of the Yangtze River. The strength of the proposed approach is its capability to estimate the ship speed and heading quantitatively from radar sequential images, which is interactive and interpretable for VTS operators.},

State-of-the-art object SLAM algorithms rely on assumptions and are sensitive to observation noise, limiting their application in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel object SLAM system that utilizes a quadric initialization algorithm based on constrained quadric optimization, which does not rely on planar assumptions and is robust to partial observations. Additionally, we introduce an automatic object data association algorithm capable of detecting motion states while associating objects across frames. To further enhance the accuracy of the quadric mapping, an extra thread is used to refine the ellipsoid parameters within a local sliding window composed of keyframes. Our system utilizes a joint optimization framework that optimizes camera poses, object landmarks, and point clouds in the local mapping thread for further global optimization while maintaining a consistent map. Experimental results on the real-world KITTI dataset show that the proposed system is more robust and significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in quadric initialization and mapping in outdoor scenarios. Moreover, our system achieves real-time performance, making it suitable for practical applications.},

In this work, a hierarchical vehicle behavior prediction framework is proposed to incorporate the traffic signal information and model the interaction between vehicles. The framework predicts vehicle behaviors in two stages, discrete intention prediction and continuous trajectory prediction. In the discrete intention prediction stage, Bayesian network is adopted to provide a high-level behavior prediction of the principle other vehicle. The discrete prediction results are forwarded to the second stage, where a continuous trajectory is predicted with maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning and potential game. The framework is designed to be able to capture the difference among human drivers with parameterized driver characteristics. The proposed predictor is validated in two scenarios: the yellow light running scenario and the right-turn scenario. The trajectory prediction average displacement error of the yellow light running scenario is 0.695m for a 3-second prediction interval, and the prediction accuracy of the right-turn vehicle in the right-turn scenario is 0.51m for a 2-second prediction interval.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are gradually being introduced in the transportation sector to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, short range and inadequate recharging facilities have hindered the widespread use of EVs. The tradeoff between the battery capacity and maximum load capacity makes it difficult to achieve the same range as that of a gasoline-powered vehicle. The EV range can be extended through dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT), in which power is transferred from a device containing power transmission coils laid on the road. In this system, the EVs can be powered without stopping, and the actual range relative to the battery capacity can be significantly extended, which in turn increases the maximum load capacity. Therefore, this study aims to develop an optimal DWPT deployment model for last-mile freight transport, explicitly considering the loading capacity of electric trucks, and discusses the relationship between DWPT placement and maximum payload capacity. A total cost minimization problem was formulated, which includes the operational and DWPT deployment costs for actual last-one-mile transportation networks in Tokyo. The results were compared with the total cost and required battery capacity without using DWPT systems. Subsequently, the effects of reducing the total cost and increasing the maximum load capacity were calculated. The results clearly reflect the tradeoff between the number of DWPT installations, battery capacity, and maximum load capacity. Moreover, the purchasing cost and DWPT system installation per location presented a greater influence on the optimal solution and cost structure compared to the battery cost per kWh.},

Due to the fact that the tire mechanical characteristics show highly nonlinear under those critical conditions, the piecewise affine (PWA) identification method is chosen in this work to model the tire nonlinear mechanical characteristics since it shows best model accuracy/simplicity compromise for system control design. On this basis, to properly reflect the coupling behaviors between longitudinal motion and lateral motion, the vehicle dynamics model which considers the tire nonlinear mechanical characteristics in the PWA form is established. By analyzing the phase plane of vehicle nonlinear model, a novel external yaw moment calculation method based on global fast terminal sliding mode (GFTSM) control method is applied to the upper layer of DYC architecture for eliminating the errors of yaw rate and sideslip angle. Then, different weight coefficients are allocated to obtain the final external yaw moment. In the lower controller, the optimal four-wheel torque is distributed according to a concise and accurate algorithm in which adaptive weight coefficients are considered. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in improving the driving stability performance of autonomous DDEV against two other control strategies under three extreme conditions.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) are vital for alleviating traffic congestion and improving traffic efficiency. Due to the delay of network transmission and failure of detectors, massive missing traffic data are often produced in ITSs, which evidently decreases the accuracy of decision-making in road traffic management. Hence, how establishing a precise and efficient estimation of missing traffic data becomes a hot yet thorny issue. Low-rank matrix completion (LR-MC) model has proven to be highly effective to address this issue owing to its fine representativeness of such high-dimensional and incomplete data. However, the existing LR-MC models mostly fail to model the inherently temporal and spatial correlations hidden in traffic network structure, resulting in low estimation accuracy. To improve it, this paper proposes a Hessian regularization spatio-temporal low rank (HRST-LR) algorithm with three main-fold ideas: a) imposing low-rank property into the global features of a traffic matrix for precisely learning its structure, b) capturing the temporal evolvement via a second-order difference of time-series constraint, and c) modeling the similar space of road segments through a Hessian regularization spatial constraint, thus exploring the local correlation between road segments for representing the spatial patterns in the traffic data. Experimental results on four traffic data sets prove that HRST-LR outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in the missing traffic data estimation with the root mean squared error improvements often higher than 14% when the missing rate is 90%. Hence, the HRST-LR algorithm is highly valuable for traffic data imputation with the need of performing spatio-temporal low-rank analysis.},

  abstract     = {With the success of Transformers in natural language processing, object detection with Transformers (DETR) has attracted widespread attentions. In previous Transformer-based 2D detectors, the object queries are a set of learning embeddings. However, it is very hard to apply these detectors to the 3D domain due to the lack of explicit physical meanings and position priors of learned object queries. In this paper, we introduce the concept of anchors and propose a novel query design based on anchor points. In our query design, we use the foreground points as the anchor points and encode these anchor points as the object queries. Consequently, each object query has an explicit physical meaning and only focus on its nearby object. Additionally, we also propose an instance-aware sampling strategy to select a small set of representation foreground points from the scene point cloud. Extensive experiments on several large-scale 3D object detection datasets demonstrate that the proposed AnchorPoint detector achieves promising accuracy and efficiency. In particularly, AnchorPoint achieves an average precision (AP) of 83.21 at 61 frame-per-second (FPS) on the moderate level of the KITTI-DET Car subset. Moreover, we model each object as its corresponding anchor point, and extend the AnchorPoint model to 3D multi-object tracking by adding an extra tracking head. We show that our method achieves comparable performance to existing state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI-MOT dataset.},

  abstract     = {Decarbonizing heavy-duty vehicles through electrification is a demanding task due to their large energy and power requirements. One promising solution to address this problem are electric road systems (ERS), which provide dynamic charging and traction power for electric vehicles. While their technological feasibility has been proven in numerous pilot projects, its reliability under realistic traffic scenarios is yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we define the reliability criteria for ERS and investigate how they are influenced by various realistic traffic scenarios. Then, the relationship between the ERS reliability criteria and the key system parameters such as the DC link voltage, distance between substations and feeding arrangement is analyzed. We find that the continuous current limit is the most critical criterion under heavy traffic conditions. Furthermore, we look into a number of run-time techniques to cope with electrical stress on the system and propose a technique based on successive approximation of the total current demand. We compare and evaluate the effectiveness of the run-time techniques and show that our proposed technique is able to improve ERS utilization while ensuring reliable operation.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at the problems of low matching accuracy and slow matching speed of high-frequency trajectory data in complex urban road networks, this paper proposes a matching method based on path increment. This method consists of two parts: combined filtering and incremental matching. Firstly, the road network is simplified through combined filtering, and then the incremental matching is carried out by taking the paths as increments. In the matching procedure, a comprehensive evaluation scheme of similarity based on distance factor and curvature is adopted. The above measures effectively reduce the impact of complex road segments on the matching results, while the path increment method enables the matching process to be executed more rapidly and accurately. The experiments were conducted using the Geolife datasets. The results show that our algorithm has obvious advantages over similar algorithms in terms of matching accuracy and efficiency, and shows good stability in road matching tests with different complexity.},

  abstract     = {Cross-spectrum depth estimation aims to provide a reliable depth map under variant-illumination conditions with a pair of dual-spectrum images. It is valuable for autonomous driving applications when vehicles are equipped with two cameras of different modalities. However, images captured by different-modality cameras can be photometrically quite different, which makes cross-spectrum depth estimation a very challenging problem. Moreover, the shortage of large-scale open-source datasets also retards further research in this field. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised visible light(VIS)-image-guided cross-spectrum (i.e., thermal and visible-light, TIR-VIS in short) depth-estimation framework. The input of the framework consists of a cross-spectrum stereo pair (one VIS image and one thermal image). First, we train a depth-estimation base network using VIS-image stereo pairs. To adapt the trained depth-estimation network to the cross-spectrum images, we propose a multi-scale feature-transfer network to transfer features from the TIR domain to the VIS domain at the feature level. Furthermore, we introduce a mechanism of cross-spectrum depth cycle-consistency to improve the depth estimation result of dual-spectrum image pairs. Meanwhile, we release to society a large cross-spectrum dataset with visible-light and thermal stereo images captured in different scenes. The experiment result shows that our method achieves better depth-estimation results than the compared existing methods.

  abstract     = {Reassignment strategies are of great significance to improve the dispatching efficiency of the ride-sourcing market by reassigning drivers and passengers. However, due to the focus on the feasibility of the reassignment strategy in the short period, previous studies ignore possible reassignment opportunities in the future and inevitably make short-sighted reassignment decisions. To fully exploit the effect of the reassignment strategy, this study proposes a two-stage reassignment framework, which integrates a reinforcement learning algorithm and the bilateral matching reassignment model. The Markov decision process is adopted to dynamically model the reassignment problem. In the framework, the reinforcement learning algorithm is utilized to first learn the randomness and dynamics of travel patterns from historical data and select vehicles participating in the reassignment process. Then, the bilateral matching reassignment model formulates the matching relationship after reassignment for passengers (drivers). Furthermore, for the cases where reassignment may increase individual matching distance, a personalized bilateral matching reassignment model is developed to avoid that. Experiments based on real data in Beijing found that learning passenger travel patterns and adjusting vehicle reassignment moments can greatly improve the passenger experience and reduce driving costs. The results also suggest that the efficiency of the reassignment strategy is influenced by the supply and demand conditions of the ride-sourcing system. This justifies that the framework can be applied to optimize the dispatching process, reduce carbon emissions, and build an eco-friendly travel system.},

We first give the generalized delay calculation model for a multi-hop path, and prove that the Dijkstra algorithm is unable to get the delay-minimized routing path from source to destination. Then we propose two routing methods: graph-based method and deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method. In the graph-based method, the network topology is reformulated as an equivalent graph and then an evolved-Dijkstra algorithm is proposed. In the DRL-based method, the deep Q network (DQN) is employed to learn the shortest end-to-end path, wherein the delay is modeled as the rewards for routing actions. The graph-based method can achieve the exact minimum end-to-end delay, while the DRL-based method is more feasible due to its acceptable complexity. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate that the DRL-based approach with proper hyper-parameters can achieve near minimum end-to-end delay, and the achieved delay has a notably decline as the number of FD nodes increases.},

Thus, passenger inflow control is proposed and implemented. This paper investigates the station-based passenger inflow control problem with the objective of maximizing overall transport efficiency and fairness. To solve the formulated nonlinear and nonconvex programming model, a novel framework integrating unsupervised subgoal discovery and hierarchical reinforcement learning, named SD-HIC, is proposed. With a series of subgoals, the complicated and long-horizon original task is decomposed and can be solved by reinforcement learning responsively and far-sightedly. A real-world case with operational data in the Guangzhou metro is presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model and framework. According to the results, the overall transport utility is improved by 28.87% compared with the benchmark inflow control strategy that is frequently used in daily operations. Through solution algorithm studies and critical parameter analyses, the performance of the proposed passenger inflow control framework is further verified. Notably, the revealed subgoals are also distinguishable and interpretable, which is helpful for the operation staff in practice.},

A finite time robust estimator (FTRE) is presented to estimate the practically unknown acceleration and mismatched disturbance of adjacent vehicles. In addition, the matched disturbance in the vehicle is also compensated for to further ensure the robustness of the platoon control. A modified constant time headway (MCTH) policy that removes the influence of the initial spacing and velocity error is defined to improve the transient response of the platoon control. Two robust platoon control methods, a nonlinear disturbance observer (DOB)-based ISMC and an adaptive dual-layer super-twisting ISMC (STISMC), are proposed. The proposed methods based on the nonlinear DOB and ISMC are more effective against highly nonlinear disturbances than the existing linear DOB-based methods and the disturbances can be compensated at all times by eliminating the reaching mode, unlike the exiting SMC-based methods. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive dual-layer STISMC provides a continuous control input that guarantees the finite time convergence of the sliding mode variables to zero without requiring an upper bound on disturbance. Both simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the superior platoon control performance of the adaptive dual-layer STISMC method compared to both the existing linear DOB-based robust platoon control method using ISMC and the nonlinear DOB-based ISMC method.},

Coordinated charging and schedule optimization with seized demand response opportunities are well-known conceptual solutions to that. Still, the main challenge is to adequately predict availability and parameters of electric vehicles which is crucial for determining the charging schedule and the demand response potential. We propose a method to represent a population of electric vehicles that on the one hand enables prediction via machine learning and on the other it enables an accurate optimization of the charging schedule and demand response ability. The method essence is to use five discrete-time signals spanned over a prediction horizon period which are related to envelopes of feasible charging power and charging states for the EV population on that horizon. We also introduce a robust conversion of any sequence of these signals into individual EVs data. It enables to pose and solve the optimization problem of charging scheduling with included demand response for a predicted population in the introduced representation. The proposed method is validated by schedule optimization using first the original data and then using reconstructed population data. The validation results show that the proposed EV population representation method preserves the valuable information needed for the charging schedule optimization and demand response.},

  abstract     = {Urban region heat refers to the extent of which people congregate in various regions when they travel to and stay in a specified place. Predicting urban region heat facilitates broad applications ranging from location-based services to intelligent transportation management. The region heat is essentially characterized by the ‘arrive-stay-leave (ASL)’ behaviors, while it is a challenging task to well capture the spatial-temporal evolution of region heat since the following issues remain: i) ASL behaviors of private cars is usually heterogeneous resulting in a hierarchical distribution of region heat. ii) Urban region heat contains complex spatial-temporal correlations hidden in ASL behaviors and how to collaboratively integrate them is challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Network (HierSTNet) to forecast urban region heat, which contains two representations, namely, grid region from micro perspective and node region from macro perspective. For the grids, three-dimension spatial and temporal convolutional network (3D-STCNN) is proposed to model multi-scale properties in temporal dimension of ASL behaviors. For the nodes, multi-head graph attention networks are utilized to model the periodicity and spatial heterogeneity among macro region. Hierarchical structures are designed for multi-view modeling spatial-temporal distribution of ASL behaviors, by which they capture small-scale features in micro regions and embeds the global representation into graph propagation. Finally, we design an interaction decoder layer to integrate the external factors and aggregate spatial-temporal information across hierarchical structures. Extensive experiments based on real-world private car trajectory dataset demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of proposed framework.},

Furthermore, we demonstrate the global asymptotic stability of the proposed controller through a novel Lyapunov analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated via simulation experiments, where the estimator is integrated into a feedback ramp-metering control strategy, employing a second-order multi-lane macroscopic traffic flow model, modified to account for time-varying FDs.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the cruise control problem of unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) platoons from the implementation perspective. Unlike most existing works related to platoon cruise control which rely on positioning infrastructures such as lane markings, roadside units, and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), this paper explores a new problem: platoon cruise control in environments without positioning infrastructures. The introduction of this constraint disables most existing cruise control approaches. To address this problem, an integrated localization and planning framework is proposed, which is composed of three modular algorithms. Firstly, to localize multiple vehicles in a common coordinate system, a collaborative localization algorithm is developed through matching local perceptions of different vehicles. Secondly, to maintain the desired platoon configuration, the historical trajectory of the preceding vehicle is reconstructed, based on which the target state is planned for the following vehicle. Finally, a virtual controller based algorithm is designed to generate feasible trajectories for the following vehicle in real time. The proposed framework has two salient features. Firstly, it does not depend on positioning infrastructures and does not introduce additional positioning sensors, such as GNSS/INS modules, ultra-wideband (UWB) devices, magnetic meters and so on, as long as each vehicle is equipped with a perception sensor (Lidar, radar or camera), which however is essential equipment for nowaday autonomous systems. Secondly, the proposed framework does not depend on direct observations between vehicles to achieve relative localization, making it applicable in non-line-of-sight (non-LOS) situations. Real-world experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness, robustness and practicality of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Uncontrolled intersections with interaction and uncertainties are challenging for autonomous vehicles (AV) to manage. In this work, we propose a decision-making model specific to intersections with emphasis on three aspects. First, behavior estimation of the social vehicles’ (SVs) is essential for risk avoidance. We try to improve prediction accuracy by predicting the intentions and driving styles of SVs in advance and doing adaptive goal sampling. Second, the uncertainty from the prediction results should be considered in the decision-making process. For this, a risk-aware framework is developed, composed of a Subordinate Driver (SD) and a Primary Driver (PD) for decision-making and planning. Particularly, in SD, the prediction-guided strategy tree is built to search for an optimal strategy with observation and action branch trimming, which employs the prediction results for risk assessment. In PD, to mimic the both-way negotiation among vehicles, the level-k game model is deployed to determine the action in the players’ best interest and update the estimation of driving styles. Third, the generated maneuver is required to be evaluated in a closed-loop simulation. A ‘semi-autonomous’ control model is designed, which is a combination of the dataset and the stochastic sampling model. The results of ablation experiments verify the function of each module. The case studies and comparison experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in highly interactive intersections.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a hierarchical model for cooperative on-ramp merging control (CORMC) in mixed traffic with both connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and connected human-driven vehicles (CHVs). The upper-layer of the CORMC model employs an anticipatory position searching (APS) algorithm to determine the anticipatory positions at which merging vehicles (MVs) should merge from the on-ramp lane to the adjacent mainline lane, and to assign cooperative vehicles (CVs) for each MV. A collaborative utility choice (CUC) model is presented to determine the optimal maneuver of CVs to create proper gaps for MVs. The driver compliance rate is introduced to account for CHVs’ unwillingness to follow the instructions given by the CUC model. The lower-layer comprises a cooperative merging control (CMC) model that ensures safe and smooth merging execution for MVs. Longitudinal and lane changing models are developed for mainline vehicles to facilitate an efficient and safe merging process. Simulation results show that the performance benefits of the CUC model are marginal when the CHV compliance rate is relatively low. However, the performance improvement is significant at higher compliance rates ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$&amp;gt;$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; 50%). Furthermore, the CORMC model has the potential to increase merging and mainline throughput by over 75% at sufficiently high CAV penetration rates. Comparison of three control strategies shows that the APS algorithm plays an important role in the CORMC model. A comparison with the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) indicates that the CORMC model significantly mitigates the propagation of congestion waves across varying levels of CAV penetration and on-ramp flow rates.},

  abstract     = {Real-time and accurate 3-D object detection is one of the foundational technologies for environmental perception in autonomous vehicles. However, the existing second-stage anchor-based 3-D object detection algorithms have high accuracy, but they are challenging in terms of computation complexity and latency. Due to poor perception of spatial features, the accuracy of the existing single-stage anchor-free detection algorithms with low latency are difficult to be implemented into autonomous vehicles. Therefore, we focus on enhancing the spatial perception ability of the anchor-free detection network based on CenterPoints. In this paper, we propose a single-stage anchor-free 3-D object detector CenterPoint-Space-Enhancement (CenterPoint-SE) algorithm and construct an efficient 3-D backbone network to extract fine-grained spatial geometric features by introducing a spatial attention mechanism and residual structure. At the same time, a powerful spatial semantic feature fusion module, the enhancement of feature fusion (EF-Fusion), is designed. In addition, we add a lightweight IoU prediction branch to improve the algorithm’s perception of various object sizes. Finally, we add a foreground point segmentation auxiliary training branch to enable the 3-D backbone to obtain object boundary features. We use the ONCE dataset to train and validate the proposed model, and the results showed that the proposed CenterPoint-SE achieves 70.33 mAP and an inference speed of 17.15 FPS, outperforming other methods.},

  abstract     = {Snow is one of the toughest adverse weather conditions for object detection (OD). Currently, not only there is a lack of snowy OD datasets to train cutting-edge detectors, but also these detectors have difficulties of learning latent information beneficial for detection in snow. To alleviate the two above problems, we first establish a real-world snowy OD dataset, named RSOD. Besides, we develop an unsupervised training strategy with a distinctive activation function, called &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$Peak Act$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , to quantitatively evaluate the effect of snow on each object. Peak Act helps grade the images in RSOD into four-difficulty levels. To our knowledge, RSOD is the first quantitatively evaluated and graded real-world snowy OD dataset. Then, we propose a novel Cross Fusion (CF) block to construct a lightweight OD network based on YOLOv5s (called CF-YOLO). CF is a plug-and-play feature aggregation module, which integrates the advantages of Feature Pyramid Network and Path Aggregation Network in a simpler yet more flexible form. Both RSOD and CF lead our CF-YOLO to possess an optimization ability for OD in real-world snow. That is, CF-YOLO can handle unfavorable detection problems of vagueness, distortion and covering of snow. Experiments show that our CF-YOLO achieves better detection results on RSOD, compared to SOTAs. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/qqding77/CF-YOLO-and-RSOD .},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Crowdsensing (VCS) aims to collect sensing data over a range of areas using a large number of on-board sensors and resources in intelligent vehicles. The mobility of vehicles allows for large-scale mobile sensing data, but it remains a challenging problem to recruit the right participating vehicles and to actively maximize the sensing benefits. In this paper, we formulate the vehicle recruitment problem as the maximizing completion rate with limited budget problem (MCRLB) and prove that it is NP-complete. A hybrid recruitment scheme based on deep learning in vehicular crowdsensing (HR-DLVCS) is proposed in this paper, which consists of two phases: an opportunistic vehicle recruitment phase and a participatory vehicle recruitment phase. In the first phase, a deep learning-based opportunistic vehicle recruitment algorithm (DL-OVR) is proposed to maximize the sensing task completion rate within a limited budget. It aims to recruit the most suitable vehicles to collect sensing data according to their daily movement patterns. In the second phase, a sensing task density-based participatory vehicle recruitment algorithm (STD-PVR) is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of matching vehicles with uncompleted sensing tasks. It is designed to recruit vehicles to arrive at designated locations to complete the sensing tasks within a given budget. Extensive evaluations based on a real-world dataset show that HR-DLVCS achieves higher sensing task completion rate than other baseline approaches in a variety of settings.},

  abstract     = {Localization in unknown environments is an essential requirement for vision navigation of robotic vehicles in intelligent transportation systems. However, moving objects in dynamic scenarios usually bring about great difficulty for robot localization, because motion estimation of robotic vehicles is disturbed by increasing feature outliers caused by moving objects. In order to improve the accuracy and robustness of robot localization, a novel saliency-induced moving object detection (SMOD) approach is proposed to filter out feature outliers for RGB-D-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in complex dynamic workspaces. Firstly, three complementary motion saliency potentials, including motion energy (ME), spatiotemporal objectness (STO), and dynamic superpixels (DS), are modeled by fully analyzing spatial, temporal, appearance and depth cues in RGB-D inputs. They can be used to identify the dynamic objects effectively from diversely changing backgrounds. Then, a superpixel-level graph-based motion saliency (MS) measure is proposed to generate the MS map for reliable localization of the moving objects. The edge weights and background nodes on the graph are determined reasonably by fusing ME, STO, and DS, which is not vulnerable to background interferences. Furthermore, the SMOD approach is embedded into the front-end of ORB-SLAM3 as a pre-processing stage, in order to filter out feature outliers associated with the moving objects. Finally, the extensive experiments are performed to verify the accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach on the public dynamic datasets. The experimental results show that the SMOD method can detect the moving objects effectively in a variety of challenging dynamic environments, and separate the dynamic regions reliably from the irrelevant background. The data comparison demonstrates that the SMOD-SLAM navigation system can outperform other state-of-the-art dynamic visual SLAM (vSLAM) systems.},

  abstract     = {Air-to-ground (A2G) communication based on Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is an important part of the future communication system. In this paper, an A2G channel model with UAV three-dimensional (3D) wobbles (pitch, roll, and yaw) based on the geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) is proposed. On this basis, the UAV’s internal vibration is modeled as a sinusoidal random process, and the UAV wobble caused by the atmospheric flow is modeled as the uniform distribution random process. We derive the channel temporal correlation function (CF) with UAV 3D wobbles, analyze the variation of the temporal CF with different carrier frequencies, and amplitudes of the wobble angles. It is found that, even if the UAV wobbles slightly, the channel temporal correlation will be significantly affected. Numerical results show that the channel CF will decrease rapidly with the increase of the amplitudes of wobble angles and the carrier frequency. Therefore, the coherence time of millimeter wave (mmWave) band is significantly less than that of sub-6 GHz band. The consistency of simulation results and measurement results in published papers ensures the availability of the proposed model. For the MUAVs scenario, when the distance between different UAVs is much greater than the wavelength, the A2G channels between different UAVs and user equipment (UE) on the ground are not correlated to each other, and the temporal auto-correlation function (ACF) of each UAV is the same as that of the SUAV scenario.

This article aims to improve road quality assessment systems by overcoming the constraint of fixed window size and taking into account the real-world scenario of variable-length events. First, we annotate a big heterogeneous data set without partitioning it into fixed-size windows. Second, we suggest two distinct approaches for detecting and characterizing anomalies utilizing deep learning architectures comprising Bi-Directional LSTM units. The first strategy is sequence classification (using a many to one correspondence to classify the entire sequence), and the second approach is endpoint detection (classify each time step as a normal or anomalous event using a many to many approach). The solutions presented in this article are intended for use with non-anomalous (normal) signals as well as with four distinct types of anomalies: cat-eyes, manholes, potholes, and speed bumps. Our sequence classification model (Bi-LSTM model) is capable of detecting anomalies with a 97.3% True Positive Rate when the anomalies are considered a positive class. On the other hand, our end-point detection framework is able to mark the exact end-point of anomalous signals with a true positive rate of 90.2% as shown in II.

However, such crack detection task still remains unexpectedly challenging in practice since the appearance of both cracks and the background are diverse and complex in real scenarios. In this work, we propose an automatic pavement crack detection method via synergizing low rank representation (LRR) and deep learning techniques. First, leveraging LRR which facilitates anomaly detection without making any specific assumption, we can easily discriminate most of the frames with cracks from the long sequence with a consistent pavement base, followed by a straightforward algorithm to localize the cracks. In order to achieve the intelligence of detecting cracks with different pavement basis under unconstrained imaging conditions, we resort to deep learning techniques and propose a deep convolutional neural network for crack detection leveraging on multi-level features and atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP). We train this network based on the training data obtained in the previous stage in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on a wide range of pavements demonstrate the high performance in terms of both accuracy and automaticity. Moreover, the dataset generated by us is much more extensive and challenging than public ones. We put it online at https://gaozhinuswhu.com to benefit the community.},

Firstly, a joint optimization method to ensure vehicle and employee balance is proposed, where the variation of the number of vehicles, customers and employees is described by fluid models, while the charging process of electric vehicles at charging stations is modeled by an M/M/S queue. Then, the well-posedness and equilibrium of the fluid model are proven, and the minimum fleet size and employee size for the system to reach equilibrium is given.

In this paper, an optimal trajectory planning algorithm is presented in order to minimise motion sickness in automated vehicles. A predefined path is provided as an input to the algorithm, to generate an optimal path with limited lateral deviation and the corresponding optimal velocity profile, for the minimisation of motion sickness. An optimal control problem is formulated with a cost function combining both motion sickness and travel time. For a sickening curvy road, the algorithm reduced the motion sickness dose value (MSDV) up to 52% depending on the allowed lateral deviation and the weighting on travel time. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated via human-in-the-loop experiments using a moving-base driving simulator. Motion cueing parameters were selected to optimally transmit the sickening stimuli resulting in close to full vibration transmission above 0.2 Hz. During the experiment, the participants were asked to rate their experience based on the standard MIsery SCore ratings. According to these, sickness levels were reduced on average by 65% with reduced motion sickness in all 16 participants.},

  abstract     = {Automated driving offers excellent opportunities for ecology, economy as well as society. Especially in urban intersections, there is a considerable margin for benefits in these sectors. This work takes a structured simulation approach to find answers on the benefit of additional information about surrounding objects of automated vehicles provided by roadside ITS stations to utilize collective perception. We are using advanced sub-microscopic 3D hardware in the loop simulation framework to generate data based on which we can achieve reliable conclusions. Our simulation data set, consisting of 400 simulation iterations, suggests that automated vehicles greatly benefit from collective perception. A lack of roadside ITS station support might lead to a disruptive impact of automated vehicles on the macroscopic traffic flow of urban road networks. If roadside collective perception is introduced to the problem, maneuver time is reduced, and traffic efficiency is increased by 19.8% on average.},

Meanwhile, existing strategies generally require a fully connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) environment. To fill up the gaps, this study contributes to a two-dimensional (spatiotemporal) control strategy by jointly optimizing traffic signals, lane settings, and vehicle trajectories at isolated signalized intersections under the mixed traffic of connected automated and human-driven vehicles. Specifically, based on the pseudo-platoons, signal timing plans and settings of approach lanes are jointly optimized by a piece-wise linear programming model. Then, vehicle trajectory control is integrated into the collaborative control framework to smooth vehicle trajectories. Three groups of numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed control method. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the actuated control in terms of vehicle travel time under both under-saturated and over-saturated traffic conditions.},

  abstract     = {Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) is a significant task in autonomous driving. Nonetheless, relying on one single sensor is not robust enough, because one modality tends to fail in some challenging situations. Texture information from RGB cameras and 3D structure information from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) have respective advantages under different circumstances. Therefore, feature fusion from multiple modalities contributes to the learning of discriminative features. However, it is nontrivial to achieve effective feature fusion due to the completely distinct information modality. Previous fusion methods usually fuse the top-level features after the backbones extract the features from different modalities. The feature fusion happens solely once, which limits the information interaction between different modalities. In this paper, we propose multi-scale interactive query and fusion between pixel-wise and point-wise features to obtain more discriminative features. In addition, an attention mechanism is utilized to conduct soft feature fusion between multiple pixels and points to avoid inaccurate match problems of previous single pixel-point fusion methods. We introduce PointNet++ to obtain multi-scale deep representations of point clouds and make it adaptive to our proposed interactive feature fusion between multi-scale features of images and point clouds. Through the interaction module, each modality can integrate more complementary information from the other modality. Besides, we explore the effectiveness of pre-training on each single modality and fine-tuning on the fusion-based model. Our method can achieve 90.32% MOTA and 72.44% HOTA on the KITTI benchmark and outperform other approaches without using multi-scale soft feature fusion.},

  abstract     = {Automotive radar sensors are widely used in vehicles so as to allow the “advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS)” to work. As far as we are concerned, no mandatory regulations were established so far for interference control in the cases where multiple vehicles equipped with automotive radars exist in close proximity. Consequently, those inter-vehicle cross-interference easily result in the radar performance degradation, e.g. incapability of target detection and identification. In this paper, an interference suppression algorithm is proposed which utilizes two Recursive-Least-Square (RLS) adaptive filters to estimate, the interference signals caused by the “aggressor” radar and the echo signals from the “ego” radar. The algorithm operates in the iterative mode with its initial input being the originally received beat signals involving interference. In each iteration, the estimates of the interference signals and of the clean signals are calculated sequentially by the two RLS filters, and the beat signal is updated with parts of the fragments substituted with their interference-mitigated counterparts. Such iterative operations stop when the convergence criterion, e.g. none of the fragments in the beat signals are considered being interfered, is achieved or the iteration number reaches the limit predefined due to the practical constraints. Simulation and measurement results demonstrate that the proposed dual-RLS-based algorithm outperforms the existing methods in terms of lower interference-to-signal ratio resultant and superior capability of retrieving the original range-Doppler profile.},

To address these issues, this paper proposes a bargaining game-based HMSD control authority allocation strategy for a steer-by-wire vehicle. First, two types of lateral path tracking controllers are developed to simulate the human driver and the automatic steering system. Then, a bargaining game-based HMSD control authority allocation strategy is created using the Nash bargaining solution. Finally, a Simulink/CARSIM co-simulation platform and a driver-in-the-loop experimental bench are utilized to verify the proposed strategy. The results show that the proposed bargaining game-based HMSD control authority allocation strategy has potential advantages over existing game-based HMSD, including decoupling of human-machine interaction, lower requirements for automated steering controllers, and feasible game modeling ability. Moreover, the proposed strategy demonstrates excellent performance in terms of shared driving, which extends the applicability of HMSD in various operating maneuvers. Both the human driver and the automatic steering system benefit from the proposed HMSD system, which could increase the acceptance and trustworthiness of the human driver with the HMSD system and reduce the human driving load to make the driver-vehicle interaction more reliable and smoother.},

Moreover, many applications, like temporary network provision, require continuous backhaul fleet connectivity. This work simultaneously addresses UAVs’ path planning and routing issues to propose connectivity-aware path planning for a fleet of UAVs in an urban environment. The proposed scheme is a graph-based offline path planning with fleet line formation that ensures continuous backhaul connectivity. This feature allows any UAV to play the role of leader and guide the entire fleet according to a desired speed. Thanks to the continuous backhaul connectivity, the Base Station (BS) can disseminate commands to the connected fleet as required. Fleet line formation acts as a backbone network and allows additional UAVs or ground users to become a part of this network. The proposed approach is implemented in MATLAB’s UAV Toolbox and evaluated in a network simulator. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides collision-free trajectories while ensuring continuous BS connectivity.},

  abstract     = {The free-floating bike-sharing system enables users to pick up bikes from everywhere. However, the spatial-temporal imbalance of bikes becomes severer in such systems. Consequently, bikes are sometimes not available at desired location and time, and the pick-up demand of users is truncated. On demand truncation, the bike user would either give up using the bike or migrate to the nearby to pick up the bike. Thus, the demand of bikes observed from smart locks does not equate with the real demand. However, capturing the real demand is crucial for system planning and operation. Therefore, a statistical model, namely the demand truncation and migration Poisson (DTMP) model, is proposed to analyze the real demand. It is able to jointly model the real demand of FFBS and the migration behavior of users. In particular, we analyzed the demand truncation and migration processes to establish the relationship between the expected value of observed demand and that of real demand. Then, the real demand of using bikes was assumed to be related to the influential factors and the demand function was formulated. Subsequently, the likelihood for each observation was established. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated through field-testing data. The results revealed that the proposed DTMP model is superior to the baseline Poisson model from both the fitness and accuracy perspectives. Finally, the spatial-temporal distribution of the real demand and unmet demand of bikes in typical hours are presented. The results can guide the efficient management of the bike-sharing system.},

This study proposed a prediction-planning collaboration method for autonomous vehicles to avoid collisions with moving pedestrians by predicting their motions, and generate feasible trajectories based on Frenet coordinate in shared spaces. Pre-crash scenarios were designed based on reported crashes, and simulations were performed to evaluate the collision avoidance performances of the proposed method.

Different from existing work focusing on optimizing the control in either traffic light signal (to improve the intersection throughput), or vehicle speed (to stabilize the traffic), this paper presents a multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) system called CoTV, which Cooperatively controls both Traffic light signals and Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAV). Therefore, our CoTV can well balance the reduction of travel time, fuel, and emissions. CoTV is also scalable to complex urban scenarios by cooperating with only one CAV that is nearest to the traffic light controller on each incoming road. This avoids costly coordination between traffic light controllers and all possible CAVs, thus leading to the stable convergence of training CoTV under the large-scale multi-agent scenario. We describe the system design of CoTV and demonstrate its effectiveness in a simulation study using SUMO under various grid maps and realistic urban scenarios with mixed-autonomy traffic.},

Results confirm that the control accuracy of the proposed controller is generally over 80% across all CAV Penetration Rates, demand levels (v/c ratio) and target demand drops (within 20%). A case study is presented to demonstrate the benefit of applying the proposed controller on a bottleneck. By preventing the onset of a breakdown and, along with it, a capacity drop, the proposed controller is able to increase the flow rate by 6%, reduce the number of stops by up to 90% and delay by approximately 5%.},

  abstract     = {A variety of longitudinal control systems employing predictive information provide a long-term velocity profile that minimizes the cost term consisting of the superposition of energy, ride comfort and travel time. The profile can be determined by discrete dynamic programming (DDP) with a three-dimensional state space, resulting in unacceptable high computation times for real-time applications. Previous studies have used DDP with two dimensions to reduce computation time. This approach, however, leads to suboptimal solutions when the maximal velocity varies. We present an iterative algorithm called waterfilling that finds the same solution as three-dimensional DDP for arbitrary velocity limitations, while its computational complexity is orders of magnitude lower that that of DDP with two dimensions. The waterfilling algorithm minimizes the energy at the wheels and reaches the upcoming traffic light at a given point in time. For vehicles powered by an internal combustion engine, the waterfilling algorithm is extended by an efficient traffic light approach unit that avoids low vehicle velocities to increase engine efficiency. The long-term planning unit is succeeded by a short-term planning unit that handles dynamic traffic and incorporates the fuel-saving pulse and glide driving strategy. The longitudinal control system developed in this paper is validated within a dynamic simulation environment with variable traffic density and compared with a longitudinal control system employing model-predictive control. For mild-hybrid electric vehicles, the developed system achieves fuel savings of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$20\,\%$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; at low traffic densities.

The success and popularity of Electric Vehicles (EVs) have led many carmakers to shift to developing clean cars in the next decade. Moreover, many countries around the globe have set aggressive EV target adoption numbers, with some even aiming to ban gasoline cars by 2050. Unlike their gasoline-based counterparts, EVs comprise many sensors, communication channels, and decision-making components vulnerable to cyberattacks. Hence, the unprecedented demand for EVs requires developing robust defenses against these increasingly sophisticated attacks. In particular, recently proposed cyberattacks demonstrate how malicious owners may mislead EV charging networks by sending false data to unlawfully receive higher charging priorities, congest charging schedules, and steal power. This paper proposes a learning-based detection model that can identify deceptive electric vehicles. The model is trained on an original dataset using real driving traces and a malicious dataset generated from a reinforcement learning agent. The Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent is trained to create intelligent and stealthy attacks that can evade simple detection rules while also giving a malicious EV high charging priority. We evaluate the effectiveness of the generated attacks compared to handcrafted attacks. Moreover, our detection model trained with RL-generated attacks displays greater robustness to intelligent and stealthy attacks.},

Because frequent data exchange occurs in open environments, VANETs are inherently vulnerable to security and privacy attacks. In history, many certificateless aggregate signature (CLAS) schemes with conditional privacy-preserving (CPP) have been proposed to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the exchanged data and protect users’ privacy. However, we reveal that the state-of-the-art schemes cannot be deployed in practical VANET applications by proposing concrete signature forgery attacks. To this end, we propose a new CLAS-based authentication scheme with CPP for VANETs. The rigorous security proofs based on the standard cryptographic assumption show that the scheme has enhanced security. Moreover, theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation illustrate the practicality of our design.},

The forecasting for electric vehicle charging load, especially for the charging load of EV charging stations, is of significant importance for the safe operation of power grids. However, most of the existing forecasting methods fail to capture the long-term dependencies efficiently and assume the availability of a large amount of training data. Hence, they cannot address newly built charging stations with scarce historical charging load data. Meanwhile, most of the methods focus on point forecasting, which lacks risk consideration. In this work, we aim to leverage the benefits of Transformer-based models for EV charging forecasting. Specifically, we propos Probformer, a Transformer-based forecasting model for charging load forecasting. To enable Probformer to adapt fast to unseen environments, we further extend it to MetaProbformer, a meta-learning-based forecasting framework. Extensive experiments have been done on real-world datasets for both point forecasting and probabilistic forecasting. Experimental results show that our methods can consistently outperform baseline methods by a large margin.},

Recent work has shown that high-accuracy disparity maps can be obtained with end-to-end training with the help of deep convolutional neural networks from stereo images. However, many of these methods suffer from long run-time for real-time studies. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce P3SNet, which can generate both real-time results and competitive disparity maps to the state-of-the-art. P3SNet architecture consists of two main modules: parallel pyramid pooling and hierarchical disparity aggregation. The parallel pyramid pooling structure makes it possible to obtain local and global information intensively from its multi-scale features. The hierarchical disparity aggregation provides multi-scale disparity maps by using a coarse-to-fine training strategy with the help of the costs obtained from multi-scale features. The proposed approach was evaluated on several benchmark datasets. The results on all datasets showed that the proposed P3SNet achieved better or competitive results while having lower runtime.

Additionally, to guarantee the safety during lane-change of AVs, an artificial potential field model is built for collision risk assessment. Further, a human-like driving model is designed, which integrates the brain emotional learning circuit model (BELCM) with a two-point preview model.

  abstract     = {Shortest path problem has been successfully applied in numerous domains. Unfortunately, its complexity increases drastically when several objective criteria must be considered. Apart from the relatively slow classic search algorithms, attempts to accelerate multicriteria shortest path search are mostly represented by goal-directed one-to-one search methods and pruning heuristics. The one-to-many version of the problem is rarely addressed, though it arises in various scenarios, such as multi-stop planning and dynamic rerouting. This paper introduces a novel algorithm combination designed for fast one-to-many multicriteria shortest path search. A preprocessing algorithm excludes irrelevant vertices by building a smaller cover graph. A modified version of the multicriteria label-setting algorithm operates on the cover graph and employs a dimensionality reduction technique for swifter domination checks. While the method itself maintains solution optimality, it is able to additionally incorporate existing heuristics for further speedups. Additionally, its operation is not limited to bicriteria cases and requires no modifications to incorporate a higher number of criteria. The proposed algorithm was tested on multiple criteria combinations of varying correlation and compared to existing one-to-one shortest path search techniques. The results show the introduced approach provides a speedup of at least 3 times on simple criteria combinations and at least over 24 times on hard instances compared to standard multicriteria label-setting, while outperforming existing one-to-one algorithms in terms of scalability. Apart from the speedup provided, graph preprocessing also reduces memory requirements of queries by up to 13 times.},

However, the case of extended target tracking in a multipath environment (e.g., tracking a submarine using a high resolution sonar, tracking a vehicle in an urban environment using an imaging radar) has not been adequately addressed. If the multipath detections from a single target can be modeled and used properly, better tracking performance can be obtained in terms of accuracy, false tracks and computing time. By integrating the Random Matrix (RM) theory and the random finite set (RFS) theory, an extension of the Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter, called MP-ET-PHD, is proposed in this paper to address the multitarget tracking problem with an unknown number of targets in an uncertain multipath environment with clutter. In the proposed framework, a novel multipath measurement update equation is formulated and derived. Also, a Gaussian Mixture (GM) implementation of the proposed MP-ET-PHD is presented for practical applications. Simulation results show that the proposed MP-ET-PHD can effectively handle multipath detections and yield improved tracking performance over the traditional single-path extended target trackers.},

  abstract     = {In the context of establishing emission control areas (ECAs) in many ports to meet the challenges posed by air pollution, the use of drone-carrying sniffers to perform emission monitoring missions has become a new monitoring mode for ECAs. The operational management problem of drones in ECAs, namely, drone scheduling problem (DSP), is eliciting the attention of researchers. To consider the influence of vessel traffic on the demand for drones, this study proposes a rental-based drone operation model. In the model, the number of drones used depends on the load of monitoring missions. Maximizing the cumulative monitoring reward and minimizing the use number of drones within the minimum monitoring rate constraint are used as optimization objectives to maximize the cost return of the rental-based operation model. The rental-based drone operation model is modeled as a multi-objective DSP (MDSP). Furthermore, we horizontally compare the characteristics of MDSP with those of many classical models in the field of operations research. Afterward, we reveal the similarities and differences between MDSP and previous models. We find that MDSP has the non-first-in-first-out property, whereas most of the advanced models have the first-in-first-out property, which leads to the failure of the developed efficient algorithms in solving MDSP. Therefore, this study innovatively designs four feasible multi-objective optimization methods for MDSP. Numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the four methods in solving MDSP with different scales. In terms of theoretical implications, experimental results prove that the proposed methods for solving MDSP are feasible and effective. In terms of practical implications, the proposed rental-based vessel monitoring operation model shows great potential for practical engineering.},

  abstract     = {With the growing number of cars in cities, smart parking is gradually becoming a strategic issue in building a smart city. As the precondition in smart parking, accurate parking prediction can reduce the time drivers spend searching for parking spaces and relieve traffic congestion. Meanwhile, VANET and the Internet-of-things (IoT) are the key elements of the current intelligent transportation system. With the IoT devices based on VANET becoming more extensively employed, a large amount of parking data is generated every day, and various methods are proposed for parking prediction, therefore, it is time to systematically summarize the parking prediction issues and the state-of-the-art prediction methods. In this survey, we first provide a comprehensive review of the existing methods used for parking prediction ranging from conventional statistical methods to the latest graph neural network methods. Then, we classify a variety of parking problems such as parking availability prediction, parking behavior prediction, and parking demand prediction. We also compile all the evaluation metrics, open data, and open-source code of the surveyed literature. Finally, we present the challenges and future directions of the parking prediction technique. As far as we know, this is the first survey exploring parking prediction methods, which will be of interest to both researchers and practitioners engaging in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and smart cities.},

  abstract     = {Powered-Two-Wheelers (PTW) riders’ fatalities are prevalent on bends outside built-up areas due to the complexity and instability of their vehicles: countermeasures require a better understanding of the rider-PTW interaction. Analysing riding data is effective but becomes challenging when using extensive datasets; segmenting the riding data would help identify events of interest, isolate specific manoeuvres and describe the riding session. Manual segmentation would be time-consuming and subjective; automation would be beneficial. This work proposed an automatic, unsupervised tool for segmenting and clustering signals acquired during a riding session for studying motorcycle lateral dynamics in-depth. The method only requires measuring the motorcycle roll angle. An expert rider completed a closed route using an instrumented motorcycle; the algorithm divided the time series into segments categorised into clusters relative to specific riding conditions. Analysing the segmented trial revealed the effectiveness and usefulness of the approach. Then, a corner entry manoeuvre was investigated in-depth to observe each segment’s properties. The method associated each riding primitive to a cluster and described each manoeuvre through the segments’ succession. The clusters were unambiguous and easy to interpret thanks to their dynamics-based nature and minimal overlap. The algorithm identified the differences between the three corner entry manoeuvres in the trial. The segmentation simplified the in-depth corner entry analysis and allowed early detection of the manoeuvre start. The proposed tool can aid research on motorcycle dynamics, PTW-rider interaction, and riding preferences in bends. The segmented time series could be employed for rider training and pre-crash fall dynamics reconstruction.},

  abstract     = {Hard landing, as one of the most frequent flight safety incidents during the landing stage, is highly concerned by the aviation industry. Recently, the popularization of Quick Access Recorder (QAR), a modern flight data recording system, has made it possible to collect large volume of flight parameters and incorporate state-of-the-art AI technologies to improve flight safety. However, due to the complex, multivariate, and highly specialized nature of QAR data, most existing studies either suffer from information loss caused by rough feature extraction methods, or rely solely on black-box models with no interpretations, making themselves difficult to achieve satisfactory performance in terms of prediction and explainability. To address this issue, we propose a novel attention-driven model named SDTAN (Scalable Deep Time-Aware Attention Network), which can accurately predict hard landing events and provide interpretable insights to help reveal the possible reasons leading to the events. Specifically, SDTAN fully captures information to learn the local representations of parameters, and leverages the time-interval attention mechanism to focus on the entire temporal pattern of flight over the relevant time intervals. It further re-encodes the representations of parameters in a global view and learns the global effect of parameters on the predicted output to uncover the ones which strongly indicate the flight safety status, enabling both high prediction accuracy and qualitative interpretability. We conduct experiments on real-world QAR datasets of 37,920 Airbus A320 flight samples. Experimental results demonstrate that SDTAN outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines and provides effective interpretability by visualizing the importance of parameters.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we discuss the co-optimized performance of multi-reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted integrated satellite-unmanned aerial vehicle-terrestrial network (IS-UAV-TN), where the multiple vehicle users are applied to the network under consideration. The performance optimization of IS-UAV-TNs faces two major challenges: one is the obstacles in the transmission path and the other is the highly dynamic communication environment caused by the UAV movement for the multiple ground vehicle users. To tackle these above issues efficiently, we will install RIS on the UAV for the purpose of reshaping the wireless transmission path. In addition, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) protocols are considered as a new paradigm to address spectrum shortage and enhance connection quality. Considering the UAV energy consumption, the satellite transmission beamforming matrix and RIS phase shift configuration, a multi-objective optimization problem is proposed to maximize the system achievable rate and minimize the UAV energy consumption during a specific mission. On this foundation, to facilitate the online decision problem, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is utilized to achieve real-time interaction with the communication environment. A multi-objective deep deterministic policy gradient (MO-DDPG) algorithm is proposed to search for sub-optimal solutions about the learning problem of multi-objective control policies in IS-UAV-TNs. Experimental results show that the method can simultaneously consider three optimization objectives and effectively adjust the optimal update policy according to the settings of different weight parameters.},

However, the daily turnover rates of parking spaces are generally less than 10 vehicles in Shanghai, China, so that WPDs waste a lot of energy in collecting and processing of redundant sensor data when the parking space is occupied or free. Hence, an environmental Energy Harvesting-driven Parking Detection (EHPD) method, which includes a vehicle-induced vibration energy harvesting and conditioning circuit, as well as a parking detection algorithm based on the signatures of vehicle-induced seismic signals and wireless energy attenuated by vehicles, is proposed in the paper. In EHPD, the signatures of pulse signals converted from vehicle-induced seismic signals are used to drive the wireless energy features to participate in achieving parking detection.

  abstract     = {The stable skeletal structure formed by the interlocking mechanism of the spatial movement of aggregate particles during compaction is the mechanism by which asphalt pavements are compacted and shaped. A major problem facing conventional compaction monitoring is that lacking the ability to monitor particle movement and a real-time evaluation method for pavement compaction, which can easily lead to problems such as uneven compaction and over-compaction. In addition, vehicle speed is an important parameter for analysing the dynamic response of a pavement. Current vehicle speed monitoring relies on complex field equipment and the collected vehicle speed parameters are difficult to match with other sensors for fusion analysis. In this paper, a method for monitoring the compaction quality of asphalt pavements and a method for collecting vehicle speed is proposed based on intelligent aggregate and aggregates interaction mechanisms. The experimental results show that with the continuous action of the compaction machinery, the compaction state of the asphalt pavement can be reliably captured and monitored by studying the spatio-temporal movement pattern of the intelligent aggregates. Meanwhile, the analysis of the time nodes of intelligent aggregate attitude change under the action of vehicle load allows accurate acquisition of vehicle speed parameters. Therefore, the method proposed in this study can improve the accuracy of asphalt pavement compaction state control as well as the accurate acquisition of vehicle speed. It can provide a reference for the later analysis of the dynamic response of pavement loads and the intelligent compaction of pavements.},

  abstract     = {Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is an essential sensor for three dimensional (3D) object detection via generating 3D point cloud of the surroundings, and it has been widely used in the various visual applications, especially autonomous driving. However, limited numbers of labeled LiDAR datasets brutally restrain the development of 3D object detector, and this situation breeds an urgent demand on data augmentation in this field. By far, most of the traditional methods reuse the labeled samples, while those unlabeled are hastily untaken. Motivated by this, we propose a R ealistic S imulator based data augmentation (RS-Aug). It aims to construct augmented real scenes to enrich the diversity of training dataset. To train 3D object detector in a supervised learning way, the first step of RS-Aug is auto-annotation. Time-continuous LiDAR frames are used to construct the dense scene, which is beneficial to annotation and the subsequent rendering augmentation. However, 3D points with incorrect semantic labels are naturally gathered during multi-view reconstruction, causing the negative effect on auto-annotation. We propose an algorithm of cluster guided &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -nearest neighbor (c- &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; NN). It emphasizes on de-nosing semantic labels of clustered points using distance and intensity constraints. Then, the next step of RS-Aug is rendering augmentation on the real scene. To enhance the rendering quality using collision and distance constraints with the less computation complexity, we propose a scheme of heuristic search (HS) based object insertion. It estimates the proper position of the inserted object from 2D bird’s eye view (BEV).

  abstract     = {In urban rail traction power supply systems, the optimal power flow method is mostly utilized for energy optimization. Conventional power flow optimization adopts offline calculation methods to obtain the optimal strategy under given scenarios. However, this method cannot continuously realize the ideal optimization effect for the time-varying flexible traction power supply system. For this reason, this paper proposes a real-time adaptive energy optimization method to solve the problem above. Firstly, the control objective of the optimal power flow is determined based on analyzing the system power flow. Secondly, a hierarchical control system is designed to achieve adaptive optimal control for the flexible traction power supply system. Moreover, a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm-based optimal power flow calculation method is employed to realize the real-time optimal power flow. Finally, some simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed real-time optimal power flow. It is demonstrated that the real-time optimal power flow method makes it possible to consider the low delay and high accuracy of control commands at the same time. Compared with the conventional offline method, the proposed real-time method can reduce the input electricity consumption by 1.47%, which is valuable in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {An increasing number of researchers are turning their attention to signcryption, particularly in the context of multi-receiver communication scenarios, due to its ability to simultaneously provide authentication, integrity, and confidentiality of messages. However, existing signcryption schemes have not been able to fully implement sender unlinkability. Specifically, when a sender signcrypts a secret message and obtains the corresponding ciphertext, the intended recipient must use the sender’s identity or public key to complete the unsigncryption process and retrieve the plaintext. Consequently, the recipient can link the sender via the same identity or public key. To address this issue, we present an Unlinkable Signcryption Scheme for Multi-Receiver (USS-MR). With Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), our USS-MR enables a vehicle to send the same secret message to a group of RoadSide Units (RSUs). Additionally, when a new message requires signcryption, the vehicle generates a new key pair, making it impossible for any RSU to link the vehicle through its public key. In our USS-MR, we have adopted a pseudonym mechanism to provide conditional privacy, which hides the real identity of the vehicle through the use of pseudonyms and avoids linking it to the identity. Moreover, if a vehicle is found to engage in malicious behavior, it will not only be tracked but also subjected to revocation. Comprehensive security analyses demonstrate that our USS-MR satisfies various security, privacy, and functionality requirements and effectively resists common attacks in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs). Finally, our USS-MR demonstrates certain advantages in terms of computation and communication when compared to relevant studies. In particular, our USS-MR maintains a consistent communication burden of 388 bytes.},

  abstract     = {High-quality fusion images with infrared and visible information contribute to intelligent and safe driving. In the infrared and visible fusion images, the useless noise information in infrared image makes the fusion image unclear, which leads to the loss of texture information from visible image. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel two-stage network (i.e., SOSMaskFuse) that can effectively reduce the noise and extract the important thermal information in infrared images as well as display sufficient texture details of visible images. In the first stage of this network, a salient object segmentation (SOS) network is proposed. Infrared images are fed into the SOS network to obtain the corresponding binarization mask of the region of interest. In the second stage, in each layer of features extracted by the encoder network, the newly proposed IMV-F (infrared mask visible fusion) fusion strategy uses the mask to decompose both infrared and visible images into infrared-foreground, visible-foreground, infrared-background and visible-background, and then fuses the foreground and background parts separately into fused-foreground and fused-background. Finally, the decoder network reconstructs the fused features into the final fused image. Compared with eighteen competitive algorithms on three public datasets, the experimental results indicate that our proposed network can produce high quality fused images with clear background texture information while highlighting infrared thermal information. Our proposed SOSMaskFuse generally outperforms the eighteen compared methods from both the quantitative and qualitative perspectives.},

The understanding of interaction mechanisms has important implications for the management of large-scale crowds. Although most vision-based heuristic models are successful, some features such as distracted pedestrians, and empirical phenomena like sudden turns are difficult to be explained. Here, a heuristic interaction model is proposed, which incorporates the extracted laws of pedestrian heterogeneity and mutual anticipation. We argue that pedestrians are heterogeneous in terms of speed and attention (e.g., distracted by cell phones), and have anticipations for other pedestrians’ velocities during the interaction. Numerical simulations indicate that our model realistically simulates the self-organizing phenomenon in the “distraction experiment,” along with related experimental findings. The “freezing-by-heating” phenomenon, as well as interesting phenomena such as “sidewalk shuffling” are successfully predicted, as exhibited in empirical observations. Taken together, our model may serve various potential fields involving the control of traffic flows and navigation of autonomous swarm robots.},

Recently, deep learning has been widely used in pavement distress detection. However, its application is still limited by the laborious and difficult annotation process due to the complex topology of pavement distress. In this study, we propose a pavement anomaly detection network (PAD Net), which is a semi-supervised learning approach based on generative adversarial networks for identifying pixel-level anomalous image segments. We build a mapping function for unpaired abnormal and normal pavement images through a framework containing two generators and three novel discriminators. The framework is capable of maintaining background pixels and modifying anomalous foreground regions with the help of multi-style discriminators that consider interrelationships of multi-scale generated images. Meanwhile, pixel-level abnormal areas are detected through an end-to-end mask channel. Experiments show that our approach is able to achieve 80.75% accuracy on our dataset without pixel-level or patch-level annotations. Quantitative comparisons with several prior semi-supervised methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.},

Furthermore, a collaborative capacity optimization (CCO) approach is formulated at the lower level to optimize the capacity of TMC and FC at candidate stations. In the proposed framework, origin-destination (OD) analysis, Floyd algorithm and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) are employed to generate the spatial-temporal distribution of charging demand based on historical data. An improved income approach (IIA) is then developed to well capture the heterogeneity of EV users’ charging behavior. The waiting cost of EV users is estimated by their value of time (VOT), which helps them to make a better choice between TMC and FC. To solve the optimal model easily, the big-M method is applied to linearize and convert the nonlinear problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. Meanwhile, the analytical target cascading (ATC) technique is employed to realize the data exchange process between the upper and lower layers.

In this case, how to design reasonable query strategies to select valuable instances and exploit the memory space efficiently is extremely meaningful. This paper proposes a novel memory-triggered submodularity-guided active broad learning approach, termed MTSGABL, to deal with such issues simultaneously. Specifically, the broad learning system is introduced as the basic assessment model to update incrementally. A memory-triggered learning mechanism is then proposed based on the drift detection procedure, which controls the update process to exploit the latest sequential information. Furthermore, a submodularity-guided query strategy is introduced to select a small number of valuable samples sequentially, which is beneficial to alleviate the negative effects of the imbalanced data stream. Numerous comparison and ablation experiments with the realistic JiaoLong deep-sea manned submersible data are conducted to validate its effectiveness. Results show that the proposed approach is superior to the existing typical approaches subject to these constraints.},

This paper proposes a two-phase optimization procedure to fully unleash the potential of MAEVs by leveraging the strengths of MAEVs, including automatic allocation and charging of modules. In the first phase, a mixed integer programming model is established in the space-time-state framework to jointly optimize the MAEV routing and charging, passenger-to-vehicle assignment and vehicle capacity management for reserved passengers. A Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is developed to solve the model efficiently. In the second phase, three dispatching strategies are designed and optimized by a dynamic dispatching procedure to properly adapt the operation of MAEVs to emerging travel demands. A case study conducted on a major urban area of Beijing, China, demonstrates the high efficiency of the MAEV adoption in terms of resource utilization and environmental friendliness across a range of travel demand distributions, vehicle supply and module capacity scenarios.},

In recent years, researchers have proposed various cooperative driving methods for CAVs, and there is an urgent need for a generic and unified traffic simulator to simulate and evaluate these methods. However, traditional traffic simulators have two critical deficiencies for CAV simulation needs: 1) the planning and dynamical modeling of vehicles in traditional simulators are based on a feedback mode, which is incompatible with the feed-forward decision and planning that CAVs commonly adopt; 2) the traditional simulators cannot provide typical traffic scenarios and corresponding standardized algorithms for multi-CAV cooperative driving. In this paper, we introduce CAVSim, a novel microscopic traffic simulator for CAVs, to address these deficiencies. CAVSim is developed modularly according to the emerging technology of the CAV environment, emphasizes feed-forward decision and planning for CAVs, and highlights the cooperative decision and planning components in the CAV environment. CAVSim incorporates rich and typical traffic scenarios and provides standardized cooperative driving algorithms and comparable performance metrics for multi-CAV cooperative driving. With CAVSim, researchers can conveniently deploy decision, planning, and control methods for CAVs at different levels, evaluate their performance, compare them with the standardized algorithms incorporated in CAVSim, and even further explore their impact on traffic flow. As a unified platform for CAVs, CAVSim can facilitate the studies on CAVs and promote the advancement of methods and techniques for CAVs.},

  abstract     = {The integration of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and microservice architecture drives the implementation of the sustainable Internet of Vehicles (IoV). The microservice architecture enables the decomposition of a service into multiple independent, fine-grained microservices working independently. With MEC, microservices can be placed on Edge Service Providers (ESPs) dynamically, responding quickly and reducing service latency and resource consumption. However, the burgeoning of IoV leads to high computation and resource overheads, making service resource requirements an imminent issue. What’s more, due to the limited computation power of ESPs, they can only host a few services. Therefore, ESPs should judiciously decide which services to host. In this paper, we propose a Microservice-oriented Service Placement (MOSP) mechanism for MEC-enabled IoV to shorten service latency, reduce high resource consumption levels and guarantee long-term sustainability. Specifically, we formulate the service placement as an integer linear programming program, where service placement decisions are collaboratively optimized among ESPs, aiming to address spatial demand coupling, service heterogeneity, and decentralized coordination in MEC systems. MOSP comprises an upper layer to map the service requests to ESPs and a lower layer to adjust the service placement of ESPs. Evaluation results show that the microservice-oriented service deployment mechanism offers dramatic improvements in terms of resource savings, latency reduction, and service speed.},

Recently, distributed ML techniques, such as Federated Learning (FL) have gained huge popularity mainly for their advantages in terms of intelligence sharing and privacy concerns. VNs are a natural contender for exploiting FL for solving challenging problems; however, their limited resources, dynamic nature, high speed, and reduced latency requirements often become the bottleneck. V2X communication technologies allow vehicular terminals (VTs) to share their valuable local environment parameters and become aware of their surroundings. Such information can be utilized to build a more sustainable and affordable FL platform for serving VTs. Gaining from recently introduced 3D architectures, integrating terrestrial and aerial edge computing layers, we present here a distributed FL platform able to distribute the FL process on a 3D fashion while reducing the overall communication cost for providing vehicular services. The framework is defined as a constrained optimization problem for reducing the overall FL process cost through a proper network selection between various nodes. We have modeled the FL network selection problem as a sequential decision-making process through a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with time-dependent state transition probabilities. A computation-efficient value iteration algorithm is adapted for solving the MDP. Comparison with various benchmark methods shows the overall improvement in terms of latency, energy, and FL performance.},

  abstract     = {RGB-Infrared multi-modal object detection utilizes diverse and complementary information, showing some advantages in intelligent transportation field. The main challenge of RGB-Infrared object detection is how to fuse the two modalities. The difficulty of fusion is reflected in two aspects: 1) large visual differences between modalities make it difficult to learn effective complementary features, 2) some misaligned RGB-Infrared images increase the difficulty of fusion. To this end, based on feature pyramid commonly used in object detection, we propose Multi-modal Feature Pyramid Transformer (MFPT) to fuse the two modalities. The proposed MFPT learns semantic and modal complementary information to enhance each modal features via intra-modal feature pyramid transformer and inter-modal feature pyramid transformer. The intra-modal feature pyramid transformer enables features to interact across space and scales, improving the semantic representations of features in each modality. The inter-modal feature pyramid transformer conducts feature interaction between modalities, enabling each modality to learn complementary features from other modalities. Meanwhile, the inter-modal feature pyramid transformer can also learn distance independent dependencies between modalities, which are not sensitive to misaligned images. Furthermore, a local attention mechanism is introduced within different windows into MFPT to achieve efficient correlation between regions of different scales or different modalities. Experimental results on two RGB-Infrared detection datasets demonstrate the proposed method is superior to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown excellent performance in the sequential decision-making problem, where safety in the form of state constraints is of great significance in the design and application of RL. Simple constrained end-to-end RL methods might lead to significant failure in a complex system like autonomous vehicles. In contrast, some hierarchical RL (HRL) methods generate driving goals directly, which could be closely combined with motion planning. With safety requirements, some safe-enhanced RL methods add post-processing modules to avoid unsafe goals or achieve expectation-based safety, which accepts the existence of unsafe states and allows some violations of safe constraints. However, ensuring state safety is vital for autonomous vehicles. Therefore, this paper proposes a state-based safety enhancement method for autonomous driving via direct hierarchical reinforcement learning. Finally, we design a constrained reinforcement learner based on the State-based Constrained Markov Decision Process (SCMDP), where a learnable safety module could adjust the constraint strength adaptively. We integrate a dynamic module in the policy training and generate future goals considering safety, temporal-spatial continuity, and dynamic feasibility, which could eliminate dependence on the prior model. Simulations in the typical highway scenes with uncertainties show that the proposed method has better training performance, higher driving safety in interactive scenes, more decision intelligence in traffic congestions, and better economic driving ability on roads with changing slopes.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain technology is developing rapidly and has been widely applied in the field of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to solve trust and security problems. However, due to the high security requirements in IoV scenarios, the security threats of blockchain itself become a big challenge for its applications in IoV. As the largest distributed platform supporting smart contract, Ethereum becomes one of the popular blockchain platforms that has been applied in IoV applications. In Ethereum, the local world state (stored on Road Side Units (RSUs) in IoV) is applied to facilitate account query and transaction verification. However, previous works showed that the local database can be easily tampered, so attackers may issue invalid transactions based on the modified world state, which is not acceptable for IoV applications. In this paper, the success probability and expected time for such an attack are first analyzed theoretically, including the effect of portion of tampered RSUs and the number of required confirmation blocks. Then experiment evaluation verifies the correctness of the theoretical analysis and shows that the attack would succeed with a higher probability within a shorter time when the local database on more RSUs are attacked. On the contrary, increasing of confirmation blocks can effectively reduce the success probability of a single attack and extend the confirmation time of the invalid transaction. Finally, efficient attack detection and recovery methods are proposed based on a novel hierarchical architecture with hybrid RSUs, and the effectiveness and complexity are verified by theoretical analysis and experiments.},

  abstract     = {The popularity of vehicles promotes the evolution of smart cities. This development makes vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) a widely used inter-vehicular communication to obtain information about road conditions, speed, vehicle location and traffic congestion. Such a public network is vulnerable to different security threats. Overall, the security of private data in VANET is a critical task. It has been observed that various authentication protocols have been devised for VANETs. However, most of the proposed protocols are not secure and reliable because of different security threats, including denial of service, replay, forgery and impersonation attacks, etc. Furthermore, the existing protocols used extra communication overhead and computational cost, so they become infeasible for resource-constrained environments. In this article, we design a lightweight and secure privacy-preserving key agreement protocol for VANETs using the hashing technique, which provides an efficient and secure data transmission mechanism over a public communication channel. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed protocol is secure against various attacks. To evaluate the performance of the protocol, we simulate key cryptographic operations of vehicles, a roadside unit, and a trusted party agent on Arduino, low-end and high-end devices, respectively. The experimental results show that compared with the other related protocols, the computational cost and communication overhead of our protocol are reduced on average by 8.797% and 22.06 %, respectively. Additionally, simulation results on NS3 show that our protocol consistently achieves a packet delivery ratio higher than 99.91 %. Therefore, our protocol is secure and reliable for VANET environment.},

It presents a taxonomy of modeling approaches used in the literature and defines extended taxonomic categories to better capture the characteristics of transportation networks. A two-part approach is presented to characterize transportation networks spatially and temporally based on the network structure and observed travel time data. The first part implements a community detection approach from network science modified for the application to transportation networks. The community detection approach is further adapted to use dynamic time warping distance to measure the dissimilarity between time series of link travel times. The second part implements a change point detection approach that identifies points in time when there are changes in the underlying link travel time distributions generating the observed time series. The proposed approach is tested via sensitivity analysis using the large-scale Chicago network and its corresponding travel time data. Sensitivity analysis with varying model parameters demonstrates the robustness of the network characterization and helps determine the most suitable parameter values. The sensitivity analysis with respect to varying weather conditions and demand patterns in the network demonstrates that the spatial and temporal characteristics are robust with respect to changing exogenous and endogenous conditions.},

A novel cooperative LPV/MPC approach is proposed, which characterizes the longitudinal and lateral coupled vehicle control in a dynamic game. The stability of the cooperative LPV/MPC system is analyzed in the presence of inconsistent targets of driver and DAS. Driver behavior is studied using 2,701 lane-changing cases extracted from naturalistic driving data (NDD). A human-like risk assessment method is achieved according to the driver behavior characteristics. Finally, a shared driving strategy in lane-changing scenarios is presented based on the cooperative LPV/MPC algorithm and the human-like risk assessment method. Simulation validations show that the shared driving strategy can ensure vehicle stability when longitudinal control, lateral control and dynamic game are performed simultaneously. In addition, the shared driving strategy can realize the driving weight gradual handover, which can help to better assist the driver in risk avoidance.},

  abstract     = {Potential increases or decreases in energy consumption for various traffic operation modes is a research focus in light-duty autonomous vehicle (AV) studies. However, AVs have unclear energy consumption patterns compared with human-driving vehicles (HV), especially under diverse real-world traffic conditions. Considering nine open-source AV activity datasets from six nations, three nontrivial characteristics of light-duty AVs under real traffic conditions were found. 1) The energy consumption of AVs was similar to that of HVs in the low-speed range and was lower than HVs in the high-speed range. 2) The turning point between low-speed and high-speed was a variable parameter for different data sources. 3) The energy consumption of AVs may be higher than that of HVs under complex traffic conditions in the high-speed range. Based on a vehicle-specific power distribution model, this study developed an AV energy consumption model under real traffic conditions at average speeds of 10 to 100 km/h. Potential energy consumption savings and losses were determined using two parameters: the turning point between low-speed and high-speed and the rate of change in vehicle-specific power standard deviation in the high-speed range. Under real traffic conditions, the results implied that light-duty AVs had the potential to reduce energy consumption by 3.78% to 26.47% under stable conditions but could also increase energy consumption by 3.25% to 48.93% compared with light-duty HVs under unstable conditions.},

This method constructs a novel one-class broad-learning classifier based on an inherency-guided comparison mechanism, which can classify and annotate unlabeled data online. This classifier employs contrastive manifold matrices to maintain the inherent structures, which is not affected to the overfitting caused by imbalanced samples. Secondly, inspired by the active learning, this classifier proposes the minimum-error strategy to annotate the samples by classifying the modes, which solves the problem of insufficient training data. Thirdly, this method applies an incremental learning strategy that continuously absorbs the newly annotated data to update the model online, which improves the model accuracy under the data imbalanced condition. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by wheelset bearing data collected from a test rig of a Chinese rolling stock company.},

However, these approaches make no mathematical guarantees of the passenger throughput for the SAV network. This study builds on the dynamic queuing model design of Kang and Levin which provides a maximum stability dispatch policy for SAVs. This model is extended to include rebalancing of empty vehicles to regions of high demand. The modified dispatch policy is proven to maximize throughput. Simulation results show that this dispatch policy reduces waiting times (between vehicle dispatch and passenger pickup) compared to the original formulation. However, vehicle time traveling empty increases in some scenarios. Simulation results also show that rebalancing often reduces passenger waiting times, but not when too many vehicles rebalance at once and are not available for dispatch.},

In this paper, the BSS recommendation problem is studied by comprehensively considering the battery swapping cost, diversity of BSS capacities, and differentiated demands of EVs, so as to be as close to the actual situation as possible. To describe the interactions among EVs, we propose a game theory-based approach to recommend appropriate BSSs for EVs to minimize the total cost (namely the sum of travel cost and battery swapping cost) of each EV. Under the game framework, a price function is designed to regulate the swapping price of each BSS, which acts as a coordination signal to induce EVs to join the game and also to alleviate congestion of BSSs. Then, an iterative algorithm is devised to seek the Nash equilibrium, through which a suitable BSS is determined for each EV. Compared to the shortest distance approach, the case studies indicate that the proposed approach can effectively reduce the average cost of EVs, improve the success rate of battery swapping, and balance the utilization ratio of BSSs.},

  abstract     = {The performance of a previously developed analog combining network (ACN) of phase shifters for periodic broadcast vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is investigated. The original ACN was designed to maximize the sum of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$K$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; consecutive cooperative awareness messages (CAMs). The design was based on the assumption of a dominant propagation path with an angle of arrival (AOA) that is constant for &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$K$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; messages. In this work, we relax this assumption by allowing the AOA and path-loss (PL) of the dominant path to be time-variant. Assuming a highway scenario with a line of sight (LOS) propagation between vehicles, we use affine approximations to model the time variation of different path quantities, including the PL, the relative distance-dependent phase shift between antennas, and the AOA-dependent far-field function of the antennas. By leveraging these approximations, we analytically derive the ACN sum- SNR as each one of these quantities varies over &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$K$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; CAMs. Moreover, we suggest a design rule for a phase slope that is robust against time variation of the dominant path and optimal under time-invariant conditions. Finally, we validate this design rule using numerical computations and an example of vehicular communication antenna elements.},

  abstract     = {3D object detection from LiDAR point cloud is a challenging task in autonomous driving systems. Collaborative perception can incorporate information from spatially diverse sensors and provide significant benefits for accurate 3D object detection from point clouds. In this work, we consider that the autonomous vehicle uses local point cloud data and combines information from neighboring infrastructures through wireless links for cooperative 3D object detection. However, information sharing among vehicles and infrastructures in predefined communication schemes may result in communication congestion and/or bring limited performance improvement. To this end, we propose a novel collaborative 3D object detection framework using an encoder-decoder network architecture and an attention-based learnable communications scheme. It consists of three components: a feature encoder network that maps point clouds into feature maps; an attention-based communication module that propagates compact and fine-grained query feature maps from the vehicle to support infrastructures, and optimizes attention weights between query and key to refine support feature maps; a region proposal network that fuses local feature maps and weighted support feature maps for 3D object detection. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on CARLA-3D, a new dataset that we synthesized using CARLA for 3D cooperative object detection. Experimental results and bandwidth consumption analysis show that the proposed collaborative 3D object detection framework achieves a better detection performance and communication bandwidth trade-off than five baseline 3D object detection models under different detection difficulties.},

Then, we construct an uncertainty-aware network to simultaneously learn the integral terms in the kinematic equations, and recursively compute the rigid body position and velocity as pseudo-measurements. We additionally use a nonlinear estimator to properly fuse the model with the learned observations, whose prior information is endowed by model on the manifold, while the updating correction signals are provided by the network on pattern learning, and finally, the split covariance intersection (SCI) is utilized to reasonably handle the unknown correlated information in both. The performance of method is evaluated in terms of accuracy, robustness, extensibility and server aspects using both simulated and real-world dataset.

Given a specific input, it is difficult to explain the output of the network. Without explainable results, it would be unsafe to deploy deep networks in unseen environments or environments with potential unexpected situations. Especially for decision-making networks, inappropriate outputs could lead to severe traffic accidents. To provide a solution to this problem, we propose a deep neural network that jointly predicts the decision-making actions and corresponding natural-language explanations based on semantic scene understanding. Two types of explanations, the reasons of driving actions and the surrounding environment descriptions of the ego-vehicle, are designed. Both the reasons and descriptions are in the form of natural language. The decision-making actions could be explained by the corresponding reasons or the environment descriptions. We also release a large-scale dataset with hand-labelled ground truth including driving actions and environment descriptions. The superiority of our network over other methods is demonstrated on both our dataset and a public dataset.},

The unsupervised registration algorithms take advantage of deep neural network-enabled novel representation learning while requiring no human annotations, making them applicable to industrial applications. However, unsupervised methods mainly depend on global descriptors, which ignore the high-level representations of local geometries. In this paper, we propose to jointly use both global and local descriptors to register point clouds in a self-supervised manner, which is motivated by a critical observation that all local geometries of point clouds are transformed consistently under the same transformation. Therefore, local geometries can be employed to enhance the representation ability of the feature extraction module. Moreover, the proposed local descriptor is flexible and can be integrated into most existing registration methods and improve their performance. Besides, we also utilize point cloud reconstruction and normal estimation to enhance the transformation awareness of global and local descriptors. Lastly, extensive experimental results on one synthetic and three real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-art unsupervised registration methods and even surpasses supervised ones in some cases. Robustness and computational efficiency evaluations also indicate that the proposed method applies to intelligent vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory prediction aims to forecast agents’ possible future locations considering their observations along with the video context. It is strongly needed by many autonomous platforms like tracking, detection, robot navigation, and self-driving cars. Whether it is agents’ internal personality factors, interactive behaviors with the neighborhood, or the influence of surroundings, they all impact agents’ future planning. However, many previous methods model and predict agents’ behaviors with the same strategy or feature distribution, making them challenging to make predictions with sufficient style differences. This paper proposes the Multi-Style Network (MSN), which utilizes style proposal and stylized prediction using two sub-networks, to provide multi-style predictions in a novel categorical way adaptively. The proposed network contains a series of style channels, and each channel is bound to a unique and specific behavior style. We use agents’ end-point plannings and their interaction context as the basis for the behavior classification, so as to adaptively learn multiple diverse behavior styles through these channels. Then, we assume that the target agents may plan their future behaviors according to each of these categorized styles, thus utilizing different style channels to make predictions with significant style differences in parallel. Experiments show that the proposed MSN outperforms current state-of-the-art methods up to 10% quantitatively on two widely used datasets, and presents better multi-style characteristics qualitatively.},

An enhanced backbone network combined with G-module is proposed to generate abundant information and reduce computational load, and the coordinate attention mechanism is introduced to focus on location features thereby strengthening the feature extract ability. The lightweight neck promotes multi-scale feature information aggregation for feature fusion to build a lightweight feature fusion network.

Experimental results show that TL-Detector has the best comprehensive performance. TL-Detector achieves a detection speed of 277 FPS and a precision of 73.24% with only 0.72 GFLOPs.

Additionally, various uncertainties arising from the environment could also cause unreliable decisions, particularly in some complex urban environments. In this paper, the fully parameterized quantile network (FPQN) is utilized to estimate the full return distribution. Then, the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is utilized with the return distribution information to generate uncertainty-aware driving behavior. Additionally, an uncontrolled four-way intersection is developed by the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) simulation platform, which considers both the surrounding vehicles (SVs) and pedestrians. More specifically, to simulate the real-world traffic environment, the uncertainty arising from the occlusion, and the behavior uncertainty of surrounding traffic participants are also considered. The experiment results suggest that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods in terms of safety.

Vehicle-to-anything (V2X) technology is rekindling corporate interest as 5G and 6G technologies take off. The absence of a reliable functional testing approach is one of the main issues with current technology. Currently, testing scenario libraries are created manually by testers, which has the drawback of being scarce and ineffective. Traditional automated generating algorithms provide limited-coverage scenarios that do not account for the influence of sensors. Our contributions to solving these issues are as follows. First, we extract the roads in the research region from OpenStreetMap (OSM), filter them, and annotate them using hierarchical clustering of feature values, which creates a static road library. Second, reinforcement learning is used to model dynamic situations using a partly observable Markov decision process (POMDP) in conjunction with sensor inputs. The creation process can be run concurrently with functional tests. Third, the efficiency of simulation testing is increased by integrating the static road library and the dynamic scenario section to produce a sizable library of test scenarios. This increases the realism and coverage of the library. The experimental results show that the proposed scene construction method is well suited for use in SUMO, VTD and other simulators, and has a 388% improvement in scenario coverage compared to the traditional method.},

  abstract     = {For subway regenerative energy optimization, the essential idea is to maximize the amount of regenerative energy absorption (AREA) between accelerating trains and braking trains by adjusting train timetable. The bottlenecks preventing the theoretical research from being used to industrial practice lie in the time-consuming simulation of AREA and the constant setting of headway threshold, which seriously reduces the computational efficiency and compresses the solution space. For addressing these issues, we formulate neural networks to speed up the AREA simulation, develop a bisection algorithm to dynamically adjust the headway threshold under moving block mechanism, and then establish a hybrid heuristic method integrating neural networks, genetic algorithm, variable neighborhood search and simulated annealing to determine the timetable, including dwell time distribution (DTD) at stations and headway time distribution (HTD) among consecutive trains. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by numerical experiments based on the real ATO data of Beijing Subway Changping Line. The results reveal that the neural networks could save 98.96% of the computational time at the expense of 1.76% of the accuracy loss, such that the hybrid heuristic algorithm could save 75.68% of the computational time. Benchmarked with the constant headway constraints used in literature, the variable headway constraints could achieve an average improvement of AREA by 8.94%. In addition, the joint optimization of DTD and HTD could increase the AREA by 15.28% on average, compared to the single optimization of HTD. This research is of great significance to improve the practicability of subway regenerative energy optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Weakly Supervised 3D Object Detection (WS3DOD) aims to perform 3D object detection with little reliance on 3D labels, which greatly reduces the cost of 3D annotations. In recent literature, the pseudo-label-based approach brings impressive performance, which generates 3D pseudo-labels from 2D bounding boxes. Despite their success, two key issues remain unresolved that reduce the quality of 3D pseudo-labels: 1) the existing local object locating algorithm can not capture complete clusters of points globally, and 2) the existing algorithm can not capture sparse points caused by the unevenly distributed points obtained by LiDAR cameras. Hence, we propose GAL, a Graph-induced Adaptive Learning algorithm, to generate 3D pseudo-labels. First, we propose the Cluster Locating algorithm based on the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) to globally locate the objects, which can leverage the characteristic that points inside an object are compact while points between objects are discrete. Second, we propose a density-guided adaptive learning algorithm to optimise the Cluster Locating algorithm, named Cuboid Drift. Cuboid Drift considers the inhomogeneous distribution of reflected points on different reflective surfaces of LiDAR imaging. Finally, 3D pseudo-labels generated by GAL are leveraged to train 3D detectors. Extensive experiments on the challenging KITTI and DAIR-V2X-V dataset demonstrate that GAL without 3D labels can be comparable with strongly supervised approaches and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art WS3DOD methods. Moreover, our method saves 88% of the time spent on pseudo-label generation.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has emerged as a robust solution to improve real-time road traffic conditions, safety, and driving comfort. However, the road’s dynamic environment and network heterogeneity make communication insecure. It poses many security threats like man-in-the-middle attacks, impersonation attacks, replay attacks, etc. Therefore, the message exchanges and real identities of nodes over the IoV network need to be preserved. The existing authentication schemes are inefficient and incur computational and communication overhead. They are unsuitable for resource-constrained IoV networks due to their highly dynamic nature, open communication, and chaotic road environment. Therefore, this paper proposes an elliptic curve cryptography-based secure and efficient anonymous batch authentication scheme with conditional privacy (EABAS-CP) for the IoV environment. The EABAS-CP scheme achieves conditional privacy by tracing the malicious vehicle efficiently. The RSU’s distributed parameters generate a pseudo-identity for vehicles and unique signatures that do not require secure channels and trusted authorities (TAs) for secure communication. Furthermore, the EABAS-CP scheme supports batch signature verification in which multiple signatures can be verified simultaneously and efficiently. The Random Oracle Model (RoM) provides unforgeability against adaptive message attacks by using the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). The AVISPA simulation tool is used to evaluate the proposed protocol for its reliability and protection from the attacks like man-in-the-middle and replay attacks. The proposed EABAS-CP scheme is also proven secure against replay, impersonation, stolen verifier, ephemeral secret leakage, and linkability attacks. The network performance of the EABAS-CP scheme has been evaluated in terms of end-to-end delay, throughput, average message delay, average message loss ratio, communication cost, and computation cost through the NS-2 simulator and compared with existing schemes to demonstrate its efficiency.},

However, data gathered from location acquisition devices generally contain positional errors that hinder its applicability, and therefore processing techniques are necessary to improve the quality of trajectory data. For instance, physical constraints of the road network that bounds the vehicles’ movement can be used to represent a trajectory better. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient framework to reconstruct road-network constrained trajectories from GPS-based datasets. The framework employs novel processing algorithms and models to prepare even low sampled trajectories, which naturally present gaps, for real applications. Besides that, we present a novel real-world benchmark dataset to evaluate trajectory reconstruction and map-matching algorithms and perform extensive experimental evaluations using the new dataset and another one from the literature to compare the proposed framework to related work. The experimental results show that the proposed framework has a better time complexity and accuracy than the other methods in all evaluated scenarios.},

  abstract     = {To efficiently implement the truck-drone collaborative logistics system, we introduce a multi-objective truck-drone collaborative routing problem with delivery and pick-up services (MCRP-DP). A truck collaborating with a fleet of drones serves three types of customers that require delivery, pick-up, and simultaneous delivery &amp; pick-up services, respectively. Different from most of the existing studies where the drone visits only one customer in a flight, we allow the drone to serve another customer requiring pick-up service when it completes a delivery service. Meanwhile, we simultaneously optimize three objectives: transportation costs, waiting time of vehicles (i.e., truck and drone), and service reliability. To solve MCRP-DP, we propose an objective space decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with adaptive resource allocation (ODEA-ARA). In ODEA-ARA, an objective space decomposition strategy is used to maintain the diversity while an adaptive resource allocation strategy is designed to improve convergence. We design an ensemble of relative improvement and relative contribution to assist the resource allocation and a variable neighborhood Pareto local search integrating 7 problem-specific neighborhood structures to improve the solution. Extensive computational experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of ODEA-ARA. The experimental results show that ODEA-ARA outperforms its competitors. Meanwhile, several useful managerial insights are presented.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been extensively applied to goods delivery and in-situ sensing. It becomes increasingly probable that multiple UAVs are delivering goods and carrying out sensing tasks at the same time. The destinations of the UAVs are usually required to jointly design their trajectories and sensing selections, leading to privacy concerns for the UAVs. This paper presents a new game-theoretic routing framework for joint goods delivery and sensing of multiple cellular-connected UAVs, where the UAVs minimize their energy consumption and connectivity outage, maximize their sensing reward, and ensure timely goods delivery and trajectory privacy by optimizing their trajectories and sensing task selections in a decentralized manner. The key idea is that we unify routing and sensing in a single task selection process, which is further transformed into routing on a task-time graph. Another important aspect is that we design a non-cooperative potential game for the routing on the task-time graph. A distributed strategy is developed, where each UAV only reports its sensing task selections and withholds its destination information and its best response produced by the Bellman-Ford algorithm. By this means, the destination and trajectory privacy of the UAVs are protected. Simulations show that the new game-theoretic approach can ensure timely delivery and achieve close-to-optimal solutions with significantly lower complexity compared to a centralized brute-force approach.},

  abstract     = {Beam tracking is a core issue in 5G vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. Specifically, higher beamforming gain is required to compensate for the path loss at higher frequencies, e.g., 5G FR2, to realize high data rate vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. However, shorter time slots at higher frequencies, high velocity of vehicles, and unpredictable localization errors make this problem more challenging. Under these circumstances, wider beams can lead to higher beam tracking accuracy. Bear in mind that wider beams mean lower beamforming gain, which cannot compensate for high path loss at high frequencies and would further influence the data rate of V2I communications. Thus, there exists a trade-off between tracking accuracy and data rate in V2I communications. Furthermore, this problem needs to be solved within an extremely short time slot according to the high transmission frequency. To solve this problem, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) assisted, high-resolution codebook-based beam tracking method. By comparing several different RL frameworks, we found that the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) framework can help the roadside infrastructure (RSI) determine a proper beam pattern within a short duration. Moreover, according to the Hurst exponent analysis, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are selected to improve the performance of the RL framework. The simulation results show that the proposed method performs well in tracking accuracy, data rate, and temporal efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Drone-based last-mile delivery is an emerging technology that uses drones loaded onto a truck to deliver parcels to customers. In this paper, we introduce a fully automated system for drone-based last-mile delivery through incorporation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). A novel problem called the autonomous vehicle routing problem with drones (A-VRPD) is defined. A-VRPD is to select AVs from a pool of available AVs based on crowd sourcing, assign selected AVs to customer groups, and schedule routes for selected AVs to optimize the total operational cost. We formulate A-VRPD as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and propose an optimization framework to solve the problem. A greedy algorithm is also developed to significantly improve the running time for large-scale delivery scenarios. Extensive simulations were conducted taking into account real-world operational costs for different types of AVs, traveled distances calculated considering the real-time traffic conditions using Google Map API, and varying load capacities of AVs. We evaluated the performance in comparison with two different state-of-the-art solutions: an algorithm designed to address the traditional vehicle routing problem with drones (VRP-D), which involves human-operated trucks working in tandem with drones to deliver parcels, and an algorithm for the two echelon vehicle routing problem (2E-VRP), wherein parcels are first transported to satellite locations and subsequently delivered from those satellites to the customers. The results indicate a substantial increase in profits for both the delivery company and vehicle owners compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {An insightful understanding and relational reasoning of motion behavior are typical components for trajectory prediction to achieve safe planning when navigating in complex scenarios. Due to the differences in behavioral responses of heterogeneous agents and the existence of chain effect in message passing, an effective prediction method is desired to better acquire potential behavioral intention and model motion behavior. In this paper, we construct a trajectory prediction method to represent and encode the behavioral interactions among heterogeneous agents, called as Tree variant with Behavioral Intention Perception (BIP-Tree). Specifically, a dual-behavior interaction module is presented to deeply understand behavioral intention by simultaneously considering the behavioral perception and behavioral response in spatial interaction. The behavioral perception means that individual acquires behavioral features from interactive objects located in its perception range, while the behavioral response means that each agent makes distinctive reactions to different categories of agents (for example, due to different collision risks caused by pedestrian and vehicle, a pedestrian will respond differently to the interactive agents at the same distance). Meanwhile, we also introduce one new tree variant in message passing stage to enhance the acquisition of potential motion feature, denoting traffic agents as nodes and the interactions among them as tree trunks. The interaction message can be delivered along tree trunks from leaf nodes to root node, to further achieves the chain effect of high-order interactions beyond adjacent entities. Our method is evaluated on several public datasets, such as Apolloscape, nuScenes, Argoverse, SDD, INTERACTION, inD, and Waymo. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can predict more plausible and realistic trajectories with multi-modality. Among them, the best performance is achieved on three datasets. More remarkably, compared with state-of-the-arts, our method achieves significant performance and decreases by at least 13.04% on average ADE and 19.42% on average FDE on inD dataset with four intersections.

Moreover, the envisaged trust management model incorporates 1) attack resilience while constituting certain parameters and 2) an adaptive and flexible threshold to mitigate malevolent behaviors.

  abstract     = {It is critical for autonomous vehicles to recognize traffic police gestures timely and accurately. During the movement of the vehicle, the collected traffic police scales change all the time, in addition, the frequency and amplitude of actions of different traffic police are different. First, we use gesture normalization to fix the traffic police actions at a unified scale and remove the influence of scale changes on traffic police gesture recognition. Meanwhile, a fully adaptive spatial-temporal graph convolution network (FA-STGCN) is proposed to recognize the actions with different amplitude and frequencies. The adaptive spatial graph network can dig the latent joints connection relation of the traffic police under different gestures, which weakens the amplitude impact on the action recognition. The adaptive temporal graph network is composed of the global temporal module and the local temporal module. The global temporal module can obtain the coarse-grained features of the traffic police gestures’ speed and then naturally use the coarse-grained features to guide the local temporal module to adaptively learn the fine-grained temporal features of the traffic police action. The adaptive spatial graph network and the temporal graph network are alternately stacked to finally output accurate traffic police gestures. We thoroughly evaluated our method through intensive experiments, the result shows that our method achieved the best results on public datasets. What’s more, we proofed the effectiveness of each module and verified our methods for moving vehicles for the first time, the performance present meets the vehicle’s practical requirements.},

  abstract     = {Oversaturation has become a serious issue for urban intersections worldwide due to the rapid increase in population and traffic demands. The emergence of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies demonstrates the potential to improve oversaturated arterial traffic. Integrating vehicular control and intersection controller optimization into a single process based on CAV technologies can optimize the performance of mixed traffic flow scenarios with various levels of CAV market penetration. This paper proposes an efficient reservation-based cooperative ecodriving model (RCEM) for an isolated intersection under partial and complete CAV market penetration, which can simultaneously optimize the CAV trajectories and intersection controller. CAVs are utilized to precluster manual vehicles into a platoon to improve vehicle passage efficiency. Then, a heuristic-based algorithm is developed to effectively obtain an optimal solution. The proposed RCEM scheme is compared with fixed signal control and actuated signal control in a Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO)-based platform. Experimental results prove that the RCEM scheme outperforms the fixed signal control and actuated signal control in terms of stop delay, fuel consumption, and emissions under the condition of low levels of CAV penetration. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the system performance further improves as the CAV penetration rate increases, and the stop delay is almost eliminated when the CAV market penetration reaches 100%. Furthermore, the vehicle delay fluctuation under left-turning rates ranging from 5%-75% is 4.4 sec, which is far better than the vehicle delay fluctuation of the fixed signal control (176 sec) and actuated control (65.6 sec).},

Based on the proposed loop-wise route representation, optimization formulation is expressed for the traveling salesman problems (TSPs) in the planar graph. The performance of the proposed method is compared with that of genetic algorithm (GA) methods in four different cases of the TSPs.

  abstract     = {Object perception plays a fundamental role in Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA) which is regarded as a revolutionary promoter for next-generation transportation systems. However, the vehicle-based perception may suffer from the limited sensing range and occlusion as well as low penetration rates in connectivity. In this paper, we propose Cyber Mobility Mirror (CMM), a next-generation real-world object perception system for 3D object detection, tracking, localization, and reconstruction, to explore the potential of roadside sensors for enabling CDA in the real world. The CMM system consists of six main components: i) the data pre-processor to retrieve and preprocess the raw data; ii) the roadside 3D object detector to generate 3D detection results; iii) the multi-object tracker to identify detected objects; iv) the global locator to generate geo-localization information; v) the mobile-edge-cloud-based communicator to transmit perception information to equipped vehicles, and vi) the onboard advisor to reconstruct and display the real-time traffic conditions. An automatic perception evaluation approach is proposed to support the assessment of data-driven models without human-labeling requirements and a CMM field-operational system is deployed at a real-world intersection to assess the performance of the CMM. Results from field tests demonstrate that our CMM prototype system can achieve 96.99% precision and 83.62% recall for detection and 73.55% ID-recall for tracking.

In this paper, we propose to utilize transportation and vehicle engineering domain knowledge to detect GPS spoofing attacks towards CVs and AVs. A novel detection method using learning from demonstration is developed, which can be implemented in both vehicles and at the transportation infrastructure. A computational-efficient driving model, which can be learned from historical trajectories of the vehicles, is constructed to predict normal driving behaviors. Then a statistical method is developed to measure the dissimilarities between the observed trajectory and the predicted normal trajectory for anomaly detection. We validate the proposed method using two threat models (i.e., attacks targeting the multi-sensor fusion system of AVs and attacks targeting the intersection movement assist application of CVs) on two real-world datasets (i.e., KAIST and Michigan roundabout dataset). Results show that the proposed model is able to detect almost all of the attacks in time with low false positive and false negative rates.},

Auxiliary countdown timers, providing the remaining time of the current traffic phase, improve the safety and smoothness of the entire traffic system. This work proposes a state estimation framework for countdown timer traffic lights. Time-domain information is adequately integrated into a variable transition Hidden Markov Model (VT-HMM), and our system provides optimal estimates of traffic light colors and countdown numbers based on noisy detection inputs. A dynamic state transition matrix is designed based on a 1-step transition logic and a probability of the number of transitions related to the current state sojourn duration. A recursive decoding method based on the Viterbi algorithm is proposed to update all the state candidates and select the optimal state chain. Extensive experiments evaluate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed work. The performance boundaries of this system are also found under various input noise levels.

  abstract     = {Having a profound understanding of the surrounding environment is considered one of the crucial tasks for the reliable operation of future self-driving cars. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor plays a critical role in achieving such understanding due to its capability to perceive the world in 3D. Similar to 2D perception tasks, current state-of-the-art methods in 3D perception tasks rely on deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the performance of 3D perception tasks, specially point-wise semantic segmentation, is not on par with their 2D counterparts. One of the main reasons is the lack of publicly available labelled 3D point cloud datasets (PCDs) from 3D LiDAR sensors. In this work, we are introducing the VoxelScape dataset, a large-scale simulated 3D PCD with 100K annotated point cloud scans. The annotations in the VoxelScape dataset include both point-wise semantic labels and 3D bounding box labels. Additionally, we used a number of baseline approaches to validate the transferability of VoxelScape to real 3D PCD for two challenging 3D perception tasks. The promising results have shown that training DNNs on VoxelScape boosted the performance of the 3D perception tasks on the real PCD. Furthermore, we are also releasing the proposed data generation pipeline for the research community to facilitate realistic simulation of 3D LiDAR point cloud data for different scenarios beyond those covered in our VoxelScape dataset.

Health assessment is a useful tool to schedule maintenance plans of suspension systems, and furthermore ensure safety operation of high-speed railway transportation. In real operating condition, two problems, i.e. data imbalance and shortage of labelled data, result in difficult for health assessment of the suspension system using deep learning. In this work, a multi-sensor information fusion method, called as multi-sensor graph transfer network (MSGTN), is proposed in basis of deep transfer learning and graph neural network. In the proposed method, a domain-share multi-sensor graph neural network (MSGNN) is firstly proposed to extract features from vibration signals collected from three different positions in train vehicles. A graph-based fusion layer in MSGNN is proposed to fuse multi-sensor information by combining frequency response curves of the suspension system. The MSGTN mainly includes two parts in source and target domains respectively. In the source domain, a simple physical dynamic model of high-speed rail suspension system is built to generate labelled simulation datasets to pre-train MSGNN. In the target domain, the initial hyper-parameters of MSGNN are that of the pre-train model in the source domain. The labelled data in the target domain is fed to fine-tune MSGNN and then the final model for health assessment can be obtained by minimizing the loss function.

Technologies related to the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) are evolving rapidly. But without an adequate understanding of driving intention, ADAS usually can’t help the driver prepare for the danger in advance. This paper focuses on the fusion strategy of driver and environment information and proposes a lightweight end-to-end model, temporal information fusion network (TIFN). Driving behavior is the interactive result of the driver and the external world. To better understand the driver’s intention, the state update cell (STU) is proposed to introduce the influence of environment information into the driver’s state modeling, inspired by the selective attention of the human cognition process. Meanwhile, semantic segmentation features are extracted to offer clear clues affecting driver attention in place of motion optical flow images and binary value vectors. Finally, the driver’s intention and environment state are combined to make a joint prediction. The experiments evaluated on Brain4cars and IESDD show that the proposed approach has superior performance than other approaches that only use camera data.},

To avoid accidents due to missing these visual cues, this paper proposes a visual notification of AP-features to drivers based on real-time images obtained via dashcam. For this purpose, Google Street View images around accident hotspots (areas of dense accident occurrence) identified by a real-accident dataset are used to train a novel attention module to classify a given urban scene into an accident hotspot or a non-hotspot (area of sparse accident occurrence). The proposed module leverages channel, point, and spatial-wise attention learning on top of different CNN backbones. This leads to better classification results and more certain AP-features with better contextual knowledge when compared with CNN backbones alone. Our proposed module achieves up to 92% classification accuracy. The capability of detecting AP-features by the proposed model were analyzed by a comparative study of three different class activation map (CAM) methods, which are used to inspect specific AP-features causing the classification decision. The outputs of the CAM methods were processed by an image processing pipeline to extract only the AP-features that are explainable to drivers and notified using a visual notification system. Range of experiments was performed to prove the efficacy and AP-features of the system. Ablation of the AP-features taking 9.61%, on average, of the total area in each image sample increased the chance of a given area to be classified as a non-hotspot by up to 21.8%.},

To break those limitations, we introduce visual localization and orientation as Visual Intention Knowledge to help the trajectory prediction, which is learned directly from visual scenarios. It benefits to comprehend human intention and formulates decision-making processes. Moreover, by learning from the visual information and decision-making policy, we construct the Visual Intention Knowledge associated spatio-temporal Transformer (VIKT) to predict human trajectory by combining the intention knowledge with the novel Transformer. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our VIKT model could achieve competitive performance by the Visual Intention Knowledge through optimizing the model prediction compared with state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy on ETH/UCY and SDD benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Despite inland ports play an essential role in today’s global logistics chain, many problems still remain unsolved. One of the main challenges that inland waterways face is the trip planning of cargo vessels. A correct trip planning does not only improve the efficiency and prestige of the port, but is also crucial to ensure the safety of operations. This issue is particularly critical in the case of natural waterways whose depth and width are conditioned by natural phenomena that, in principle, cannot be controlled. This is the case of the Guadalquivir river, a waterway that connects the Atlantic Ocean and the inland Port of Seville in the south of Spain. In this context, this work proposes a two-step solution to optimize the time needed for vessels to complete their journey through the waterway while considering the constraint imposed by the time-varying depth and encountering situations. The outcome is the set of times when vessels are required to cross a series of boundaries delimiting the different sections of the waterway.

  abstract     = {Driver behavior analysis plays an important role in driver assistance systems. A driver’s face and head pose hold the key towards understanding whether the driver’s attention and concentration are on the road while driving. Naturalistic driving studies (NDS) allow observing drivers in real-time under naturalistic traffic conditions. Yet, data collected in NDS often comprise low-resolution videos usually with more challenging camera positions compared to controlled studies. For instance, when the camera is not directly facing the driver, classifying head pose becomes more challenging, since the variation between different classes becomes much smaller. In this paper, we propose three different approaches to classify a driver’s head pose from naturalistic videos, which were captured by a camera providing a side view, instead of directly facing the driver. These approaches employ a sequence of five key points on the driver’s face. We compare these three proposed approaches with each other as well as with three different baselines by using leave-one-driver-out cross-validation on nine different drivers. Results show that our proposed method employing a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) outperforms the best performing baseline by 11% in terms of overall accuracy.},

In this paper, the multi-period charging service pricing interactions between multiple charging network operators (CNOs) are discussed considering the dynamics of traffic-power systems. A multi-period user equilibrium model considering mixed vehicle types is formulated to describe the possible vehicle trip transitions between different periods in urban transportation network. For the power distribution network, a convexified multi-period AC optimal power flow model is adopted for local electricity market clearing. With the dynamics of traffic-power systems, the pricing interaction between multiple CNOs is a non-cooperative game. We analyze the existence of Nash Equilibrium with fixed-point theory, and propose an iterative method based on the best response strategy to find &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\epsilon $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -Nash Equilibrium.

  abstract     = {Forecasting the future environment is an essential and fundamental capability of autonomous driving systems. In contrast to the widely studied video prediction, only a few literatures have explored LiDAR point cloud prediction. To achieve future point cloud generation, most existing methods are based on free-form 3D scene flow prediction. However, these simple scene flow prediction-based methods may cause distortions since the motions of 3D scenes can be seen as a combination of rigid (static background) and flow (dynamic foreground) motions. To address this issue, we propose a simple but effective rigid constrained point cloud prediction network named RPP-Net. The key component of the proposed method is the hybrid motion decoder, which generates motion masks and combines flow motions and rigid motions to produce hybrid motions without additional annotations and sensors. Besides, to reduce running time, we provide a hierarchical cell, which uses a feature encoder to extract deep features and an RPP-RNN module to capture temporal correlations across frames. To evaluate the effectiveness of our RPP-Net, we have conducted extensive experiments on both KITTI dataset and Argoverse dataset and the results show that our RPP-Net significantly outperforms existing methods and achieves a new state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {In vehicular networks, task scheduling at the microarchitecture-level and network-level offers tremendous potential to improve the quality of computing services for deep neural network (DNN) inference. However, existing task scheduling works only focus on either one of the two levels, which results in inefficient utilization of computing resources. This paper aims to fill this gap by formulating a two-level scheduling problem for DNN inference tasks in a vehicular network, with an objective of minimizing total weighted sum of response time and energy consumption for all tasks under the following constraints: per task response time, per vehicle energy consumption, per vehicle storage capacity. We first formulate the problem and prove that it is NP-hard. A group transformation based algorithm, called GTA, is proposed. GTA makes scheduling decisions at the network-level using the group transformation based approach, and at the microarchitecture-level using a greedy strategy. In addition, an algorithm, denoted as DRL, is proposed to decrease total weighted sum of response time and energy consumption for all tasks. DRL trains two models with deep reinforcement learning to achieve two-level scheduling. The proposed algorithms are evaluated on a platform consisting of a desktop, Raspberry Pi, Eyeriss, OSM, SUMO, NS-3. Simulation results show that DRL outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for all cases, while the proposed GTA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for most cases, in terms of total weighted sum of response time and energy consumption. Compared with four baseline algorithms, GTA and DRL reduce the total weighted sum of response time and energy consumption by 41.49% and 62.38%, on average respectively, for different numbers of tasks.},

  abstract     = {Platooning technologies enable trucks to drive cooperatively and automatically, providing benefits including less fuel consumption, greater road capacity, and safety. To establish trust during dynamic platooning formation, ensure vehicular data integrity, and guard platoons against potential attackers in mixed fleet environments, verifying any given vehicle’s identity information before granting it access to join a platoon is pivotal. Besides, due to privacy concerns, truck owners may be reluctant to disclose private vehicular information, which can reveal their business data to untrusted third parties. To address these issues, this is the first study to propose an aggregated zero-knowledge proof and blockchain-empowered system for privacy-preserving identity verification in truck platooning. We provide the correctness proof and the security analysis of our proposed authentication scheme, highlighting its increased security and fast performance. The platooning formation procedure is re-designed to seamlessly incorporate the proposed authentication scheme, including the 1st catch-up and cooperative driving steps. The blockchain performs the role of verifier within the authentication scheme and stores platooning records on its digital ledger to guarantee data immutability and integrity. In addition, the proposed programmable access control policies enable truck companies to define who is allowed to access their platoon records. We implement the proposed system and perform extensive experiments on the Hyperledger platform. The results show that the blockchain can provide low latency and high throughput, the aggregated approach can offer a constant verification time of 500 milliseconds regardless of the number of proofs, and the platooning formation only takes seconds under different strategies. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our design for use in real-world truck platooning.},

It is necessary to provide the drivers with continuous feedback. Meanwhile, bus operators also need a fair incentive system to encourage drivers to drive ecologically to reduce energy costs. Considering the influence of traffic conditions, ambient temperature, and passenger load on the energy consumption of battery electric buses, a quantitative evaluation method for eco-driving with energy consumption as a single evaluation index is proposed. Specifically, the traffic conditions recognition method based on low-frequency data is constructed and then the division of ambient temperature range is discussed. According to the traffic conditions and ambient temperature, the actual operation data of 19 battery electric buses in one year are divided into 12 control groups and the reference energy consumption of each control group is obtained. The reference energy consumption describes the range of variation in energy consumption changes for different traffic conditions and ambient temperatures. In addition, to describe the impact of passenger load on bus energy consumption, a passenger load conversion factor is proposed. Finally, the eco-driving evaluation method is constructed using the reference energy consumption and the passenger load conversion factor. Since factors of the traffic conditions, ambient temperature, and passenger load are integrated into the eco-driving evaluation method design, the score depends only on the driver’s eco-driving level and the results show that efficient drivers will not get lower scores due to driving in poor driving conditions.},

  abstract     = {The SOTA methods proposed voxelization or pillarization to regularize unordered point clouds, improving computing efficiency for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. However, they usually trade partial accuracy for speed. Thus, we bring up a new problem setting: “Is it possible to keep high detection accuracy while point-cloud quantization is applied?”. To this end, we found that the inconsistent sparsity of the point cloud over the depth distance, which is still an open question, might be the main reason. To address the inconsistency effect, we first proposed a new pillar-based vehicle detection model, named SVDnet, in which novel plug-ins are introduced in its backbone and neck. Specifically, a novel low-rank objective is designed to force the backbone to extract distance/sparsity-aware features and suppress the other feature variations among vehicle samples. Next, we alleviated the remaining feature inconsistency resulting from distance/sparsity in the neck by dynamic feature selection and adaptive feature fusion. Here, feature selection is realized by a position attention network, while feature fusion is achieved by a Distance Alignment Ratio-generation Network (DARN). Later, the selected and fused features, less sensitive to sparsity, are concatenated and fed to an SSD-like detection head. Besides, we also integrate the proposed plug-ins with multiple pillar/voxel-based methods for performance boosting. Our evaluation shows that SVDnet improves the average precision of the distant cases by 8.11% with only 0.23 milliseconds speed drop compared with PointPillars. Furthermore, the extensional results validate that our plug-ins can help SOTA pillar/voxel-based methods to gain noticeable improvement, especially for far-range objects.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle re-identification is a pervasive technology in real-world intelligence transportation systems. Conventional methods generally perform re-identification tasks by representing vehicle images as real-valued feature vectors and then ranking the gallery images by computing the corresponding Euclidean distances. Despite achieving remarkable retrieval accuracy, these high-dimensional real-valued feature vectors are not tailored for fast indexing and matching and require tremendous memory and computation when the gallery set is large, making them inapplicable in a large-scale real-world retrieval setting. In light of this limitation, in this paper, we make the very first attempt to develop an efficient vehicle re-identification system (DVHN) for real-world large-scale retrieval tasks with deep hashing learning. It could substantially reduce memory usage and enhances retrieval efficiency while maintaining retrieval accuracy. Concretely, DVHN directly learns discrete compact binary hashing codes for each image by jointly optimizing the feature learning network and the hash code generating module. Specifically, we directly constrain the output from the convolutional neural network to be discrete binary codes and ensure the learned binary codes are optimal for classification. To optimize the deep discrete hashing framework, we further propose an alternating minimization method for learning binary similarity-preserved hashing codes. Extensive experiments on two widely-studied vehicle re-identification datasets- VehicleID and VeRi- have demonstrated the superiority of our method against the state-of-the-art deep hash methods. DVHN of 2048 bits can achieve 13.94% and 10.21% accuracy improvement in terms of mAP and Rank@1 for VehicleID (800) dataset. For VeRi, we achieve 35.45% and 32.72% performance gains for Rank@1 and mAP, respectively.},

One of the major challenges in state-of-the-art deep-learning based object detection are false positives which occur with overconfident scores. This is highly undesirable in autonomous driving and other critical robotic-perception domains because of safety concerns. This paper proposes an approach to alleviate the problem of overconfident predictions by introducing a novel probabilistic layer to deep object detection networks in testing. The suggested approach avoids the traditional Sigmoid or Softmax prediction layer which often produces overconfident predictions. It is demonstrated that the proposed technique reduces overconfidence in the false positives without degrading the performance on the true positives. The approach is validated on the 2D-KITTI objection detection through the YOLOV4 and SECOND (Lidar-based detector). The proposed approach enables interpretable probabilistic predictions without the requirement of re-training the network and therefore is very practical.},

In this study, a trajectory prediction algorithm based on the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) estimation strategy is proposed to predict paths involving lane-changing, lane-keeping, and turning motion. More specifically, the Interacting Multiple Model estimation technique is used with models defined in curvi-linear coordinates to predict a vehicle’s trajectory based on prior behavioral maneuvers. The road geometry is used to help facilitate behavior identification and prediction. Moreover, the combination of a more recently developed estimation technique known as the Generalized Variable Boundary Layer-Smooth Variable Structure Filter and the Interacting Multiple Model Estimator is applied to track, identify behaviors, and predict trajectories of a vehicle. The performance of this technique is compared with a Kalman Filter based formulation using synthetic and experimental data. This model-based strategy is also compared with machine learning-based strategies for trajectory prediction.},

  abstract     = {Learning-based algorithms for automated license plate recognition implicitly assume that the training and test data are well aligned. However, this may not be the case under extreme environmental conditions, or in forensic applications where the system cannot be trained for a specific acquisition device. Predictions on such out-of-distribution images have an increased chance of failing. But this failure case is oftentimes hard to recognize for a human operator or an automated system. Hence, in this work we propose to model the prediction uncertainty for license plate recognition explicitly. Such an uncertainty measure allows to detect false predictions, indicating an analyst when not to trust the result of the automated license plate recognition. In this paper, we compare three methods for uncertainty quantification on two architectures. The experiments on synthetic noisy or blurred low-resolution images show that the predictive uncertainty reliably finds wrong predictions. We also show that a multi-task combination of classification and super-resolution improves the recognition performance by 109% and the detection of wrong predictions by 29%.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear model predictive control has been used in motion cueing algorithms recently to consider the nonlinear dynamics model of the system. The entire motion cueing algorithm indexes, including the physical and dynamical constraints of the actuators and physical constraints of passive joints, can be controlled with precision using nonlinear model predictive control. However, several weighting parameters in the nonlinear model predictive control-based motion cueing algorithm (including driving sensation, motion description of the actuators, and passive joints) require proper and laborious tuning to attain an optimal design structure. In this work, the optimal weighting parameters of a nonlinear predictive control-based motion cueing algorithm model are calculated using cascade optimisation and human interaction. A cascade optimisation method consisting of a particle swarm optimisation and genetic algorithm is designed to identify the best weighting parameters compared to those from one optimiser. In addition, the human decision-making units are added to the two-level cascade optimiser to determine the best solution from a Pareto front. The proposed cascade optimiser decreases the run-time with better extraction of the optimal weighting parameters to increase the motion fidelity compared to a single optimiser. It should be noted that the proposed methodology is applied along longitudinal channel. While the same methodology can be applied along lateral, heave and yaw channels for further evaluation of the proposed method. The proposed model is simulated utilising the MATLAB software and the results prove the efficiency of the newly proposed model compared to those from the previous single optimiser in reproducing more accurate motion signals with better usage of the driving motion platform workspace.},

This paper proposes a novel package pickup and delivery mode and system wherein multiple drones collaborate with automatic devices.

Finally, extensive experiments and comparative studies were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The static distribution of the static secondary suspension load has a significant impact on the adhesion, rim wear and passenger comfort of the locomotive. At present, the locomotive secondary suspension load adjustment is mainly realized by artificial padding to adjust the height of the spring. This process is not predictable, so it is difficult to complete the adjustment at one time, and it is limited by the operating space, technician proficiency, weight and volume of equipment, etc., so the efficiency of the whole industrialization process needs to be improved. Therefore, it is necessary to study the relationship between the shimming quantity, shimming position and load variance, and establish an expert system to guide the spring adjustment process, so as to avoid the waste of time, space and human resources caused by repeated operation. Based on the analysis of the supporting structure and force balance relationship, the general theoretical model of the load adjustment of the secondary suspension design with flexicoil suspension springs of six-axle locomotive is established in this study. The mayfly algorithm (MOA), which is characterized by high efficiency and precision, is introduced into the field of the locomotive spring load adjustment process for the first time in this study. However, the standard MOA still faces the problems of low efficiency of late iteration, sample degradation and algorithm prematurity. Therefore, this study optimized the standard MOA from the parameter control, offspring mutation strategy and weighted optimization strategy of the position updating process. The experimental analysis of an HXD1C locomotive proves that the proposed method is a great improvement in terms of efficiency and accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The electric vehicles (EVs) charging stations (CSs) at public premises have higher installation and power consumption costs. The potential benefits of public CSs rely on their efficient utilization. However, the conventional charging methods obligate a long waiting time and thereby deteriorate their efficiency with low utilization. This paper suggests a novel fuzzy integer linear programming and a heuristic fuzzy inference approach (FIA) for CSs utilization. The model introduces the underlying fuzzy inference system and a detailed formulation for obtaining the optimal solution. The developed fuzzy inference incorporates the uncertain and independent available power, required state-of-charge, and dwell time from the power grid and EVs domains and correlates them into weighted control variables. The FIA automates the service provision for the EVs with the most urgent requirements by resolving the objective function utilizing the weighted control variables, thereby optimizing the waiting time and the CSs utilization. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed FIA, several case studies were conducted, corresponding to different parking capacities and installations of CSs. Moreover, the simulations were conducted on EVs with varying battery capacities, and their performance was evaluated based on several metrics, including average waiting time, utilization of CSs, fairness, and execution time. The simulation results have confirmed that the effectiveness of the proposed FIA scheduling method is considerably higher than that of the other methods discussed.},

In many congested scenarios such as peak-hour subway stations, the utilization of fences to guide crowd movement has become a widely adopted approach to alleviate congestion. This work presents a method that combines crowd simulation and management, focusing on the optimization of the fence layout for efficient crowd guidance. First, a congestion probability social force model (CP-SFM) is introduced to simulate the irrational pedestrians and to evaluate the efficacy of different fence layouts. Second, based on CP-SFM, we are the first to formulate the fence layout problem as an optimization problem with the objective to minimize the congestion of pedestrians in public places. Third, we further propose an ant colony crowd intervention algorithm (ACCI) to optimize the layout of fences. Lastly, we illustrate the performance of proposed ACCI on 18 scenarios including two real-world subway stations. Compared with other optimization methods, ACCI demonstrates promising performance in avoiding crowd congestion.},

  abstract     = {Electric location-routing problem is a challenging problem consisting of the optimization of electric vehicle routing and charging facility location, simultaneously. Existing algorithms generally adopt the two-phase search strategy to alternately optimize the routing and the location. However, they are usually criticized for the inefficiency as the problem scale increases. In order to improve the search efficiency in each phase, we propose an accelerating two-phase multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, where the learning method is used to mine the useful information from the historical search process to generate the high-quality routing and location offspring. To be specific, in the routing optimization phase, an interpolation method is developed to extract the frequent visiting orders existing in the historical best solutions. These frequent visiting orders are used to create potential routing offspring that can accelerate the convergence toward the optimal solutions. In the location optimization phase, a surrogate model is used to approximatively represent the relationship from routing to location, which can directly output a promising location scheme for a given routing offspring and thus reduce the optimization time. Experimental results on different scales of test instances demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed algorithm in comparison with several state of-the-art algorithms, including four widely used heuristic algorithms and two multiobjective evolutionary algorithms.},

This work develops a scheduling framework to balance the use of slow and fast chargers assuming the bus routes and charger locations are fixed. Slow chargers are utilized when possible to lower the cost of charging and fast chargers are used when needed to meet timing constraints and to ensure a sufficient charge for route execution. A directed graph is used to model the available charge times for buses that periodically return to the station to pick up passengers and to recharge its battery. A constrained network flow Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) problem is formulated to optimize the scheduling of chargers as well as to determine the number of chargers required to meet battery state of charge thresholds. Using a randomly generated route schedule for thirty buses, results are presented that demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to find optimal charging plans while considering time-of-use (TOU) costs and allowing for fixed and variable numbers of chargers. These optimal charging plans reduce costs up to 20.9% compared to a thresholding-based plan and up to 12.3% compared to an optimal strategy that does not consider the TOU costs.},

It gives hope of addressing some challenges related to vehicular autonomy which is based on artificial intelligence by providing a fallback plan. Variable network time-delay in data transmission is the major problem in teleoperating a vehicle. On 4G network, variability of this delay is significant (70-150 ms ping). Due to this, both video streaming and driving commands encounter variable time-delay. This paper presents an approach to provide the human-operator with a forecasted video stream that replicates future perspective of vehicle’s field of view accounting for the delay present in the network. Regarding the image transformation, perspective projection technique is combined with correction given by Smith predictor in the control loop. This image transformation accounts current time-delay and tries to address both issues, time-delays as well as variability. For experiment sake, only frontward field of view is forecasted. Performance is evaluated by performing vehicle teleoperation with real vehicle on street edge-case maneuvers and later comparing the cross-track error with and without perspective projection.

  abstract     = {Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have the characteristics of high mobility, frequently changing topology and uneven distribution, which made it a challenge to design an efficient and robust routing protocol with low latency and high packet delivery rate. Currently, intersection-based routing method and full-path based routing method are two popular solutions for the packet routing in VANETs. Although the intersection-based routing method has better real-time performance, it has the problem of local optimization, making the routing results not global optimal. Although the full-path based method can obtain the global optimal solution, it is weak in dealing with the dynamically changing topological network. Aiming at solving the above problems, this paper designs an intersection-based QoS routing (IQRRL) algorithm, which mainly includes two crutial steps: the next intersection selection and the next hop vehicle selection. In the selection of the next intersection, this paper uses an improved intersection-based routing protocol. In addition to considering connectivity and delay, IQRRL also considers the communication quality from the neighbor’s road to the destination node while evaluating the quality of the neighbor’s road, which minimizes the problem of local optimization. When the next intersection is determined, a road is then determined, and then the next hop vehicle within the road should be chosen to relay the packet forward. In the next-hop vehicle selection step, this paper adopts multi-hop evaluation technology based on reinforcement learning. In addition to using “greedy decision-making” to select the next-hop vehicle, it also comprehensively evaluates whether the next-hop vehicle is still optimal in the future, so that the stability and reliability of data forwarding are improved and local optimal problems are avoided. Besides, this article uses a simulation system to compare IQRRL with other routing algorithms. The result reveals that IQRRL outperforms in terms of packet delivery ratio and transmission delay.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial systems, known as “drones,” are relatively new in collecting traffic data. Data from drone videography can have potential applications for traffic research. Drones can record the vehicles from their aerial point-of-view and provide their naturalistic driving behavior. Processing raw data from drones to remove noise and anomalies is crucial to ensure that the data are fit for subsequent applications, e.g., the development of traffic flow or crash risk models. This study uses a part of the pNEUMA dataset, a large dataset with almost half a million trajectories captured by a swarm of drones over Athens, Greece. This novel dataset offers an opportunity to analyze the data attributes and treat the noise and outliers in the data. We use a combination of smoothing filters and Extreme Gradient Boosting with adaptive regularization to process the speed and acceleration profiles of the vehicle trajectories in the dataset. Our approach can help prospective data users treat this or similar trajectory datasets alternatively to applying manual thresholds and assist in accelerating research in microscopic traffic analysis.},

  abstract     = {The dramatically growing trend of vehicles equipped with driving camera recorders has allowed realizing real-time crowdsourced video sharing in vehicular edge computing (VEC). Such cameras can assist in monitoring objects directly in front of and behind the vehicles, enabling them to provide important visual information through real-time video streaming in case of possible accidents. Exploiting the on-board units (OBUs) for VEC can allow drivers and passengers to share and access on-road video surveillance services. However, data security and privacy concerns of video generators (owners) are two key challenges that can severely limit video sharing in a VEC environment. In this article, we propose a blockchain empowered publish/subscribe (P/S) scheme to enable one-to-many secure video sharing in the VEC scenario. Then, we design an attribute-based encryption algorithm with static and dynamic attributes (ABE-SD) to achieve fine-grained access control in a mobile environment. Finally, We utilize permissioned blockchain and smart contracts to record access policy and publish and subscribe events, thus resulting in user self-certification and event traceability. The numerical results indicate that our proposed scheme ABE-SD outperforms traditional centralized CP-ABE methods in terms of encryption and decryption performance. The simulation experiments demonstrated that the proposed video-sharing scheme is secure and efficient.},

This paper fulfills three primary objectives. First, it provides such a catalog through the Surface Accelerations Reference, which is openly available as an interactive analytics tool as well as an open and downloadable dataset. The Surface Accelerations Reference statistically describes the driving profiles of about 3,500 individuals contributing 34 million miles of continuous driving data collected in the Second Strategic Highway Research Program Naturalistic Driving Study (SHRP 2 NDS). These profiles were created by summarizing billions of longitudinal and lateral acceleration epochs experienced by the participants. Second, this paper introduces a standardized methodology for creating such a catalog so that similar acceleration profiles can be produced for other human cohorts or automated driving systems. Finally, the data are used to analyze the effect of roadway speed category on the rates of lateral and longitudinal acceleration epochs at various thresholds. It is observed that, for the median driver, the rates of epochs are up to three orders of magnitude higher on low-speed roads as compared to high-speed roads. This catalog will facilitate intelligent vehicle system designers to compare and tune their systems for safer driving experiences. It will also allow agencies with similar data to create comparable catalogs facilitating safety and behavioral comparisons between populations.},

The path dispersion reflects the operational features of traffic flow and is related to driving behaviour, arrival flow patterns, layout design, and the traffic control and management scheme. This study aims to improve the understanding of the overall path dispersion of unprotected left-turns and the opposing through movement. A behavioural simulation model was established to represent the overall path dispersion. Human behaviours regarding vehicle trajectory planning with and without conflicting vehicles were modelled based on optimal control and integrated into the proposed discrete event simulation framework. The descriptive power and accuracy of the proposed simulation model were validated using empirical data. The effects of the spatial size of the intersection, crossing angle, and traffic volume on the path dispersion of the left-turn and through movement were explored based on numerical experiments. The results show that the proposed simulation model can represent the path dispersion of left-turn and opposing through movement well for both the calibrated intersections and newly added intersections without model parameter recalibration with an average error of 8.92%.},

We present numerical simulation results that illustrate the effectiveness of the developed model to track the trajectories of the moving bottlenecks and simulate their impact on freeway traffic. Lastly, we present control applications of the developed model to trajectory optimization.

Platooning is considered to be a closed application between well-known participants that use V2V data for their operation. For the deployment of platooning, multi-brand, i.e. interoperable, solutions are paramount. To achieve this, the European ENSEMBLE (ENabling SafE Multi-Brand pLatooning for Europe) project has been conducted. In this project, multi-brand specifications have been harmonized to a set of common specifications and requirements for a generic Platooning Support Function (PSF). Part of the specifications is a common interaction protocol, which also encompasses security features. A reference design has been developed to initially check the specifications. It consists of a detailed design of the common functionality and includes software and communication sub-system hardware prototypes. This reference design has also been used as benchmark for brand-specific implementations, e.g. in communication plug tests. Daimler Truck included the reference design directly in their PSF implementation, which gave the opportunity to continuously develop the reference design during the project. In this paper, the ‘final’ reference design is described as implemented in the Daimler truck, which took part in the verification, validation and demonstration of multi-brand platooning together with six other truck manufacturers.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving is considered one of the revolutionary technologies shaping humanity’s future mobility and quality of life. However, safety remains a critical hurdle in the way of commercialization and widespread deployment of autonomous vehicles on public roads. Safety concerns require the autonomous driving system to handle uncertainties from multiple sources that are either preexisting, e.g., the stochastic behavior of traffic participants or scenario occlusion, or introduced as a result of processing, e.g., the application of neural networks. Thus, it is crucial to analyze the sources of uncertainties and quantify the risks associated with them, including the propagated risks that accumulate in the decision-making system. In this context, this paper provides an overview of uncertainty challenges and state-of-the-art techniques for mitigating these challenges. We argue that the uncertainties mainly originate from two aspects: 1) the external traffic environment, and 2) the internal autonomous driving system. Specifically, this paper first analyzes the safety challenges caused by the uncertainties and summarizes their sources. In addition, the corresponding techniques that mitigate and quantify the risk of uncertainties are presented. Finally, research perspectives are highlighted to facilitate future studies for guaranteeing the safety of autonomous vehicles.},

As most of the traditional ETC schemes (ETCS) require identifying their users, they enable location tracking. This violates user privacy and poses challenges regarding the compliance of such systems with privacy regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). So far, several privacy-preserving ETC schemes have been proposed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that systematically reviews and compares various characteristics of these schemes, including components, technologies, security properties, privacy properties, and attacks on ETCS. This survey first categorizes the ETCS based on two technologies, GNSS and DSRC. Then under these categories, the schemes are classified based on whether they provide formal proof of security and support security analysis. We also demonstrate which schemes specifically are/are not resistant to collusion and physical attacks. Then, based on these classifications, several limitations and shortcomings in privacy-preserving ETCS are revealed. Finally, we identify several directions for future research.},

By pushing the AI frontier to the network edge, EI enables ITS AI applications to have lower latency, higher security, less pressure on the backbone network and better use edge big data.

The enabling technologies, such as AI models, the Internet of Things, and Edge Computing technologies used in EI-based ITS, are reviewed intensively. We discuss the edge intelligence applications and research fields in ITS in depth. Typical application scenarios, such as autonomous driving, vehicular edge computing, intelligent vehicular transportation system, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in ITS environment, and rail transportation control and management, are explored.

Considering the practical application of EV WPT system, this paper studies the electromagnetic exposure of human body based on the uncertainty quantification theory. A sparse polynomial chaos expansion method is used to establish the surrogate model of the mean value of some human organs’ SAR, and the probability distribution function of SAR is calculated. The Sobol is used to quantify the impact of relevant variables on SAR. The final calculation results show that when the person is on the side of the EV, the offset between the magnetic coupling coils of the WPT and the lateral displacement of the human body on the side of the EV have a greater impact; When a person is at the rear of the EV, the vertical displacement of the magnetic coupling coils of the WPT has a greater impact on the longitudinal displacement of the human body at the rear of the vehicle. Combined with the above analysis, this paper can provide reasonable suggestions for the safety protection of electromagnetic exposure of human body in the WPT of EVs.},

Accordingly, in this survey, for the first time, we provide an overview of GNN studies in the general domain of ITS. Unlike previous surveys, which have been limited to traffic forecasting problems, we explore how GNN frameworks have evolved for different ITS applications, including traffic forecasting, demand prediction, autonomous vehicles, intersection management, parking management, urban planning, and transportation safety. Also, we micro-categorize the studies based on their transportation application to identify domain-specific research directions, opportunities, and challenges, which have been missing in previous surveys. Moreover, we identify unique and undiscussed research opportunities and directions, which is the result of reviewing a wide range of transportation applications. The neglected role of edge and graph learning in ITS applications, developing multi-modal models, and exploiting the power of unsupervised and reinforcement learning methods for developing more powerful GNNs are some examples of such new discussions in this survey.

  abstract     = {Fully automated vehicles collect information about their road environments to adjust their driving actions, such as braking and slowing down. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) has improved the cognitive abilities of vehicles, allowing them to detect traffic signs, pedestrians, and obstacles for increasing the intelligence of these transportation systems. Three-dimensional (3D) object detection in front-view images taken by vehicle cameras is important for both object detection and depth estimation. In this paper, a joint channel attention and multidimensional regression loss method for 3D object detection in automated vehicles (called CAMRL) is proposed to improve the average precision of 3D object detection by focusing on the model’s ability to infer the locations and sizes of objects. First, channel attention is introduced to effectively learn the yaw angles from the road images captured by vehicle cameras. Second, a multidimensional regression loss algorithm is designed to further optimize the size and position parameters during the training process. Third, the intrinsic parameters of the camera and the depth estimate of the model are combined to reduce the object depth computation error, allowing us to calculate the distance between an object and the camera after the object’s size is confirmed. As a result, objects are detected, and their depth estimations are validated. Then, the vehicle can determine when and how to stop if an object is nearby. Finally, experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method is effective and performs better than other baseline methods, especially in terms of 3D object detection and bird’s-eye view (BEV) evaluation.},

  abstract     = {Accurate traffic prediction is a challenging task in intelligent transportation systems because of the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in transportation networks. Many existing works utilize sophisticated temporal modeling approaches to incorporate with graph convolution networks (GCNs) for capturing short-term and long-term spatio-temporal dependencies. However, these separated modules with complicated designs could restrict effectiveness and efficiency of spatio-temporal representation learning. Furthermore, most previous works adopt the fixed graph construction methods to characterize the global spatio-temporal relations, which limits the learning capability of the model for different time periods and even different data scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose an automated dilated spatio-temporal synchronous graph network, named Auto-DSTSGN for traffic prediction. Specifically, we design an automated dilated spatio-temporal synchronous graph (Auto-DSTSG) module to capture the short-term and long-term spatio-temporal correlations by stacking deeper layers with dilation factors in an increasing order. Further, we propose a graph structure search approach to automatically construct the spatio-temporal synchronous graph that can adapt to different data scenarios. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our model can achieve about 10% improvements compared with the state-of-art methods.

  abstract     = {In this paper, the trajectory tracking problem of underactuated surface vessels (USVs) that is subject to input saturation, unmodeled dynamics, and marine environmental disturbances is investigated. Firstly, USVs underactuation problem is handled by constructing a coordinate transformation. An auxiliary dynamic system is adopted to deal with input saturation. The adaptive law is presented to online update the upper bounds of the composite disturbances. The event-triggering condition is introduced to reduce drastically control execution frequency and the transmission load. By combining the auxiliary dynamic system, an adaptive technique, a first-order command filtered technique and an event-triggered condition, a novel adaptive finite time event-triggered control (AFETC) scheme is proposed, which has the following significant characteristics compared to most existing schemes: 1) the artfully constructed coordinate transformation not only avoids computational complexity but also simplifies the design; 2) the first-order command filtering vector-backstepping control method not only circumvents “explosion of complexity” in the traditional backstepping approach, but also ensures the finite-time settling of position tracking errors of USVs; 3) with the event triggered control, it reduces the control execution frequency, thereby decreasing the communication transmission load; and 4) it ensures stable tracking without requiring a priori information of the unmodelled dynamics of USVs or external disturbances. The designed robust adaptive control has proven to enable USVs to track the desired trajectory while guaranteeing the closed-loop stability in a finite time and avoiding Zeno behavior. Simulation and comparation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {With the advancement of automatic driving and smart city, it is critical to predict traffic information for traffic management, traffic planning, and traffic safety. When predicting traffic information, the spatial structure of the roads will also affect the traffic flow information, such as speed, occupancy rate, etc. The common method either merely focusing on the temporal feature without the considering the spatial structure, or the method of spatial feature extraction is only applicable to Euclidean structure, which does not apply to Non-Euclidean structure. This paper proposes a traffic speed prediction method based on time classification in combination with spatial Graph Convolutional Network. This method employs Gated Recurrent Unit to extract the temporal correlation and Graph Convolutional Network to extract the traffic network’s spatial structure. In consideration of the varying features of traffic speed on weekdays and weekends in the time dimension, time is divided into two types: weekdays and weekends. Since the structure of the road network will not change in the short term in actual process, the same network structure of spatial graph convolution can reasonably be shared in the spatial dimension after which the two sections are fused for training and prediction. Finally, this proposed method is compared to some baseline models to prove the performance. Generally speaking, this strategy produces more accurate prediction results on the PEMS_BAY and METR_LA data sets than the baseline models.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud data, a flexible 3D object representation, is critical for various applications such as autonomous driving, robotics and remote sensing. Despite the recent success of deep neural networks (DNNs) on supervised point cloud analysis tasks, they still rely on tedious manual annotation of point clouds and cannot make predictions for new classes. Unlike few-shot learning for 2D images with the advantages of large-scale datasets and high-quality deep pre-trained models like ResNet, for 3D few-shot learning, obtaining discriminative representations of unseen classes with high intra-class similarity and inter-class difference is very challenging. To address this issue, this work proposes a novel cascade graph neural network for few-shot learning on point clouds, termed as CGNN, in which two cascade GNNs are adopted to extract the intra-object topological information and learn the inter-object relations respectively. To further increase the discriminability of point cloud features, we first design a novel discriminative edge label to model the intra-class similarity and inter-class dissimilarity based on channel-wise feature variance and class consistency. Second, we propose a novel few-shot circle loss which classifies the nodes into two subsets, i.e., support to support pairs and support to query pairs, and optimizes the pair-wise similarity on two subsets independently. Extensive experiments on benchmark CAD and real LiDAR point cloud datasets have demonstrated that CGNN improves accuracy by 5.98% over the state-of-the-art GNN-based few-shot classification methods.},

  abstract     = {Mobile robot autonomous navigation in large-scale environments with crowded dynamic objects and static obstacles is still an essential yet challenging task. Recent works have demonstrated the potential of using deep reinforcement learning to enable autonomous navigation in crowds. However, only considering the human-robot interactions results in short-sighted and unsafe behaviors, and they typically use hand-crafted features and assume the global observation range, leading to large performance declines in large-scale crowded environments. Recent advances have shown the power of graph neural networks to learn local interactions among surrounding objects. In this paper, we consider autonomous navigation task in large-scale environments with crowded static and dynamic objects (such as humans). Particularly, local interactions among dynamic objects are learned for better-understanding their moving tendency and relational graph learning is introduced for aggregating both the object-object interactions and object-robot interactions. In addition, local observations are transformed into graphical inputs to achieve the scalability to various number of surrounding dynamic objects and various static obstacle patterns, and the globally guided reinforcement learning strategy is introduced to achieve the fixed-sized learning model even in large-scale complex environments. Simulation results validate our generalizability to various environments and advanced performance compared with existing works in large-scale crowded environments. In particular, our method with only local observations performs better than the benchmarks with global complete observability. Finally, physical robotic experiments demonstrate our effectiveness and practical applicability in real scenarios.},

However, existing static interactions among Driver-Vehicle-Road (DVR) are too passive to reflect the change of driver preferences, vehicle conditions, road conditions, etc. Therefore, we provide a data-driven Cloud-Fog-Edge Collaborative Driver-Vehicle-Road (CFEC-DVR) framework. The framework could self-adaptively evolves through continuous iteration to provide better ITS services for humans. The collaboration among DVR creates a lot of relation data that construct our relation graphs. Cloud brings some privacy risks. Relation graphs have great analytic value. As DVR collaboration, privacy quality and analytic accuracy are three key issues in the framework, we propose a Relation Graph Privacy-Preserving scheme with High Accuracy in our framework, which is named as RGPP-HA. Based on machine learning, our method nearly maximizes the difficulty for attackers to know exactly how many other roles are connected to the attacked role, which enhances the privacy quality. Meanwhile, we find as much valuable information as possible from roles’ encrypted relations for more accurately analytic performance. Based on the experiments, we compare the proposed scheme RGPP-HA with existing classic and relevant schemes.

  abstract     = {Predicting traffic flow plays an important role in reducing traffic congestion and improving transportation efficiency for smart cities. Traffic Flow Prediction (TFP) in the smart city requires efficient models, highly reliable networks, and data privacy. As traffic data, traffic trajectory can be transformed into a graph representation, so as to mine the spatio-temporal information of the graph for TFP. However, most existing work adopt a central training mode where the privacy problem brought by the distributed traffic data is not considered. In this paper, we propose a Federated Deep Learning based on the Spatial-Temporal Long and Short-Term Networks (FedSTN) algorithm to predict traffic flow by utilizing observed historical traffic data. In FedSTN, each local TFP model deployed in an edge computing server includes three main components, namely Recurrent Long-term Capture Network (RLCN) module, Attentive Mechanism Federated Network (AMFN) module, and Semantic Capture Network (SCN) module. RLCN can capture the long-term spatial-temporal information in each area. AMFN shares short-term spatio-temporal hidden information when it trains its local TFP model by the additive homomorphic encryption approach based on Vertical Federated Learning (VFL). We employ SCN to capture semantic features such as irregular non-Euclidean connections and Point of Interest (POI). Compared with existing baselines, several simulations are conducted on practical data sets and the results prove the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

Road networks can be easily constructed into a graph structure with spatial-temporal features, and how to use these spatial-temporal features for dynamic traffic flow forecasting has become a heated issue. Although existing studies bring in the consideration of periodicity to deal with spatial-temporal sequence dependence, the similarity of time-varying relationships among cross-spatial nodes has not been well discussed. In this paper, we propose a Graph Attention Network with Spatial-Temporal Clustering (GAT-STC), which considers the so-called recent-aware features and periodic-aware features, to improve the Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based traffic flow forecasting in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Specifically, for the recent-aware feature extraction, a distance-based Graph Attention Network (GAT) is improved and constructed to better utilize the hidden features of neighbor nodes within a reliable distance during the recent time interval, thus can effectively capture the dynamic changes in spatial feature representation. For the periodic-aware feature extraction, a spatial-temporal clustering algorithm, in which both features in terms of nodes’ current traffic states and similar trends in terms of their dynamic changes are taken into account, is developed and applied to achieve better learning efficiency. Experiments using three public traffic datasets demonstrate the higher accuracy and better efficiency of our proposed model for traffic flow forecasting, compared with five baseline methods in ITS.},

The attention mechanism and the multiscale feature fusion were combined to improve the generator network, which could effectively reduce noise while improving the attention of high-frequency region information. The improved PatchGAN in the discriminator used a local discrimination strategy to distinguish the generated image from the real image, and then the Nash equilibrium was achieved through the continuous interaction between the generator and the discriminator, to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the restored image. Compared with other image enhancement algorithms, using PSNR and SSIM as measurement indicators, the experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm’s results were, respectively, 21.97% and 12.89% higher in nighttime enhancement, 26.16% and 12.75% higher in rain removal, and 26.56% and 12.1% higher in fog removal.

  abstract     = {Traffic forecasting models rely on data that needs to be sensed, processed, and stored. This requires the deployment and maintenance of traffic sensing infrastructure, often leading to unaffordable monetary costs. The lack of sensed locations can be complemented with synthetic data simulations that further lower the economical investment needed for traffic monitoring. One of the most common data generative approaches consists of producing real-like traffic patterns, according to data distributions from analogous roads. The process of detecting roads with similar traffic is the key point of these systems. However, without collecting data at the target location no flow metrics can be employed for this similarity-based search. We present a method to discover locations among those with available traffic data by inspecting topological features. These features are extracted from domain-specific knowledge as numerical representations (embeddings) to compare different locations and eventually find roads with analogous daily traffic profiles based on the similarity between embeddings. The performance of this novel selection system is examined and compared to simpler traffic estimation approaches. After finding a similar source of data, a generative method is used to synthesize traffic profiles. Depending on the resemblance of the traffic behavior at the sensed road, the generation method can be fed with data from one road only. Several generation approaches are analyzed in terms of the precision of the synthesized samples. Above all, this work intends to stimulate further research efforts towards enhancing the quality of synthetic traffic samples and thereby, reducing the need for sensing infrastructure.},

Effective long-term traffic flow prediction has become a challenging issue. As a solution to these challenges, this paper proposes a deep learning approach based on a spatiotemporal graph convolutional network for long-term traffic flow prediction with multiple factors. In the proposed method, our innovative idea is to introduce an attribute feature unit (AF-unit) to fuse external factors into a spatiotemporal graph convolutional network. The proposed method consists of (1) constructing a weighted adjacency matrix using Gaussian similarity functions; (2) assembling a feature matrix to store time-series traffic flow; (3) building an external attribute matrix composed of external factors, including temperature, visibility, and weather conditions; and (4) building a spatiotemporal graph convolutional network based on a deep learning architecture (i.e., T-GCN). The experimental results indicate that (1) the performance of our method considering spatiotemporal dependence has better prediction capability than baseline models; (2) the fusion of meteorological factors can reduce the inaccuracy of traffic prediction; and (3) our method has high accuracy and stability in long-term traffic flow prediction.},

  abstract     = {Traffic congestion prediction (TCP) plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems due to its importance of traffic management. Methods for TCP have emerged greatly with the development of machine learning. However, TCP is always a challenging work due to the dynamic characteristics of traffic data and the complex structure of traffic network. This paper presents a new quantum algorithm that can capture temporal and spatial features of traffic data simultaneously for TCP. The algorithm consists of the following steps. First, we give a closed-form solution in the Schrödinger approach theoretically to analyze this TCP problem in time dimension. Then we can get the temporal features from the solution. At last, we construct a quantum graph convolutional network and apply temporal features into it. Thus, the temporal-spatial quantum graph convolutional neural network is proposed. The feasibility of this method is proved through experiments on the simulation platform. The experimental results show the average error rate is 0.21 and can resist perturbation effectively.},

  abstract     = {Suffering from environmental distress like carbon emissions, traffic restrictions have been enforced extensively in distribution logistics. Reasonable arrangement of urban freight transportation can effectively improve distribution efficiency, reduce distribution costs, and alleviate the impact of traffic restrictions in distribution logistics. In response to increasingly stringent traffic restrictions, we establish a multi-objective optimization model, including the minimum distributions and the minimum carbon emissions. Given that the limits of battery capacity and cargo capacity, we build a green vehicle routing problem with soft time windows (GVRPTW) model with heterogenous fleets. In this study, three different factors, that is restricted area, travel time of vehicles, and carbon tax prices, are discussed in details. In order to solve the NP-hard model, we propose an improved ant colony optimization algorithm (IACO) by optimizing the state transition probability, and verifies the worth of the algorithm. The experimental results can explore the impacts of traffic restriction policies on the formulation of distribution scheme and offer reference opinions for the government to formulate reasonable restriction policies and better guide logistics enterprises to reduce carbon emissions.},

  abstract     = {Recent works demonstrate that capturing correlations between road network nodes is crucial to improving traffic flow forecasting accuracy. In general, there are spatial, temporal, and joint spatial-temporal correlations between two nodes, whose strength is related to spatial and temporal position factors. For example, traffic congestion that occurs at a traffic hub has a wider and stronger impact than that at a branch road. Moreover, the above impacts can vary with temporal position. Although spatial-temporal graph convolution networks have become a popular paradigm for modeling those correlations, there are still three problems with existing models: (i) failing to effectively model joint spatial-temporal correlations; (ii) ignoring spatial and temporal position factors when modeling the aforementioned correlations; and (iii) failing to capture distinct spatial-temporal patterns of each node. To cope with the above issues, this paper proposes a novel S patial- T emporal P osition-aware G raph C onvolution N etwork (STPGCN) for traffic flow forecasting. Specifically, a trainable embedding module is constructed to represent the spatial and temporal positions of the nodes. Subsequently, a spatial-temporal position-aware relation inference module is proposed to adaptively infer the correlation weights of the three important spatial-temporal relations. Based on this, the generated spatial-temporal relations are integrated into a graph convolution layer for aggregating and updating node features. Finally, we design a spatial-temporal position-aware gated activation unit in the graph convolution, to capture the node-specific pattern features under the guidance of position embedding. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model in terms of prediction performance and computational efficiency.},

However, the unique characteristics of vehicular networks, such as high mobility and frequent communication interruptions, make content delivery to end-users under strict delay constraints extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose a social-aware vehicular edge computing architecture that solves the content delivery problem by using some vehicles in the network as edge servers that can store and stream popular content to close-by end-users. The proposed architecture includes three main components: 1) the proposed social-aware graph pruning search algorithm computes and assigns the vehicles to the shortest path with the most relevant vehicular content providers. 2) the proposed traffic-aware content recommendation scheme recommends relevant content according to its social context. This scheme uses graph embeddings in which the vehicles are represented by a set of low-dimension vectors (vehicle2vec) to store information about previously consumed content. Finally, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to optimise the content provider vehicle distribution across the network. The results obtained from a real-world traffic simulation show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed system when compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {Accurate spatial-temporal traffic modeling and prediction play an important role in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Recently, various deep learning methods such as graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been widely adopted in traffic prediction tasks to extract spatial-temporal dependencies based on a large volume of high-quality training data. However, there exist data scarcity problems in some transportation networks, and in these cases, the performance of traditional GCNs and RNNs based approaches will degrade sharply. To address this problem, this paper proposes an adversarial domain adaptation with spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (Ada-STGCN) model to predict traffic indicators for a data-scarce target road network by transferring the knowledge from a data-sufficient source road network. Specifically, Ada-STGCN first develops a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network that combines the GCN and gated recurrent unit (GRU) to extract spatial-temporal dependencies from source and target road networks. Then, the technique of adversarial domain adaptation is integrated with the spatial-temporal graph convolutional network to learn discriminative and domain-invariant features to facilitate knowledge transfer. Experimental results on the real-world traffic datasets in the traffic flow prediction task demonstrate that our model yields the best prediction performance compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

To improve the computing and training efficiency, we embed the self-attention mechanism into the critic network construction, leading to a self-attention-based SAC algorithm. Evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed approach is able to exactly track the equipotential lines of a particular concentration in many categories (with different types of equipotential lines (including the shape, noise, and diffusion value)) of underwater diffusion fields.

Multiple pedestrian tracking is one of the key technologies for traffic statistics and abnormal behavior analysis, etc. Detection-based tracking methods have achieved remarkable results and have become mainstream processing schemes. However, target association is still immature and less effective in complex scenarios. In the proposed tracking system, several candidates surrounding each detected pedestrian are selected sparsely, and the associating relationship between the target and these candidates is determined based on a graph attention map. These graph attention maps contain positional correlations of the matching pairs and are applicable with pedestrians’ posture variations. The weighted correlating value is estimated with the positional weighted matrix and merged attention map. The correlating relationship is confirmed with the weighted correlating value and distance matching loss. To enhance the computation efficiency of the graph attention maps for these tracked targets and candidates, feature extraction is processed separately. Convolutional features extracted from one specific middle layer of the backbone network are used to represent each target or candidate. The experiment results show that the proposed tracker achieves better performance than the other five state-of-the-art trackers on three publicly available databases.},

Maximizing the traffic capacity of an intersection and reducing the delay rate of vehicles has always been a problem for traffic control research. The coordinated control of urban traffic signals is regarded as a multi-objective optimization problem. A mathematical model for urban trunk traffic is studied herein. An average delay model, average queue length model, total delay calculation model for vehicles at intersections, and vehicle exhaust emission model are established to obtain an optimization model for a new traffic trunk coordinated control system. In addition, our study combines the fuzzy control theory with the adaptive sequencing mutation multi-objective differential evolution algorithm (FASM-MDEA). This new optimization method for traffic signal control at urban intersections is proposed as a solution for the traffic flow optimization model to solve the problem of traffic signal coordination and control of urban trunk lines.

Unfortunately, none of the recent approaches in traffic event detection have taken sentiment knowledge into view. This paper proposes a multimodal coupled graph attention network (MCGAT). It aims to construct a multimodal multitask interactive graphical structure where terms (sucha as words, and pixels) are treated as nodes, and their contextual and cross-modal correlations are formalized as edges. The key components are cross-modal and cross-task graph connection layers. The cross-modal graph connection layer captures the multimodal representation, where each node in one modality connects all nodes in another modality. The cross-task graph connection layer is designed by connecting the multimodal node in one task to two single nodes in another task. Empirical evaluation of two benchmarking datasets, such as MGTES and Twitter, shows the effectiveness of the proposed model over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of F1 and accuracy, with significant improvements of 2.4%, 2.4%, 2.7%, and 2.7%.},

  abstract     = {With the development of intelligent transportation systems, timely and accurate travel forecasting task has witnessed growing interest. Unlike most previous research that only considers the demand prediction in origin regions, this task aims to predict the origin-destination demand between all-region pairs. Its main challenges come from effectively capturing the direction, weight, and temporal information of links in dynamic traffic networks. To confront these challenges, we treat the dynamic traffic networks as multiple weighted directed network snapshots and propose a graph-based deep learning framework, Temporal Graph Autoencoder (TGAE). Specifically, TGAE encodes the fundamentally asymmetric nature of a directed graph via directed neighborhood aggregation and learns a pair of vector representations for each node. Meanwhile, we use the graph attention mechanism to capture the weight information of links. Next, TGAE preserves the temporal dependencies by independently reconstructing the existence and weight of links over two consecutive time steps. Furthermore, we employ the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) to capture the evolution patterns of traffic networks and predict both the direction and weight of links based on the historical data. Experimental results demonstrate that TGAE outperforms several baseline methods on the travel forecasting task, which can help traffic management, resource preallocation, and services optimization.},

  abstract     = {Automatic text spotting can help unmanned vehicles read human texts, thus improving the safety and reliability of autonomous driving. Some existing text spotting models use inefficient region proposal networks or modules based on the recurrent neural network. Region proposal networks produce redundant anchors. Recurrent neural networks cannot perform parallel operations well. The existence of these inefficient modules prevents these models from applying in autonomous unmanned vehicles. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end two-stage text spotting model named Center TextSpotter, which is a convolution model that does not involve region proposal networks and recurrent neural network. Moreover, we develop a weakly supervised training method and a feature fusion module. The weakly supervised training method adjusts the loss by weighting the predicted labels to improve the performance of text recognition. The feature fusion module fuses the features of the proposal with the features of the proposal-context to enhance the overall performance. Our model follows the modular design principle. So it can be easily extended and modified. This paper presents an extension scheme based on graph neural network. By adding the graph neural network before the fully connected layer, the model learns better features. Experiments demonstrate that Center TextSpotter can complete the task of text spotting for autonomous unmanned vehicles commendably.},

Deep learning models provide researchers with powerful tools to achieve this task, but research in this area is still lacking. This paper thus proposes a novel deep learning architecture named Spatio-Temporal Multi-Graph Transformer (STMGT) to forecast the real-time spatiotemporal dockless scooter-sharing demand. The proposed model uses a graph convolutional network (GCN) based on adjacency graph, functional similarity graph, demographic similarity graph, and transportation supply similarity graph to attach spatial dependency to temporal input (i.e., historical demand). The output of GCN is subsequently processed with weather condition information by the Transformer to capture temporal dependency. Then, a convolutional layer is used to generate the final prediction. The proposed model is evaluated for two real-world case studies in Washington, D.C. and Austin, TX, respectively, and the results show that for both case studies, STMGT significantly outperforms all the selected benchmark models, and the most important model component is the weather information. The proposed model can help micromobility operators develop optimal vehicle rebalancing schemes and guide cities to better manage dockless scooter-sharing operations.},

The task of trajectory prediction is challenging because there are all kinds of factors affecting the motions of vehicles, such as the individual movements, the ambient driving environment especially road conditions, and the interactions with neighboring vehicles. To resolve the above issues, this work proposes a novel Heterogeneous Context-Aware Graph Convolutional Networks following the Encoder-Decoder architecture, which simultaneously extracts the hidden contexts from individual historical trajectories, varying driving scene, and inter-vehicle interactional behaviors. Specifically, the historical vehicle trajectories are fed into Temporal Convolutional Network to capture the individual context. Besides, a 2-Dimensional Convolutional Network with temporal attention is designed for transforming the scene image stream into compressing scene context. Then a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks is devised to model the evolving interactional patterns, which incorporates the acquired individual and scene contexts as the representation of the node. Finally, the aforementioned three contexts are combined and fed into the decoder to produce future trajectories. The proposed model is validated on two real-world datasets which contain various driving scenarios. Results demonstrated that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy and achieves immense stability towards different vehicle states.},

The vehicles dispatching system can also judge the real-time road conditions according to the prediction results and plan a more reasonable and efficient driving route, which is of great significance to urban traffic planning and urban construction planning. However, the amount of information in the vehicles data is less, which cannot meet the training needs of some artificial intelligence models. In addition, due to communication technology and other issues, there is a certain degree of deviation between the GPS data of the vehicles and the real data. The previous vehicles destination prediction model did not well eliminate the negative impact of this deviation. In addition, the previous model linearly adds the characteristics of each vehicles’s trip data, which cannot reflect the complex rules of the vehicles’s trip destination. Therefore, to address the above-mentioned drawbacks, we propose a novel vehicle trip destination prediction method named Hybrid Trip Destination Prediction Model of Vehicle Based on Autoencoder and High-Order Interaction Features (HAHIF). The HAHIF model extracts robust hidden features using the autoencoder model and considers the second-order association between them using a factorization machine to improve its superiority and effectiveness. Compared with mainstream benchmarks, the HAHIF model has an MSE value of 0.096, an RMSE value of 0.427, and a MAE value of 0.203 on the public dataset, both of which are the first place, which verifies that the HAHIF model has good predictive ability.},

One key challenge is imputing several different types of missing entries in spatial-temporal traffic data to meet the high-quality demand of data science applied in Cooperative-ITS (C-ITS) since accurate data recovery is critical to many downstream tasks in ITSs, such as traffic monitoring and decision making. For such, it is proposed in this article solutions to three kinds of data recovery tasks in a unified model via spatial-temporal aware Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), named Spatial-Temporal Aware Data Recovery Network (STAR), enabling a real-time and inductive inference. A residual gated temporal convolution network is designed to permit the proposed model to learn the temporal pattern from long sequences with masks and an adaptive memory-based attention model for utilizing implicit spatial correlation. To further exploit the generalization power of GNNs, a sampling-based method is adopted to train the proposed model to be robust and inductive for online servicing. Extensive numerical experiments on two real-world spatial-temporal traffic datasets are performed, and results show that the proposed STAR model consistently outperforms other baselines at 1.5-2.5 times on all kinds of imputation tasks. Moreover, STAR can support recovery data for 2 to 5 hours, with its performance barely unchanged, and has comparable performance in transfer learning and time-series forecast. Experimental results demonstrate that STAR provides adequate performance and rich features for multiple data recovery tasks under the C-ITS scenario.},

In this article, Graph-Transient Security Method (GTSM) is proposed for improving the cybersecurity features of ITS. The proposed method uses a trusted graph model for identifying reliable infrastructure and neighboring units in communication. The units are verified based on the information exchanged for identifying the frauds through the mutual trust sharing paradigm. In the mutual trust sharing process, fastened classifier learning is employed for assessing the trust of the communicating vehicles and infrastructure units. Based on the output of the classifier learning, a connected trust-based transportation network is constructed. This helps to replace, transform the connected scenario depending on the cybersecurity requirement.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of mobile technology, it is very convenient to share people’s current locations by checking-in on Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs). Using users’ check-in histories to study mobility preferences and recommend new locations is a typical application to LBSNs. Most existing models explore reasonable representations for users and locations. However, a lack of behavioral mobility modeling would hamper a better understanding of users’ mobility patterns. This paper proposes a location recommendation model to serve the personalized LBSNs application, called Spatio-temporal Individual mobility graph encoding network with Group Mobility Assistance (SIGMA). We design a spatio-temporal interaction enhanced graph neural network to encode the mobility graphs to represent individual mobility behaviors. Furthermore, we provide a novel stacked scoring approach to generate the recommendation score by combining the stacked individual mobility graphs with the group influences. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world LBSNs data, Foursquare and Gowalla. The result demonstrates SIGMA outperforms ten state-of-the-art models and further confirms that both the individual and the group mobility behaviors play essential roles in the practical scenario of location recommendation.},

Therefore, intelligent transport systems (ITS) gain a lot of progress at the different vehicle levels and in the vehicular area network. However, privacy and security at the network level are critical issues for ITS applications in the existing mechanism. In this paper, the study devises the cost-efficient and secure Serverless Blockchain Enable Task Scheduling (SBETS) ITS system and algorithm framework. The main goal is to reduce processing and security blockchian costs for ITS applications in the system. The processing cost minimizes based on the new proposed function-based price model and secures the data by a suggested deep graph convolutional neural network scheme in the network. The simulation results show that SBETS outperformed all existing ITS systems and minimized processing costs by 10% and fraud detection issues by 50% for transport applications.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to find the optimized angular distribution of the vertical beam channels for different application scenarios and installation configurations. The experimental results in a study case suggest that concerning the vehicle detection task, the optimized LiDARs perform almost two times better than the ones with the same number of channels in terms of the detection range, and have perception performances close to the LiDARs with double channels in the long distance.},

  abstract     = {Battery swapping stations (BSS) have recently grabbed the attention of transportation firms as a viable method for accelerating the deployment of electric vehicles. However, most existing literature considered model-based approaches lacking dynamicity to optimize their swapping systems. To address this problem, this paper introduces a model-free optimal dynamic operations framework for BSS using novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches. The main goal is to minimize the BSS’s running costs by controlling the charging/discharging and swapping actions. First, the system is formulated as a Markov decision process. Then, two DRL approaches, the double buffer deep deterministic policy gradient (DB-DDPG) and twin delayed DDPG (TD3), are utilized to achieve optimal control of the BSS operations. Unlike existing methods, the charging characteristics, the swapping time, and the battery degradation are considered in the proposed framework to obtain realistic results. The proposed approach is model-free and can adaptively learn an optimal policy. Hence, it is more robust to uncertainties than existing model-based methods that require previous knowledge of the uncertainty distribution. Simulation results considering real-world data verify the effectiveness of the proposed solution and show that the proposed DRL approaches outperform the classical DDPG method.},

Road surface perception with vision sensors is an emerging technology that has recently gained much attention. However, there are few reports on an exhaustive technical scheme and application practice for driving assistance. This study first creates a large-scale road surface image dataset containing one million samples with detailed road friction level, material, and unevenness level annotations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) classification model constrained by a combined loss function and adapted optimization strategies is trained on the dataset. Then we propose a decision-level fusion method based on the improved Dempster-Shafer evidence theory to enhance the robustness of the classification algorithm. Finally, the developed models are deployed on the embedded hardware platform. The top-1 accuracy for classifying road surface images reaches 92.05% by the CNN model and 97.50% after fusion. Onboard experiments illustrate the advantage and superiority of the developed technical framework, which has excellent potential in real-vehicle applications for driving assistance.},

Extensive evaluations on 50 benchmark instances show that FIS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, it discovers 29 new upper bounds and matches 18 previous best-known bounds. Finally, we experimentally analyze the importance of each key algorithmic component, and perform a case study on an air transportation network for understanding its network structure and identifying its influential airports.},

YOLO v4 (You Only Look Once) inspired real-time computer vision capable of detecting vehicles, pedestrians and animals at high efficiency (0.9777 mean average precision) is deployed on the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) which offered higher frame rate of detection (74.26 fps). The locations of animals and potholes were mapped through consistent survey and mobile app which relayed the detected locations to the cloud server forming a geospatial database. Clustered locations from the geospatial database on dense transportation network were utilized for constructing animal and pothole hotspot zones. A basic level of display warning was triggered when the vehicle approached animal and pothole areas. Furthermore, advanced alert comprising of display and sound alert was trigger when the vehicle approached hotspot zones. This was implemented using real-time Internet of things (IoT) and cloud infrastructure applications for continuous vehicle’s location monitoring and triggering as per the hotspot geo-locations.

In other words, each moving vehicle in the IoV can be seen as an agent, and it can make decisions about content caching and content access adaptively according to the changing environment to minimize the delay in the process of content distribution.

Search path planning is a critical factor to improve multi-UAV search performance. Aiming at the search inefficiency resulting from insufficient cooperation between UAVs in existing researches, we present a novel distributed real-time search path planning method based on distributed model predictive control (DMPC) framework. Firstly, we formulate the overall search objective function in finite time domain, considering not only repeated searches, but also maintenance of connectivity and collision avoidance between UAVs. Secondly, we decompose the overall search objective function to establish a distributed constrained optimization problem (DCOP) model, so that all UAVs optimize the overall search objective by interacting with neighbors. Thirdly, aiming at the problem of falling into the local optima in existing algorithms, distributed stochastic algorithm based on enhanced genetic algorithm (DSA-EGA) is proposed to solve the established DCOP model. We design a point crossover operator and introduce anytime local search (ALS) framework that stores the global optimal solution explored. Finally, the simulation results of different benchmark problems demonstrate that the proposed DSA-EGA outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the quality of solution. The simulation results of cooperative area search problems illustrate that the established DCOP model improves the search efficiency by 7.7%, and DSA-EGA improves the search efficiency by 4.3% at least. In addition, we also verify that our method has high scalability.},

  abstract     = {Roughly a decade ago, inspired by the phenomenal success of cloud computing, a group of researchers have defined Vehicular Clouds as a group of vehicles whose sensing, communication, and computing resources can be coordinated and allocated to authorized users. While both conventional and Vehicular Clouds are instances of utility computing, a number of important characteristics set vehicular clouds apart from their conventional counterparts. These characteristics include the mobility of vehicles and the volatility of resources that fluctuate with the arrival and departure of vehicles. As in the conventional version of cloud computing, approximating job completion time is one of the key performance metrics of interest. Unfortunately, estimating job completion time with any degree of accuracy and confidence requires complete knowledge of the distributions of several relevant random variables. Typically, however, these probability distributions are not known. Luckily, in many cases of practical relevance, accumulated empirical evidence allows to estimate the first few moments of these random variables. The main contribution of this paper is to offer an accurate approximation of the expected job completion time in Dynamic Vehicular Clouds built on top of vehicles on a highway. For this purpose, we rely on empirical estimates of the first moment of the user job execution time in the absence of any overhead attributable to the Dynamic Vehicular Cloud itself. Our extensive simulations have confirmed that our approximations of the expected job execution time are very accurate.},

  abstract     = {Accurate multi-parameter perception of pavement traffic load state is a prerequisite for smart highway construction, which is essential in improving the level of road intelligence and realising road information management. This research was based on the piezoelectric effect. Piezoelectric perception devices and strips were prepared and placed in asphalt mixture specimens and test sections, respectively. Through laboratory tests and outdoor vehicle loading tests, piezoelectric signals were collected by the data collector. The signal output peak value, peak area, and other parameters of piezoelectric sensing devices under different test conditions were analyzed. The perceptive calculation method of driving speed, axle number, wheelbase, and total vehicle weight was proposed. The perceptual calculation formula of vehicle load, including temperature, vehicle speed, and signal output parameters, was established and improved. The results show that the peak value of the output signal has a high correlation with test temperature, load, and loading frequency. Also, the signal of piezoelectric material under wheel loading has good stability; the perception accuracy of driving speed can reach more than 95%, the perception accuracy of vehicle axle number was 97.3%, the perception accuracy of vehicle wheelbase was 92.99%, and the perception accuracy of total vehicle weight was 95.19%. Piezoelectric devices have high accuracy in the perception of traffic load state.},

  abstract     = {A main challenge for radar-aided millimeter wave (mmWave) vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication application, is that it requires mitigating the mutual interference between vehicular radar and communication operating at same frequency bands. This paper considers the joint design of the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmit waveform and receive filter bank for road side unit (RSU)-mounted radar in a spectrally crowded V2I communication environment. With the criterion of maximizing the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), a non-convex problem, which involves the weighted-sum waveform energy over the overlayed space-frequency bands, energy and similarity constraints, is formulated. An iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the joint optimization problem. At each iteration, the transmit waveform is optimized based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method with a significantly lower computational complexity. As a consequence, accurate location information derived from the optimized radar is used to reduce the beam training overhead of V2I communication links. Finally, simulation results display the effectiveness of the devised method in finding feasible and enhanced solutions, importantly outperforming several counterparts.},

It has been well investigated and examined that deep learning-based Spatio-temporal models have an edge when exploiting Spatio-temporal relationships in traffic data. Typically, data-driven models require vast volumes of data, but gathering data in small cities can be difficult owing to constraints such as equipment deployment and maintenance costs. To resolve this problem, we propose TrafficTL, a cross-city traffic prediction approach that uses big data from other cities to aid data-scarce cities in traffic prediction. Utilizing a periodicity-based transfer paradigm, it identifies data similarity and reduces negative transfer caused by the disparity between two data distributions from distant cities. In addition, the suggested method employs graph reconstruction techniques to rectify defects in data from small data cities. TrafficTL is evaluated by comprehensive case studies on three real-world datasets and outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by around 8 to 25 percent.},

Developing fuel rate prediction models is the cornerstone of fuel consumption optimization approaches for heavy-duty trucks. However, limited by accurate features directly related to the truck’s fuel consumption, state-of-the-art models show poor performance and are rarely deployed in practice. In this paper, we use the truck’s engine management system (EMS) and Instant Fuel Meter (IFM) to collect a three-month dataset during the period of December 2019 to June 2020. Seven prediction models, including linear regression, polynomial regression, MLP, CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and AutoML, are investigated and evaluated to predict real-time fuel rate. The evaluation results show that the EMS and IFM dataset help to improve the coefficient of determination of traditional linear/polynomial models from 0.87 to 0.96, while learning-based approach AutoML improves the coefficient of determination to attain 0.99. Besides, we explore the actual deployment of fuel rate prediction with transfer learning and path planning for autonomous driving.},

In this context, this paper proposes a novel cooperative perception solution based on consensus theory to improve the accuracy and consistency for the detection and tracking of non-connected targets by combining V2X information. Given the common multi-sensor configurations of AVs, we design a consensus-based distributed cooperative perception (DCP) algorithm in the framework of multi-layer information fusion for local sensors and connected nodes, and give a nonlinear form based on cubature rules to include more accurate nonlinear system models and nonlinear sensors. Considering the high maneuverability of vehicle targets, we then extend the DCP algorithm to a multi-model form (DMMCP) to improve the model uncertainty of maneuvering targets via combining the prior knowledge of multiple models, which also gives a calculation method for model probability and its average consensus in the context of multiple local sensors. Besides, a new consensus information weight strategy and the properties from different consensus information weights are discussed. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of both our algorithms over the traditional algorithms in accuracy and consistency, moreover, the DMMCP algorithm, which takes into account model uncertainty, shows better performance than DCP in complex conditions.},

In this problem, customers announce requests on a crowdsourced delivery platform to deliver orders from a depot to their destinations and crowdsourced drivers are willing to make a detour to deliver orders in exchange for rewards provided by the platform. The crowdsourced drivers have preference lists over groups of orders based on their profits and meanwhile each order has a preference list over crowdsourced drivers based on the drivers’ arrival times at the depot. According to their preference lists, to maximize profits, crowdsourced drivers need to consider routing and scheduling decisions for delivering orders. This crowdsourced driver-order matching problem is considered to be a non-cooperative game between crowdsourced drivers. A Nash equilibrium for such a non-cooperative game is a stable matching between crowdsourced drivers and orders. We propose two exact algorithms to find stable matchings and develop a heuristic algorithm to find feasible matchings for large scale problem. The results from computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches are highly efficient and effective, and the matching rate of stable matching is larger than that of feasible matching. Finally, we investigate two extensions to demonstrate the applicability of our methods and also extend to a stochastic setting with random release times of orders.},

We study trade-offs of using Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA), Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT and RRT*), and Fast Markov Decision Process (FastMDP) as the collision avoidance algorithms. We examine low-altitude UAS navigating through a portion of New York City dense with skyscrapers to study the effectiveness of the algorithms in a challenging environment.

These data are typically non-stationary multi-variable time series with abrupt variations. The challenges of multivariate time series forecasting include how to identify the interactions between various variables, and how to assess the influence of historical data on present data. This paper presents the nature of the air brake system and its physical models. By analyzing the observed data obtained from the freight train air brake system, a Memory network-based Time series Multi-step fault Forecasting model (MTMF) is proposed. MTMF consists of a dual-encoder and a memory network module for feature extraction. The two encoders are used to extract features of short-term and long-term historical data respectively. The memory network is used to further mine the different weights of the long-term historical data. MTMF also designs a joint multi-step forecasting loss function, which is composed of shape, time and mean square error losses between the forecasting series and the real series. The improved loss function is no longer restricted to the differences in evaluation points. MTMF is evaluated on the real freight train braking system time series dataset. The results show that MTMF outperforms other forecasting methods on multivariate time series. The forecasting accuracy is increased by 5%-45%, demonstrating that the model is effective for non-stationary series and can better mine the dependence patterns for the train braking system.},

Meanwhile, the external disturbances and the unknown nonlinear uncertainties of the train are transformed into a new state, which is estimated by an ESO designed in the iteration domain. Then, the ESO-based energy-efficient controller with learning ability is designed, which enables the train to achieve the purpose of energy efficiency by reducing the input force. Further, over-speed protection with trigger mechanism is developed to ensure the train operates within safe speed range. All the control strategies are designed under the constraint on traction/braking force by considering the practical limitation of the train system. No model information is involved in the whole design processes and it is a pure data-driven iterative learning approach. Rigorous mathematical analysis proves the feasibility and the robustness of the proposed method, which can guarantee the train operates safely and reliably.

Numerous convolutional neural network (CNN) trackers have achieved unprecedented performance. However, CNN features with regular spatial context relationships experience difficulty matching the rigid target templates when dramatic deformation and occlusion occur. In this paper, we propose a novel full Transformer Sub-patch Matching network for tracking (TSMtrack), which decomposes the tracked object into sub-patches, and interlaced matches the extracted sub-patches by leveraging the attention mechanism born with the Transformer. Roots in Transformer architecture, TSMtrack consists of image patch decomposition, sub-patch matching, and position prediction. Specifically, TSMtrack converts the whole frame into sub-patches and extracts the sub-patch features independently. By sub-patch matching and FFN-like prediction, TSMtrack enables independent similarity measurement between sub-patch features in an interlaced and iterative fashion. With a full Transformer pipeline implemented, we achieve a high-quality trade-off between tracking speed performance. Experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our Transformer sub-patch matching framework. In particular, it realizes an AO of 75.6 on GOT-10K and SR of 57.9 on WebUAV-3M with 48 FPS on GPU RTX-2060s.},

The GA module is used to obtain gaze images of drivers, and extract the gaze features from the images. The SU module provides trajectory predictions for surrounding vehicles, motorcycles, bicycles and other traffic participants. The GA and SU modules are parallel and the outputs of both modules are sent to the IF module that fuses the gaze and scene information using the attention mechanism and recognises the driving behaviours through a combined classifier.

  abstract     = {Stereo matching depth estimation based on rectified image pairs is of great importance to many computer vision tasks such as vehicle navigation and autonomous driving. Confidence measures are typically used to refine stereo matching results, which provides robustness and efficiency for disparity estimation. However, previous learning-based confidence methods for stereo matching usually use the middle results or composition as a post-processing step to refine the stereo matching results. This cannot be optimized end-to-end and the performance is limited by the quality of the tri-modal output. To handle this issue, in this paper, we pursue an end-to-end hierarchical architecture and propose a differentiable confidence propagation (DCP) model of a cost aggregation network for stereo matching. The DCP model is integrated into an end-to-end neural network hierarchical architecture to guide matching cost volume aggregation. More specifically, to better represent the similarity of left and right feature maps, we extract unary context feature maps with an effective attention mechanism for matching cost construction. Moreover, we aggregate the cost volume with the multiple stacked DCP cost aggregation (DCPCA) networks to generate a more reliable and finer cost volume. This network suppresses multi-level disparity maps. Each output disparity is supervised with different training weights to learn in a coarse-to-fine way.

Considering that the traffic model parameters are random variables with known expectations and variances, the traffic signal control and coordination problem is formulated as a quadratic program with linear and second-order cone constraints. In order to reduce computational complexity, we suggest a way to decompose the optimization problem corresponding to the whole network into multiple subproblems. By applying an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) scheme, the optimal stochastic traffic signal splits are found in a distributed manner. The effectiveness of the designed control method is validated via some simulations using VISSIM and MATLAB.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing number of video surveillance cameras in public buildings, it has become challenging, yet significant to detect abnormal pedestrian behaviors in crowd management, to prevent crowd accidents. Although current advancements in human action recognition based on computer vision can help detect abnormal behaviors after their incidence, majority of them lack the ability to detect potential characteristics prior to the occurrence of real abnormal behaviors. Hence, in this study, we addressed this issue by proposing a novel dynamic centroid model (DCM) of a human body, and rebuilding pedestrian joint sub-segments from human skeleton key nodes obtained in camera images. We built a weighted centroid-combined force model based on Newton’s second law, considering acceleration, mass inertial of human body sub-segments, and internal constraints. Thereafter, pedestrian kinematic and dynamic parameters were analyzed, such as speed, trajectory, force. Furthermore, abnormal behavior detection criteria were constructed for typical abnormal-behavior cases: U-turn and fall-down. Comparative experiments between the proposed DCM and the state-of-the-art methods were conducted. The experimental results showed that the model was capable of detecting abnormal behaviors, with mean values of lead time of 277 ms in U-turn behavior, and 562 ms in fall-down behavior, prior to the captured occurrence of these two abnormal behaviors. Finally, a de-occlusion algorithm was designed and jointly used with DCM, validated by a fall-down detecting experiment including partial occlusion. Therefore, this study holds significant value for the prevention of abnormal pedestrian behaviors in public places.},

With the rapid growth of the electric vehicle (EV) market penetration, state-of-the-art algorithms based on mathematical programming are limited in handling high-dimensional optimization problems adequately. Unlike previous studies, we make the first attempt to formulate the fast charging station deployment problem (FCSDP) as a finite discrete Markov decision process (MDP) in a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework to alleviate the curse of dimensionality problem. Since creating a supervised training dataset is impractical due to the high computational complexity of the FCSDP, we propose a recurrent neural network (RNN) with an attention mechanism to learn the model parameters and determine the optimal policy in a completely unsupervised manner. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted on multiple problem sizes to evaluate the performance of the RNN-based RL framework.

This paper proposes a real-time and edge-based traffic flow estimation system. The proposed system follows a detect-and-track mechanism where lightweight deep learning models perform vehicle detection. A novel scenario-based tracking and counting technique is developed to provide multi-class, multi-movement vehicle counting.

In particular, the threshold parameters are adjusted according to road conditions, which enhances the flexibility of the event-triggered mechanism in face of different road excitation. Then, we propose a novel adaptive algorithm based on the acceleration constrained model by means of which the method ensures that the maximum overshoot of the vehicle acceleration cannot be violated. Moreover, under the presented control strategy, the performance requirements in the resulting closed-loop ASSs are guaranteed, while the tracking error of the vertical displacement converges to a small region.

  abstract     = {Decision-making for autonomous driving is challenging, considering the complex interactions among multiple traffic agents (including autonomous vehicles (AVs), human-driven vehicles, and pedestrians) and the computational load needed to evaluate these interactions. This paper develops two general potential game-based frameworks, namely, finite and continuous potential games, for decision-making in autonomous driving. The two frameworks account for the AVs’ two types of action spaces, i.e., finite and continuous action spaces, respectively. The developed frameworks provide theoretical guarantees for the existence of pure-strategy Nash equilibria and for the convergence of the Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking algorithms. The scalability challenge is also addressed. In addition, we provide cost function shaping approaches such that the agents’ cost functions not only reflect common driving objectives but also yield potential games. The performance of the developed algorithms is demonstrated in diverse traffic scenarios, including intersection-crossing and lane-changing scenarios. Statistical comparative studies, including 1) finite potential game vs. continuous potential game, 2) best response dynamics vs. potential function optimization, and 3) potential game vs. reinforcement learning (RL) vs. control barrier function (CBF), are conducted to compare the robustness against various surrounding vehicles’ strategies and to compare the computational efficiency. It is shown that the developed potential game frameworks have better robustness than RL and than CBF if the surrounding vehicles are not safety-conscious, and are computationally feasible for real-time implementation.},

This reduces the solution space and leads to reduced computation complexity. To further reduce computational time for solving the Train-SPPTW, we take advantage of the preprocessing + query structure used in existing pulse algorithms (PA) on one hand, and further overcome their limitations in computation efficiency on the other hand by proposing a tour-adaptive partial-bounding pulse algorithm (TPPA) to shorten the total time of the preprocessing and query stages. We use a simulation study on the tracks of the Dongguan-Huizhou intercity railway in China to demonstrate that the proposed TPPA reduces the computational time by at least 60 % compared to three existing algorithms without sacrificing the quality of the solution.},

In critical scenarios, deficiencies in an intelligent vehicle’s performance and defects of an algorithm can be exposed. Therefore, increasing the search efficiency and coverage of critical scenarios is key in improving scenario-based intelligent vehicle testing technology. In this study, a critical scenario search method for intelligent vehicle testing based on the social cognitive optimization (SCO) algorithm is proposed. This method has two main parts: global search and local search. The global search, based on the modified SCO algorithm, integrates the density peak clustering (DPC) algorithm and the cooling scheduling function, and aims to find all local aggregation areas of critical scenarios in a logical scenario space. The local search applies a multi-dimensional convolution algorithm to the global search results to find critical scenarios near the local aggregation areas. Finally, a longitudinal automatic driving algorithm is tested using the proposed method under a specified logical scenario in a simulation environment. The test results show that the proposed method can improve both the search efficiency and coverage of critical scenarios.},

This paper is the first to propose joint image-to-image (I2I) translation to enhance TMDF images of ITS. First, as TMDF images are without corresponding clear ones, identity preserving is critical for TMDF images under unpaired I2I translation. This paper proposes a fast diagonal symmetry pattern (FDSP) to preserve identity structure under unpaired I2I translation. Second, FDSP is introduced into CycleGAN to form FDSP-CG, which aims to learn the degradation mapping (i.e., FDSP-CG-d) from the clarity domain to the degradation domain. FDSP-CG-d can generate massive degradation/clarity image pairs for paired I2I translation training. Third, this paper proposes the dual residual block (DRB) to strengthen Pix2pix for rich face detail features learning (i.e., DRB-P2P), which learns the enhancement mapping from the degradation image to its clear version under paired I2I translation. Finally, the experiments on TMDF (i.e., the brevity name of the face database collected from real ITS) and Chinese famous face (CFF) databases, as well as CelebA and MegaFace databases, indicate that the proposed method can efficiently enhance TMDF images whose degradation variations are learned by FDSP-CG.},

  abstract     = {Origin-destination (OD) short-term passenger flow forecasting (OD STPFF) in urban rail transit (URT) is essential for developing timely network measures. The capacity utilization ratios of critical sections are key factors in developing these measures. The OD pairs passing through critical sections require a higher prediction accuracy than others; however, most studies have raised equal concerns on the prediction accuracy of each OD pair, namely, prediction at the network level. To address this problem, we raise heterogeneous time-variant concerns on OD pairs and employ an operation-oriented deep-learning architecture called the spatiotemporal convolutional neural network (STCNN) for realizing short-term OD passenger flow prediction. The architecture contains OD pair importance calculation, lagged spatiotemporal relationship construction, lagged spatiotemporal learning, real-time information learning, and sequential-temporal learning blocks. To this end, critical OD pairs are ascertained first, and the topological lagged spatiotemporal relationship among critical OD pairs are constructed and then normalized into grid-shaped data. The third block utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the grid-shaped lagged spatiotemporal feature and real-time information in parallel. A temporal convolutional neural network (TCN) is utilized for learning the sequential-temporal feature at last. Further, we design a time-varying weighted masked loss function to jointly reinforce the concerns on critical OD pairs during model training. Finally, we test the proposed STCNN and its components on a field dataset from Chengdu Metro. Although the proposed STCNN performs only slightly better at the network level than the other models, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods with significant superiority on critical OD pairs.},

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for developing more intelligent autonomous vehicles (AVs). A typical DRL application on AVs is to train a neural network-based driving policy. However, the black-box nature of neural networks can result in unpredictable decision failures, making such AVs unreliable. To this end, this work proposes a method to identify and protect unreliable decisions of a DRL driving policy. The basic idea is to estimate and constrain the policy’s performance uncertainty, which quantifies potential performance drop due to insufficient training data or network fitting errors. By constraining the uncertainty, the DRL model’s performance is always greater than that of a baseline policy. The uncertainty caused by insufficient data is estimated by the bootstrapped method. Then, the uncertainty caused by the network fitting error is estimated using an ensemble network. Finally, a baseline policy is added as the performance lower bound to avoid potential decision failures. The overall framework is called uncertainty-bound reinforcement learning (UBRL). The proposed UBRL is evaluated on DRL policies with different amounts of training data, taking an unprotected left-turn driving case as an example. The result shows that the UBRL method can identify potentially unreliable decisions of DRL policy. The UBRL guarantees to outperform baseline policy even when the DRL policy is not well-trained and has high uncertainty. Meanwhile, the performance of UBRL improves with more training data. Such a method is valuable for the DRL application on real-road driving and provides a metric to evaluate a DRL policy.},

  abstract     = {Transit Signal Priority (TSP) is a broadly used traffic signal control strategy designed for reducing transit delays at signalized intersections. Although recent TSP systems began to consider more objectives, TSPs that addressed transit reliability issues commonly focused on improving schedule adherence and were only able to reduce schedule delays by expediting buses. Buses running ahead of the schedule were not considered. This paper proposed a dual-objective two-way TSP algorithm (D2 TSP) using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). D2 TSP concurrently optimizes transit delays and reliability (i.e., headway adherence) by expediting late buses or delaying early buses. Further, the DRL agents were enhanced with a coordination algorithm for an optimized solution balancing opposite directions. This D2 TSP reacts adaptively and efficiently to real-time bus performance using data provided by readily available technology (loop detector) at low communication frequencies. We trained and tested this algorithm in a stochastic microsimulation environment in Aimsun Next that modelled a transit route segment with reliability issues in the City of Toronto. The performance of D2 TSP was compared with four baseline scenarios, one without TSP, one with the current TSP algorithm used in the field in the City of Toronto, one conditional TSP with an arrival prediction model, and one using DRL agents with a First-Come-First-Served logic. D2 TSP demonstrated its advantages in providing an efficient and balanced solution in reducing headway variability and travel time for both directions.},

In Safe-aaS, the end-users register to the infrastructure, provide their initial and destination location, select certain decision parameters, and make payment through a Web portal. As the safety-related decisions are time-critical in nature, therefore timely delivery of these decisions is essential. Considering these facts and road transportation as the application scenario of Safe-aaS, we address the problem of efficient decision delivery to the end-users in two stages. In the first stage, we propose a Software Defined Safe-aaS platform to address the problems of heterogeneity among the SDN switches present in the edge layer. Further, based on the utility of each of the SDN switches present within the vicinity of the end-users, we optimally select a suitable SDN switch among the available ones, for delivering them decisions in the second stage. To obtain the maximum utility for delivering decisions to the end-users, we map the interactions between the SDN controller and SDN switches as a Non-cooperative Single Leader Multiple Follower game. Then, we estimate the optimal delay incurred by an SDN switch applying the Lagrangian function and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Exhaustive simulation results illustrate that the energy consumed and delay incurred using our proposed scheme, Soft-Safe, is reduced compared to the existing schemes, Traditional Safe-aaS and MoRule.},

Using the trajectory data generated by GPS can analyze and study the various needs of taxi drivers. Big data technology such as interpreting, manipulating data and extracting nugget of information from data is crucial in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). In order to enhance cruising efficiency of drivers, this paper proposes a Taxi-cruising Recommendation strategy based on Real-time information and Historical Trajectory data (TR-RHT). Primarily, we construct a Passenger-Demand predict model based on Historical Hotspot (PDHH) to predict the passengers’ demand in hotspot area. Then, an Improved Decision Tree (IDT) predicting algorithm is proposed to construct spatio-temporal index to select suitable historical data. Furthermore, we introduce Hotspot Recommendation based on Historical Trajectory (HRHT), wherein it defines cruising event as the process of taxi searching for passengers. The HRHT model performs statistics and analysis on the different states of taxi operation, which can obtain the probability of catching passengers at each hotspot and calculate the travel time between hotspots. The model selects the statistics result of cruising efficiency and driving time between hotspots based on spatio-temporal index, then analyzes the selected result to provide optimal pick-up hotspots for drivers. Experiment results show that TR-RHT can precisely suggest a cruising path to reduce cruising time for drivers.},

It is a big issue that needs to be solved urgently. However, due to the development of infrastructure and technologies in 6G-driven Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), it becomes possible to alleviate urban congestion. Existing solutions either optimize the path planning of each vehicle, or only focus on solving the problem of resource allocation of a single road, neither can take advantage of self-organizing networks and easily fall into local optimum. Combining the above reasons, we propose the Direction Decide as a Service (DDaaS) scheme. First, it contains a novel three-layer service architecture based on Swarm Learning (SL), which enables orderly transmission of traffic data and control instructions and protects user privacy. Second, an improved local model and aggregation method is incorporated into DDaaS, which enables to make accurate predictions when the road resources at a single intersection are insufficient. Third, we propose a dynamic traffic control algorithm to provide signal light switching decisions for rapidly changing ITS. Finally, constructing an urban road simulation experiment combined with SUMO, we prove that DDaaS can reduce traffic congestion effectively and has significant advantages compared to other schemes.},

  abstract     = {Future worldwide 6G research will drive the evolution of emerging intelligent control technologies, such as intelligent speed advisory systems (ISA), to a more advanced generation. As a special type of ISA, consensus-based speed advisory systems (CSAS) can be widely used to recommend a consensus speed for a vehicle platoon, enabling minimizing energy consumption or emissions over a planned route. Recently, speed recommendation services that protect data privacy (i.e., how to obtain an optimal speed in a privacy-preserving way) have drawn tremendous attention. However, current approaches could still encounter service trust issues with central servers and the malicious behavior of vehicles. Furthermore, existing research lacks considering road safety constraints (i.e., safe distance between adjacent vehicles and road speed limits) that are essential for the practical deployment of CSAS. To address the above issues, this paper proposes Eco-CSAS, a safe and eco-friendly consensus speed advisory system using blockchain. We formulate an optimization problem subject to the minimum following distance and maximum road speed limit to minimize the energy consumption of the automatic vehicle platoon. In addition, we introduce a consortium blockchain and cryptographic primitives to ensure service trust and data privacy. We implement the system on the Hyperledger platform, and experimental results show that the system can achieve speed recommendations in a trustworthy and privacy-preserving manner while ensuring a secure platoon.},

Although machine learning-based hybrid intelligence has attracted significant attention and achieved much success in recent years, the current models are often ineffective and have poor generalization in extreme weather. This is because the training of a deep learning model is often uncourteous, meaning that the models can easily fail, even during the feature extraction step. An adaptive hybrid attention-based convolutional neural network (AHA-CNN) framework is proposed in this paper to address these shortcomings. First, fuzzy c-means and maximum entropy algorithms are utilized for image feature pre-extraction. A heuristic search-based adaptive attention mechanism is then presented, which adaptively combines the previously extracted features and generates fused images. By applying this mechanism, the key areas of an image are reinforced in a more intelligent and interpretable way, and less important areas are ignored. The processed images are then transferred into a modified region-CNN for further training. Finally, four real-world experiments on traffic sign detection, vehicle license plate recognition, road surface condition monitoring, and pavement disease detection are carried out. Results show that the proposed framework has high testing accuracy compared with other existing methods. The features fused with the cognition mechanism are also easier to interpret.},

Second, we propose a data management method to store lane information in the cloud data center. An improved density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise clustering algorithm and a gradual fitting algorithm are used to remove the outliers and improve the lane data accuracy. The proposed method is quantitatively evaluated against a real-world HD map produced by a mobile mapping vehicle. The experimental results show that more than 80% of the extracted lane markings meet the accuracy requirements of HD maps. In conclusion, our method can be used as a low-cost and efficient approach for updating the lane information in HD maps for autonomous vehicles.},

This would allow collections of individual preferences as predictions of travellers’ perceptions, and thus support data analysis and traffic control in a dynamic circumstance. Therefore, analysis of nonlinearly modelled perceptions and perception-based user equilibrium are the necessary problem we encounter. This research explores the existence characteristics of perception-based stochastic user equilibrium (P-SUE), a type of stochastic user equilibrium where travelers make route choices according to their perceptive traffic circumstances instead of actual ones. A nonlinear perception model with stochasticity is developed and the traffic arrivals are approximately transformed from Poisson-distributed to Normal-distributed. From a static perspective, we develop a P-SUE model with a heterogeneous traveler community and discuss the interaction among travelers’ attitude, grouping and static perception-based stochastic user equilibrium (P-SSUE). After embedding a day-to-day learning process into the P-SSUE model, we further explore evolutionary dynamics of the equilibrium. Several scenarios are provided to investigate effects and sensitivity of traveler-related and road-related factors. It is found that learning produces perturbation and makes the existence condition of P-SSUE more complicated; the convergence processes of P-SSUEs are significantly shortened as the learning rate increases to higher than 0.1.},

Independent stability controller is designed for feedback control of virtual DLO from perspective of MSR considering model stabilization. With the integration of proposed virtual DLO model, a digital-twin prediction prototype system of metamorphic object transportation is established. To bridge the communication gap between physical and digital world, a THz communication-based system framework is proposed to implement the digital-twin prediction for extremely security-sensitive system. Both numeric simulation and industrial experiment prove the availability and feasibility.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter-wave automotive radar is essential for realizing autonomous driving. Realistic channel model and simulation are important for system and sensing algorithm design. This work introduces channel measurements and ray-tracing (RT) channel simulations for frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) automotive mmWave radar. The 77 GHz channel measurements in an urban crossroads environment are presented. The dominant echoes (multi-path components) of the measurement are detected and matched with corresponding objects for each frame. A measurement-based electromagnetic (EM) parameter estimation method is proposed to find the optimal parameter set that minimizes the error of simulated radar cross section (RCS). As a result, the issue of lacking reliable EM material parameters for RT simulation at 77 GHz frequency band is tackled. Simulation results are validated in power, range, velocity, and angle domains with the provided EM parameter set. Extending validated RT simulations in similar environments with various configurations allows more reliable channels for rigorous testing without the limitation of channel measurement.},

  abstract     = {Numerous object detection algorithms, such as Faster RCNN, YOLO and SSD, have been extensively applied to various fields. Both accuracy and speed of the algorithms have been significantly improved. However, as 6G technology develops, the detection effect for the small object detection task in intelligent autonomous transportation is not ideal. To strengthen the detection ability and performance of multiple scales, especially for small objects, this study proposed an object detection model based on multi-attention residual network (MA-ResNet). At first, residual network with spatial attention, channel attention, and self-attention were designed as MA-ResNet. Meanwhile, the dataset labels were smoothed. On this basis, the proposed MA-ResNet replaced the original feature extractor VGG-16 of Faster-RCNN. Different layers of MA-ResNet were extracted for feature pyramid construction. Moreover, the improved Faster-RCNN model for object detection based on MA-ResNet was formed. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the model was confirmed. The results demonstrate that MA-ResNet outperforms other feature extraction models with faster convergence speed, higher accuracy, and stronger small object classification accuracy. The improved Faster-RCNN model for object detection can effectively improve the network retrieval accuracy, performance and robustness, can exhibit satisfying adaptability for the targets of different scales in different scenarios such as vehicle identification, autonomous driving in intelligent autonomous transport system with 6G. Moreover, the study provides a certain reference for improving the effect of multiple scales, especially small object detection in intelligent transportation with 6G.},

The images, however, contain flairs and fractures due to the influence of environmental interference and reflected light on the smooth surfaces. The image defects affect the accurate extraction of stripe centerlines. To segment the defects and inpaint them, we propose a new lightweight U-shaped segmentation model URS. A target-shaped receptive field is designed to efficiently extract the details of the local, the ring-shaped, and the cross-shaped context around the local, which facilitates segmenting various defects. A scale-select sub-module is designed to adjust the weights of features from different receptive fields. To train the model, a multi-line laser image defect segmentation dataset MLIDSD is constructed. Experiments demonstrate that the performance of our model surpasses twelve SOTA models explicitly and can achieve a balance between the accuracy and the lightweight requirement.},

This paper presents a pavement crack detection method based on 3D edge representation and data communication with digital twins. Firstly, pavement data is achieved by multiple sensors including video data and 3D scanning technology, and the digital twins based model is constructed based on data communication. Secondly, to distinguish between crack feature and pavement background in depth level, the point cloud data enhancement method based on fractional differential is proposed to strengthen crack boundary and maintain detail simultaneously. Thirdly, a 3D crack segmentation algorithm is proposed based on edge feature representation. After improved filter function with plane proximity and depth similarity, the gradient magnitude values of every point are estimated by the neighborhood and direction. Two thresholds are computed automatically using the iteration method to extract the crack from pavement. Finally, the dataset is established by 2600 crack data, and extensive experiments verify the proposed method could conduct better result compared with other existing methods using F-measure evaluation system.},

Considering that different images have different properties, instead of using a fixed block size for encryption, we develop a new block segmentation strategy to first divide the plain-image into two different sizes of blocks, &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$8\times 8$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$16\times 16$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , followed by corresponding size of DCT’s transformation. The strategy can ensure that the file size increment and rate-distortion are minimal. After block transformation and quantization, we encrypt DC coefficients by XOR and swapping, while AC coefficients are protected through block permutation and data embedding. The experiments show that our scheme does not compromise JPEG’s compression efficiency, offers satisfied security and maintains the format-compliant of the final encrypted bitstream to JPEG’s decoder.},

In this paper, we abandon the traditional time series prediction method and use a more efficient deep learning method to solve the traffic forecasting problem. Moreover, instead of considering spatial relation and temporal relation relatively, we produced a deep multi-view spatial-temporal network to combine them into one prediction model framework.

Using unmanned aerial vehicles as base stations (UAV-BSs) to serve ground users has become a trend for wide area coverage and capacity enhancement for rapid access of service in 6G networks. However, as UAV-BSs have limited energy or battery storage, solutions to optimize energy efficiency while providing high-quality services are necessary. Therefore, this paper mainly concentrates on the energy-efficient deployment of coverage-aimed UAV-BSs (Co-UAV-BSs) and capacity-aimed UAV-BSs (Ca-UAV-BSs) for the coverage and capacity enhancement of ground communication under disaster areas or burst data traffic. First, Co-UAV-BSs are deployed with DQN algorithm to to get the UAV-BSs’ optimal flight paths, which mainly adopted to detect out of service users in such areas. Then the users are completely clustered based on the detection results. After that, Co-UAV-BSs and Ca-UAV-BSs are deployed hierarchically based on the user distribution and sought to optimize the energy efficiency with acceptable user services. Still, DQN algorithm and the A3C algorithm are used for obtaining all the UAV-BSs’ location deployment and users’ best connections. The simulation results show that the dynamic flying path requires less energy than the fixed path for user detecting. For the coverage and capacity enhancement, it reveals the solution we proposed could provide high-quality service for users with high energy efficiency comparing to traditional algorithms.},

Dynamic service orchestration and adaptive resource allocation became a necessity for network operators to manage the rapid growth of users and data-intensive applications. The impact of network automation on energy consumption and overall operating costs is often overlooked. Guaranteeing strict performance constraints of Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) services while enhancing energy efficiency is one of the major critical problems of future communication networks, given the urgency to reduce carbon emissions and energy consumption. In this work, we study the problem of zero-touch Service Function Chain (SFC) orchestration for multi-domain networks, targeting the latency reduction of URLLC services while improving energy efficiency for beyond-5G networks. Specifically, we propose SCHE2MA, a Service CHain Energy-Efficient Management framework based on distributed Reinforcement Learning (RL), that can intelligently deploy SFCs with shared VNFs per se into a multi-domain network. Finally, we evaluate SCHE2MA through model validation and simulation while demonstrating its ability to jointly reduce average service latency by 103.4% and energy consumption by 17.1% compared to a centralized RL solution.},

And malware authors use policies like category disguise or family obfuscation in malware components to evade detection, which poses a great security threat to enterprises, government agencies, and Internet users. In this paper, we propose a malware family classification approach based on multimodal fusion and weight self-learning. Firstly, multiple modalities of malware such as byte, format, statistic, and semantic are fused in various ways to generate effective features. And then, we creatively add a weight self-learning mechanism of malware families into the classification model, which works by continuously calculating log-loss based on the family label and the probabilities predicted by each feature. The approach proves to achieve excellent classification performance on highly imbalanced malware family datasets with high efficiency and small resource overhead, which helps to identify and classify malware families and enhance the efficiency of massive malware analysis in Intelligent Transportation Systems.},

  abstract     = {Facial expression cognition technology continues to face challenges from certain perspectives despite the fact that there have been significant recent learning advances in computer vision in the areas involving posture, orientation, and viewing mode of photos or videos that affects the device performance. In particular, the current distributed machine learning schemes do not consider the privacy issue in face monitoring data. Hence, this paper proposes a new federated learning framework for unsupervised multidomain face recognition of postexercise. It is a graph AE design base to ensure multiple edge devices can cooperate with each other to ensure the optimization of the common objective function of the model to enhance the efficiency and speed of the global model. In addition, a multidomain learning loss function is proposed to share the common feature representation with other related tasks to improve domain adaptability. Adversarial learning is used to improve the recognition effect of the federated framework in each domain. The proposed scheme is validated on different multidomains expression datasets and the experimental results indicate a 19% higher F1 score than the benchmark scheme in multidomain face recognition tasks.},

  abstract     = {Acquiring a sparse signal from an underdetermined linear system arises from numerous applications. Several hard thresholding algorithms have been developed for the sparse reconstruction. In particular, the so- called Newton-Step-based Iterative Hard Thresholding (NSIHT) and Newton-Step-based Hard Thresholding Pursuit (NSHTP) algorithms were developed by Meng et al. recently. Although they are efficient, a faster sparse recovery algorithm with a better reconstruction performance is still needed. In this paper, we first propose a Pseudo-inverse-based Hard Thresholding sparse signal recovery algorithm called PHT for short. Unlike the Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) algorithm which uses the gradient of the objective function to iteratively update the solution, our proposed algorithm utilizes the pseudo-inverse of the sensing matrix to iteratively update the solution. We then analyze the computational complexity of PHT and show that it is &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$O(n^{2}/m^{2})$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; times faster than both NSIHT and NSHTP if they perform the same number of iterations, where &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$n$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; are the number of rows and columns of the sensing matrix &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\boldsymbol {A}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; . Furthermore, we establish a sufficient condition of stable recovery of the sparse signal with PHT by using the restricted isometry property (RIP) of the sensing matrix. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted which indicate that our proposed algorithm PHT is much faster than both NSIHT and NSHTP with overall better recovery performance.},

  abstract     = {Traffic congestion has been a significant issue across the large cities. Though a considerable body of research has investigated transit ridership and traffic congestion effect of new transit service, most research focuses on the effect at a corridor level or for localized areas, little research has examined the long-term effect of large transit projects on transit ridership and traffic congestion at the regional level, and the causal relationship between transit and its effect on traffic congestion and transit ridership is rarely analyzed in the literature. This study attempts to address this gap by conducting an empirical analysis in three Urban Areas (UAs). Using the synthetic control method, this study quantified the causal impacts of newlRT lines on ridership and traffic congestion. Results indicate that LRT contributed to traffic congestion relief and transit ridership increase, and that the effect changed over time and varied across UAs. This study provides empirical evidence for the effect of new LRT on traffic congestion and transit ridership and contributes to the ongoing debates concerning the effectiveness of LRT service to increase transit ridership and relieve traffic congestion.},

  abstract     = {AI-empowered 5G/6G networks play a substantial role in taking full advantage of the Internet of Things (IoT) to perform complex computing by offloading tasks to edge services deployed in intelligent transport systems. However, offloading behavior has a certain regularity, and the real-time location of users can easily be inferred by attackers who have historical user data during the data transmission process. To address this problem, a privacy-oriented task offloading method that can resist attacks from privacy attackers with prior knowledge is proposed. First, the local computing model, channel model, and privacy loss model are defined and used to quantify evaluation indicators, such those related to privacy, time, and energy. Among them, privacy loss is formalized as the probability of a successful attack by an attacker with prior knowledge. Second, the process of solving an optimal task offloading decision problem is formalized into a Markov decision process (MDP). Finally, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method PPO2 is proposed to solve the planning problem of task offloading with good generalization and convergence speed, where we focus on the location privacy requirement. Experiments show that our method can handle large-scale task offloading and obtain offloading policies with reduced privacy loss, energy consumption and time delays.},

The integration of (vehicular) communication technologies allows communication between the on-board communication units (OBUs) of vehicles, roadside units (RSUs), and vulnerable road users (VRUs), and contribute to the efficacy of ITS applications. However, these additional sources of information must be reliable and accurate. Security primitives such as confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity are required, but only achievable when supported with a suitable cryptographic key management scheme. This paper presents the design of a decentralized and efficient key management scheme, abbreviated as the DECENT scheme. This scheme provides secure multi-hop communication in dense and dynamic network environments while functioning in a self-organized manner. Through threshold secret sharing techniques, network nodes act as a distributed trusted third party (TTP) such that a threshold number of nodes can collaborate to execute key management functions. These functions include decentralized node admission and key updating. Novelties include (i) the unique self-healing characteristic, meaning that DECENT is capable of independently recovering from network compromise, and (ii) guidelines for choosing an appropriate security threshold in any deployment scenario which maximizes the level of security while simultaneously guaranteeing that decentralized key management services can be provided.},

One of their crucial utilization is in supply-chain management and scheduling for optimally routing transportation of goods by vehicles at a given set of locations. This paper discusses the broader problem of vehicle traffic management, more popularly known as the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), and investigates the possible use of near-term quantum devices for solving it. For this purpose, we give the Ising formulation for VRP and some of its constrained variants. Then, we present a detailed procedure to solve VRP by minimizing its corresponding Ising Hamiltonian using a hybrid quantum-classical heuristic called Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), implemented on the IBM Qiskit platform. We compare the performance of QAOA with classical solvers such as CPLEX on problem instances of up to 15 qubits. We find that performance of QAOA has a multifaceted dependence on the classical optimization routine used, the depth of the ansatz parameterized by &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$p$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , initialization of variational parameters, and problem instance itself.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in traffic signal control have witnessed the success of reinforcement learning. However, most of these approaches have focused on vehicle traffic and lack consideration for pedestrians. This can be attributed in part to the fact that the existing underlying technologies are not yet practical to deploy in real-world environments. Vision technologies, for example, can easily be obscured from view in reality. The direction of movement and position of pedestrians is difficult to estimate accurately. The emergence of 6G localization and tracking services offer new opportunities. With this base service, we intend to improve the efficiency, safety, and scalability of multi-intersection traffic signal control with mixed traffic flows. This problem is challenging for its coordination, scalability, and access of new traffic. To solve these challenges, we propose PV-TSC, a distributed reinforcement learning motivated traffic signal control with pedestrian access. We analyze different behaviors of pedestrian traffic, and integrate pedestrian traffic with the proven traffic signal control scheme for vehicle traffic. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to illustrate the superiority of PV-TSC against classic methods, and further analyze the effectiveness of PV-TSC design by exploring its variants.},

However, existing efforts rarely focus on protecting data confidentiality and authenticity in autonomous vehicle platoons. How to ensure secure and high-fidelity platoon-level communication is still in its infancy. This paper makes the first attempt for efficient and secure communication across autonomous vehicle platoons. Specifically, we present PDSM-FC , the first privacy-preserving data share mechanism with flexible cross-domain authorization over distinctive platoons. The key insight of PDSM-FC is the design of a new ciphertext conversion technique, which allows a ciphertext to be easily converted into another type of ciphertext, facilitating efficient access by all entities holding the legitimate authorization. As a result, PDSM-FC can achieve high-fidelity data communication between two unique platoons in ciphertext, so as to complete specific tasks including platoon integration. Rigorous security analysis shows that PDSM-FC is secure against various attacks such as collusion, forgery and chosen-plaintext attacks. Moreover, theoretical evaluation and extensive experiments demonstrate the practicability of PDSM-FC in terms of functionality, storage and computation overheads.},

We aim at minimizing the sum energy consumption of all UEs by the joint optimization of the task offloading decisions and the UAV position under the constraints of the latency and the total energy of UAV. The formulated optimization problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex problem and involves coupling of many optimization variables. To address this challenge, we first transform the original optimization problem into a linear convex optimization problem via reformulation linearization technology, and then the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed to achieve the approximate optimal solution. Numerical results confirm that the proposed ADMM algorithm can effectively reduce the total of energy consumption of UEs and ensure the continuous operation of the UEs.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), in conjunction with 6G, are a potential tool for monitoring agricultural lands and various agricultural applications. There have been several trajectory generation algorithms proposed for surveying agricultural land. However, in most situations, the accuracy of the trajectory is hampered by several factors, namely the complex geographical topography, performance, connectivity with the Ground Control Station (GCS) and positioning error of the UAV during flight, amongst others. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Drones Trajectory Generation employing an improved Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Non-Uniform Rational P-Splines (NURPS) based optimizer (DTG-GN). The improved GA utilizes a novel dual fitness function parameter to select an optimal path to map the weed-infested regions. The path chosen is often impeded by the high number of sudden turns, affecting the UAV’s speed profile and the path’s continuity. Therefore in the NURPS optimization, the computation of the intermediate knots vector between the control points improves the smoothness of the path. Furthermore, the accuracy of detecting the weed-infested area and the path length are employed to optimize the path. Besides, a 6G network is utilized for communicating the path between the GCS and the UAV to ensure seamless connectivity. Thus the time taken by DTG-GN to generate the optimal trajectory reduces by 38.815% for 50 control points. DTG-GN also reduces the average trajectory length by 45.67% for 50 control points, establishing its supremacy over conventional trajectory generation algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The exploitation/utilization of marine resources and the rapid development of urbanization along coastal cities result in serious marine pollution, especially underwater diffusion pollution. It is a non-trivial task to detect the source of diffusion pollution, such that the disadvantageous effect of the pollution can be reduced. With the vision of 6G framework, we employ Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) flock and introduce the concept of AUV-based network. In particular, we utilize the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technique to update the controllability of the AUV-based network, leading to the paradigm of SDN-enabled multi-AUVs network Intelligent Transportation Systems (SDNA-ITS). For SDNA-ITS, we utilize artificial potential field theories to model the control model. To optimize the system output, we introduce the graph-based Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, i.e., a category of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) mechanism where each AUV can be regarded as a node in a graph. In particular, we improve the optimization model based on Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) architecture with the assistance of the SDN controller, by which each AUV can efficiently adjust its speed towards the diffusion source. Further, to achieve exact path planning for detecting the diffusion source, a dynamic detection scheme is proposed to output the united control policy to schedule the SDNA-ITS dynamically. Simulation results demonstrate that our approaches are available to detect the underwater diffusion source when the actual scenario is taken into account and perform better than some recent research products.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the design and incorporation of innovative user control mechanisms, one category based on brain-derived biometric data and known as Brain Control Interface (BCI). BCI devices measure brain signals in EEG and allow users to interact with computerised systems, such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), intuitively. However, the utilisation of EEG data in the IIoT for actuator control and the collection of such biometric data as evidence for policing the IIoT introduces considerable implications for the users’ cognitive privacy. Thus, considering the importance of cognitive privacy in an evolving era of smart environments, it becomes imperative to develop methods that can ensure the cognitive privacy of users. Cognitive privacy also protects the anonymity of corporations and law enforcement. Furthermore, it maintains the inherent information found in EEG measurements, used by various machine and deep learning models. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based human cognitive privacy framework, named DeepCog, that ensures users’ privacy through the application of feature transforming normalisation. A deep MLP model then processes the encoded data to classify samples according to an integer-based subject ID, enabling the framework to select the correct secondary deep MLP model (one for each subject) to identify eye activity. Our experiments indicate high accuracy of 93.4%, with precision 93.2% and recall 93.8%, outperforming compelling techniques.},

  abstract     = {Due to the inherent broadcast characteristics of wireless communications, the data transmission is difficult to be shielded from unintended recipients. Secure communications over wireless channel is regarded as an effective way to overcome this issue in the design of wireless networks. In this paper, a new cooperative relaying system based on partial non-orthogonal multiple access (P-NOMA) is proposed, where two relays help the communications between the source and destination nodes in the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve). Specifically, after receiving the P-NOMA signals transmitted from the base station, the relay nodes decode and forward the receptions under the attack of a passive Eve. To improve the physical layer security (PLS) of the proposed system, we design four cooperative schemes for signals decoded at the relays and destination, where maximum ratio combination (MRC) technique is adopted to both destination and Eve to construe the worst case for achievable secrecy rate. Without lose of generality, the channel conditions (weak or strong), new power allocations, decoding principles and Eve locations are considered in designing forwarding schemes. In particular, to further improve the achievable secrecy rate, we also propose that, if the Eve locating near to the weak relay node, the weak relay only forwards the signal with lower power allocation factor at the base station. The closed-form expressions of the achievable secrecy rates are derived for the proposed schemes over Rayleigh fading and Nakagami- &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; fading channels, which well match the simulation results. By means of the numerical result, it corroborates the superiority of the proposed P-NOMA schemes over the conventional NOMA schemes. It is also revealed that, with an increasing overlap ratio, the advantage in terms of the secrecy rate becomes more remarkable.},

  abstract     = {Due to the absence of distinct boundaries, wireless networks are vulnerable to a variety of intrusions. As the number of intruders has increased, the risks on critical infrastructures monitored by networked systems have also increased. Protecting shared information using effective and robust Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) remains a critical issue, especially with the growing implementation of vehicular networks. Building an IDS that detects threats efficiently with maximum accuracy and detection is a challenging undertaking. Machine Learning (ML) mechanisms have been successfully adopted in IDSs to detect a variety of network intruders. Split learning is considered one of the main developments in creating efficient ML approaches. In utilizing the Split Learning approach, an IDS is successful in performing at higher accuracy, and detection rate as well as a higher classification performance (Precision, Recall).

  abstract     = {6G is the future of intelligent connectivity artefacts with Artificial Intelligence (AI) at its backbone. The Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) based 6G enabled infrastructure helps in achieving the required zero latency for autonomous Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) with features of low power consumption, lower end-to-end latency, minimal processing/transmission overheads, higher throughput and reliability. MEC are prone to a deadlock due to the limited amount of available computational resources, resulting in fatal delays in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicles to Road Side Unit (RSU) and RSU to ITS communication. The unresolved deadlock may entail higher energy consumption that can adversely affect the Quality of Service (QoS) in terms of safety and reliability with potential threats of causing fatal accidents. Therefore, it is almost imperative to resolve the deadlocks from MEC to comply with the QoS parameters of MEC based autonomous vehicles. The asserted goals can be achieved by employing an intelligent and adaptive deadlock resolution strategy. In this paper, a deadlock-aware, and collaborative edge decision algorithm has been proposed for facilitating the seamless communication of autonomous vehicles over MEC. Additionally, deadlock avoidance and prevention schemes have been evaluated using Bankers resource request avoidance algorithm, wound wait algorithm and wait-die algorithms for resource provisioning in collaborative MEC. Furthermore, the effectiveness of deadlock avoidance and prevention algorithms in real-time scenarios has been analyzed in MEC systems. The metrics used for a comparative analysis in this research include Round-trip time, Queue wait-time and CPU utilization. The proposed algorithm shows promising results when compared with prevalent techniques.},

  abstract     = {As one of the most promising solutions, edge caching is emerging to reduce the content retrieval latency and relieve the huge burden on the backhaul links in the 6th generation (6G) millimeter wave (mmWave) intelligent vehicular networks. In this paper, we first formulate the optimization problem in terms of request hit probability and investigate two crucial factors, which impact the effectiveness of cache placement in device-to-device (D2D) enabled mmWave vehicular networks. Then, the general mathematical expressions for optimization of the request hit probability with the constraints of caching capacity are derived. Moreover, a group caching scheme (GCS) is proposed to obtain the sub-optimal results by utilizing relaxation method and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Inspired from the Matern hard-core processes and by exploiting the spatially correlated characteristics of users distribution, hard-cored based caching algorithm (HCCA) is proposed to avoid the simultaneous caching for a particular file. In addition, a joint caching and scheduling strategy is investigated which maximizes the number of concurrent transmissions by D2D enabled vehicle pairs matching and antennas adjustment. Comprehensive simulations validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve higher performance in terms of request hit probability and the number of concurrent transmissions compared to the existing methods. Consequently, the proposed caching scheme has great potential in future intelligent vehicular applications.},

The Terahertz (THz) frequency-enabled communication system is also envisioned as enabling technology for Sixth-Generation (6G) communication systems. To this end, we consider a THz UAV network for our investigation. In this article, we study energy-efficiency (EE) analysis for UAV-Aided Terahertz-Enabled 6G Networks. The metric coverage probability (CP) is adopted as EE analysis given the QoS requirement. Using stochastic geometry tools, we derive a CP. Afterward, considering that CP, we study a network EE optimization method. Borrowing the idea from the existing literature, we reformulate the actual EE optimization problem into a solvable Dinkelbach nonlinear fractional programming. However, the optimization problem turns into a nondeterministic polynomial hard (NP-hard) problem. Eventually, we transform that NP-hard problem into a convex optimization problem using the ConCave-Convex procedure (CCCP), which is more tractable and feasible to find a solution for the optimization.},

In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework with 6G enabled transport system for joint optimization of depth and ego-motion estimation, which is an important task in 3D perception for autonomous driving. A novel loss based on feature map and quadtree is proposed, which uses feature value loss with quadtree coding instead of photometric loss to merge the feature information at the texture-less region. Besides, we also propose a novel multi-level V-shaped residual network to estimate the depths of the image, which combines the advantages of V-shaped network and residual network, and solves the problem of poor feature extraction results that may be caused by the simple fusion of low-level and high-level features. Lastly, to alleviate the influence of image noise on pose estimation, we propose a number of parallel sub-networks that use RGB image and its feature map as the input of the network. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the quality of the depth map and the localization accuracy and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.},

An AsynchronouS federaTed deep Q-learning (DQN)-basEd and URLLC-aware cOmputatIon offloaDing algorithm (ASTEROID) is presented in this paper to achieve throughput maximization considering the long-term URLLC constraints. Specifically, we first establish an extreme value theory-based URLLC constraint model. Second, the task offloading and computation resource allocation are decomposed by employing Lyapunov optimization. Finally, an asynchronous federated DQN-based (AF-DQN) algorithm is presented to address the UV-side task offloading problem. The server-side computation resource allocation is settled by an queue backlog-aware algorithm. Simulation results verify that ASTEROID achieves superior throughput and URLLC performances.},

  abstract     = {In order to improve traffic conditions and environmental pollution caused by automobile exhaust, it is critical and challenging to help numerous vehicle users to obtain ideal parking spaces in terms of quality of experience (QoE), security and efficiency. The parking assistance scheme using the consortium blockchain can get a tradeoff between security and efficiency, but it is a key issue to meet the preferences of parking space seekers and design a well-operated incentive sharing mechanism. This paper proposes a Parking Assistance Alliance (PAA) scheme based on double auction for vehicular blockchain. Through truthful incentives, the PAA encourages vehicles in the alliance to provide parking information for nearby vehicle users. Further, the vehicle user’s preference is fully considered when assigning the parking space. The matching priority is introduced by incorporating the parking space supply and demand, as a reference to provide prioritized service. Theoretical proofs and simulation results show that the PAA scheme can achieve individual rationality, budget balance, and truthfulness, with high user satisfaction, and the PAA scheme deployed on the IBM Hyperledger Fabric platform outperforms the existing method with an average of 7.42% higher successful allocation ratio and 35.4% less transaction confirmation time.},

  abstract     = {A self-designed AMR detector named Smart Road Stud (SRS) is proposed. SRS, installed along lane markings, is not only a detector but also a lane markings enhancement device. Because a single SRS needs to detect vehicles on two lanes, the vehicle detection method for SRS is different from the AMR detectors installed in the middle of the lane or at the roadside. Based on SRS, an innovative mathematical model based on the magnetic dipole is developed to simulate vehicle magnetic field. According to the model, lane information can be inferred to achieve traffic volume detection. Results show that a single SRS delivers traffic volume detection accuracy of 97%, providing a strong foundation for future research to achieve higher detection performance based on multi-SRS linkage. The significance of this paper is to meet the detection requirements of warning equipment installed on lane markings.},

  abstract     = {Pavements continually experience various types of distresses that are manifested in the form of defects that will eventually lead to the pavement’s failure. Selection of appropriate preventive maintenance strategies in terms of timing and method retards the large backlog of poor conditions of pavements, therefore improves the system-wide performance in an efficient and cost-beneficial way. However, the pre-treatment functional performance condition of asphalt pavement has a significant impact on the efficacy of preventive maintenance, and to provide years of service, it is necessary to designate an appropriate preventive maintenance method according to the actual functional condition of pavement. This study presents a new unsupervised learning approach for 1) extracting high correlation factors to reduce the dimensionality of feature distress data, and 2) accurately separating attributes that define pavement functional performance into severity levels to effectively assess the practiced preventive maintenance. Three unsupervised machine learning algorithms including feature extract, relevant factor analysis, and cluster analysis were executed. Based on the severity level results of the pre-treated pavement, the effects of four treatment methods (thin overlay, slurry seal, chip seal, and crack seal) were evaluated by a statistical analysis. The preventive maintenance data from the Specific Pavement Studies-3 (SPS-3) experiment of the Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) database are used for the analysis. The results demonstrated that selecting the appropriate maintenance method for the functional performance risk level of the pavement is beneficial in achieving successful treatment results.},

  abstract     = {Distributed drive electric vehicles (DDEVs) eliminate the complex drivetrain. The independently driven in- wheel motors also endow the vehicle with more ability for improving maneuverability. To this end, this paper proposes an integrated control framework of torque vectoring (TV) and active front-wheel steering system (AFS) to ensure the vehicle lateral motion stability performance. First, the polytope method with finite vertices is employed to deal with the system uncertainties and simplify the modeling structure, based on which a distributed model predictive control is adopted to construct a dynamic interactive model between agents. Then, through introducing the game theory, a distributed parallel control scheme is developed to obtain the cooperative strategy of agents. Such a design can also satisfy the modular and scalable requirement for integrated chassis control. To ensure the system asymptotic stability, the terminal input combined with the terminal cost function are treated as the constraints in the game paradigm and then transformed as the linear matrix inequalities. Furthermore, a robust &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\text{H}\infty $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; compensation method is used to suppress the system disturbance. Finally, the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests are conducted to assess the control performance. The results verify the proposed integrated control scheme is effective to enhance the vehicle handling stability.},

In previous protocols, V2I and V2V authentication protocols based on bilinear pairings or identity-based cryptography are computationally heavy or difficult to protect the user’s identity and privacy. In addition, lightweight authentication protocols have not achieve both V2I and V2V authentication, and may suffer from Onboard Unit (OBU) intrusion attacks, Roadside Unit (RSU) captured attacks, and difficult to track malicious vehicles. Therefore, a lightweight and anonymous V2I and V2V authentication protocol with batch verification based on Elliptic Curves Cryptography (ECC) is proposed. We use Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) and biological key to avoid RSU captured attacks and OBU intrusion attacks, design a feature embedding strategy with dynamic pseudo-identity to recover the malicious vehicle’s identity by the Trusted Authority (TA). In the application test simulating the actual scenario, our protocol is more efficient because of lower overhead and batch authentication strategy. The semantic security of the protocol is formally proved under the random oracle model. The comparative analysis and security proof results show that our protocol is more superior to others.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, Vulnerable Road User (VRU) trajectory prediction for autonomous driving based on the Intention-Attention-Gate Recurrent Unit (IA-GRU), Improved Social Force Model (ISFM) and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) is systematically investigated. Firstly, a novel IA-GRU is proposed for VRU (pedestrian, cyclist, and electric cyclist) trajectory prediction. VRU intention (waiting/crossing), VRU heterogeneity (age and gender), VRU-VRU interactions and VRU-dynamic vehicle interactions are taken into account. Attention is used to obtain the influence weights of the above factors used for VRU trajectory prediction. Secondly, a micro-dynamic ISFM is developed for VRU trajectory prediction. The impact of zebra crossing, collision avoidance with vehicles and VRUs, and VRU heterogeneity are considered. Moreover, traffic data collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is obtained and analyzed, and the parameters of the ISFM are calibrated by the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Finally, a data-driven integrated approach based on the IA-GRU and ISFM is proposed, and AdaBoost is used to prevent the model from overfitting and improve the prediction accuracy. The results indicate that the integrated model outperforms the existing methods, and the prediction accuracy is improved by more than 11% based on the collected traffic data, which can give us great confidence to use the integrated model in the autonomous driving domain to improve the safety of VRUs.},

Next-generation high-density matrix headlights enable precise, high-resolution projections, while advanced driver assistance systems enable detection and tracking of objects with high update rates and low-latency estimation of the pose of the ego-vehicle. Accurate motion tracking and precise coverage of the masked vehicles are necessary to avoid glare while maintaining a high light throughput for good visibility. Safety margins are added around the mask to mitigate glare and flicker caused by the update rate and latency of the system. We provide a model to estimate the effects of spatial and temporal sampling on the safety margins for high- and low-density headlight resolutions and different update rates. The vertical motion of the ego-vehicle is simulated based on a dynamic model of a vehicle suspension system to model the impact of the motion-to-photon latency on the mask. Using our model, we evaluate the light throughput of an actual matrix headlight for the relevant corner cases of dynamic masking scenarios depending on pixel density, update rate, and system latency. We apply the masks provided by our model to a high beam light distribution to calculate the loss of luminous flux and compare the results to a light throughput approximation technique from the literature.},

In addition, ONESTO authenticates and encrypts the communication between the ship and the shore via mainstream free and open-source software components. Initially, we present the abstract mathematical formulation of the problem, with its assumptions, goal function, constraints, and significant quantities. Then, we introduce the architecture of a system capable of continuously estimating the compressibility, processing and transmission time of streaming data. Such estimations allow ONESTO to calculate and apply optimal parameters for achieving the best compression ratio. Lastly, using a prototypical implementation, we evaluate the system performance with a Class B ship simulator on two realistic use cases. Our experiments show an excellent compression ratio with maritime protocols (more than 40:1) and a limited latency impact, demonstrating the approach’s viability.},

Constraints are introduced to ensure that vehicles do not collide with other vehicles, run red indications, or exceed a maximum vehicular jerk for passenger comfort. Results of simulation scenarios are evaluated against empirical comparable trajectories of uninformed drivers to compute fuel consumption savings. The proposed approach produced significant fuel savings compared to an uninformed driver behavior amounting to 37% on average for deterministic SPaT and 30% for stochastic SPaT data. A sensitivity analysis was performed to understand how the degree of uncertainty in SPaT predictions affects the optimal trajectory’s fuel consumption. The results present the required levels of confidence in these predictions to achieve savings in fuel consumption. Specifically, the study demonstrates that the proposed system can be within 85% of the maximum savings if the timing error is (±3.3 seconds) at a 95% confidence level. Results also emphasize the importance of more reliable SPaT predictions as the time to green decreases relative to the time the vehicle is expected to reach the intersection given its current speed.},

  abstract     = {Making safe and human-like decisions is an essential capability of autonomous driving systems, and learning-based behavior planning presents a promising pathway toward achieving this objective. Distinguished from existing learning-based methods that directly output decisions, this work introduces a predictive behavior planning framework that learns to predict and evaluate from human driving data. This framework consists of three components: a behavior generation module that produces a diverse set of candidate behaviors in the form of trajectory proposals, a conditional motion prediction network that predicts future trajectories of other agents based on each proposal, and a scoring module that evaluates the candidate plans using maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). We validate the proposed framework on a large-scale real-world urban driving dataset through comprehensive experiments. The results show that the conditional prediction model can predict distinct and reasonable future trajectories given different trajectory proposals and the IRL-based scoring module can select plans that are close to human driving. The proposed framework outperforms other baseline methods in terms of similarity to human driving trajectories. Additionally, we find that the conditional prediction model improves both prediction and planning performance compared to the non-conditional model. Lastly, we note that the learning of the scoring module is crucial for aligning the evaluations with human drivers.},

Currently, most of the resource allocation solutions for CAVs communication do not consider the driving routes of the cars. In this paper, we introduce joint vehicular route selection and radio and computing resource allocation for CAVs. The proposed approach is based on the graph search-based lexicographic A* algorithm that minimizes the ratio of failed tasks along the entire vehicular route considering the availability of both radio and computing resources. To manage the allocation of resources among multiple CAVs for each vehicular route, we develop a blockchain-based framework allowing resource reservation by means of nonfungible tokens (NFTs). Each NFT represents an exclusive right to the required amount of radio and computing resources for the given road segment and defined time interval. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by simulations showing that the proposed vehicular route selection algorithm reduces the ratio of tasks not completed before the deadline by up to 69% compared to the existing state-of-the-art algorithms.},

In this work, we study the problem of traffic prediction with expanding road network structures under the continual learning paradigm. Considering the model prediction performance, efficiency, and data accessibility, a SpatioTemporal Knowledge Expansion and Consolidation (STKEC) framework is proposed. This framework contains an influence-based knowledge expansion strategy to help the spatiotemporal learning model integrate new spatiotemporal traffic patterns and a memory-augmented knowledge consolidation mechanism to preserve the learned spatiotemporal patterns without accessing the data in previous graphs. Extensive experiments are conducted on a large-scale dataset and verify the superior performance of STKEC in continual traffic prediction.},

  abstract     = {Intersections are major bottlenecks for road traffic, as well as the origin of many accidents. Efficient management of traffic at intersections is required to ensure both safety and efficiency. Yet, the traditional solutions (static signs, traffic lights) are limited in their efficiency as they consider the flow of vehicles and not the vehicles at the microscopic level. By using inter-vehicular communication of connected vehicles, recent works have shown the possibility to have a great increase in the number of evacuated vehicles thanks to the possibility to give an individual right-of-way directly to each vehicle. In this context of intersections of cooperative vehicles, the scheduling of this right-of-way in order to maximize the throughput of the intersection is still a challenging task, with regard to the hybrid and dynamic aspects of the problem. In this paper, we propose an approach based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to efficiently distribute the right-of-way to each vehicle. A Markov Decision Process model of intersections of cooperative vehicles, enabling the application of DRL, is proposed. The performance of the DRL-based scheduling is then compared with classic traffic lights, and with two state-of-the-art cooperative scheduling policies, showing the benefits of the approach (increase of the flow, reduction of CO2 emissions).},

Most of the machine-learned models in the literature focus on quantitative error metrics like the root mean square error (RMSE) to learn and report their models’ capabilities. This focus on quantitative error metrics tends to ignore the more important behavioral aspect of the models, raising the question of whether these models really predict human-like behavior. Thus, we propose to analyze the output of machine-learned models much like we would analyze human data in conventional behavioral research. We introduce quantitative metrics to demonstrate presence of three different behavioral phenomena in a naturalistic highway driving dataset: 1) The kinematics-dependence of who passes a merging point first 2) Lane change by an on-highway vehicle to accommodate an on-ramp vehicle 3) Lane changes by vehicles on the highway to avoid lead vehicle conflicts. Then, we analyze the behavior of three machine-learned models using the same metrics. Even though the models’ RMSE value differed, all the models captured the kinematic-dependent merging behavior but struggled at varying degrees to capture the more nuanced courtesy lane change and highway lane change behavior. Additionally, the collision aversion analysis during lane changes showed that the models struggled to capture the physical aspect of human driving: leaving adequate gap between the vehicles. Thus, our analysis highlighted the inadequacy of simple quantitative metrics and the need to take a broader behavioral perspective when analyzing machine-learned models of human driving predictions.},

  abstract     = {Flight delay prediction is a major topic in intelligent airport management systems, which emphasizes the use of historical data and potential features to estimate whether a future flight will delay. However, many factors affect flight delays, and these factors can be categorized into weather features (e.g., temperature, humidity, and wind speed) and non-weather features (day-of-month, day-of-week, scheduled departure and arrival time). Moreover, the impacts of weather and non-weather factors on flight delays are different. Weather features play a more important role in adverse weather conditions and are the main reason for long flight delays. When the weather condition changes from severe to non-severe, non-weather features are the main reason for flight delays, and the caused delays are relatively short. Such different impacts on flight delays raise a strong need for considering the priority information of weather and non-weather features in flight delay prediction. In this paper, we design a variant of the Random Forest model to consider the priority information of weather and non-weather features to predict flight delays. A clustering algorithm-based analysis approach is developed to assess the impact of weather and non-weather features on flight delays and draw conclusions on the priority information of weather and non-weather features. A probability sampling method is embedded in the Random Forest at the feature selection stage to perform a prior choice for weather and non-weather features to help select the key influential features. Experiments are carried out on U.S. domestic flights in July 2018, and the comparison results demonstrate that the proposed model can significantly increase flight delay prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {A detailed representation of the surrounding road scene is crucial for an autonomous driving system. sethlcolor yellow The camera-based Bird’s Eye View map has been a popular solution to present the surrounding information, due to its low cost and rich spatial context information. Most of the existing methods predict the BEV map based on the depth-estimation or the trivial homography method, which may cause the error propagation and the absence of content. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a novel end-to-end framework that employs the front monocular image to predict the road layout and vehicle occupancy. In particular, to capture the long-range feature, we redesign a CNN encoder with a large kernel size to extract the image features. For reducing the big difference between the front image features and the top-down features, we propose a novel Spatial-Channel projection module to convert the front map into the top-down space. Additionally, concerning the correlation between front view and top-down view, we propose the Dual Cross-view Transformer module to refine the top-down view feature maps and strengthen the transformation. Extensive evaluations on the KITTI and Argoverse datasets present that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art results for both datasets. Furthermore, the proposed model runs in 37 FPS on a single GPU, demonstrating the generation of a real-time BEV map. The code will be published at https://github.com/raozhongyu/BEV_LKA .},

  abstract     = {In time-variant high-speed train (HST) radio channels, the scattering environment changes rapidly with the movement of terminals, leading to a serious deterioration in communication quality. In the system- and link-level simulation of HST channels, this non-stationarity should be characterized and modeled properly. In this paper, the sizes of the quasi-stationary regions are quantified to measure the significant changes in channel statistics, namely, the average power delay profile (APDP) and correlation matrix distance (CMD), based on a measurement campaign conducted at 2.4 GHz. Furthermore, parameters of the multi-path components (MPCs) are estimated and a novel clustering-tracking-identifying algorithm is designed to separate MPCs into line-of-sight (LOS), periodic reflecting clusters (PRCs) from power supply pillars along the railway, and random scattering clusters (RSCs). Then, a non-stationary geometry-cluster-based stochastic model is proposed for viaduct and hilly terrain scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed model is verified by measured channel statistics such as the Rician K factor and the root mean square delay spread. The temporal autocorrelation function and the spatial cross-correlation function are presented. Quasi-stationary regions of the model are analyzed and compared with the measured data, the standardized IMT-Advanced (IMT-A) channel model, and a published non-stationary IMT-A channel model. The good agreement between the proposed model and the measured data demonstrates the ability of the model to characterize the non-stationary features of propagation environments in HST scenarios.},

The robustness of the measure is supported through several sensitive analysis based on real Global Positioning System dataset.

  abstract     = {Connected Vehicles (CVs), an integral part of the future of intelligent transportation systems, use communication and sensing technologies to communicate among vehicles and infrastructure. However, as vehicles become interconnected, the vulnerability of their components to anomalies and deliberate malicious activity increases. In both cases, it is vital to detect and exclude anomalous data from the decision-making process. While deep learning techniques are gaining popularity for anomaly detection due to their adaptability, they are computationally expensive and require long training times. To overcome this challenge, this paper uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) based distributed ledger technique and combines it with social psychology principles of ability, integrity, and benevolence to calculate the reputation of vehicles. We introduce the probability of malevolence, a measure of quality, which is a function of the error measurements (between ground truth and reported values) and reputation metrics. We introduce various anomalies such as bias, noise, short, multi-short, drift, multi-drift, stuck-at, and parasite chain attack in the simulated data from the Intelligent Driver Module framework on road topology such as uphill, ring, on-ramp, off-ramp, and road-works to validate the efficacy of the proposed framework in identifying the anomalies. Simulation results show that the malevolence factor serves as an efficient metric for automatically determining the types of anomalies in the CV network.},

The cooperative lane-change movements with the coexistence of platoons and CAVs are typical scenarios on the muti-lane roads. This paper proposes an optimal control framework with the advantages of completeness and universality for platoons and CAVs’ cooperative lane-change motion planning in different task scenarios. Two typical cooperative scenarios are designed for the subsequent study of optimal modeling. The platoons’ reconfiguration and original shape maintenance are considered to reflect the universality of moving objects and the diversity of cooperative tasks. Approximately geometric contour models, dynamic externally tangent rectangle and inflated rectangle, are utilized to describe the platoon’s profile. Analytical complete collision avoidance constraints among different motion objects are constructed effectively. Other necessary constraints and the weighted cost function that minimizes lane-change time and motion energy are comprehensively considered. The optimal control models are established for the desired scenarios. Moreover, a numerical solution method combined with the simultaneous direct collocation method based on the trapezoidal rule and the barrier function method is proposed to obtain the optimal schemes. Simulation and contrast experiments are conducted for two scenarios. The results indicate that the cost function’s weight coefficients and specific lane-change tasks influence the cooperative motion planning effects and verify that the proposed optimal control framework is of reasonability, effectiveness, and unification.},

Although many datasets are introduced to support the study of DDC, most of them are small in data size and are short of diversity in environmental variations. This largely limits the development of DDC since many practical problems such as the cross-modality setting cannot be fully studied. In this paper, we introduce 100-Driver, a large-scale, diverse posture-based distracted diver dataset, with more than 470K images taken by 4 cameras observing 100 drivers over 79 hours from 5 vehicles. 100-Driver involves different types of variations that closely meet real-world applications, including changes in the vehicle, person, camera view, lighting, and modality. We provide a detailed analysis of 100-Driver and present 4 settings for investigating practical problems of DDC, including the traditional setting without domain shift and 3 challenging settings ( i.e. , cross-modality, cross-view, and cross-vehicle) with domain shifts. We conduct comprehensive experiments on these 4 settings with state-the-of-art techniques and show several insights to the future study of DDC. Our 100-Driver will be publicly available offering new opportunities to advance the development of DDC.

In the optimization stage, we simultaneously considered and optimized all of the historical constraints, and performed multiple iterations to reduce the linearity errors. For further reducing the cumulative error and improving the relocation accuracy, we used a bag-of-words model for global optimization. To lower the computational cost and increase the real-time performance, we set keyframe insertion mechanism and introduced sliding window, and used a new form of Kalman gain that converts the Kalman gain in multi-state constraint Kalman filtering into the inverse of the state dimension. We validated the proposed method by using the EuRoC MAV dataset and KITTI dataset.

Datasets extracted from fifteen controlled experiments were trained through CART algorithm in this approach. Fifteen original scenarios are adopted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach from both macroscopic and microscopic aspects. Simulation results show that the trajectories and density, velocity, flow vs . time curves and fundamental diagrams are basically consistent with those from corresponding experiments. Four evaluation metrics, final displacement error ( FDE ), duration error ( DE ), mean trajectory error ( MTE ) and relative distance error ( RDE ) are applied to quantitatively verify the precision of simulation. The mean of FDE , DE , and MTE are calculated to be 0.144 m, 0.112 s and 0.095 m respectively. With time intervals of 0.5 s, 1 s and 2 s, the mean RDE of all scenarios are respectively 0.7089, 0.4073 and 0.2515. Data from additional experiments of bottleneck scenarios and publicly available data of corridor scenarios are also introduced to prove the potential of general application of this approach. Comparisons and analysis indicate that the proposed approach has a good capability and reliability in simulating the pedestrian motion before the bottleneck. The models presented will be useful for passenger flow management and architectural design, also beneficial to understand the pedestrian movement mechanism in collective motion.},

Passive WiFi sensing collects WiFi probe (request) frames sent by nearby mobile devices in a non-intrusive manner, and can thus be employed to monitor ridership. Compared with the existing non-WiFi based approaches, passive WiFi sensing based approaches demonstrate the advantages of limited interferences, large coverage, low costs and lightweight calculations. More recently, although some dedicated passive WiFi sensing based methods have been proposed in an offline mode, due to sniffing opportunistically, unknown dynamic transmission boundary, MAC randomization and the difficulty in online feature extraction, how to utilize limited sensing data to provide accurate online ridership information is still challenging. To this end, an innovative public transit ridership monitoring system built upon a customized WiFi sniffer and an online ridership estimation algorithm is developed. In the algorithm, a convolutional neural network (CNN) module and a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) neural network module are first adopted to find correlations among inputs and capture the bidirectional time-series features, respectively; furthermore, an attention module is incorporated to determine the importance of an input sequence at different times. Real-world experiments are carried out on 8 buses corresponding to 4 bus routes in Hohhot, China. The evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other 4 online algorithms and the state-of-the-art offline algorithm.},

As shown by the experimental evaluation, SELMA allows the efficient training of standard and multi-modal deep learning architectures, and achieves remarkable results on real-world data.

By selecting signal timing parameters, such as stage time, stage center point, offset, and cycle length, as optimization variables, the relationship between signal timing parameters and the effect of green wave coordination was established. The stage time of the coordinated stage at the upstream and downstream intersections is used to calculate the evaluation index of the coordination control benefit of the whole road network. The case study demonstrates that this model can optimize coordinated path chains with left-turn traffic flows under green wave coordination management. In terms of network performance, compared with Transyt and Synchro, the signal control scheme obtained by the proposed model can reduce the average delay by about 30% and the average number of stops by about 40%. To meet the requirements of regional green wave coordination control, the proposed model can optimize different signal timing parameters to obtain a wide range of applications of green wave coordinated control in road networks.},

To enhance the tolerance of such methods against these variations, we design a cross-scale and illumination-invariant detection model (CSIM) based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture. A main cause of false detection in large-scale detection tasks is the inconsistency between various feature scales. To address this issue, we introduce an adaptive cross-scale feature fusion model to ensure the consistency of the constructed feature pyramid. To overcome the influence of uneven light, we build an illumination-invariant chromaticity space on the CSIM model, which is independent of the correlated color temperature. In addition, we adopt spatial attention modules, K-means clustering and the Mish activation function for further model optimization. The obtained experimental results show that the proposed CSIM produces excellent detection results for addressing the challenges derived from large-scale deformations and the illumination changes encountered during traffic surveillance.

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving systems have witnessed significant development during the past years thanks to the advance in machine learning-enabled sensing and decision-making algorithms. One critical challenge for their massive deployment in the real world is their safety evaluation. Most existing driving systems are still trained and evaluated on naturalistic scenarios collected from daily life or heuristically-generated adversarial ones. However, the large population of cars, in general, leads to an extremely low collision rate, indicating that safety-critical scenarios are rare in the collected real-world data. Thus, methods to artificially generate scenarios become crucial to measure the risk and reduce the cost. In this survey, we focus on the algorithms of safety-critical scenario generation in autonomous driving. We first provide a comprehensive taxonomy of existing algorithms by dividing them into three categories: data-driven generation, adversarial generation, and knowledge-based generation. Then, we discuss useful tools for scenario generation, including simulation platforms and packages. Finally, we extend our discussion to five main challenges of current works– fidelity, efficiency, diversity, transferability, controllability– and research opportunities lighted up by these challenges.},

  abstract     = {3D semantic segmentation (3DSS) is an essential process in the creation of a safe autonomous driving system. However, deep learning models for 3D semantic segmentation often suffer from the class imbalance problem and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this study, we explore how the class imbalance problem affects 3DSS performance and whether the model can detect the category prediction correctness, or whether data is ID or OOD. For these purposes, we conduct two experiments using four representative 3DSS models and five trust scoring methods, and conduct both a confusion and feature analysis of each class. Furthermore, a data augmentation method for the 3D LiDAR dataset is proposed to create a new dataset based on SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS, called AugKITTI. We propose the wPre metric and TSD for a more in-depth analysis of the results, and follow are proposals with an insightful discussion. Based on the experimental results, we find that: 1) classes are not only imbalanced in their data size but also in the basic properties of each semantic category; 2) intraclass diversity and interclass ambiguity make class learning difficult and greatly limit the models’ performance, creating the challenges of semantic and data gaps; 3) trust scores are unreliable for classes whose features are confused with other classes. For 3DSS models, those misclassified ID classes and OODs may also be given high trust scores, making the 3DSS predictions unreliable, and leading to the challenges in judging 3DSS result trustworthiness. All of these outcomes point to several research directions for improving the performance and reliability of the 3DSS models used for real-world applications.},

This paper proposes a new methodology for the path planning of a fleet of AGVs to improve the flexibility, robustness, and scalability of the AGV system. We mathematically describe the transport process as a dynamical system using an ad hoc mixed logical dynamical (MLD) model. Based on our MLD model, model predictive control is proposed to determine the collision paths dynamically, and the corresponding optimization problem is formulated as 0–1 integer linear programming. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based decomposition technique is then developed to coordinate the AGVs and reduce the computational burden, aiming for real-time decisions. The proposed methodology is tested on industrial scenarios, and results from numerical experiments show that the proposed method can obtain high transport productivity of the multi-AGV system at a low computational burden and deal with uncertainties resulting from the industrial environment.},

  abstract     = {In nighttime driving scenes, due to insufficient and uneven lighting, and the scarcity of high-quality datasets, the miss rate of nighttime pedestrian detection (PD) is much higher than that of daytime. Vision-based distance detection (DD) has the advantages of low cost and good interpretability, but the existing methods have low precision, poor robustness, and the DD is mostly performed independently of PD. A narrowband near-infrared (NIR) camera and an NIR lamp to relieve the impact of noisy visible light (VIS) and improve imaging quality have been selected; a LiDAR to obtain distance information has been embedded in the system; a nighttime driving scene pedestrian and its distance joint detection dataset NIRPed has been built. The NIRPed includes 146k pedestrian annotations, which is 3 times that of NightOwls, the largest VIS nighttime pedestrian dataset. Based on Faster-RCNN, a joint PD and DD method using monocular imaging has been proposed. The propo- sed method realizes the joint detection of pedestrian and its distance on the NIRPed dataset with the PD log-average miss rate and DD mean absolute error rate of 6.5% and 5.5%, respectively. For comparison, the joint detection method was implemented on other large-scale VIS pedestrian datasets as well. Moreover, compared with the existing vision-based DD methods, the proposed method is less affected by pedestrian distance and height, exhibits higher accuracy and robustness, and satisfied the ISO requirements for intelligent transportation systems (absolute error rate &lt; 15%).},

An adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2 FLS) is introduced to approximate the lumped model uncertainty, and a switching event-triggering mechanism (ETM) is applied to save the communication resources. Combining the backstepping approach and barrier Lyapunov function techniques, a prescribed tracking performance control method is proposed for SbW systems, where the initial values of state errors are no longer required in the controller design. Theoretical analysis shows that the tracking error can converge to the predefined residual set within preset time instead of the time tending infinite, while the closed-loop system is semi-globally stable.

Intersections are considered accident blackspots with major traffic violations that cause property damage, injuries and fatalities. An accurate perception of drivers’ intended movements at intersections is required for advanced red-light (ARLW) or turning warnings for vulnerable road users (TWVR). Early prediction of intersection movement and adequate warning assistance will ensure road users’ safety at the intersection. In this study, we adopted recurrent neural networks (RNN): long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU) networks to predict driver intended movements at intersections using the vehicle kinematics extracted from the Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs). We used naturalistic driving data of the Ipswich Connected Vehicle Pilot (ICVP) project, Queensland, which was collected from 351 participants who drove their connected vehicles during the pilot period. The pilot study installed roadside equipment at 29 signalised intersections to enable the Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System (C-ITS) use cases. Vehicle speed, speed limit, longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, and yaw rate are used as predictors and monitored in 100-millisecond intervals for 1s to 4s at different warning distances from the stop line. Separate prediction models are trained based on different monitoring windows. Furthermore, drivers’ intended intersection movements are predicted at two individual intersections to evaluate intersection-specific prediction performance and are found with improved prediction accuracy than overall prediction models trained with all 29 intersections data. Overall prediction models are useful for some intersections which lack available data for individual intersection-based prediction.},

In order to improve the ride comfort and operation familiarity of drivers when using the ACCS, driver’s personalized car-following (CF) characteristics should be considered in ACCS developments. In this paper, an ACCS framework with CF characteristics identification and application is designed, where the desired safety margin (DSM) model is utilized to describe driver’s CF behaviors. In view of the limited performance of on-board computers, a simple method for CF characteristics identification from the sight of driver’s physiology and psychology mechanism is proposed, which tries to estimate DSM model parameters on the basis of CF data. With the proposed method, the CF data under manual driving are collected and filtered for the identification of drivers’ response time, upper and lower limits of DSM and sensitivity factors for acceleration and deceleration iteratively. And the latest iteration results of DSM model parameters would then be applied into the ACCS when it’s enabled. Several naturalistic driving tests are adopted for the verification whose results support that, the proposed method could perform well in identifying drivers’ CF characteristics online by collecting and analyzing manual driving data with a much smaller resource consumption when compared with genetic algorithm (GA). Besides, with the increase of CF data volume, the identified results are also becoming more and more stable and robust. Therefore, the proposed ACCS framework is able to imitate different drivers.},

  abstract     = {Cellular vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications can support advanced cooperative driving applications such as vehicle platooning and extended sensing. As the safety critical applications require ultra-low communication latency and deterministic service guarantee, it is vital to characterize the latency upper bound of cellular V2V communications. However, the contention-based Medium Access Control (MAC) and dynamic vehicular network topology brings many challenges to model the upper bound of cellular V2V communication latency and assess the link capability for quality of service (QoS) guarantee. In this paper, we are motivated to reduce the research gap by modelling the latency upper bound of cellular V2V with network calculus. Based on the theoretical model, the probability distribution of the delay upper bound can be obtained under the given task features and environment conditions. Moreover, we propose an intelligent scheme to reduce upper bound of end-to-end latency in vehicular platoon scenario by adaptively adjusting the V2V communication parameters. In the proposed scheme, a deep reinforcement learning model is trained and implemented to control the time slot selection probability and the number of time slots in each frame. The proposed approaches and the V2V latency upper bound are evaluated by simulation experiments. Simulation results indicate that our network calculus based analytical approach is effective in terms of the latency upper bound estimations. In addition, with fast iterative convergence, the proposed intelligent scheme can significantly reduce the latency by about 80% compared with the conventional V2V communication protocols.},

  abstract     = {Steganography is an area where researchers focus on how to develop novel hiding techniques that are aided by the mathematical or computational model. In order to conceal the secret bits in a cover image, the imperceptible property and embedding payload capacity must be maintained. In most of the developed methods, some selective least significant bits (LSBs) of each pixel of the cover image is modified to hide the data which may lead to substantial distortion in the stego-image especially when the payload size is large. Therefore, to attain the trade-off between payload capacity and image quality, the authors have devised a binary lower triangular matrix-based secret message embedding process in which data can be hidden in the color pixel. In this secret message embedding process, the secret data is embedded aided by the binary lower triangular matrix. The formulated mathematical model for the secret message embedding process has ensured a secure embedding technique with reduced aberration on the stego-image. The proposed steganography scheme is preserving significant visual quality while emphasizing the security aspect by adopting an indirect data-hiding mechanism in contrast to the conventional mechanism. Furthermore, for the betterment of the visual properties of the stego-image, we have generically extended the formulation and tested it to check the visual quality. The empirical results of the proposed steganography scheme depict outcomes satisfactorily for the RGB color images.

Efficient evacuation after extreme events is of utmost importance, which requires transport authorities to plan for and develop solutions to ensure transport infrastructure resiliency to disasters. In this study, we develop a modeling framework for optimizing road network pre-disaster investment strategy under different disaster damage levels. A bi-level multi-objective optimization model is formulated, in which the upper-level aims to maximize the capacity-based functionality and reliability of the road network, which are measured by the resilience polygon area, while minimizing the total budget costs, and the lower-level is the user equilibrium problem. To efficiently solve the model, the Shapley value is used to select candidate edges and obtain a near-optimal project order. Realistic speed data collected from crowd sources is used to explore the dependency between the vulnerability and new steady state with copula functions. The numerical study finds that the dependency of road capacities does affect measurements of road network reliability. The investment strategy is significantly affected by the characteristics of road edges and disaster damage levels. Critical sections that can significantly improve the overall functionality of the network are identified. This paper provides a theoretical basis for authorities to make pre-disaster road network investments based on different disaster damage levels, road attributes and budgets.},

  abstract     = {Intersections are prone to congestion in urban areas and making competent speed plans for vehicles to efficiently utilize green time resources is significant for congestion alleviation and driving experience improvement. The key is to increase the chance of going through green lights and avoid idling at red lights. Existing works for velocity planning fail to fully consider various realistic traffic conditions, such as interfering traffic, free lane switch, and group efficiency, thus compromising effectiveness and limiting feasibility. To address all the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel method DeepGAL for vehicle control by dividing vehicles into groups, assigning a leader in each group and delivering intelligent control on leaders with deep reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments are conducted based on two real-world datasets with distinct traffic flow rates in Hangzhou, China, and the results demonstrate that DeepGAL achieves outstanding improvement over various performance metrics applied in five classic car following models considering realistic traffic conditions. Moreover, DeepGAL outperforms four state-of-the-art baseline methods over various metrics under both light and heavy real-world traffic flows. The test of DeepGAL with indeterministic traffic-signal phase and timing (SPAT) information under an adaptive traffic signal control indicates its effectiveness even with partial SPAT information. In addition, considering the practical issue that only some of the vehicles can be controlled by our scheme, we conduct simulations on different penetration levels of controlled leader vehicles, which demonstrate that even with only 10% penetration, DeepGAL can notably alleviate congestion and enhance driving experience at intersections, validating its great feasibility.},

  abstract     = {While vehicular ad hoc Networks (VANETs) are relatively well-studied, a number of challenges remain, particularly as autonomous vehicles become more commonplace. For example, devices on a vehicle such as, On-Board Units (OBUs) may have resource constraints which render them incapable of supporting computationally expensive cryptography operations required to achieve various security features. One potential solution is to offload computationally expensive tasks to other nodes in the VANET; however, the dynamic nature of the setup (such as the, mobility of the requesting vehicles and other nodes) compounds the challenge of resource management. In this context, we propose a scheme that uses Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) to achieve data confidentiality in VANETs despite such challenges. Specifically, we build a cluster of vehicles to perform CP-ABE operations without relying on other nodes in the VANET. We use Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration system, to build vehicle cluster(s) to handle distributed micro-tasks. In this scheme, we use a set of factors that impact the computation operations in cluster vehicle components (i.e., the OBU). Each factor, including the distance between the data owner vehicle and the target vehicle, the duration of each target vehicle in the cluster, and the resource of each vehicle in the cluster, has a weight based on its influence in computational operations. The Euclidean method is used to calculate the weight value for each factor. Based on the final total weight for each vehicle, our approach distributes the tasks between vehicles. We evaluate our results by comparing our approach with the mechanism of Kubernetes for task distribution, which only considers the resources in each vehicle.

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles (AV) are a promising contemporary engineering innovation. Since they have no human drivers, their vehicle controllers must be fully informed of the activities of their occupants in vehicle seats so that occupant safety and comfort can be guaranteed. This paper introduces a system that employs capacitive sensing and machine learning to inform the controller of occupant activities, like actions and posture changes. The system facilitates capacitive sensing by deploying a capacitance-sensing mat on the vehicle seat. A sensing circuitry connected to the mat measures all its capacitances continuously. Since an occupant’s body induces variations in these capacitances, temporal sequences of capacitance measurements represent various occupant activities in the vehicle seat. Subsequently, the system converts capacitance measurements corresponding to every time step to two grayscale capacitance-sensing images (CSIs). The CSIs, in turn, yield a feature vector corresponding to every time step, thereby building a dataset of temporal sequences of features. The system’s machine-learning unit tracks and recognizes occupant actions and posture changes using an action-recognition block, which is essentially a long short-term memory (LSTM) network trained on a dataset of temporal sequences of either features or capacitance measurements corresponding to various occupant actions. If the occupant remains stationary, a switching block in the unit disables the action-recognition block and enables a posture-recognition block. The latter is a &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${k}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -nearest-neighbor ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${k}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; NN) classifier trained on a dataset of features to recognize stationary occupant postures.

This survey examines the cybersecurity aspects of railway systems by considering the standards, guidelines, frameworks, and technologies used in the industry to assess and mitigate cybersecurity risks, particularly regarding the relationship between safety and security. To do so, we dedicate specific attention to signaling, which fundamental reliance on computer and communication technologies allows us to explore better the multifaceted nature of the security of modern hyperconnected railway systems. With this in mind, we then move on to analyzing the approaches and tools that practitioners can use to facilitate the cyber security process. In detail, we present a view on cyber ranges as an enabling technology to model and emulate computer networks and attack-defense scenarios, study vulnerabilities’ impact, and finally devise countermeasures. We also discuss several possible use cases strongly connected to the railway industry reality.},

While a successful attack could have an equally severe impact, motion control sensors are investigated to a lesser degree, and security research on them often treats only one of the vehicle types (air, sea, road). The same aspect also applies to mitigations proposed in some of the papers. We close this gap by providing a broad overview and comparing research on demonstrated attacks and defenses. The present survey is the first to cover demonstrated attacks on vehicle motion control sensors of air, sea and road vehicles. Moreover, for the identified issues, demonstrated mitigations and countermeasures for the attacks are referenced. Further, we discuss possible adjustments required to transfer a countermeasure that is demonstrated for one vehicle type to the other two. Additionally, all attacks and countermeasures are summarized in tabular or graphical representation.

How does it evolve with respect to the Market Penetration Rate (MPR) of connected vehicles? Here are some questions raised by this paper with a focus made on Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) strategy. Such a system, based on V2I communication, aims at providing speed advice/recommendations when approaching an intersection to adjust speed and enhance fuel consumption. The message is displayed on the Human Machine Interface (HMI) of the connected vehicles and a response is expected from the driver. This paper derives its interest in the response behaviour of the driver to HMI. It develops a two-stage methodology based on (i) Field Operational Test to collect realistic inputs (e.g., response rate, delay, deceleration profile, etc.) and (ii) a simulated environment used for extending the findings to non-observed cases (e.g. higher MPR). Besides, the methodology that is well-fitted for generic evaluation and comparison of pilots sites’ conclusions, one further contribution lies in the process to select the explaining factors. Factors are targeted among features of (i) the road configuration (e.g. number of lanes), (ii) the service configuration (e.g. activation distance), or (iii) the individual route choice and traffic conditions. Among others, it is highlighted that the activation distance plays a significant role in the response behaviour and, depending on the cycle duration, a short activation distance might be completely inefficient, while a true environmental impact requires high MPR.},

Recently released SAE Level-4 AV datasets such as the Waymo Open Dataset provide great opportunities to evaluate their behavioral impact on traffic flow. In this study, we aim to characterize the empirical Car Following (CF) behaviors of the Waymo autonomous vehicle and compare its feature with human-driven Vehicles (HV), and capture such behavioral differences using the IDM CF model. Our main findings include: (a) AV is much safer than HV, based on our analysis using surrogate safety measures, as time headways and jam spacings of the AV are significantly larger than HV; (b) the response time of AV is also significantly larger than that of HV in response to various types of stimuli; (c) despite the short length of trajectories in the Waymo Open Dataset, we have confirmed that these trajectories are suitable for calibrating some of the IDM parameters; and the calibration results of IDM are consistent with our empirical analysis. Moreover, the modelling results, reveal that the proportion of string unstable behavior of AV is less than that of HV; and (d) for HV, there is generally no significant difference between following AV and following HV except a smaller jam spacing when following AV. Overall, we conclude that currently AV behaves in a conservative way to ensure its safety at the cost of traffic efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are becoming a reality and are progressively penetrating the markets level by level. CAVs are a promising solution for traffic safety. However, robust studies are needed to explore and assess the expected behavior. This study attempts to evaluate traffic safety resulting from a near-real introduction of CAVs with different levels of automation (from Level 1 to Level 4). The investigation consisted of modeling different CAV levels using Gipps’ model, followed by the simulation of nine mixed fleets at a motorway segment. Subsequently, the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model was used for safety analysis. According to the results: (1) the gradual penetration of CAV levels led to a progressive reduction in traffic conflicts, ranging from 18.9% when the penetration of high levels of automation (Level 3 and Level 4 vehicles) is 5%, to 94.1% when all the vehicles on the traffic flow are Level 4; (2) human-driven vehicles and vehicles with low levels of automation (Level 1 and Level 2 vehicles) are more frequently involved in conflicts (as follower vehicles) than vehicles with high automation levels. E.g. human-driven vehicles are involved in conflicts from 8% to 122% more, while vehicles with high automation levels are involved in conflicts from 80% to 18% less than their sharing percentages, respectively, depending on different mixed fleets. This study confirms the theory and conclusions from previous literature that indicate a safety gain due to CAV penetration. Moreover, it provides a broader perspective and support for the introduction of CAVs levels.},

  abstract     = {CAVs have the potential to improve traffic safety and efficiency in a fully connected environment, but they face additional challenges when they interact with human-driven vehicles in mixed-traffic scenarios due to the uncertainty in humans’ driving behaviour. Another challenge is the unreliability of communication networks. Delays and packet losses in communication links due to dense traffic, communication interference, channel fading, etc. may jeopardize CAVs driving behaviour and negatively affect traffic safety and efficiency. While the impact of CAVs on traffic safety and efficiency at different market penetration rates (MPRs) has been studied extensively, CAVs have been assumed to operate in either realistic traffic scenarios with perfect communication or with only a very small number of vehicles with imperfect communication. In contrast, this paper investigates the impact of CAVs on both traffic safety and efficiency in realistic scenarios in terms of imperfect communication, large-reaction time, vehicle modelling, and traffic scenario, with a focus on quantifying the detrimental effects of unreliable V2V communication and large-reaction time. Results show that CAVs can significantly improve mixed traffic safety in the presence of unreliable V2V communication and large-reaction times by adopting a very cautious car-following strategy (i.e., larger time headways), but this is at the expense of a slight reduction in traffic efficiency. Specifically, safety conflicts can be reduced by up to 66.67% at 70% penetration rate in the presence of packet drop of 70% and reaction time of 0.5s, but only at the cost of a travel time increase of 2.6%.},

This study proposes a learning framework that combines primitive-based interaction pattern recognition and risk analysis. The Hidden Markov Model with the Gaussian mixture model (GMM-HMM) approach is developed to decompose the LC scenarios into primitives. Then K-means clustering with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is applied to gather the primitives into 13 LC interaction patterns. Finally, this study considers time-to-collision (TTC) of two conflict types involved in the LC process. And the TTC is used to analyze the risk of interaction patterns and extract high-risk LC interaction patterns. The LC events obtained from the Highway Drone Dataset (highD) demonstrate that the identified LC interaction patterns contain interpretable semantic information. This study identifies the dynamic spatiotemporal characteristics and risk formation mechanism of the LC interaction patterns. The findings are useful to comprehensively understand the latent interaction patterns, which can then be used to design and improve the decision-making process during lane changes and enhance the safety of autonomous vehicle.},

  abstract     = {A connected and automated vehicle safety metric determines the performance of a subject vehicle (SV) by analyzing the data involving the interactions among the SV and other dynamic road users and environmental features. When the data set contains only a finite set of samples collected from the naturalistic mixed multi-modal traffic driving environment, a metric is expected to generalize the safety assessment outcome from the observed finite samples to the unobserved cases by specifying in what domain the SV is expected to be safe and how safe the SV is, statistically, in that domain. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing safety metrics is able to justify the above properties with an operational domain specific, guaranteed complete, and provably unbiased safety evaluation outcome. In this paper, we propose a novel safety metric that involves the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\alpha $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -shape and the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\epsilon $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -almost robustly forward invariant set to characterize the SV’s almost safe operable domain and the probability for the SV to remain inside the safe domain indefinitely, respectively. The empirical performance of the proposed method is demonstrated in several different operational design domains through a series of cases covering a variety of fidelity levels (real-world and simulators), driving environments (highway, urban, and intersections), road users (car, truck, and pedestrian), and SV driving behaviors (human driver and self driving algorithms).},

  abstract     = {Previous studies have mostly hypothesised or provided preliminary evidence that crash risk during mandatory lane-changing manoeuvres in a connected environment would be reduced. However, the unavailability of crash data for a connected environment makes it challenging to confirm such a hypothesis. To this end, this study has adopted an Extreme Value Theory approach to estimate and compare crash risk using traffic conflicts during mandatory lane-changing manoeuvres in the traditional and connected environments. Using the CARRS-Q advanced driving simulator, seventy-eight participants performed mandatory lane-changing manoeuvres in three randomised driving conditions: baseline (without driving aids), connected environment with perfect communication (PC), and connected environment with communication delay (CD). Driving-related factors obtained from the driving simulator data such as speeds, spacings, lag gaps, and remaining distances were used as input to a block maximum (or generalised extreme value, GEV) model. The characteristics of the estimated GEV distributions and relative crash risk were employed as an indicator of safety. Results reveal that in the connected environment driving conditions, the mandatory lane-changing crash risk is significantly reduced compared to the baseline, with the highest reduction observed in the PC condition. The crash risk is found to be higher in the CD condition compared with the PC condition. Findings of this study confirm (i) that the connected environment has the potential to reduce the crash risk substantially by assisting drivers during mandatory lane-changing manoeuvres, and (ii) the efficacy of GEV models to quantify crash risk by using conflict data when crash records are unavailable.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous platoons are good alternatives for cargo transportation, with many approaches to safety and efficiency issues. In the last decades, much effort has been employed in this context, with solutions ranging from low-level control laws to learning strategies. Although some papers have concentrated on methods robust to disturbances or resilient to disruptions, most of the current literature assumes that the platoon starts and remains connected all the time, even when subjecting vehicles to limited communication ranges and time-delay. Therefore, in this paper, we address the problem of connectivity maintenance and stability of platoons under the complete disconnection of vehicles. The main goal is to increase the tolerance to agent exits, external elements (such as traffic lights and human-driven vehicles), and non-ideal initial conditions, improving traffic safety in mixed traffic scenarios. By modeling the network connection as a Directed Acyclic Graph, we use a state-machine policy to recover connectivity and regulate the spacing distance to other vehicles under heterogeneous time-delays. We demonstrate that this state alteration can be interpreted as a reference tracking problem and propose a design procedure that provides stability and zero spacing error in steady-state. Our control protocol allows vehicles to reach a consensus with the team, even when they start disconnected from other ones. Results with agent-based and nonlinear simulations illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {The interaction between automated and human-driven vehicles in mixed (human/automated) platoons is far from understood. To study this interaction, the notion of head-to-tail string stability was proposed in the literature. Head-to-tail string stability is an extension of the standard string stability concept where, instead of asking every vehicle to achieve string stability, a lack of string stability is allowed due to human drivers, provided it can be suitably compensated by automated vehicles sparsely inserted in the platoon. This work introduces a theoretical framework for the problem of head-to-tail string stability of mixed platoons: it discusses a suitable vehicle-following human driver model to study mixed platoons, and it gives a reduced-order design strategy for head-to-tail string stability only depending on three gains. The work further discusses the safety limitations of the head-to-tail string stability notion, and it shows that safety improvements can be attained by an appropriate reduced-order design strategy only depending on two additional gains. To validate the effectiveness of the design, linear and nonlinear simulations show that the string stability/safety trade-offs of the proposed reduced-order design are comparable with those resulting from full-order designs.},

The traffic under consideration is mixed with connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-piloted vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The proposed collaborative control is of two levels. At the upper level, the objective is to minimize total delay via platoon control and dynamic priority control of conflicting movements. We formulate the platoon coordination of mixed traffic as a mixed-integer linear programming problem (MILP). This MILP determines whether adjacent vehicles will form a platoon and prioritize any two conflicting movements subject to lateral safety and rear-end safety constraints. At the lower level, we propose an eco-driving strategy to minimize the energy consumption by optimizing the speed profile of the platoon leading vehicles subject to the dynamic priority control from the upper level, i.e., the entry time to the merging zone. We deduce an analytical solution to the eco-driving problem using optimal control theory. Compared with existing benchmarks, such as the first-come-first-served policy, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art controllers in reducing the total delay. Sensitivity analysis regarding the penetration rate of CAVs shows that substantial improvements can be achieved even at low to medium penetration rates of CAVs.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) for mixed platoons consisting of both human-driven vehicles (HVs) and automated vehicles (AVs). This research is critical because the penetration rate of AVs in the transportation system will remain unsaturated for a long time. Uncertainties and randomness are prevalent in human driving behaviours and highly affect the platoon safety and stability, which need to be considered in the CACC design. A further challenge is the difficulty to know the exact models of the HVs and the exact powertrain parameters of both AVs and HVs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a data-driven model predictive control (MPC) that does not need the exact models of HVs or powertrain parameters. The MPC design adopts the technique of data-driven reachability to predict the future trajectory of the mixed platoon within a given horizon based on noisy vehicle measurements. Compared to the classic adaptive cruise control (ACC) and existing data-driven adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), the proposed MPC ensures satisfaction of constraints such as acceleration limit and safe inter-vehicular gap. With this salient feature, the proposed MPC has provably guarantee in establishing a safe and robustly stable mixed platoon despite of the velocity changes of the leading vehicle. The efficacy and advantage of the proposed MPC are verified through comparison with the classic ACC and data-driven ADP methods on both small and large mixed platoons.},

  abstract     = {Mixed traffic of conventional and automated vehicles entails many challenges concerning the safe coexistence and the improvement of traffic efficiency. As a solution, a Traffic Management Center (TMC) combines information from physical sensors and communicated data to enable advanced traffic controllers. Since there is no sufficient penetration rate of automated vehicles nowadays, such a solution could be developed and tested with synthetically generated data using simulation, which models the future Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). This paper addresses the challenges for evaluation of such a system by the means of simulation. For this purpose, we present the Eclipse MOSAIC Multi-Domain Simulation Framework, which provides the possibility to couple best-in-class simulators of the domains traffic, application, and communication, as well as to include further models and external native code libraries. Moreover, we discuss modeling extensions for traffic control algorithms and our method to create a highway scenario based on real traffic data. As primary result, many research questions for mixed traffic and ITS could be investigated using the MOSAIC framework. In an exemplary study, we analyze the deployment effort for infrastructure and communication technologies in order to facilitate a Mainstream Traffic Flow Controller in a realistic scenario with mixed traffic. Simulations performed with MOSAIC confirmed that traffic efficiency improvement is feasible even with fewer infrastructure components, thus with less cost.},

  abstract     = {The gradual deployment of automated vehicles on the existing road network will lead to a long transition period in which vehicles at different driving automation levels and capabilities will share the road with human driven vehicles, resulting into what is known as mixed traffic. Whether our road infrastructure is ready to safely and efficiently accommodate this mixed traffic remains a knowledge gap. Microscopic traffic simulation provides a proactive approach for assessing these implications. However, differences in assumptions regarding modeling automated driving in current simulation studies, and the use of different terminology make it difficult to compare the results of these studies. Therefore, the aim of this study is to specify the aspects to consider for modeling automated driving in microscopic traffic simulations using harmonized concepts, to investigate how both empirical studies and microscopic traffic simulation studies on automated driving have considered the proposed aspects, and to identify the state of the practice and the research needs to further improve the modeling of automated driving. Six important aspects were identified: the role of authorities, the role of users, the vehicle system, the perception of surroundings based on the vehicle’s sensors, the vehicle connectivity features, and the role of the infrastructure both physical and digital. The research gaps and research directions in relation to these aspects are identified and proposed, these might bring great benefits for the development of more accurate and realistic modeling of automated driving in microscopic traffic simulations.},

While several studies have presented stability analyses of various traffic systems, most have relied on linear analysis methods, which cannot capture the complex nonlinear dynamic behavior of heterogeneous traffic flow. To address this shortcoming, this paper derives a generic Hopf bifurcation structure that can be applied to multiclass traffic models. The proposed bifurcation structure is investigated to understand the characteristics of heterogeneous traffic flow in a connected and autonomous environment as case studies. The results, based on selected on- field calibrated traffic models, show that (i) the linear analysis results deviate significantly from the actual instability of the mixed traffic system, which illustrates the necessity of a bifurcation analysis; and (ii) connected human-driven vehicles and connected autonomous vehicles have the ability to alleviate the formation and propagation of traffic oscillations. Finally, the theoretical analysis results are verified through simulation experiments.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of autonomous driving, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have started to appear on public roads, which has inevitably affected current traffic conditions and the operations of Manual Vehicles (MVs). Current research on AVs’ influence has mainly been conducted at individual level of driving behaviors, while few studies have focused on the overall network level to consider the traffic flow pattern due to mixed traffic. In this work, considering varying signal control schemes and demand loading patterns, we conducted simulation experiments based on a grid network and a real-world network in Beijing using SUMO. Traffic flow with the mixture of MVs, low-level AVs (LAVs), and high-level AVs (HAVs) were emulated so to investigate how the network performs at various levels of mixed traffic. Driving behaviors between the three types of vehicles were calibrated using driving data drawn from OpenACC dataset, and Waymo Open Dataset. The capacity and critical accumulation of the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) were chosen as the key indicators of network performance. We found that AVs positively boost network capacity (up to 19.0% increase) but a negative influence on critical accumulation was also observed (up to 9.0% decrease). However, the positive impact of OpenACC and Waymo’s AVs on macroscopic traffic is still far from ideal since they may be too conservative. AVs can boost flow when traffic is in unsaturated or saturated states. However, when traffic flow is oversaturated, AVs can instead cause flow and average speed to drop faster than that in the MV-only scenario.},

Firstly, the car-following modes and their proportion of mixed traffic flow without and with CAVs dedicated lanes are analyzed. Secondly, the fundamental diagram of mixed traffic flow is derived based on car-following models to analyze the traffic capacity with and without CAVs dedicated lanes. Then, the relevant properties of the fundamental diagram with CAVs dedicated lanes are proposed and proved. Finally, the sensitivity of related parameters (e.g., CAVs penetration rate, time headway, and free-flow speed) in the fundamental diagram is discussed. Results show that (1) the increase of CAVs penetration rate and free-flow speed can improve the traffic capacity; (2) the design of smaller CAVs time headway benefits traffic capacity. Moreover, one and two CAVs dedicated lanes of three manual lanes are set to improve the traffic capacity to the greatest extent when the penetration rate of CAVs reaches 0.6 and 0.86, respectively. It is noteworthy that developing CAVs dedicated lanes under a reasonable CAVs penetration rate does not waste resources and increases traffic congestion while improving traffic capacity.},

Secondly, according to the different main factors influencing traffic flow, free flow, terrain jams, and homogeneous congested flow coexist on the slope section. The traffic flow in the crowded terrain area is significantly negatively correlated with the length and longitudinal gradient of the slope, and increasing the longitudinal angle of the hill will extend the congested terrain area. In addition, the influence of the change in slope conditions on mixed traffic flow has a critical longitudinal gradient of 3% and a fixed critical slope length.

The primary objective of this paper is to incorporate the reinforcement learning (RL) technique into vehicle merging control to achieve global cooperation. A communication protocol among RL agents is integrated with the Soft Actor-Critic (CSAC) algorithm. The parallel SAC agents with a parameter-sharing structure cooperate to optimize the common reward function. It enables CAVs to know the actions of each other so that they proactively negotiate to adjust speeds. We designed a parsimonious state representation containing crucial merging information to speed up the RL training. The effects of the merging control strategy were investigated with the simulation model in scenarios with different CAV penetration rates and traffic flow compositions. Results showed that the CSAC-based merging strategy generated collision-free merging trajectories with a short travel time while guaranteeing traffic safety in various traffic conditions. Four baselines (including two rule-based and two RL-based merging strategies) were applied in the same scenarios for comparison. It was found that the proposed merging strategy took the safest merging behaviors (zero traffic conflicts) and reduced the most significant travel time (56.9%).},

  abstract     = {To make intelligent decisions in an autonomous vehicle, the system must predict the future reactions of surrounding vehicles for any given action plan of the ego vehicle. However, learning reactive trajectories is challenging due to scant action-reaction pair data. That is, building a dataset with multiple action-reaction pairs for an identical scene history is impossible in reality. Here, we propose a semi-supervised learning framework with auxiliary structures to handle this problem. The proposed training framework has two modules: Action Reconstructor and Identifier modules with corresponding loss functions referred to as the Reconstruction Loss and Association Loss. In addition to the conventional supervised approach pertaining to readily available data, the Action Reconstructor module is employed to learn the dependencies on the ego vehicle in an unsupervised manner. Furthermore, reaction trajectory data corresponding to the augmented future trajectories of the ego vehicle are not available, meaning that the model must be trained in an unsupervised manner as well. The main idea of the proposed unsupervised learning method is to find the identity feature vector from both history and future trajectories and associate these features for each vehicle. This idea is realized by introducing the Identifier network and the Association Loss, which are used only during the training process. Interestingly, experimental results show that plausible reaction can be predicted for the augmented future trajectory of the ego vehicle, which indicates that the network can generalize the interactive behavior of vehicles from a partially labelled dataset.},

  abstract     = {To optimize a vehicle platoon system in terms of car-following behavior, a decentralized model predictive control (MPC) strategy for longitudinal velocity control was established (namely, CF-MPC). Firstly, considering the influence of car-following behavior on vehicle states, a longitudinal velocity control model for platoons of connected and automated vehicles (CAV) was designed. Based on that model, an upper-level MPC controller was built to obtain the desired acceleration of the vehicles. Secondly, a lower-level controller received the desired acceleration signal and converted it into the expected throttle opening/braking pressure, to control acceleration/deceleration. Then, the Lyapunov stability method was used to detect the stability conditions that the model should satisfy. Finally, three simulation procedures—constant speed, acceleration, and deceleration were tested, and the validity of the CF-MPC method was verified from the perspectives of a model strategy and a control strategy. The simulation results show that with the proposed CF-MPC method, CAV platoons quickly completed velocity tracking and maintained a safe distance, thereby improving traffic efficiency, fuel economy, driving safety, and transportation capacity.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study mixed traffic systems that move along a single-lane ring-road or open-road. The traffic flow forms a platoon, which includes a number of heterogeneous human-driven vehicles (HDVs) together with only one connected and automated vehicle (CAV) that receives information from a subset of neighbors. The dynamics of HDVs are assumed to follow a general continuous-time nonlinear car-following model, which is a function of their velocity, spacing, and the relative velocity. The acceleration of the single CAV is also directly controlled by a dynamical output-feedback controller. The ultimate goal of this work is to present a robust control strategy that can smoothen the traffic flow in the presence of undesired disturbances (e.g. abrupt deceleration) and parametric uncertainties. A prerequisite for synthesizing a dynamical output controller is the stabilizability and detectability of the underlying system. Accordingly, a theoretical analysis is presented first to prove the stabilizability and detectability of the mixed traffic flow system. Then, two &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$H_\infty $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; control strategies, with and without considering uncertainties in the system dynamics, are designed. The efficiency of the two control methods is subsequently illustrated through numerical simulations, and various experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller to mitigate disturbance amplification and achieve platoon stability.},

  abstract     = {Owing to the difference in utilization efficiency of road between a connected-automated vehicle (CAV) and connected human-driven vehicle (CHV), caused by trajectory controllability, the optimization methods reported in literature for the mixed traffic of CAVs and CHVs at signalized intersections do not consider the dynamic adjustment of the approach lane utilization due to variations in the CAV penetration rate and traffic demand. Accordingly, a dynamic CAV-dedicated lane allocation method with the joint optimization of signal timing parameters and smooth trajectory is proposed to avoid using transitional or inefficient CAV-dedicated lanes and improve the performance of the intersections. In addition, a CAV trajectory control model for the CAV-dedicated lane is built to avoid the start-up loss time and maximize the utilization of green time. The delay and stops are weighted to form an integrated performance index (PI), and a PI model is established to evaluate the proposed method. A simplified solution procedure is designed to solve the joint optimization problem. The simulation results show that the proposed method in this paper can reduce the average PI per vehicle at intersections by 15.7% or more compared with that of a fully actuated signal control scheme, which indicates that it is necessary to drive the CAVs in one or more CAV-dedicated lanes when the CAV penetration rate exceeds a certain threshold. Compared with the existing signal and trajectory control approaches, the proposed method is more suitable for multi-lane signalized intersection with high saturation and high CAV penetration rate.},

For fault-tolerant state estimation, it is well known that fault detection and exclusion (FDE) based methods and Huber’s M-estimation based methods have their own drawbacks when facing different forms of observation outliers, or faults. To solve this problem, our proposed HRGBP uses an interactive multiple model (IMM) framework to fuse these two strategies, which combines the advantages of both methods without their drawbacks. HRGBP can fully exploit the message passing process to mitigate the biased estimates, which further improves the system’s fault-tolerant robustness. HRGBP can be further adapted to fuse more fault-tolerant strategies to improve the robustness of the CP system, and be extended to other factor graph-based methods. Here, we evaluate HRGBP for observations from visual landmark range and bearing, neighboring vehicle range and bearing, and odometer. Our evaluations show that HRGBP outperforms other state-of-the-art CP methods.},

The anchor-free and keypoint-based models receive increasing attention recently due to their effectiveness and simplicity. However, most of these methods are vulnerable to the occlusion and truncation of objects. In this paper, a single-stage monocular 3D object detection model is proposed. An instance-segmentation head is integrated into the model training, which allows the model to be aware of the visible shape of a target object. Therefore, the detection largely avoids interference from irrelevant regions surrounding the target objects. In addition, we also reveal that the popular IoU-based evaluation metrics, which were originally designed for evaluating stereo or LiDAR-based detection methods, are insensitive to the improvement achieved by the monocular 3D object detection algorithms. A novel evaluation metric, namely average depth similarity (ADS) is proposed for the monocular 3D object detection models. Our method outperforms the comparison baseline in terms of both the popular and the proposed evaluation metrics while maintaining real-time efficiency.},

Existing studies suffers from deficient data cleaning, ignoring low spatial accuracy of data and lack of the common datasets labeled with travel modes. This study proposes a novel TMI framework with MPSD and pseudo MPSD by designing hidden markov model (HMM)-based map-matching algorithm and bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM)-based deep neural network (DNN). In this framework, conventional data cleaning method is modified to eliminate outliers in raw MPSD to improve data quality. In addition, HMM-based map-matching algorithm is designed to estimate the actual position of travelers from MPSD for spatial-temporal accuracy improvement. Specifically, pseudo MPSD is reconstructed by multi-source data aiming at overcoming the facts lacking of labeled MPSD. Both MPSD and labeled pseudo MPSD are processed to features, where the latter is used to train model based on Bi-LSTM, and the former is input to the trained model for TMI application validation. To evaluate the framework performance, a case study is carried out. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms baseline models on the same datasets. Furthermore, the accuracy improvement of designed approaches is demonstrated by a series of algorithm comparisons. The framework has good generality and flexibility, and can be extended to other cities for TMI.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, with the purpose of fulfilling the increasing demands for emerging extensive and ubiquitous accessibility to modern intelligent transportation systems (ITS), the conventional vehicle-to-everything (V2X) paradigms are progressively evolving into the Internet of vehicles (IoVs). As of now, substantial enhancements in IoV technologies have been witnessed, particularly in the era of vehicular data secure exchange and user privacy protection. On the other hand, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to provide scalable and adaptive stereoscopic service coverage for IoV implementations. However, the existing approaches intended for the common scenarios mainly rely on the well-established local IoV infrastructures, whereas the specific infrastructure-less IoVs with dysfunctional edge facilities have not been properly investigated. Additionally, the related UAV-assisted IoV schemes still fail to independently perform the secure vehicular data transmission but rather as the auxiliary strategies due to the dependence on the assistance of local edge deployment. Therefore, the practical requirements of reliability and scalability in real-world IoV circumstances cannot be satisfied. In this paper, an efficient UAV certificateless group authentication mechanism is developed in order to facilitate the secure data transmission of infrastructure-less IoV. The proposed design deploys the tethered UAV (TUAV) as the specific mobilized base station so that the active edge IoV infrastructure is not needed. The security analysis regarding the key security features are presented first, followed by the performance evaluation. According to the comparison results with the existing designs, improvements in terms of computational cost and communication overhead for different phases can be demonstrated.},

Two complexity models are proposed to characterize the complexity of static scenarios and dynamic scenarios separately, which help to construct feedback for the adaptive generation of CBDS. The scenario-based test is carried out on a joint simulation platform, and the multi-dimensional evaluation system, including safety, driving comfort, driving performance, and traffic coordination, is developed to assess the performance of AVs. Based on the proposed complexity models and multi-dimensional evaluation system, the generation of CBDS is transformed into online environmental parameter optimization. Moreover, the naturalistic driving scenarios generation, scenario complexity calculation, intelligent driving algorithm execution, and intelligent driving evaluation are all concatenated together to form a closed loop so as to adaptively generate critical boundary driving scenarios. Extensive simulations are conducted at the intersection with two different types of intelligent driving algorithms, which show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

In the proposed method, firstly the cosine similarity is used to quantify cell inconsistency and the representative cells in the battery pack are determined by the largest cosine similarity value. Secondly, the OCV-SOC curves of the representative cells at different temperatures are used to construct the OCV-SOC-temperature relationship of the battery pack. Finally, a multi-branch fusion method is developed to estimate the SOC of the battery pack through the SOC of each branch by means of a Bayesian probability formula. The effectiveness of the newly constructed OCV-SOC-temperature relationship and the proposed SOC estimation method of the battery pack is verified under various dynamic conditions. The estimated SOC error of the series–parallel battery pack is less than 1.5%, which is approximately 60% lower than the traditional methods.},

  abstract     = {The crossing behaviors modeling of non-networked road users can improve Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs)’s awareness of the imminent hazards in shared space while planning routes. In this study, an agent-based microsimulation model is utilized to simulate the crossing behavior of e-bikes which is difficult to model due to their greater maneuverability. To deeply understand the crossing mechanism of e-bikes, a customized neural network-based nonlinear reward function is developed from five dimensions, including travel efficiency, travel direction, travel destination, risk avoidance, and travel location. A Deep Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning(Deep MEIRL), which can recover the nonlinear reward function, is introduced to predict trajectories of e-bikes from the real drone-based video dataset, collected at the intersection of Jixiangcun, Xi’an (China). The results reveal that the Deep MEIRL can simulate the e-bike crossing trajectory more precisely, particularly in the microscopic behaviors of riders. Comparing Deep MEIRL with the baseline model MEIRL, it can be found that the nonlinear reward function designed in this paper is more advantageous in terms of continuous space modeling, with an improvement of 19.77%. Notably, Deep MEIRL outperforms MEIRL in modeling distance to potentially risk target states for left- and right-turn crossing behavior, improving Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 71% and 30%, respectively. It means that the Deep MEIRL with a designed neural network is of great value to provide a logical result in modeling e-bike interaction with other road users. Therefore, the research is conducive to CAVs to understand e-bike behaviors in complex traffic scenarios, thereby assisting CAVs in making decisions efficiently.},

In this paper, we propose a self-powered multisensor monitoring and communication integrated system in HSR. A low-power backscatter communication working framework of the self-powered monitoring system is designed in the monitoring network model, and a finite Gaussian mixture model (GMM) clustering method is used to analyze the communication cell coverage area in the communication network model. Aiming to minimize the total task completion time, we formulate a data monitoring and remote communication problem with the energy transfer constraint, data collection constraint, and transmission data rate constraint. As for the non-convex minimum time optimization problem, we develop a novel option-based hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (OHDRL) method to deal with the complex continuous variation characteristics of the monitoring and communication integrated HSR system. The system learns to select options at a high level, and the action is executed according to the policy of the selected option at a low level. This approach enables us to handle stochastic HSR environments, closed-loop policies, and goals in a temporal abstraction way. Numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithm for the integrated monitoring and communication HSR achieves a significantly higher reward and more stable learning performance than other algorithms in the literature.},

An integer linear programming model with a compensation mechanism is established to provide a better overall solution for dynamic and multistage rescheduling problems. The main part of the model considers the strategies of retiming, adding train stops and reordering to reduce the impact of passengers, while the compensation mechanism part mainly deals with the uncertainty of disruption durations. The related constraints mainly include section track capacity, station track capacity,passenger transfer rules and some robust measures under the uncertainty of disruption durations. A multistage decision optimization framework is established, and a rolling horizon algorithm is embedded in it to approximate the desired optimal solution.

In long-term train service, bogies are prone to wear and aging. Currently, most studies on fault diagnosis methods are aimed at single equipment identification. It is challenging to accurately diagnose the faults of such coupled multi-equipment combination systems as bogies. Multiple devices on the bogie have implied correlations in space, and fully exploiting their spatial features enhances the fault diagnosis accuracy. This paper proposes a new bogie fault diagnosis method based on the directional graph of train bogie: RS-GAT model. The model uses the Residual-Squeeze Network (RS-Net) to construct the framework of the model and use the Graph Attention Network (GAT) for spatial information fusion and feature extraction to identify bogie faults. Using six datasets collected under the operation of high-speed trains, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach has better effectiveness than the RS-Net class model and single-layer graph class model, with diagnosis accuracy near 96%. Ablation experiments and comparisons between RS-GAT and RS-GCN verify the effectiveness of RS-Net framework and GAT model in fault classification. In addition, the RS-GAT model is found to have strong robustness when different models are analyzed using small-scale data sets.},

One revolutionary CAV’s impact on transportation system is cooperative driving that turns signalized intersections to be signal-free and boosts traffic efficiency by better organizing the passing order of CAVs. However, how to get the optimal passing order is an NP-hard problem (specifically, enumerating based algorithm takes days to find the optimal solution to a 20-CAV scenario). Here, we introduce a novel cooperative driving algorithm (AlphaOrder) that combines offline deep learning and online tree searching to find a near-optimal passing order in real-time. AlphaOrder builds a pointer network model from solved scenarios and generates near-optimal passing orders instantaneously for new scenarios. For the scenarios with 40 CAVs, AlphaOrder reduces the travel delay by more than 20% on average compared to the best-so-far MCTS based algorithm. Moreover, our algorithm provides a general approach to managing preemptive resource sharing between multi-agents (e.g., scheduling multiple automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at conflicting areas).},

In the paper, different distance metrics for kriging are evaluated. Then, a new, data-driven one is formulated, capturing the similarity of measurement sites. Then, with multidimensional scaling the distances are transformed into a hyperspace, where the kriging algorithm can be used. As a next step, temporal dependency is injected into the estimator via extending the hyperspace with an extra dimension, enabling for short horizon traffic flow prediction. Additionally, a temporal correction is proposed to compensate for minor changes in traffic flow patterns. Numerical results suggest that the spatio-temporal prediction can make more accurate predictions compared to other distance metric-based kriging algorithms. Additionally, compared to deep learning, the results are on par while the algorithm is more resilient against traffic pattern changes.},

Our work aims to improve the user experience while minimizing the delay and simultaneously considering efficient utilization of limited edge resources. First, an optimal service placement is performed while considering traffic dynamicity and meeting the service requirements with the use of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. Next, an optimal secondary mapping and service recovery placements are performed to account for the attacks/failures at the edge. The use of DRL framework helps to adapt to dynamically varying IoV traffic and service demands. In this work, we develop three integer linear programming (ILP) models and use them in the DRL based framework to provide attack-resilient service placement and ensure service availability with efficient network performance.

The multi-view logical feature extraction is realized based on the graph convolution module. Then, combining the multi-view logical features and the adaptive spatial topology network, the logical-physical features at the micro level are mined through the graph convolution module; based on the logical-physical features at the micro level and the regional clustering network at the macro level, the global logical-physical features are obtained. Finally, the model predicts the future trajectories of traffic-agents based on the encoder-decoder structure of the GRU.

  abstract     = {In a mixed traffic environment of human and autonomous driving, it is crucial for an autonomous vehicle to predict the lane change intentions and trajectories of vehicles that pose a risk to it. However, due to the uncertainty of human intentions, accurately predicting lane change intentions and trajectories is a great challenge. Therefore, this paper aims to establish the connection between intentions and trajectories and propose a dual Transformer model for the target vehicle. The dual Transformer model contains a lane change intention prediction model and a trajectory prediction model. The lane change intention prediction model is able to extract social correlations in terms of vehicle states and outputs an intention probability vector. The trajectory prediction model fuses the intention probability vector, which enables it to obtain prior knowledge. For the intention prediction model, the accuracy can be improved by designing the multi-head attention. For the trajectory prediction model, the performance can be optimized by incorporating intention probability vectors and adding the LSTM. Verified on NGSIM and highD datasets, the experimental results show that this model has encouraging accuracy. Compared with the model without intention probability vectors, the impact of the model on NGSIM dataset and highD dataset in RMSE is improved by 57.27% and 58.70% respectively. Compared with two existed models, evaluation metrics of the intention prediction can be improved by 7.40-10.09% on NGSIM dataset and 2.17-2.69% on highD dataset within advanced prediction time 1s. This method provides the insights for designing advanced perceptual systems for autonomous vehicles.},

Denial of service (DoS) attacks force vehicle formations to destabilize by disrupting digital communications between vehicles. To this end, this paper develops a resilient distributed event-triggered security control strategy to resist the malicious impact of DoS attacks on connected vehicles. By designing a distributed event-triggered mechanism based on sampled data, the controller updating frequency is reduced, thereby promoting utilization rate of network resources. Since the end of the attack is not the sampling instant, this may prolong the duration of the attack. To overcome this problem, a switched sampled-data scheme is proposed to ensure that the control signal acts on the system immediately when the attack ends. Then, a switched system model with artificial delay is established to capture the sampling period, event triggering mechanism and DoS attack purpose. With the analysis methods of switched system and time-delay system, sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the same safe distance and speed between vehicles, so that the connected vehicle system can achieve the desired tracking effect. A co-design approach is given with respect to controller gains and triggering parameter. Finally, simulation and experimental studies are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed security control method.},

  abstract     = {This work studies perishable products’ distribution using electric commercial vehicles (ECVs). Extra energy is consumed for refrigeration to keep such products from deteriorating, which shortens the limited driving range of ECVs. Besides charging at public recharging stations, their travel speed can be adjusted to improve their driving range and decrease distribution cost. We propose an Electric Vehicle Routing problem with variable vehicle speed and soft time windows for perishable products (EVRP-VS). An energy consumption rate function of refrigerated ECVs during driving is introduced into the problem. The function considers refrigeration and has a nonlinear relationship with ECV speed and weight. As long as the carriage is not empty, the vehicle needs refrigeration during driving and during its stay at customers and stations. A mathematical programming model is developed for EVRP-VS, to minimize total distribution cost, including vehicle cost, power cost, refrigeration cost, and penalty cost due to delayed delivery. An adaptive hybrid ant colony optimization (AHACO) with a two-stage speed optimization strategy is proposed to solve EVRP-VS. In the first stage, local speed optimization is used to optimize the speed of each ant (ECV) in each transfer step. In the second one, global speed optimization further optimizes the speed for each fixed route constructed by ants. AHACO is applied to many problem instances. Experimental results show that it can effectively solve EVRP-VS in comparison with CPLEX and other meta-heuristics.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a spatial-index modulation (SIM) based orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) system, named SIM-OTFS, is proposed to enhance the effectiveness and the reliability of high mobility vehicular networks in intelligent transportation systems. The SIM-OTFS system adopts a three dimensional index modulation (IM) technique which utilizes the transmit antenna, delay, and Doppler indexes in the space and delay-Doppler domains, respectively, to achieve a higher transmission rate. Considering the characteristics of vehicular networks, we first present the SIM-OTFS system design and the corresponding signal processing. Then, we derive the average bit error rate (ABER) upper bound of the SIM-OTFS system by the union bound theory. Moreover, the diversity, the coding gain, and the complexity of the SIM-OTFS system are further investigated. Numerical results verify the theoretical analysis of the ABER and the diversity of the SIM-OTFS system, which shows the superiority of the SIM-OTFS system in the ABER performance over the multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) based OTFS (MIMO-OTFS) system. Meanwhile, the SIM-OTFS system realizes better performance than the spatial modulation (SM) and IM based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (SM-OFDM-IM) system in high mobility vehicular communication with reasonable complexity sacrifice. Furthermore, the influence of the resolvable multipaths of the channel in vehicular networks on the ABER performance of the SIM-OTFS system is also illustrated.},

  abstract     = {This study considers an electrodynamic maglev train of the MLX01 type as the research object. Equivalent circuit models of levitation/guidance were established, and forces in different directions were solved using the energy method. A field-circuit-motion coupling numerical model of a single bogie and a ground coil was established. Based on the field-circuit-motion coupling model, the various electromagnetic relationship of maglev train on curved track was analyzed. The law of the electromagnetic spring coefficient and the internal mechanism under different electromagnetic parameters was explored. Considering the coupling characteristics between the electromagnetic forces, the characteristics of the levitation force and guidance force under different standard air gaps were analyzed, and a numerical fitting analysis was performed. On this basis, the laws of levitation force and guidance force with levitation displacement and guidance displacement, as well as the characteristics of drag force with operation speed under different standard air gaps, were studied. Meanwhile, the characteristics of the guidance-drag ratio and levitation-drag ratio were analyzed. A dynamic model with 20 degrees of freedom was established based on the analysis of the geometric model of the maglev train. Taking the track irregularity as the external excitation source of the bogie, the dynamic characteristics of the bogie and vehicle body under different standard air gaps and speeds were analyzed. The effects of different suspension damping and stiffness coefficients on the vibration characteristics of a vehicle body were studied. This provides important theoretical and data support for design and dynamic analysis of superconducting electrodynamic maglev trains.},

  abstract     = {In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), there are many resource constrained communication nodes, distributed geographical locations, and low delay requirements. The authentication system is required to be distributed. However, the information interaction between traditional distributed authentication entities (AEs) is not transparent, and the use of blockchain is only to save certificate status records on the chain. There is a lack of trusted security management mechanisms between AEs, so there is a risk of collusion attacks and behavior record forgery and tamper attacks between AEs. Therefore, this paper mainly addresses the management problems of opaque interaction and insufficient security verification of distributed authentication entities in the VANETs scenario. In this paper, based on the security features of blockchain technology, such as public audit and tamper proof block structure, and distributed trust consensus, we propose a hierarchical and trust certificate service chain based on reputation value called HCSC. We have a set of safe and reliable management mechanisms between distributed authentication entities such as the Bitcoin system. First, we integrate the traditional hierarchical authentication system and the blockchain network into a new hierarchical certificate service chain. Then, we propose a reputation evaluation model based on the logistic regression model by quantifying the behavior records of the AEs. In addition, a new hierarchical reputation consensus based on delegated proof of stake (DPoS) and proof of work (PoW) is given. Then, a fast verification based on block height and security verification for the efficiency and security of certificate verification is proposed. Finally, the security analysis is given, and a prototype implementation of HCSC is developed based on Fabric. The experimental simulation and security analysis reveal that the HCSC is very efficient and suitable for the above issues.},

  abstract     = {The advancement of smart wearable devices and location-based smart services has enabled a new paradigm for smart human mobility prediction (HMP), which has a broad range of applications in smart healthcare and smart cities. Due to the privacy concerns and rigorous data regulations, federated learning provides a distributed learning framework to collaboratively train the HMP model without sharing the highly sensitive location data with others. However, in real-world scenarios, federated human mobility prediction suffers from data heterogeneity challenge, which includes two main aspects: heterogeneity mobility patterns, and data scarcity. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end federated representation learning framework for human mobility prediction, named FR-HMP, to overcome all the above obstacles. Specially, in order to enhance the representation abilities of data-scarcity clients, a two-phase learning process is proposed. The clustering module could cluster similar clients together on the parameter server to address the heterogeneous mobility patterns, and the representation learning module learns the enhanced representations of each client through the graph learning layer and graph convolution layer on the third-part server. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted using two diverse real-world HMP datasets to show the advantages of FR-HMP over state-of-the-art methods.},

To achieve effective non-horizontal payload hoisting, the two booms of DBCs should reach different positions while guaranteeing safety, high efficiency, and energy conservation, which makes coordinated boom motions particularly difficult. To this end, an optimal collaborative motion planning method for DBCs is proposed in this paper without any linearization, which realizes fast, accurate, and energy-saving payload transportation with swing suppression. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method provides the first solution for DBCs to transport payloads to the desired non-horizontal attitudes, and simultaneously achieves comprehensive optimization of multiple performance indicators, including transportation time, energy consumption, etc., on the premise of safety. On the theoretical side, novel collaborative auxiliary signal construction and parametric design guarantee the coordination of boom motions, and the solving process of optimal trajectories is simplified through elaborate convex optimization problem reformulation and analysis. At last, the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method are verified by hardware experiments under different working requirements.},

  abstract     = {Radar is among the most popular sensors in modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs), enabling weather-robust perception. The orientation and position of the traffic radar relative to the ITS coordinate system are necessary for the perception fusion in ITSs. However, due to the unknown target association, sparseness and noisiness of traffic radar measurements, the robust and accurate extrinsic calibration of traffic radar is challenging. In this paper, we propose a targetless traffic radar calibration method based on GPS to overcome the inconvenience during ITS operation, because the installation of a dedicated calibration target on the highway is impractical and dangerous. On the other hand, the high-precision GPS device installed on the moving vehicle can provide traffic radar with accurate positioning information of the detection target. Furthermore, during the optimization process of extrinsic calibration, we propose a globally optimal registration method, which is robust to noise and outliers in radar measurements, and is called Gaussian Mixture Robust Branch and Bound (GMRBnB). Specifically, we first construct the robust objective function by utilizing the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Then, we derive novel relaxation bounds and present the GMRBnB algorithm that overcomes the susceptibility to local minima and the dependence on initialization of traditional optimization methods. Compared with existing methods, extensive experiments in synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method is not only globally optimal, but also more accurate and robust.},

Like FLA, the chance-constrained FLA problem is strongly NP-hard, and solving it exactly is out of reach, even for moderate realistic instances. An efficient heuristic is therefore proposed to deal with the whole problem by solving iteratively the chance-constrained FLA problem separately for each flight level. The approach used to solve the latter problem consists in a constraint generation one which adds iteratively new constraints until reaching the probability threshold for the specific chance-constrained FLA subproblem. An essential aspect of this method is the fast feasibility probability estimation of the chance-constrained constraints of a given solution. Numerical results support our findings.},

Since the metro or other rail transit have high safety requirements, it is hard to acquire numerous fault samples.

An intelligent approach for bogie-bearing fault diagnosis is proposed to deal with the above problems. A third-order tensor model is established to be suitable for variable working conditions. Furthermore, a density-based affinity propagation tensor (DAP-Tensor) clustering algorithm is presented to identify different failures with unlabeled. Train bogie and public data sets were employed to simulate three probable conditions of train operation: high-frequency impact, speed variation, and load change. Compared with existing clustering methods in three cases, the proposed DAP-Tensor performs better in identifying bearing faults under variable working conditions. Moreover, The DAP-tensor has a comparable recognition rate to some deep learning methods, which unsupervised characteristics show it has potential for applications on rail transit trains.},

  abstract     = {A reliable prediction of traffic participants’ trajectories is challenging for automated driving. We attempt to integrate human trajectory’s temporal and spatial reciprocal consistency into the prediction network structure. Moreover, humans are intention-driven agents, and modelling human intentions will continuously provide more accurate and detailed information for future trajectory prediction. In this paper, we propose a Reciprocal Consistency Prediction Network (RCPNet), a bi-directional prediction network consisting of the forward and the backward with a similar structure. The prior work of human trajectory prediction is mainly a unidirectional process, while RCPNet fully uses the past and future trajectory information at reverse temporal scales. By training the backward part to optimize the whole network parameters based on the reciprocal consistency, we can improve the prediction accuracy of the forward network. In particular, the framework incorporates a destination variational auto-encoder (DVAE) to estimate the target intention of humans and generate multi-modal trajectory prediction. In order to adapt to the offline prediction situation, we refer to the calculation method of correlation between two variables to present “Predictive Confidence” to clarify the reliability of offline predicted trajectories. Experimental results show that the RCPNet improves state-of-the-art performance on the SDD and ETH/UCY benchmarks.},

However, previous approaches provide black-box solutions, which do not offer information on how confident the agent is about its decisions. An estimate of both the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of the agent’s decisions is fundamental for real-world applications of autonomous driving. Therefore, this paper introduces the Ensemble Quantile Networks (EQN) method, which combines distributional RL with an ensemble approach, to obtain a complete uncertainty estimate. The distribution over returns is estimated by learning its quantile function implicitly, which gives the aleatoric uncertainty, whereas an ensemble of agents is trained on bootstrapped data to provide a Bayesian estimation of the epistemic uncertainty. A criterion for classifying which decisions that have an unacceptable uncertainty is also introduced. The results show that the EQN method can balance risk and time efficiency in different occluded intersection scenarios, by considering the estimated aleatoric uncertainty. Furthermore, it is shown that the trained agent can use the epistemic uncertainty information to identify situations that the agent has not been trained for and thereby avoid making unfounded, potentially dangerous, decisions outside of the training distribution.},

  abstract     = {Ramp metering has been considered as one of the most effective approaches of dealing with the traffic congestion on the freeways. The modelling of the freeway traffic flow dynamics is challenging because of its non-linearity and uncertainty. Recently, Koopman operator, which transfers a non-linear system to a linear system in an infinite-dimensional space, has been studied for modelling complex dynamics. In this paper, we propose a data-driven modelling approach based on neural networks, denoted by deep Koopman model, to learn a finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator. To consider the sequential relations of the ramps and main roads on the freeway, a long short-term memory network is applied. Furthermore, a model predictive controller with the trained deep Koopman model is proposed for the real-time control of the ramp metering on the freeway. To validate the performance of the proposed approach, experiments based on the simulation in the traffic simulation software Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) environment are conducted. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both the dynamics prediction and the real-time control of the ramp metering.},

  abstract     = {This study presents an innovative reinforcement-learning-based control algorithm for a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft under wind disturbances. In our approach, the tracking control problem of the VTOL aircraft is formulated as a Markov decision process, and the appropriate system state, reward function, and soft update method are presented. To improve the control accuracy under wind disturbances, three kinds of wind fields were added in the learning environment to expand the exploration space and simulate the effect of wind disturbances on the flight control. Moreover, to ensure the tracking accuracy and the practical implementation, a quantum-inspired experience replay strategy was developed based on quantum computation theory. In this strategy, the preparation operation scheme was designed to encourage the exploration and speed up the convergence. The depreciation operation method was developed to enrich the sample diversity, which increased the robustness of the controller and allowed the control strategy learned in the numerical simulations to be directly transferred into real-world environments. Numerical simulations, hardware-in-the-loop experiments, and real-world flight experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance and merits of the proposed method. The results demonstrated high accuracy and effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed control algorithm in terms of standoff target tracking control and flight stability.},

Point-based methods preserve precise point positions but incur high computational load, whereas voxel-based methods rasterize unordered points into voxel grids efficiently but give rise to an accuracy bottleneck. To take advantage of voxel- and point-based representations, we develop an effective and efficient 3D object detector via a novel voxel-point geometry abstraction scheme. Our motivation is to use coarse voxel representation to accelerate proposal generation while using precise point representation to facilitate proposal refinement. For voxel representation learning, we propose a context enrichment module with a novel 3D sparse interpolation layer to augment raw points with multi-scale context. We further develop a point-based RoI pooling module with explicit position augmentation for proposal refinement. Extensive experiments on the widely used KITTI Dataset and the latest Waymo Open Dataset show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art point-voxel-based methods while running at 24 FPS on the TITAN XP GPU.},

The design of advanced FD algorithms requires large-scale and diverse video dataset. However, collecting and labeling real dataset is still time-consuming, labor-intensive, and highly subjective. To address this issue, we first use computer graphics (CG) to clone real highway scenarios (HS) and generate synthetic multi-challenge video datasets, called “Synthetic-HS (CG)”, automatically labeled with accurate pixel-level ground truth. The Synthetic-HS (CG) dataset contains eight imaging condition sequences for computer vision research. Then, we design an image translation (IT) model that translates source domain (Synthetic-HS (CG)) to target domain (real). This model uses skip connections and attention module to generate realistic synthetic images “Synthetic-HS (IT)”. We use publicly available Synthetic-HS in combination with the corresponding real video sequence to conduct experiments. The experiment results suggest that: 1) The Synthetic-HS (CG) dataset enables us to provide precise quantitative evaluation of the drawbacks of foreground detection methods 2) The realistic Synthetic-HS (IT) images can be used to promote the visual perception in highway video surveillance.},

Focused on the stochastic factors of energy trading caused by EVs and network constraints in residential MGs scenario, a V2V Energy Trading in Residential Microgrids (VETRM) considering multiple constraints via Bayesian game model is proposed. Frist, the Bayesian game modeled types of players by information including the stochastic characteristics of EVs, which results in uncertainties that the game participants determine the roles of seller or buyer that depends on the states of power surplus or lack. Then, utility functions based on the sensitivity analysis to the impact of V2V transactions on the network and to guarantee the exchange of energies to inviolate network constraints are established.

  abstract     = {Object detection and classification are key processes in advanced driver-assistance systems. The existing object detection and classification methods are effective in normal daylight conditions. However, the performance of these methods deteriorates in adverse driving conditions, such as those involving low light, illumination changes, and nighttime conditions. To overcome these limitations, several feature-based algorithms have been developed that introduce local features, such as local binary pattern, local tetra pattern, and local density encoding, for adverse driving conditions. However, these local patterns cannot effectively address the noise in real driving conditions because the relationship between the neighboring pixels cannot be comprehensively encoded. To solve these problems, this study developed a robust feature-based method by introducing a triangular-pattern-based sigmoid function to effectively encode and establish the robust feature of neighboring pixels in the local region. The performance of the proposed pattern is evaluated by integrating it into state-of-the-art object detection algorithms. The proposed method significantly increases the vehicle detection ratio of YOLOv5s by 11.7% for an intersection over a union of 0.5 in difficult driving conditions for the CCD dataset. Moreover, the detection ratios of the proposed method are comparable to those of other state-of-the-art object detection methods such as Retina, Faster RCNN, and Deformable DETR over various datasets such as KITTI, COCO, HCI, and CCD. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is implemented on a Raspberry Pi-based autonomous car system to evaluate its performance during real driving conditions. Our proposed method supports robust input feature extraction and can thus be used to enhance the performance of the existing obstacle detection and classification systems.},

In traditional vehicle-mounted devices, communication and sensing modules exist but in an isolated way, resulting in a waste of hardware resources and wireless spectrum. In this paper, to cope with the above inefficiency, we propose a vehicular behavior-aware integrated sensing and communication (VBA-ISAC) beamforming design for the vehicle-mounted transmitter with multiple antennas. In this work, beams are steered based on vehicular behaviors to assist driving and meanwhile provide spectral-efficient uplink data services with the help of a roadside unit (RSU). Specifically, we first predict the area of interest (AoI) to be sensed based on the vehicles’ trajectories. Then, we formulate a VBA-ISAC beamforming design problem to sense the AoI while maximizing the spectral efficiency of uplink communications, where a trade-off factor is introduced to balance the communication and sensing performance. A semi-definite relaxation-based beampattern mismatch minimization (SDR-BMM) algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated problem. To reduce the hardware cost and power consumption, we further improve the proposed VBA-ISAC beamforming design by introducing the hybrid analog-digital (HAD) structure. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of VBA-ISAC scheme and show that the proposed beamforming design outperforms the benchmarks in both spectral efficiency and radar beampattern.},

  abstract     = {Promotion of charging facilities (CFs) can ameliorate range anxiety and facilitate long-distance travel by electric vehicles (EVs). In this context, a multistage low-carbon EV CFs planning model is proposed in this paper for the coupled transportation and power systems. This model not only takes into account the construction costs of newly-built CFs and their adverse impacts on the distribution system, but also considers the carbon emissions of CFs and the penalty due to the inconvenience for EVs to be recharged. In addition, a rational travel route choice model is significantly important to accurately evaluate the service capability of CFs to be constructed and thereby to obtain an optimal CF planning result. Therefore, a novel travel route choice model developed in this work allows EV drivers to take detours according to the CF locations to charge their EVs multiple times and then finish their trips. Carbon emission flow (CEF) model is innovatively employed to precisely calculate CFs’ carbon emission amount from the perspective of consumption side. Subsequently, uncertainties involved in CF planning, i.e., distribution and growth rate of traffic flow and electric load, popularity of different types of EVs, as well as location of the connected node of clean electricity, are fully considered to obtain a robust CF planning scheme that can achieve a good performance in the current stage and exhibit robustness for the uncertainties in the future stage. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The impacts of future carbon price and EV cruising range on the planning results are also comprehensively evaluated.},

  abstract     = {The Regenerative Braking Energy (RBE) of metro trains plays an important role in metro energy saving. If the regenerative energy can be directly absorbed by the adjacent trains, the investment in other RBE usage equipments like super capacitors will be reduced. To increase the RBE usage, the overlaps of traction and braking processes of adjacent trains can be increased by timetable optimization or real-time train regulation. But if the overlaps cannot be realized, the RBE cannot be efficiently absorbed by the other trains. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an optimal train control method to absorb the RBE of the braking train by adjusting the speed profile of an adjacent train that runs at non-braking stage. A speed profile adjustment algorithm for the adjacent train is given considering the speed limits and gradients, in which a traction process is incorporated in the adjusted speed profile. Connected and unconnected DC power supply networks are both considered. In the connected DC power supply network, the RBE of the braking train can be absorbed by the adjacent adjusted train, which runs in the different power supply section. To test the robustness of the proposed algorithm, random train delays are considered in the simulations. The interstation running time will be regulated to reduce the train delay by a linear programming model, based on which, the speed profile of the cooperative train will be adjusted. Simulations are conducted based on a whole day data of Beijing Metro Line 4. The simulation results show that the proposed method improves the energy efficiency over 13% by improving RBE usage, and the proposed method also shows strong robustness in the train delay simulations, which makes it a promising method to be applied in real metro system.},

Therefore, when given a new set of city coordinates, the optimal route can be directly and quickly calculated without iteration. Considering the recent advancement in computer vision with deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), an image representation is proposed to convert TSP to a computer vision problem. A problem decomposition method is introduced to reduce the mapping complexity. Taking advantage of the powerful fitting capabilities of DCNN, a deep reinforcement learning method is designed without any labeling requirement.

This paper introduces a real-time multipath estimation and mitigation technique which considers compensation for the time offset between constellations. It also presents a mode-switching algorithm between the DGNSS and multipath mitigating mode and shows that this technique can be effectively utilized for automobiles in a deep urban environment without any help from sensors other than GNSS. The availability is improved from 64% to 100% and the error RMS is reduced from 11.1 m to 1.2 m on Teheran-ro, Seoul, Korea. Because this method does not require prior information or additional sensor implementation for high-positioning performance in deep urban areas, it is expected to gain wide usage in not only the automotive industry but also future intelligent transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {The increasing availability of travel trajectory data allows for a better understanding of travel behavior. In the individual mobility analysis, the problem of next trip prediction assumes a central role and is beneficial for applications such as personalized services and mobility management. This paper addresses the next trip prediction problem with arbitrary prediction times (the time when the prediction is made). This problem has not been studied adequately in the literature and it is important for applications driven by system events, such as proactive travel recommendations under disruptions or crowding in transport systems. It predicts an individual’s next trips given their historical trip sequences and the prediction time. We formulate the next trip prediction problem as on-board and off-board predictions depending on an individual’s travel status (i.e. on-board/off-board). Using historical/real-time travel trajectories, a DeepTrip model is proposed based on a trip sequence-to-sequence deep learning structure coupled with an attention mechanism. A novel overlapped embedding method is proposed to represent continuous travel attributes capturing simultaneously the categorical and numerical feature information. We also develop a random-sampling training algorithm to learn the impact of the prediction time. The model is validated using trip data in urban rails. The results show that DeepTrip outperforms statistical-based models by more than 10% in terms of accuracy and other deep learning models by 2%-3%. The impact analysis shows that different representations are appropriate for the two prediction cases (on-board/off-board), and the prediction performance does not monotonically improve as the prediction time approaches the next trip.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is highly dynamic due to the high speed and sparse distribution of vehicles on the road. This creates major challenges (e.g., network fragmentation, packet routing) for the researchers to enable robust, reliable, and scalable communication, especially in a highly dense network. Clustering in VANET is one of the remedies to address the scalability issue. However, it is observed in the literature, that existing clustering techniques produce a high number of clusters for the vehicular environment. Consequently, it increases the consumption of scarce resources in a wireless network. Furthermore, it also increases the communication overhead as well as the number of hops for data routing. As a result communication latency also increases and the reliability of communication protocol decreases. So it is highly desirable to find out the optimal clusters for a given vehicular environment. As finding optimal clusters is a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem, therefore by employing nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithms we can optimize the multi-objective problem. To this end, we proposed a novel clustering algorithm based on the Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm for VANET (HHOCNET). HHO algorithm is a nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm inspired by the foraging maneuver of hawks called surprise pounce. The proposed framework imitates the cooperative foraging maneuver of hawks (i.e., surprise pounce for creating optimized vehicular clusters). The stochastic operators of the HHO algorithm and proper maintenance of the equilibrium state between the operations of exploration and exploitation enable the proposed algorithm to escape from the local optima and provide a globally optimal solution (i.e., the optimal number of vehicular clusters). Simulations are performed in MATLAB and the results are compared with the state-of-art schemes (i.e., Gray Wolf optimization-based clustering algorithm (GWOCNET), Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MO, PSO), and Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimization (CLPSO)) using different performance metrics. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach is an effective approach for clustering in VANET and outer performs the other benchmark algorithms in terms of optimizing the multi-objective clustering problem. HHOCNET algorithm selects 36.04% of nodes as cluster heads while the existing state-of-the-art schemes are providing 50.42%, 56.7%, and 60.89% for GWOCNET, CLPSO, and Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO). The proposed HHOCNET algorithm enhances the performance of the vehicular network by up to 15%. Consequently, it increases network efficiency by reducing the consumption of the required wireless resources. It also reduces the number of hops for packet routing. Hence it achieves a minimum end-to-end communication latency.},

However, this approach is detrimental for model optimization because occlusions and moving objects in a scene violate the underlying static scenario assumption. In addition, pixels in textureless regions or less discriminative pixels hinder model training. To address these problems, in this paper, we deal with moving objects and occlusions by utilizing the differences between the flow fields, and the differences between the depth structure generated by affine transformation and view synthesis, respectively. Secondly, we mitigate the effect of textureless regions on model optimization by measuring the differences between features with more semantic and contextual information without requiring additional networks. In addition, although the bidirectionality component is used in each sub-objective function, a pair of images is reasoned about only once, which helps reduce overhead. Extensive experiments and visual analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms existing state-of-the-art self-supervised methods under the same conditions and without introducing additional auxiliary information.},

Considering resource limitations, although recent technologies make progress in image-deblurring, there are still challenges in applying image-deblurring models in practical transportation systems: the model size and the running time. This work proposes an artful variant-depth network (VDN) to address the challenges. We design variant-depth sub-networks in a coarse-to-fine manner to improve the deblurring effect. We also adopt a new connection namely stack connection to connect all sub-networks to reduce the running time and model size while maintaining high deblurring quality. We evaluate the proposed VDN with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on several typical datasets. Results on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) show that the VDN outperforms SOTA image-deblurring methods. Furthermore, the VDN also has the shortest running time and the smallest model size.},

However, most existing macroscopic traffic models are typically concerned with driving behavior and do not incorporate human route choice behavior models in their formulation. In this paper, we propose a socio-technical macroscopic traffic model that characterizes the traffic states using human route choice attributes. Essentially, such model provides a framework for capturing the Cyber-Physical-Social coupling in smart transportation systems. To derive this model, we first use Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) to model the human passengers’ route choice under bounded rationality. These choices are assumed to be influenced by traffic alerts and other incomplete traffic information. Next, we assume that the vehicles are operating under a non-cooperative cruise control scenario. Accordingly, human route choice segregates the traffic into multiple classes where each class corresponds to a specific route between an origin-destination pair. Thereafter, we derive a Mean Field Game (MFG) limit of this non-cooperative game to obtain a macroscopic model which embeds the human route choice attribute. Finally, we analyze the mathematical characteristics of the proposed model, present simulation studies to illustrate the model behavior and show comparison with existing traffic model.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to solve the trajectory tracking control problem for an autonomous vehicle based on reinforcement learning methods. Existing reinforcement learning approaches have found limited successful applications on safety-critical tasks in the real world mainly due to two challenges: 1) sim-to-real transfer; 2) closed-loop stability and safety concern. In this paper, we propose an actor-critic-style framework SRL-TR2, in which the RL-based TRajectory TRackers are trained under the safety constraints and then deployed to a full-size vehicle as the lateral controller. To improve the generalization ability, we adopt a light-weight adapter State and Action Space Alignment (SASA) to establish mapping relations between the simulation and reality. To address the safety concern, we leverage an expert strategy to take over the control when the safety constraints are not satisfied. Hence, we conduct safe explorations during the training process and improve the stability of the policy. The experiments show that our agents can achieve one-shot transfer across simulation scenarios and unseen realistic scenarios, finishing the field tests with average running time less than 10 ms/step and average lateral error less than 0.1 m under the speed ranging from 12 km/h to 18 km/h.

There is yet no lightweight vehicular data exchange mechanism for resource-constrained environments that simultaneously offers secure and low-cost message transmission, data storage, and information searching. State-of-the-art vehicular communication protocols are also vulnerable to crucial security attacks and require more computational resources during the implementation. We, therefore, propose secure and efficient message communication, data storage, and information searching protocols (named QueryCom) for smart transportation. The QueryCom is designed using SHA-512 and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), preserving security and user anonymity attributes. Further, an index-based sequential searching method is used to effectually obtain information from the Vehicular Cloud (VC) database. We evaluate QueryCom based on the security proof and attacks analysis to confirm its security robustness against crucial security attributes. The experimental testbed results (on Raspberry Pi 3B+) are discussed to analyze the computational proficiency based on different performance parameters, i.e., time complexity (to search information from the VC database), computation time, storage cost, communication overhead, and energy consumption.},

Besides high accuracy, efficiency in terms of processing effort and energy consumption are also desirable. To satisfy both requirements, we propose a detection framework based on simultaneous classification and tracking in the point stream. In this framework, a tracker performs data association in sequences of the point cloud, guiding the detector to avoid redundant processing (i.e. classifying already-known objects). For objects whose classification is not sufficiently certain, a fusion model is designed to fuse selected key observations that provide different perspectives across the tracking span. Therefore, performance (accuracy and efficiency of detection) can be enhanced. This method is particularly suitable for detecting and tracking moving objects, a process which would require expensive computations if solved using conventional procedures. Experiments were conducted on the benchmark dataset, and the results showed that the proposed method outperforms original tracking-by-detection approaches in both efficiency and accuracy.},

For the wide deployment of platooning, multi-brand, i.e. interoperable, solutions are paramount. To achieve this, the European ENSEMBLE (ENabling SafE Multi-Brand pLatooning for Europe) project has been conducted. In this project, amongst others, all European truck manufacturers worked together to define harmonized multi-brand specifications for two different levels of platooning: a Platooning Support Function (PSF) and a Platooning Autonomous Function (PAF). The PSF aims towards fast deployment, whereas the PAF gives an outlook on the future of platooning when more advanced automated driving technologies become available. This paper describes the definition and specifications for the first level of platooning, the Platooning Support Function. It comprises a set of use cases, specifications and requirements for the common functionality. Part of the specifications is an interaction protocol, which also encompasses a security framework. To verify the definitions and to expedite standardization, all truck manufacturers implemented the PSF and this was tested in several multi-brand settings to conclude that the specifications result in technically feasible solutions.},

Several control algorithms are investigated, optimized and compared to manage the longitudinal inter-vehicular spacing distances of a formed platoon, as well as the lateral platoon motion tracking. The superior longitudinal controller in terms of spacing error convergence, velocity tracking and acceptable control effort, in addition to the outperformed lateral controller for its accurate lane change tracking and lower computational cost are promoted to be tested in the integrated architecture.

  abstract     = {Automated vehicles have great potential to transform our existing transportation systems by improving driving safety, comfort, congestion, and emissions. Despite the tremendous efforts that have been spent on the development of various automated driving technologies, user acceptance of automated driving technologies is still low, which is largely caused by the gaps between automated driving controllers and human preferences. Recent research efforts have been focusing on adapting automated driving behaviors to human demonstrations. However, most existing methods assume that human demonstration is perfect and only focus on mimicking human driving behaviors. In reality, the human demonstration will not be ideal and will include some over-aggressive or over-conservative actions that compromise the safety or efficiency of the trained automated driving controller. In this paper, an Inverse Model Predictive Control (IMPC) based bilateral adaptation method for automated vehicles and human drivers is proposed. The method can adapt automated longitudinal driving behaviors to human preferences based on human interventions during automated driving. Meanwhile, it can also reject improper interventions and send warnings to the human driver such that he/she can realize the irrationality in his/her behaviors. Eventually, the automated driving controller will adapt to the human driver’s preferences and the human driver will get rid of his/her bad driving habits. Human-in-the-loop experiments were conducted using a driving simulator to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

In order to reduce the impacts of surface vehicles configuration and surface vehicles type on transportation efficiency, the nonlinear terms in the system models are considered. Then, an inverse optimal formation controller is proposed by using leader-follower formation approach and the inverse optimal stability theory, which ensures all signals of considered system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). And the controller can also minimize the cost function. Finally, a simulation example is given to verify the effectiveness of the designed control method.},

  abstract     = {As an important part of intelligent transportation systems, On-demand Food Delivery (OFD) becomes a prevalent logistics service in modern society. With the continuously increasing scale of transactions, rider-centered assignment manner is gaining more attraction than traditional platform-centered assignment among food delivery companies. However, problems such as dynamic arrivals of orders, uncertain rider behaviors and various false-negative feedbacks inhibit the platform to make a proper decision in the interaction process with riders. To address such issues, we propose an online Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Order Recommendation (DRLOR) framework to solve the decision-making problem in the scenario of OFD. The problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The DRLOR framework mainly consists of three networks, i.e., the actor-critic network that learns an optimal order ranking policy at each interaction step, the rider behavior prediction network that predicts the grabbing behavior of riders and the feedback correlation network based on attention mechanism that identifies valid feedback information from false feedbacks and learns a high-dimensional state embedding to represent the states of riders. Extensive offline and online experiments are conducted on Meituan delivery platform and the results demonstrate that the proposed DRLOR framework can significantly shorten the length of interactions between riders and the platform, leading to a better experience of both riders and customers.},

The constraint-coupled bi-level optimization is operated within a rolling horizon to balance traffic performance and computational efficiency. In each decision step, the platoon formation scheme is incorporated into an upper-level traffic scheduling model as decision variables to pursue an optimal schedule from a systemic view. Meanwhile, the passing sequence and timeslots of vehicles are jointly optimized with the platoon configuration scheme by virtue of real-time traffic states to improve operational efficiency and fairness. After that, a lower-level trajectory planning model will generate dynamically-feasible and energy-efficient trajectories according to the given schedule and coupling constraints with the objective of improving space utilization to prevent spillbacks. Moreover, the quantifiable connection between the makespan of traffic scheduling schemes and the occurrence of spillbacks is established, demonstrating that the cooperative platoon formation strategy is effective in avoiding and mitigating spillbacks in normal and saturated traffic states. Additionally, the proposed algorithm can be extended to mixed traffic scenarios. Numerical experiments are conducted on extensive scenarios with different arrival flows, where the Constraint Programming technique is employed to produce the optimal schedule. Experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed approach in optimality and stability with reasonable sub-second computation time for real-life applications.},

This event has economic and operational implications for airspace users and airports, as well as negative environmental consequences. Diversions are triggered by many reasons, including adverse weather (e.g., low visibility) or medical emergencies. While the latter are certainly unpredictable, the former could be learned from observed diversions, given the weather at the estimated time of arrival and the landing capabilities of the aircraft and airport. Unfortunately, only airspace users are aware of the reason for the observed diversions. This implies that some (unknown) diversion in the historical data should not be learned by the model because they were triggered by reasons different from adverse weather. This paper presents a gradient boosted decision trees model that learned the likelihood of diversions due to adverse weather from noisy labels using confident learning. Results indicate that this method is effective in pruning of diversions caused by reasons other than adverse weather, and that diversions could be predicted with high precision and moderate recall.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) paradigm sparks the generation of large volumes of distributed data at vehicles, which can be harnessed to build models for intelligent applications. Federated learning has recently received wide attentions, which allows model training over distributed datasets without requiring raw datasets to be shared out. However, federated learning is known to be vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where malicious clients may manipulate the local datasets or model updates to corrupt the global model. Such attacks have to be countered when federated learning is adopted in IoV systems, given that the training process is distributed among a large number of vehicles in an open environment. In addition, IoV systems present a hierarchical architecture in practice where other types of nodes sit between the cloud server and vehicles, allowing intermediate aggregation for reducing overall training latency. Yet the intermediate aggregation nodes may also pose threats. In this paper, we propose a robust hierarchical federated learning framework named RoHFL, which allows hierarchical federated learning to be suitably applied in the IoV with robustness against poisoning attacks. We develop a robust model aggregation scheme that contains a logarithm-based normalization mechanism to cope with scaled gradients from malicious vehicles. We integrate the notion of reputation into the aggregation process and develop a scheme for reputation updating. We provide a formal analysis of RoHFL’s convergence guarantees. Experiment results over several popular datasets demonstrate the promising performance of RoHFL, which is superior to prior work in the robustness against poisoning attacks.},

  abstract     = {License Plate Detection and Recognition (LPDR) is widely used in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Although there are typically multiple categories of license plates, the majority of existing research cannot be applied to multi-category plates due to that existing methods are not optimised for multi-category plate scenarios and the scarcity of large-scale multi-category plate datasets. In this paper, we propose a multi-category license plate recognition framework called GroupPlate, which consists of Group Module and Indirect Supervision Module, making full use of the implicit and explicit grouping information of license plate. In addition, the Category Decouple Module is intended to decouple the grouping information from the original features, allowing the decoder to concentrate on character features. Simultaneously, we propose a large-scale All-Category license Plate detection and recognition Dataset (ACPD) for vehicles on the Chinese mainland, which also includes annotations of plates’ categories. Considering the domain gap between synthetic data and real data, we propose a simple but effective strategy called Feature Shift to mitigate the performance degradation caused by this gap. Experiments demonstrate that GroupPlate achieves the comparable performance to the existing methods on single-category license plate dataset and outperforms our baseline on the multi-category license plates dataset. Ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the modules in GroupPlate. Extensive results demonstrate that the dataset we proposed can mitigate the problem of models trained on a single-category license plate dataset failing to recognize multi-category license plates, and that our model can generalizes well to unseen categories.

  abstract     = {Optical flow estimation is a basic task in self-driving and robotics systems, which enables to temporally interpret traffic scenes. Autonomous vehicles clearly benefit from the ultra-wide Field of View (FoV) offered by 360° panoramic sensors. However, due to the unique imaging process of panoramic cameras, models designed for pinhole images do not directly generalize satisfactorily to 360° panoramic images. In this paper, we put forward a novel network framework——PANO FLOW, to learn optical flow for panoramic images. To overcome the distortions introduced by equirectangular projection in panoramic transformation, we design a Flow Distortion Augmentation (FDA) method, which contains radial flow distortion (FDA-R) or equirectangular flow distortion (FDA-E). We further look into the definition and properties of cyclic optical flow for panoramic videos, and hereby propose a Cyclic Flow Estimation (CFE) method by leveraging the cyclicity of spherical images to infer 360° optical flow and converting large displacement to relatively small displacement. PanoFlow is applicable to any existing flow estimation method and benefits from the progress of narrow-FoV flow estimation. In addition, we create and release a synthetic panoramic dataset FlowScape based on CARLA to facilitate training and quantitative analysis. PanoFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on the public OmniFlowNet and the fresh established FlowScape benchmarks. Our proposed approach reduces the End-Point-Error (EPE) on FlowScape by 27.3%. On OmniFlowNet, PanoFlow achieves an EPE of 3.17 pixels, a 55.5% error reduction from the best published result (7.12 pixels). We also qualitatively validate our method via an outdoor collection vehicle and a public real-world OmniPhotos dataset, indicating strong potential and robustness for real-world navigation applications. Code and dataset are publicly available at PanoFlow.},

Nevertheless, due to the open feature of the wireless offloading channels and the high mobility of the vehicles, the security and stability of the offloading process would be seriously degraded. In this paper, by utilizing the physical layer security (PLS) technique and spectrum sharing architecture, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based joint secure offloading and resource allocation (SORA) scheme to improve the secrecy performance and resource efficiency of the multi-user VEC networks, where the VU offloading links share the frequency spectrum preoccupied with the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication links. We use Wyner’s wiretap coding scheme to obtain the achievable secrecy rate and guarantee that confidential information cannot be decoded by multiple mobile eavesdroppers. We aim at minimizing the system processing delay while securing the wireless offloading process, by jointly optimizing the transmit power, the frequency spectrum selection and the computation resource allocation. We formulate the optimization problem as a multi-agent collaborative optimal decision problem and solve it with a double deep Q-learning algorithm. Besides, we set a punishment mechanism for the rate degradation to guarantee the communication quality of each V2V link. Simulation results demonstrate that multiple VU agents adopting the SORA scheme can rapidly adapt to the highly dynamic VEC networks and cooperate to improve the system delay performance while increasing the secrecy probability.},

However, it is non-trivial to perform accurate target-specific detection since the point cloud of objects in raw LiDAR scans is usually sparse and incomplete. In this paper, we address this issue by explicitly leveraging temporal motion cues and propose DMT, a Detector-free Motion-prediction-based 3D Tracking network that completely removes the usage of complicated 3D detectors and is lighter, faster, and more accurate than previous trackers. Specifically, the motion prediction module is first introduced to estimate a potential target center of the current frame in a point-cloud-free manner. Then, an explicit voting module is proposed to directly regress the 3D box from the estimated target center. Extensive experiments on KITTI and NuScenes datasets demonstrate that our DMT can still achieve better performance ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\sim $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; 10% improvement over the NuScenes dataset) and a faster tracking speed (i.e., 72 FPS) than state-of-the-art approaches without applying any complicated 3D detectors.

  abstract     = {In recent years, ride-on-demand (RoD) services such as Uber and DiDi are becoming increasingly popular. Different from traditional taxi services, RoD services adopt dynamic pricing mechanisms to manipulate the supply and demand on the road, and such mechanisms improve service capacity and quality. Seeking route recommendation has been widely studied in taxi service. In RoD service, the dynamic price is a new and accurate indicator describing the supply and demand, but it is yet rarely studied in providing clues for drivers to seek for passengers. In this paper, we propose to incorporate the impacts of dynamic prices as a key factor in recommending seeking routes to drivers. We first justfiy why it is necessary to recommend seeking routes and consider dynamic prices, by analyzing real service data from a typical RoD service. We then design a reinforcement learning model based on order and GPS trajectories datasets, and take into account dynamic prices in the design. Results prove that our model improves both driver earnings and seeking strategies. On driver earnings, the reinforcement learning model increases revenue efficiency by up to 34.52%, and considering dynamic prices leads to another increase of 6.19%. On seeking strategies, drivers are encouraged to serve local demand first, and they are redistributed more evenly and effectively.},

In this paper, we propose a different approach for traffic flow prediction. Our major motivation is to more effectively incorporate various intrinsic patterns in real-world traffic flows, such as fixed spatial distributions, topological correlations, and temporal periodicity. Along this line, we propose a novel autoencoder-based traffic flow prediction method, named Spatio-Temporal AutoEncoder (ST-AE). The core of our method is an autoencoder specially designed to learn the intrinsic patterns from traffic flow data, and encode the current traffic flow information into a low-dimensional representation. The prediction is made by simply projecting the current hidden states to the future hidden states, and then reconstructing the future traffic flows with the trained autoencoder. We have conducted extensive experiments on four real-world data sets. Our method outperforms existing methods in several settings, particularly for long-term traffic flow prediction.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle trajectory data is critical for traffic management and location-based services. However, the released trajectories raise serious privacy concerns because they contain sensitive information such as homes and workplaces. Based on differential privacy, this problem can be addressed by generating synthetic trajectories from the original sensitive data while guaranteeing personal privacy. Unfortunately, existing methods focus on synthesizing trajectory datasets that preserve summary-level statistics (e.g., the overall distribution of user movements), making these synthetic trajectories lose individual-level mobility patterns. As shown in our experiment, this results in the low performance of their synthetic datasets in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose a novel solution for Synthesizing Private and Realistic Trajectories, namely SPRT, whose key idea is to integrate the public geography structures of the target area into the process of private trajectory synthesis. This enables us to capture more accurate mobility patterns to synthesize realistic trajectories, which can preserve both summary-level statistics and individual-level mobility behaviors. Consequently, the synthetic trajectories generated by SPRT are more similar to real trajectories and therefore more practical. We evaluate the performance of SPRT in real-world applications by applying its synthetic data to a series of trajectory analytic tasks.

  abstract     = {Vehicle platoons (VPs) are groups of vehicles driving together with a short inter-vehicle gap and a harmonized velocity. For a long period, the VPs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) will coexist in mixed traffic flow, where the cut-in maneuver of the HDVs towards the VPs can be frequently expected. In this paper, to handle such cut-ins, we propose an intention prediction-based control method for the VPs by considering the tradeoff between the platoon integrity and traffic safety. Particularly, the proposed method is designed to prevent as many cut-ins as possible while taking care of the road safety. It consists of a cut-in prediction part, including intention and trajectory prediction algorithms, and a finite state machine (FSM)-based predictive control part, including a high-level FSM and a low-level predictive control. Driver-in-the-loop experiments were conducted in the VP-based driving scenarios to train the intention prediction algorithm and test the proposed method. We show the results detailing the control behavior of the proposed method in a no cut-in test, a mandatory cut-in test, and three discretionary cut-in tests. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the cut-in intention of human drivers in real time. Besides, according to the prediction results, the proposed method can prevent cut-ins for the VPs while taking care of the road safety.},

  abstract     = {The airline crew pairing (ACP) problem is one of the most challenging problems in airline operations. It aims to decide the optimal connections among pairs of flights assigned to flight crews. However, the number of connections grows exponentially with the increasing number of flights. Conventional approaches usually follow a two-stage method, i.e., divide-and-conquer. The flight sequences (pairings) spanning multiple days are firstly generated for each crew. Then, the best pairing set is chosen based on minimum operational costs. When the number of flights is large, it becomes too difficult to generate all feasible pairings and find the optimum. In order to solve large-scale ACP problems efficiently, we propose a novel iterative optimization framework based on monte carlo tree search (MCTS). Thus, the speed of pairing generation and solution accuracy can be improved. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on different scales of real-world instances provided by airline companies. The empirical results show that the proposed approach is capable of producing high-quality solutions, especially in large-scale instances.},

Based on the observed information, the vehicle finally determines the most appropriate edge cloud and subchannel.

Due to the sparsity and varying density of points in the outdoor point clouds, it becomes particularly challenging to extract object-centric features from data. This leads to poor semantic segmentation, especially for the rare object classes. To address that, we introduce the first-ever Slot Attention Transformer based technique to effectively model object-centric features in point cloud data. Our method uses cylindrical splits of space for voxelization and computes channel-wise positional embeddings before repetitively encoding the point cloud with slot attentions. Our second major contribution is a Large-Scale Outdoor Point Cloud dataset (SWAN), collected in a dense urban environment, driving 150km distance. It provides 16 billion points in more than 200K frames. The dataset also provides annotations for 10K frames for 24 classes. We also contribute a data augmentation scheme to handle rare object classes in real-world point clouds. Besides benchmarking popular existing methods on SWAN for the first time, we thoroughly evaluate our technique on the existing large-scale datasets, Semantic KITTI and nuScenes. Our results demonstrate a consistent performance gain for our technique, and verify the need of the more challenging SWAN dataset.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the expectations for autonomous vehicles (AVs) are increasing. However, it is expected to take at least a decade to develop a fully AV, where human intervention is completely unrequired. By then, human driving is required if necessary. Currently, when the AV hands over control to the driver, a safe driving environment can be created only if it is possible to determine whether the driver is in an abnormal state. Unfortunately, according to the sensory conflict theory, the risk of motion sickness (MS) is higher in AV than in ordinary vehicles. This is because neither passengers nor drivers can predict the movement path of the vehicle under AV, so there is more dissonance between vision and perception. Because the technology to remove MS when it occurs has not yet been developed, the best way to maintain the driver’s good condition is to quickly predict MS through the driver’s bio-signals and establish a system to prevent MS through advanced driver assistance systems. It is necessary to quickly predict early MS and provide feedback before it becomes severe. In this study, we collected dry electroencephalogram (EEG) data to predict MS in a real-world driving environment. For MS-based feature extraction, a normalized sample covariance matrix-based feature representation method was used, and they were classified using convolutional neural networks. As a result, we achieved 89.05% (±5.76) accuracy when averaging all four experimental sessions we conducted. We expect our proposed model to be a useful indicator for resolving MS issues in AV environments.},

  abstract     = {Traffic self-organizing is controlled autonomously by rules that rely on adaptation to local variations in traffic state and enable effective coordination of the vehicular traffic at a network level. Combined self-organizing network with intelligent transportation, we proposed a distributed self-organizing method for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), which aimed to improve the efficiency and safety between Multiple Adjacent-Ramps (multi-ARs). To make the mainline formation more stable, the speed of ramp vehicles was adjusted to ensure suitable speed and headway of the mainline formation. In the test, the multi-ARs in the East Ring Interchange on the Inner Ring Express in Chongqing was selected to collect the initial data sample by the drones and fixed-point cameras. Under the respective scenarios of conventional driving and intelligent networks, the Python, SUMO, and TraCI were adopted to run simulations and validate the proposed model. Results showed that our model could keep Time to Conflict (TTC) above 1.4s, reduce the average delay by 34.22%, reduce the lane-changing times by 28.07%, reduce single lane occupancy to 8% and improve average speed by 3.68% of multi-ARs. To verify the applicability of the proposed model, experiments were carried out under different traffic volumes, demonstrating the relevance of the proposed method for medium-to-high-density traffic flows. It can provide a basis for traffic engineers and policymakers to maintain the stable development of the urban expressways and ensure the overall operation quality of the multi-ARs.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at the problems of object mutual occlusion and inaccurate confidence in complex traffic environments, we propose an adaptive network object detection algorithm with a perspective box based on density-aware. Firstly, an adaptive convolutional neural network is designed according to the complexity of image density. Res2Net-101 is used as the backbone. For the images with objects concentrated on both sides and occluded each other more, a high-density network is selected to improve the accuracy of object detection, and a low-density network is selected for the images with significant and simple objects. Secondly, in the high-density network, to improve the accuracy of object detection and reduce the missed detection problem caused by occlusion, a perspective box is added to the detection head, and the transparent box is fused with the prediction box to obtain more accurate positioning. Finally, we propose the perspective loss function, which is based on the repulsion loss of focusing smooth function and combined with feature loss and classification loss to form the overall loss of the model. The experimental results show that the model has a good detection effect compared with the state-of-the-art object detection model in complex traffic environments. Without reducing the detection speed, the mAP of PerspectiveNet on the KITTI dataset is 86.2%, which is 3.6% higher than that of VarifocalNet.

  abstract     = {Re-identification (re-ID) of maritime vessels plays an important role in marine surveillance, but remains highly unexplored due to the lack of large-scale annotated datasets. In vessel re-ID, contrastive methods are supposed to learn discriminative representation from unlabeled vessel images in an unsupervised manner. However, directly introducing classical instance-level contrastive methods to maritime vessel re-ID suffers from the difficulty of finding vessel images with the same pseudo label as positive images, which potentially leads to inefficient training and unsatisfactory performance. This paper proposes a simple but effective method to solve such a hard positive problem. Our method takes all images in an intra-batch cluster as positives and excludes them from the set of negative samples when computing instance-level contrastive loss. Based on this strategy, we construct a multi-level contrastive learning (MCL) framework for vessel re-ID trained with the specifically designed intra-batch cluster-level contrastive loss along with the instance-level one. Experiments on a newly proposed dataset consisting of 1,248 vessel identities show that MCL achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with other unsupervised methods.},

To this end, we first present a dedicated intersection coordination framework, where the involved vehicles hand over their control authorities and follow instructions from a centralized coordinator. Then a unified cooperative trajectory planning problem will be formulated to maximize the traffic throughput while ensuring driving safety. To address the key computational challenges in the real-world deployment, we reformulate this non-convex sequential decision-making problem into a model-free Markov Decision Process (MDP) and tackle it by devising a Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3)-based strategy in the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. Simulation and practical experiments show that the proposed strategy could achieve near-optimal performance in sub-static coordination scenarios and significantly improve the traffic throughput in the realistic continuous traffic flow. The most remarkable advantage is that our strategy could reduce the time complexity of computation to milliseconds, and is shown scalable when the road lanes increase.},

At present, most license plate recognition methods focus on a single category and specific scenes. The requirements on distance, illumination, angle and other conditions are pretty high, which are not conducive to the application in practice. This paper proposes a real-time and accurate automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) method to overcome these challenges. The ALPR method contains a license plate detection network (LPDNet) and character recognition network (CRNet). LPDNet is based on the anchor-free method to detect the bounding box and four corners of license plates in an unconstrained environment. The proposed Rotating Gaussian Kernel and centrality loss enable LPDNet to improve performance in complex environments. CRNet is composed of a full convolution network, which can identify many kinds of license plates. In this network, feature extraction and compression technology have been proposed, effectively identifying multiple license plates in combination with a Character Classification module. Experiments on multiple public datasets show that the method outperforms existing methods in speed and accuracy, especially in complex and challenging environments.},

  abstract     = {Owing to the development of fast-charging technologies, the problems of limited driving range and long charging time for battery electric buses (BEBs) can be alleviated. However, fast charging may lead to a high energy cost because of charging during periods of high electricity rates and a high-power peak and consequently enhanced electricity demand cost. The reason is that the bus service and charging schedules can both affect the charging behavior and there is strong interaction between them. However, there is lack of researches to consider these two aspects jointly to optimise the charging behavior of large-scale BEB network. In this study, a BEB network charging optimisation (BEB–NCO) model is proposed to cooperatively optimise the bus service and charging schedules to minimise the charging cost for a fast-charging BEB network. To enhance the computing efficiency for large-scale networks, a heuristic algorithm, an integration of adaptive large neighbourhood searching and branch &amp; bound (ALNS–BB), has been developed. The developed model and the heuristic algorithm were applied to a real-world BEB network in Shenzhen, China. The results show that the ALNS–BB algorithm can reduce the computational time by at least 82.56% and the bus service and charging schedule generated by BEB–NCO model can reduce the charging cost by up to 53.35% compared with the existing strategy. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate the impact of the charging power on the charging cost. It is suggested that a charging power of 115 kW is recommended in this case.},

It is challenging in large part due to the uncertain, multi-modal, and practically intractable set of possible agent-agent and agent-space interactions, especially in urban driving settings. Models solely based on constant velocity or social force have an inherent bias and may lead to inaccurate predictions across the prediction horizon whereas purely data driven approaches suffer from a lack of holistic set of rules governing predictions. We tackle this problem by introducing MPC-PF: a novel potential field-based trajectory predictor that incorporates social interaction via agent-agent and agent-space considerations and is able to tradeoff between inherent model biases across the prediction horizon. Through evaluation on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset and a variety of other common urban driving scenarios, we show that our model is capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance while producing accurate predictions for both short and long term timesteps. We also demonstrate the significance of our model architecture through an ablation study.},

  abstract     = {Under extreme conditions, such as low friction surfaces, violent steering and urgent acceleration/deceleration, vehicle states change rapidly and are influenced by nonlinear and coupled vehicle dynamics. To improve vehicle stability under extreme conditions, a hierarchical control strategy is proposed for DDEVs. In the upper layer controller, a combined-slip tire model is adopted to improve the model accuracy under extreme conditions. A nonlinear model predictive control based controller is then designed to generate the desired tire slip ratios with the main objectives of tracking the desired yaw rate and suppressing the lateral velocity and tire slip ratios. In the lower layer controller, the disturbance on the driver’s torque requirement, which is disregarded by existing studies, is taken into account. Next, a linear predictive controller is designed to track the desired tire slip ratios by adjusting the motor torques. To improve the computational efficiency of the nonlinear predictive controller, a PMP-based, fast solving algorithm is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed solving algorithm is checked by comparing the control performance with IPOPT. The proposed control strategy is evaluated by a series of HIL experiments. The HIL results show better performance in overall stability improvement and minimize the disturbance on the driver’s torque requirement.},

  abstract     = {There exists spectral gap between visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) images causing dissimilar intensity according to reflection property of objects and materials. Therefore, it has a limit of applying traditional stereo matching to cross spectral disparity estimation. In this paper, we propose cross spectral disparity estimation from VIS and NIR paired images using disentangled representation and reversible neural networks. We build a supervised learning framework based on reversible blocks to extract scene features robust against the spectral gap. Reversible blocks decompose features into scene and style components to bridge the spectral gap between VIS and NIR images. We perform stereo matching on the scene component to get an initial disparity map by a 3D convolutional neural network. To generate clear edges in the disparity map, we use a semantic segmentation network as auxiliary information to refine the initial disparity map. Besides, to consider the lack of the ground truth, we synthesize reference disparity maps with guided image filtering. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accurate edges in disparity along object boundaries and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both visual comparison and quantitative measurements.},

  abstract     = {To unleash the power of buses, we propose a bus-pooling system that keeps the notion of bus stops and terminals but discards the concept of fixed bus lines by enabling buses to choose the next stop or terminal based on orders submitted by passengers. Each bus, unlike a taxi, must consider the additional delays experienced by the passengers already on board when deciding how to adapt its route to serve new orders. This paper treats each bus as an agent and formulates the buses’ re-routing decision-making process as a Semi-Markov game. Then, we propose a novel double graph attention actor-critic (DGAAC) framework by integrating high-level and low-level actor-critics separately with graph attention networks (GATs) to solve the game. Specifically, GATs embedded in high-level and low-level critics take a large-scale graph covering a city-scale area as input and capture graph-structured mutual influences among buses. In contrast, the high-level and low-level actors equipped with GATs only take the n-hop sub-graph with local information as the input and are employed as the distributed decision module of each bus. We conduct extensive experiments on one of the largest real-world datasets in Shenzhen, China, and validate that the proposed DGAAC framework greatly outperforms all baselines.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting Origin-Destination (OD) passenger flow can help metro service quality and efficiency. Existing works have focused on predicting incoming and outgoing flows for individual stations, while little attention was paid to OD prediction in metro systems. The challenges are that OD flows 1) have high temporal dynamics and complex spatial correlations, 2) are affected by external factors, and 3) have sparse and incomplete data slices. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Feature Fusion Network (AFFN) to a) adaptively fuse spatial dependencies from multiple knowledge-based graphs and even hidden correlations between stations and b) accurately capture the periodic patterns of passenger flows based on the auto-learned impact from external factors. To deal with the incompleteness and sparsity of OD matrices, we extend AFFN to multi-task AFFN to predict the inflow and outflow of each station as a side-task to further improve OD prediction accuracy. We conducted extensive experiments on two real-world metro trip datasets collected in Nanjing and Xi’an, China. Evaluation results show that our AFFN and multi-task AFFN outperform the state-of-the-art baseline techniques and AFFN variants in various accuracy metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of AFFN and each of its key components in OD prediction.},

However, service quality and service ratio are two conflict goals because of the limited bandwidth and the vehicle mobility in Internet of Vehicles. In order to optimize these two conflict objectives simultaneously, we present an improved decomposition based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for the temporal data scheduling (I-MOEA/D-TDS) in Internet of Vehicles. Based on the MOEA/D framework, we integrate a self-adaptive weight vector adjustment method based on chain segmentation to improve the performances of temporal data scheduling. For verifying the availability of presented algorithm, under the hybrid Vehicle-to-Infrastructure / Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2I/V2V) communications and multiple Roadside Units (RSUs) scenario, we compare the proposed algorithm with several related algorithms under the effects of data valid periods, service workloads, maximum tolerated delay, and traffic workloads.

  abstract     = {Pedestrian tactical choices and operational movement in evacuations essentially pertain to decision-making under risk and uncertainty. However, in microscopic evacuation models, this attribute has been greatly overlooked, even lacking a methodology to delineate the related decision characteristics (bounded rationality and risk attitudes), let alone their effects on evacuation processes. This work presents an innovative two-layer floor field cellular automaton model framework, where three intertwined sub-modules respectively dedicated to modelling the exit choice, the locomotion movement and the exit-choice changing behaviours are proposed and integrated as an entity. By introducing various decision-making elements computed by the proposed algorithm, Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) is proposed for the first time to model the exit choice and locomotion decision-making under risk and uncertainty. In the exit-choice changing module, attractive and repulsive forces are invented to jointly describe the tendency to revisit the routing decision. Each sub-module and the whole framework are validated in manifold indoor environments. The simulation results of the modules with CPT accord with the empirics from the evacuation experiments and are superior over those from the state-of-the-art models. The degree of rationality and risk attitudes are proven to have significant impacts on tactical and operational decisions. Furthermore, irrational behaviour in decision-making is not variably detrimental to locomotion efficiency of pedestrians. The proposed framework can serve as an elegant tool to predict pedestrian dynamics. The behavioural findings shed new light on understanding and modelling the tactical and operational decisions in evacuations.},

In recent years, there has been great interest in deploying autonomous devices to solve it. A particle swarm optimizer (PSO) is a widely employed source location method. Yet most work in this field focuses on a flat search space while ignoring height information. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has a coarser but wider view as it flies higher. Inspired by such facts, this paper focuses on improving the efficiency of locating sources by utilizing height information through UAVs. A novel source location model is designed where their sensing range gradually increases as their flying height rises, but their obtained signal strength fades away. It can be directly deployed to existing PSO-based multi-source location methods and improve their performance, especially in a large-scale environment with sparse sources. UAVs can spontaneously switch their search schemes between a rough search at a higher height and a fine one at a lower height. Experimental results of three PSO-based methods show their significant improvement after deploying our model. Given the same computation resources, its deployment leads to over 30% hike in both location accuracy and speed. This represents a great advance to the field of source location.},

Assuming the connectivity between vehicles, we propose a novel approach to implement both Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) for platoon control.

In this study, it is aimed to extract a flight fingerprint using different machine learning techniques by means of a public dataset and the data obtained from our experimental flights. To get the individual flight pattern, multidimensional UAV sensor data has been reduced using manifold learning methods. By comparison, the most proper manifold method that allows highest classification accuracy (CA) has been investigated. Their performances are compared using both different manifold types and different classification methods. Then, the obtained manifold is used as flight fingerprints and validated by classification techniques. Various unsupervised manifold learning techniques such as t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Isometric Feature Mapping (ISOMAP) were tried for dimension reduction. For flight fingerprint classification, supervised machine learning techniques such as k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Adaboost, Neural Network, Bayes, etc., were tested. It has been observed that the highest classification accuracy is achieved with the t-SNE manifold and k-NN classification pair.

However, existing deep learning-based methods largely omit the specific characteristics of pavement images, such as high image resolution and low distress area ratio, and are not end-to-end trainable. In this paper, we present a series of simple yet effective end-to-end deep learning approaches named Weakly Supervised Patch Label Inference Networks (WSPLIN) for efficiently addressing these tasks under various application settings. WSPLIN transforms the fully supervised pavement image classification problem into a weakly supervised pavement patch classification problem for solutions. Specifically, WSPLIN first divides the pavement image under different scales into patches with different collection strategies and then employs a Patch Label Inference Network (PLIN) to infer the labels of these patches to fully exploit the resolution and scale information. Notably, we design a patch label sparsity constraint based on the prior knowledge of distress distribution and leverage the Comprehensive Decision Network (CDN) to guide the training of PLIN in a weakly supervised way. Therefore, the patch labels produced by PLIN provide interpretable intermediate information, such as the rough location and the type of distress. We evaluate our method on a large-scale bituminous pavement distress dataset named CQU-BPDD and the augmented Crack500 (Crack500-PDD) dataset, which is a newly constructed pavement distress detection dataset augmented from the Crack500. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority of our method over baselines in both performance and efficiency. The source codes of WSPLIN are released on https://github.com/DearCaat/ wsplin.},

However, the long charging time and high recharging frequency of EVs pose challenges to efficiently managing EV AMoD systems. The complicated dynamic charging and mobility process of EV AMoD systems makes the demand and supply uncertainties significant when designing vehicle balancing algorithms. In this work, we design a data-driven distributionally robust optimization (DRO) approach to balance EVs for both the mobility service and the charging process. The optimization goal is to minimize the worst-case expected cost under both passenger mobility demand uncertainties and EV supply uncertainties. We then propose a novel distributional uncertainty sets construction algorithm that guarantees the produced parameters are contained in desired confidence regions with a given probability. To solve the proposed DRO AMoD EV balancing problem, we derive an equivalent computationally tractable convex optimization problem. Based on real-world EV data of a taxi system, we show that with our solution the average total balancing cost is reduced by 14.49%, and the average mobility fairness and charging fairness are improved by 15.78% and 34.51%, respectively, compared to solutions that do not consider uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {Road hazards (RH) have always been the cause of many serious traffic accidents. These have posed a threat to the safety of drivers, passengers, and pedestrians, and have also resulted in significant losses to people and even to the economies of countries. Hence, road hazards detection (RHD) could play an essential role in intelligent transportation systems (hypertarget ITSITS). The cooperative vehicle-infrastructure systems (CVIS) coordinate the communication between vehicles and roadside infrastructures. Onboard computing devices (OCD), then, make fast analyses and decisions based on road conditions. In this study, an RHD solution based on CVIS is proposed. Firstly, a high-performance heavy action detection model is selected. Using a meta-learning paradigm, critical features are generalized from a few-shot RH data. Secondly, we designed a lightweight RHD model to ensure its smooth inference on an OCD. Thirdly, we use a knowledge distillation (KD) framework to progressively distill the features of the complex model and the privileged information of the data into the lightweight one.

  abstract     = {Recently, with the development of deep learning, Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) has made great progress, However, there are still many challenges to accomplish license plate (LP) recognition under various traffic scenarios. One of them is the detection speed and recognition speed, and the other is the difficulty to recognize the low resolution and highly tilted LP images. In this paper, we present a two-stage ALPR framework to achieve efficient LP detection and recognition in unconstrained scenarios. Our LP detector is based on improved Yolov3-tiny, and we also propose a lightweight recognition network MRNet based on multi-scale features. In order to improve the inference speed, we abandoned the rectification of LP images, and RNNs that are difficult to compute in parallel. Additionally, we also propose a license plate data augmentation method, which achieves more effective augmentation and improves the generalization ability of the network through secondary random and hyperparametric search. As an additional contribution, we provide a challenging dataset collected from real-world driving recorders. The dataset is for multiple LPs in a single image, which makes up for the lack of public datasets in multiple LP scenarios. We evaluated the results on five datasets and showed that we achieved the best performance on almost all test sets, achieving 99.8% accuracy on CCPD with more than 180,000 license plate test sets. In terms of speed, the inference speed for detecting license plates reaches 751 FPS, and the fastest inference time for recognizing a single license plate takes only 2.9 ms.},

  abstract     = {The scarcity of driving data constrains the accuracy of deep learning (DL)-based driver identification methods in practical application scenarios. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel unsupervised deep generative model called the convolution condition variant autoencoder (CCVAE) for driving data augmentation. In CCVAE, aided by driver identification information, the condition variant autoencoder can learn the real driving data distribution of each driver through an unsupervised learning paradigm; and aiming for better feature representation ability, convolutional neural network and deconvolution are leveraged, respectively. Therefore, a large number of synthetic samples can be generated by the generative part of the CCVAE. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the CCVAE through extensive experimental analysis using a real dataset collected from a vehicular CAN bus; the improvement of the DL-based driver identification results is demonstrated using synthetic samples. For instance, when only using 2% of the original data, approximately 20% improvement is achieved in terms of four evaluation indicators for two commonly used DL-based driver identification methods, namely, 1-D CNN and LSTM. Furthermore, several comparable experiments with state-of-the-art deep generative methods reveal the superior performance of the proposed CCVAE with respect to identification results, synthetic data quality, and model computation time. Therefore, the proposed model accomplishes a breakthrough in driver identification with limited data and shows great potential in data-driven applications of intelligent vehicles.},

The main purpose of this paper is to develop a robust multi-model estimation algorithm for reliable navigation when there are abnormities of measurement and motion. In order to deal with these abnormities, we propose a quantitative evaluation method of relative navigation system by introducing the degree of observability (DoO) and the degree of abnormity (DoA). In addition, we design a feedforward information fusion and a feedback information allocation method based on DoO and DoA, and thus form a multi-model robust estimation algorithm. In order to testify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm, a practical experiment with real data sets gathered in urban areas has been carried out. The results showed that the maximum relative positioning RMSE reduction ratio can reach 75%, and the maximum relative velocity RMSE reduction ratio can reach 51% compared with EKF. Therefore, the proposed method can guarantee the accuracy and robustness of relative navigation under abnormal conditions.},

  abstract     = {The upgrading and updating of vehicles have accelerated in the past decades. Out of the need for environmental friendliness and intelligence, electric vehicles (EVs) and connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have become new components of transportation systems. This paper develops a reinforcement learning framework to implement adaptive control for an electric platoon composed of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) at a signalized intersection. Firstly, a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model is proposed to describe the decision process of the mixed platoon. Novel state representation and reward function are designed for the model to consider the behavior of the whole platoon. Secondly, in order to deal with the delayed reward, an Augmented Random Search (ARS) algorithm is proposed. The control policy learned by the agent can guide the longitudinal motion of the CAV, which serves as the leader of the platoon. Finally, a series of simulations are carried out in simulation suite SUMO. Compared with several traditional reinforcement learning approaches, the proposed method can obtain a higher reward. Meanwhile, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the delay reward, which is designed to outperform distributed reward mechanism. Compared with some state-of-the-art optimization-based frameworks, the simulation analysis reveals that more energy can be saved for different sizes of platoon. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted by adjusting the relative importance of the optimization goal to show the flexibility of ARS and delay reward setting. On the premise that travel delay is not sacrificed, the proposed control method can save up to 53.64% electric energy.},

Most existing results are subject to the same attack models for all communication channels, however multiple channels launched by different attackers are considered in this paper. First, a predictor-acknowledgement clock algorithm for each vehicle is proposed to judge whether the communication channel among neighboring vehicles is attacked or not by receiving or transmitting an acknowledgement. Then, a resilient distributed predictor is proposed to predict the pinning vehicle’s state for each vehicle. In addition, a resilient local control protocol consisting of the feedforward state provided by the predictor and the local feedback state of each vehicle is developed for the output path following problem, which is further converted to the optimal control problem by designing a discounted performance function. Discounted algebraic Riccati equations (AREs) are derived to address the optimal control problem. An off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is put forward to learn the solution of discounted AREs online without any prior knowledge of vehicles’ dynamics. It is shown that the RL-based output path following control problem of AGVs imposed by cyber attacks can be achieved in an optimal manner. Finally, a numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {The tap-on smart-card data provides a valuable source to learn passengers’ boarding behaviour and predict future travel demand. However, when examining the smart-card records (or instances) by the time of day and by boarding stops, the positive instances (i.e. boarding at a specific bus stop at a specific time) are rare compared to negative instances (not boarding at that bus stop at that time). Imbalanced data has been demonstrated to significantly reduce the accuracy of machine-learning models deployed for predicting hourly boarding numbers from a particular location. This paper addresses this data imbalance issue in the smart-card data before applying it to predict bus boarding demand. We propose the deep generative adversarial nets (Deep-GAN) to generate dummy travelling instances to add to a synthetic training dataset with more balanced travelling and non-travelling instances. The synthetic dataset is then used to train a deep neural network (DNN) for predicting the travelling and non-travelling instances from a particular stop in a given time window. The results show that addressing the data imbalance issue can significantly improve the predictive model’s performance and better fit ridership’s actual profile. Comparing the performance of the Deep-GAN with other traditional resampling methods shows that the proposed method can produce a synthetic training dataset with a higher similarity and diversity and, thus, a stronger prediction power. The paper highlights the significance and provides practical guidance in improving the data quality and model performance on travel behaviour prediction and individual travel behaviour analysis.},

This study proposes a generic descriptor for both outdoor and indoor scenarios based on the point cloud’s Gridded Gaussian Distribution (GGD). Wasserstein distance is introduced to this field to evaluate the proposed GGD descriptors’ matching performance because it not only has a solid mathematical foundation in comparing two Gaussian distributions but also shows excellent time efficiency via a straightforward analytical solution without enumeration or iteration. We construct a multi-step error function to initialize the vehicle pose using conventional cosine similarity, and Wasserstein distance. Two experiments are designed for this study. The first experiment compares the pose initialization performances under various multi-frame superimposition distance in space to find an efficient GGD descriptor extraction setting. The second experiment verifies that the proposed method achieves a better pose initialization success rate than the mainstream methods.},

Various conventional GNSS techniques have been utilized to resolve this problem, but applying them to urban environments has been difficult owing to the complexity of the reflected signals and their unpredictable and nonlinear variation to the signal receiving environments. In this study, multipath maps were generated for dynamic users at multiple positions on a road and a residual-based map selection algorithm was implemented to solve the problem of user position uncertainty in deep urban environments. GNSS data collected over a period of 327 min were used to train the multipath maps corresponding to 247 points near the 2.5 km stretch of the Teheran-ro road in Seoul, South Korea. The proposed system performed efficiently—it was verified to be capable of constructing a multipath map with a radius of 25 m using only 4 min of data. Moreover, it improved positioning accuracy by 45 % horizontally and by 80 % vertically, enabling the determination of the positional information of an urban vehicle with a horizontal accuracy of 18 m during 99% of the duration of a one-hour-long dynamic test. Due to the nonreliance of the proposed method on prior information or implementation of additional sensors, it is expected to be widely used for constructing map-based multipath mitigation models as part of intelligent transportation infrastructure in all cities in future.},

The learned representation is capable of jointly exploiting the dynamic traffic conditions and the topology of the road network, which is then fed into a route-based spatio-temporal dependence learning module to estimate the travel time. By incorporating a distribution loss function, our proposed model is able to predict the distribution of travel time. In the meantime, we design an auxiliary local task of predicting the congestion status of each road segment, which further enhances the generalization performance of the representation learning.

This paper proposes a novel bi-level control framework that combines a design of traffic signal timings at a network level, and a detailed trajectory control policy for individual vehicles at a link-level within a network of CAVs. We develop a group-based longitudinal trajectory planning scheme to coordinate vehicular movements at the lower level of our framework while abiding by the signal operations along with end-to-end vehicle routing decisions from the upper network level optimization. This joint and mutual interaction between the two different control strategies in the urban signalized corridors is complex and can significantly affect the overall network’s performance, nevertheless has not been explored previously in the literature. The proposed framework enables such studies where we derive an efficient algorithm that iteratively solves the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and linear programming models in each link at the lower and over the network at the upper levels, respectively. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed joint control framework in network performance regarding the average travel time, queue formation and dissipation across the network.},

However, due to GPS measurement errors and/or the lack of sufficient information, the performance of most existing online algorithms will degrade in the increasingly complex traffic environment. In this paper, we propose an adaptive online map matching algorithm called AMM. The basic idea is that AMM should be able to calibrate GPS observation data for various measurement errors and under complex urban conditions. First, we establish a collaborative evaluation model between GPS points and candidate points to effectively filter low-quality GPS measurement points, dynamically set the weights of different features and comprehensively select the best candidate points. Second, we propose a retrospective correction mechanism to correct the previous matching results when more information is available, which will help improve the accuracy of future GPS points. Furthermore, we define parameter self-tuning rules for AMM to enhance its portability by avoiding time-consuming parameter tuning steps. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of AMM on real vehicle trajectory datasets. The experiment results show that AMM outperforms its counterparts by up to 32% in terms of accuracy and its performance in different traffic conditions is more stable.},

  abstract     = {Recently, achieving high accuracy in bus arrival time prediction has become a hot research topic. Extensive research has been conducted around this topic, among which fusion of multi-source heterogeneous information is the mainstream. However, using only GPS trajectory data to predict the arrival time of buses is meaningful for small cities since they do not have easy access to external sources of data. Therefore, we propose a novel deep-learning model based on sequence and network(i.e., graph) embedding (SGE-net) which adopts only GPS trajectories as input and achieves accurate bus arrival time prediction without external data. Specifically, the sequence embedding part, composed of the Echo State Network (ESN), the Auto-Encoder (AE), and the k-means cluster method, is constructed to extract the complex and potential sequence patterns from a large number of trajectory sequences, and cluster different patterns of trajectories. Then, the network embedding part with the node2vec algorithm is proposed to capture the spatial correlation among bus stops on different lines under the condition of limited data. Finally, a fusion prediction part based on the specifically designed parallel Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks is introduced to combine sequence and network embedding vectors with hidden outputs of the GRUs and then get the prediction. Both real-world offline and online experiments are conducted based on GPS data of bus lines in QiTaiHe city and ShiJiaZhuang city. The results clearly show that the SGE-net outperforms the baseline models, and validate the effectiveness and robustness of the SGE-net.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a fault-tolerant control method based on the integral sliding mode (ISM) output feedback technique for the dynamic positioning control of an unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) subject to signal quantization and thruster faults. By using output information and estimates of thruster effectiveness factors, a novel integral sliding manifold is first constructed to maintain that the sliding function of system output equals the one of quantized output, which removes the region restriction that exists in the literature. Then based on the quantized signals of system output, a compensator is designed to introduce some degrees of design flexibility. To conquer the quantization effects, we incorporate a dynamic quantization parameter adjustment strategy and the fault-tolerant technique into the ISM output feedback control algorithm. The relation between the attraction area and quantization range has been revealed for the first time. Finally, the closed-loop stability can be guaranteed from every beginning time in despite of the quantization and thruster faults. Simulation through a typical floating production ship has verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In the area of autonomous driving, it typically brings great difficulty in solving the motion planning problem since the vehicle model is nonlinear and the driving scenarios are complex. Particularly, most of the existing methods cannot be generalized to dynamically changing scenarios with varying surrounding vehicles. To address this problem, this development here investigates the framework of integrated decision and control. As part of the modules, static path planning determines the reference candidates ahead, and then the optimal path-tracking controller realizes the specific autonomous driving task. An innovative and effective constrained finite-horizon approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm is herein presented to generate the desired control policy for effective path tracking. With the generalized policy neural network that maps from the state to the control input, the proposed algorithm preserves the high effectiveness for the motion planning problem towards changing driving environments with varying surrounding vehicles. Moreover, the algorithm attains the noteworthy advantage of alleviating the typically heavy computational loads with the mode of offline training and online execution. As a result of the utilization of multi-layer neural networks in conjunction with the actor-critic framework, the constrained ADP method is capable of handling complex and multidimensional scenarios. Finally, various simulations have been carried out to show that the constrained ADP algorithm is effective.},

  abstract     = {Turnouts are crucial to the safety of high-speed railways. Due to the intensive use and complex environment, breakdowns caused by different faults occur frequently in practice. Considering that the operation of turnouts is a multi-stage process during which each stage has its specific health characteristics, this paper proposes segmentalized maximal-relevancy and minimal-redundancy (mRMR) for feature extraction from each stage separately. Based on mathematical analysis of the turnout mechanism, the electric power curve is segmented into four stages, from which time-domain analysis and mRMR are combined to extract valid features corresponding to different movements respectively. Then, a novel classifier named cost-sensitive Extreme Learning Machine with fixed inputs (cf-ELM) is proposed for fault classification. We modify the inputs of ELM and define a new formula to limit the input weights and biases for the sake of stability of the network structure. Besides, a cost-sensitive optimization method is also presented in this classifier to embed the failure degree and data proportion into cost calculation rules to deal with data imbalance. To verify our proposed method, real data collected from a turnout of Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway is used. It is proven by comparisons that the accuracy of our method has achieved 100% with fast running speed and also outperforms traditional methods in terms of stability and generalization remarkably.},

The formulated problem is tackled by the proposed two-stage alternating optimization algorithm named AOBWS (alternating optimization for backscatter aided wireless powered sensors). In the first stage, AOBWS employs an iterative algorithm to obtain optimal CE transmit power through simplified closed-form computed through Cardano’s formulae. In the second stage, AOBWS uses a non-iterative algorithm that provides a closed-form expression for the computation of optimal reflection coefficient for roadside sensors under their quality of service (QoS) and a circuit power constraint. The global optimal exhaustive search (ES) algorithm is used as a benchmark. Simulation results demonstrate that the AOBWS algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance with very low complexity, which makes it suitable for practical implementations.},

In this paper, we propose a resilience-oriented train rescheduling framework, which helps the rail transit system recover to the normal state as soon as possible in case of disruptions, with the help of pre-allocated rolling stocks at the depots, side tracks and timetable rescheduling of grains. Specifically, we first construct an event-activity network for an urban rail line with multiple depots and side tracks, in which the arrival and departure of trains are modeled as a set of events. Several groups of decision variables and linear constraints are denoted to model the rescheduling of trains. Considering the use of short-turning train rescheduling strategy and pre-allocated rolling stocks, we then formulate the problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, where the objective is to maximize the resilience of the urban rail line against disruptions. Through the analysis of model properties, we develop a branch-and-cut algorithm by deriving a series of linear inequalities, which we prove are valid inequalities, to strength the tightness of the MILP model. Finally, numerical experiments based on real-world data of Beijing metro are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {How to generate road conditions from urban GPS trajectory is an important problem in transportation systems. However, this computation process usually suffers from serious missing value problem due to the observation uncertainty or limited reports from crowdsourcing systems. Conventional tensor factorization approaches learn the spatio-temporal dependencies in a collaborative filtering way, which ignores the complex road network structure information and temporal heterogeneity. In this study, we propose a multi-view model with multiple aspects of prior knowledge to impute traffic state computed from a real-world trajectory dataset. More specifically, in the spatial view, rather than focusing on a specific type of road segment, we take the heterogeneity of road network into consideration and model the multiple relations of adjacent road segments. Meanwhile, the temporal pattern is also viewed as a heterogeneous graphical structure that discriminates the weekly/hourly adjacency in the temporal view. Finally, we fuse the above spatio-temporal features to provide a robust estimation under different sparse conditions. Intensive experiments on two types of missing scenarios (i.e., random and non-random) demonstrate that the proposed imputation method outperforms all the other state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, our model represents interpretable patterns for spatio-temporal graph analysis.},

Consequently, the computation and communication costs of the IoV network are increased. Therefore, IoV needs a lightweight and efficient security solution along with effective communications. Existing state-of-the-art schemes in IoV are generally based on cryptographic methods that use session keys, public keys, elliptic curves, and Message Authentication Codes (MAC). In contrast to the other schemes, MAC-based schemes provide feasible security solutions having high performance with less overhead. The existing MAC-based authentication schemes are vulnerable to the key disclosure issue along with some security attacks such as side-channel attacks, Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS), etc. Due to the side channel attack, a data leakage problem occurs, which is a serious concern in security and privacy facets. We propose a novel MAC-based authentication scheme (NoMAS) that mitigates the above-discussed challenges and provides all the benefits of MAC-based schemes. The NoMAS scheme offers a solution for key disclosure issues by providing Hard Key and Soft Key Updates (HKU and SKU) and data leakage problems using encryption along with high performance. It reduces the computational overhead maximum to 99.60% and the communication overhead maximum to approximately 81% compared to the existing schemes. In the security analysis, We have provided the formal security proof using BAN logic and the ProVerif tool and verified the correctness of the scheme.},

DSRC relies on the IEEE 802.11p standard for its PHY and MAC layer while LTE-V2X is based on 3GPP’s Release 14 and operates in a distributed manner in the absence of cellular infrastructure. There has been considerable debate over the relative advantages and disadvantages of DSRC and LTE-V2X, aiming to answer the fundamental question of which technology is most effective in real-world scenarios for various road safety and traffic efficiency applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these two technologies (i.e., DSRC and LTE-V2X) and related works.

  abstract     = {Forecasting vessel locations is of major importance in the maritime domain, with applications in safety, logistics, etc. Nowadays, vessel tracking has become possible largely due to the increased GPS-based data availability. This paper introduces a novel Vessel Location Forecasting (VLF) framework, based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks, aiming to perform effective location forecasting in time horizons up to 60 minutes, even for vessels not recorded in the past. The proposed VLF framework is specially designed for handling vessel data by addressing some major GPS-related obstacles including variable sampling rate, sparse trajectories, and noise contained in such data. Our framework also learns by incorporating a novel trajectory data augmentation method to improve its predictive power. We validate VLF framework using three real-word datasets of vessels moving in different sea areas, comparing with various methods, and examining several aspects. Results prove VLF framework’s generic nature, robustness regarding parameter changes, and superiority against state of the art in terms of prediction accuracy (higher than 30%) and computational effort.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the traffic state estimation (TSE) problem using sparse observations from mobile sensors. Most existing TSE methods either rely on well-defined physical traffic flow models or require large amounts of simulation data as input to train learning algorithms. Different from previous studies, in this paper we propose a purely data-driven and model-free solution. We consider TSE as a spatiotemporal matrix completion/interpolation problem and apply spatiotemporal delay embedding to transform the original incomplete matrix into a fourth-order Hankel structured tensor. By imposing a low-rank assumption on this tensor structure, we can approximate and characterize both global patterns and local patterns in a data-driven manner. We use a truncated nuclear norm of a balanced spatiotemporal unfolding to approximate the tensor rank and develop an efficient algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve the problem. The proposed framework only involves two hyperparameters, spatial and temporal window lengths, which are easy to set given the degree of data sparsity. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conducted numerical experiments on real-world high-resolution trajectory data, which demonstrated its superiority in some challenging scenarios. The proposed method shows great potential for solving the TSE problem using sparse observations from mobile sensors and can be applied in various traffic applications.},

HyperSurfaces (HSF) is a revolutionary enabling technology for RIS, complementing Software Defined Metasurfaces (SDM) with an embedded network of controllers to enhance intelligence and autonomous operation in wireless networks. In this work, we consider feedback-based autonomous reconfiguration of the HSF controller states to establish a reliable communication channel between a transmitter and a receiver via programmable reflection on the HSF when Line-of-sight (LoS) between them is absent. The problem is to regulate the angle of reflection on the metasurface such that the power at the receiver is maximized. Extremum Seeking Control (ESC) is employed with the control signals generated mapped into appropriate metasurface coding signals which are communicated to the controllers via the embedded controller network (CN). This information dissemination process incurs delays which can compromise the stability of the feedback system and are thus accounted for in the performance evaluation. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method to maximize the power at the receiver within a reasonable time even when the latter is mobile. The spatiotemporal nature of the traffic for different sampling periods is also characterized.},

  abstract     = {In the last decade, the popularity of UAVs has increased tremendously. Nowadays, many researchers are interested in UAV swarms. Coordinating a swarm of UAVs is a complicated task and many problems should be addressed before wide-spread adoption. In this work, we focus on the take-off for large-scale UAV swarms, with an extra focus on the assignment phase. The assignment phase is the first take-off stage whereby we decide which UAV on the ground goes to which place in the air. A good assignment algorithm, is quick, and at the same time reduce the total distance travelled as much as possible. We assess the performance of three different assignment algorithms: a heuristic, the original Kuhn-Munkres algorithm (KMA), and the KMA adapted for GPU use. Each algorithm was tested while varying the number of UAVs, as well as the type of flight formation. During the experiments, we measured the calculation time, total distance travelled, and number of flight paths crossing. In terms of total distance travelled, the KMA always outperforms the heuristic. However, the KMA takes longer (orders of magnitude) to calculate the assignment. Realistically, the KMA algorithm can only be used as long as the swarm does not contain more than 500 UAVs. From that point the GPU version of the KMA is faster. We can conclude that, in most cases, it is recommendable to use the KMA for the assignment as it will reduce the distance travelled to a minimum and, consequently, also reduce the number of flight paths crossing.},

  abstract     = {Since millions of smart vehicles in Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) produce and relay data to analyze road conditions, creating social networks of vehicles in IoV is an important factor for the future Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Likewise, the IoV architecture has seen vertical fragmentation of approaches used to meet the needs of different work domains. Therefore, IoV in combination with social networking, called Social IoV (SIoV), was created to address these alleged problems. However, one of the challenges in SIoV is that the social relations between vehicles grow and deplete very fast due to the extremely dynamic and unstable nature of the IoV. Therefore, a clustering-based scheme for SIoV, which is efficient in terms of stability can overcome this problem. We propose SeAC: an SDN-enabled adaptive clustering technique for SIoV. SeAC uses a 3D modeling approach to construct logical clusters that are based on factors such as physical location, social tie, and interest similarity among vehicles. Therefore, SeAC improves the stability of clusters and the efficiency of the underlying SIoV architecture. Additionally, by minimizing the trade-off between social and physical distances, SeAC lowers communication and computation costs. We evaluate SeAC, and the simulation results show that for two different topologies, the adaptive approach using SeAC can produce better results in terms of a stable cluster formation.},

A switched polytopic linear-parameter-varying (LPV) model combining path-following and vehicle lateral dynamics is established, where the velocity-dependent parameters are divided into several switched regions. In each region, a trapezoidal polytope is adopted to describe the varying parameters. A global &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$H_{\infty }$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; performance analysis is carried out for the switched polytopic LPV vehicle system based on the average dwell time approach with multiple Lyapunov functions. Based on the analysis, a switched velocity-dependent controller is synthesized to achieve a desired path-following performance by regulating the steering angle of the front wheels. The proposed switched path-following control specializes in handling large range of varying velocity, and achieves superior path-following performance compared with the conventional gain-scheduling control. Simulations are carried out for typical road maneuvers to illustrate the advantages of the proposed method. The results are also applicable to other LPV analysis and synthesis conditions involving time-varying parameters of large varying ranges.},

Significant emphasis has been given by the researchers to identify the traffic pollutant sources. However, there is a need for a low-cost, automated solution for fast detection of polluting vehicles from the end of law enforcers. In this article, we have presented a novel deep learning based evaluation strategy that will identify the pollutant vehicle through on- road installed surveillance camera images. An enhanced image data set with notable variations has been prepared for training the models. Thereafter, a multi-model feedback process has been integrated. In contrast to the other deep learning approaches, the proposed framework has started with low labeled training data which is quite relevant in real-life scenarios. Subsequently, the size of the training samples has been increased using feedback. The evaluation of the framework has been performed with seven popular deep learning CNN models, i.e Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, MobileNet-V3 (small), InceptionResNet-V2, VGG16, VGG19 and XceptionNet. Transfer learning has been exploited to distinguish the on- road pollutants and to provide proper surveillance in transport system. We have compared our method with recent state-of-the-art techniques. The results have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed framework in the road surveillance domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply a feedback based iterative deep learning model for vehicle pollution detection.},

Deep learning has enabled the development of a variety of semantic segmentation networks using RGB and depth data. However, poor lighting conditions and long-distance sensing limit the applicability of RGB and depth cameras. Nevertheless, many existing methods still rely on precise depth maps for scene segmentation. Unlike depth information, thermal imaging provides a visual heat representation that remains accurate under a variety of lighting conditions and over longer distances. For robust and accurate segmentation of scenes collected during autonomous driving, we used the advanced MobileNetV2 network for feature extraction and a fusion strategy with an embedded control gate. In addition, we adopted an encoder–decoder scheme for semantic segmentation and developed an attention residual learning strategy to restore the resolution of the feature map. Finally, semantic and boundary supervision is introduced to optimize parameters of the proposed network. Experimental results show that the proposed network outperforms existing networks on segmentation of urban scenes, and our network can be generalized to depth data.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of minimizing fuel consumption of a heavy-duty truck traveling across the national highway network subject to a hard deadline. We focus on a real-world setting that traversing a road segment is subject to variable speed ranges due to dynamic traffic conditions. The consideration of dynamic traffic conditions not only differentiates our work from existing ones but also allows us to leverage opportunistic driving to improve fuel efficiency. The idea is for the truck to strategically wait (e.g., at highway rest areas) for benign traffic conditions, so as to traverse subsequent road segments at favorable speeds for saving fuel. We observe that traffic conditions and thus speed ranges are mostly stationary within certain duration of the day, and we term them as phases. We formulate the fuel consumption minimization problem under phased speed ranges, considering path planning, speed planning, and opportunistic driving. We prove that the problem is NP-hard, and develop a dual-subgradient algorithm for large-/national- scale instances. We characterize conditions under which the algorithm generates an optimal solution. We carry out simulations based on real-world traces over the US highway system. The results show that our scheme saves up to 20% fuel than a shortest-path based alternative, of which opportunistic driving contributes 13%. Meanwhile, opportunistic driving also reduces driving time by 6% as compared to only optimizing path planning and speed planning. As such, it offers a desirable design option to simultaneously reduce fuel consumption and hours of driving. Last but not least, our results highlight a perhaps surprising observation that dynamic traffic conditions can be exploited to achieve fuel savings even larger than those under stationary traffic conditions.},

Owing to temporal and spatial observation limitations, numerous unknown traffic states and parameters exist in a nonlinear traffic flow model. These cannot be accurately estimated using filter methods with unavoidable parametric assumptions. In addition, the difficulty of estimation increases owing to an increased number of diverse traffic flow states and more unfavorable observation conditions at signalized intersections compared with those on the freeway. To overcome these problems, in this study, we developed switching state-space models to approximate the description of dynamic traffic flows at signalized intersections. By setting the traffic flow rate at the upstream and downstream boundaries of the road as observation data, we constructed a Bayesian learning framework in which all unknown variables in the models can be learned from the observed data. Finally, the utility of our method is demonstrated with the synthetic and the real NGSIM data. The result demonstrated that the proposed method could perform reasonably well in estimating the traffic flow dynamic process and states at signalized intersections, and could constitute an efficient scheme that avoids critical dependence on parametric calibrations and assumptions.},

First, a bibliometric visualization is conducted to show the overall characteristics of AO research. Then, existing mathematical models that formulate AO problems are reviewed.

Over the past years, novel image sensors, namely, infrared cameras, range-gated cameras, polarization cameras, and event cameras, have demonstrated strong potential. Some of them could be game-changers for future autonomous vehicles, they are the result of progress in sensor technology and the development of the accompanying perception algorithms. This paper presents in a systematic manner their principles, comparative advantages, data processing algorithms, and related applications. The purpose is to provide practitioners with an in-depth overview of novel sensing technologies that can contribute to the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Automated and autonomous vehicles are often required to operate in complex road environments with potential hazards that may lead to hazardous events causing injury or even death. Therefore, a reliable autonomous hazardous event detection system is a key enabler for highly autonomous vehicles (e.g., Level 4 and 5 autonomous vehicles) to operate without human supervision for significant periods of time. One promising solution to the problem is the use of graph-based methods that are powerful tools for relational reasoning. Using graphs to organise heterogeneous knowledge about the operational environment, link scene entities (e.g., road users, static objects, traffic rules) and describe how they affect each other. Due to a growing interest and opportunity presented by graph-based methods for autonomous hazardous event detection, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art graph-based methods that we categorise as rule-based, probabilistic, and machine learning-driven. Additionally, we present an in-depth overview of the available datasets to facilitate hazardous event training and evaluation metrics to assess model performance. In doing so, we aim to provide a thorough overview and insight into the key research opportunities and open challenges.},

  abstract     = {The smartphone-based sensors (including accelerometer, proximity, and gyroscope sensors) are ubiquitous and emerging mobility data sources that could be used for transportation modes (i.e. bus, train, car, walking, and stationary) detection. One of the important challenges in transportation modes detection is to build an appropriate model that can extract useful data from the sensor outputs and that can reduce misclassifications. Several factors make the feature modeling difficult including inappropriate sampling frequency of input signals, wavering behavior of devices (e.g. the changing orientation of a device relative to the human body), and continuous base vibration causing similar sensor outputs for both stationary and non-stationary states and related threshold values of velocity. This paper proposes novel approaches to address these challenges by developing a robust transportation mode detector based on a convolution neural network (CNN). The proposed robust detector develops a feature modeling technique by novel feature fusion and cloning techniques. Pre-trained features are constructed using a separate vanilla neural network (VNN) framework to extract the distinguishing components from the original features that are combined with the original and cloned features. The proposed feature fusion technique is successfully able to overcome the noise from the base vibration and the minimal informative outputs from the lower sampling frequency. This enables the CNN to be trained with more efficient and discriminative features that result in a better classification model. The proposed approaches have been validated using a large volume of mobile sensor data based on the movements of travelers. Different types of mobile sensors have been used to collect data including accelerometer, proximity, and gyroscope. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approaches can improve the performance of the detection engine significantly over conventional techniques and reduces the misclassification rate.},

  abstract     = {In order to fulfill the requirements of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) on ultra-delay service response, task scheduling for trajectory analysis is being shifted from the data center into the network edge of ITS. Such a decentralized paradigm motivates the computing power of the edge device and makes traditional analysis tasks open to the users around ITS. However, since these ITS users have differentiated identities and roles with differentiated security demands and privacy protection, assigning tasks for different users requires identifying and assessing the vulnerability of edge intelligence entities (EIEs). Otherwise, sensitive tasks assigned to the vulnerable EIEs will extremely increase the security risks of industrial control networks. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a vulnerability-aware task scheduling (VATS) mechanism, which integrates vulnerability assessment and access control. With VATS, secure EIEs can obtain more permissions and join in the privacy-sensitive trajectory analysis task, which is essential to enhance privacy protection at edges and ultimately improve the efficiency of task scheduling. The simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed scheme to defend insecure task scheduling like trajectory analysis.},

To address such a research gap, we propose a reinforcement learning-based scheme to design UGV trajectory against malicious radio source as well as minimize the movement cost. Firstly, the malicious radio source detection and localization models are introduced after the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) map establishment. Then, the RSSI Map-based UGV trajectory design problem is formulated, where the movement cost and security risk are both concerned. To solve the formed problem, we propose a reinforcement learning-based trajectory design scheme, whose complexities are analyzed in detail. Finally, experiments are conducted under various parameter settings, where the simulation results evaluate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

By analyzing and processing the trajectory big data in the form of data streams in a timely and effective manner, anomalies hidden in the trajectory data can be found, thus serving urban planning, traffic management, safety control and other applications. Limited by the inherent uncertainty, infinity, time-varying evolution, sparsity and skewed distribution of trajectory big data, traditional anomaly detection techniques cannot be directly applied to anomaly detection in trajectory big data. To solve this problem, we propose a hierarchical trajectory anomaly detection scheme for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) using both machine learning and blockchain technologies. To be specific, a hierarchical federated learning strategy is proposed to improve the generalization ability of the global trajectory anomaly detection model by secondary fusion of the multi-area trajectory anomaly detection model. Then, by integrating blockchain and federated learning, the iterative exchange and fusion of the global trajectory anomaly detection model can be realized by means of on-chain and off-chain coordinated data access. Experiments show that the proposed scheme can improve the generalization ability of the trajectory anomaly detection model in different areas, while ensuring its reliability.},

Bike-sharing systems (BSS) are increasingly important in the traffic planning, management, and deployment of ITS. Therefore, it is crucial to determine how trajectory data are best used to accurately predict the demand for short-term bike sharing usage. This study proposed a recurrent neural network (RNN) model based on the dual attention mechanism to extract spatial and temporal features. The attention mechanism is able to determine and weight all location features of the data in time series to learn mutual correlations. The method applied in this paper can effectively conduct an adaptive combination of local- and global-feature dependencies for trajectory data, in order to effectively predict the trend of short-term bike sharing usage demand. In addition, this study adopted the random walk mechanism to maintain local relations between bike stations in the preprocessing of time series data, which makes it more adaptive to the local location changes of different stations. Finally, the experimental results show that the model architecture in this study combined the attention and random walk mechanisms to achieve better prediction performance.},

Turning trajectories into graphs and then analyzing them efficiently in an AI-empowered way is a representative branch of trajectory analysis in IoV and ITS environments, which is of great significance. This research attempts to project trajectories onto road networks to predict traffic conditions. Extracting accurate spatio-temporal dependencies is the key to improving the analysis. However, two problems exist in the current study. The first one is the focus on the network structure while ignoring node features, and the second one is that the structure cannot be fully utilized. In addition, the static spatial structure may not accurately reflect the dynamic real spatial dependency. In response to these problems, a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks via View Fusion for Trajectory Data Analytics (STFGCN) model is designed. It contains two independent views: the structural view and feature view. The view fusion layer is further designed. It includes an extended graph convolutional module and a causal dilated module. The extended graph convolutional module fully extracts dynamic spatial dependencies, while the causal dilated module captures time tendencies. Stacked view fusion layers and a view fusion module perform fusion operations based on the advantages of the two views, efficiently integrating information from both. Several experiments are performed on two real-world trajectory datasets. The results show that a better prediction performance is obtained, especially on the long-range time prediction task.},

AVs increase data demands from in-vehicle users, which pose a significant risk to the vehicular trajectory data and are extremely vulnerable to security threats. It is challenging to describe and detect the trajectory anomalies in urban motion behavior due to the enormous coverage and complexity of ITS in the V2X environment. Most existing systems rely on a restricted number of single detection strategies, such as determining frequent patterns and have limited accuracy in detecting anomalous trajectories. However, they focus only on outlier detection, failing to consider different patterns of anomalous trajectories. This paper proposes Efficient Trajectory Anomaly Detection and Classification (ETADC) framework in a 6G-V2X environment. The proposed ETADC framework employs the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (DDPG) to improve accuracy and efficiency by analyzing multiple strategies, namely driving speed, driving distance, driving direction, and driving time. The result analysis shows that the proposed ETADC technique outperforms the existing systems by 97% accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology have pathed the way for the use of various smart services for the management of urban traffic, including authentication and key management. Key management protocols are an important means of addressing security and privacy concerns. However, they can be resource-intensive in terms of network traffic and workload management, particularly at times of traffic congestion, which in turn can increase the ECU and RSU processing load and adversely impact network communications. This paper introduces a more efficient key management method, named AI-enabled and Layered Key Management (ALKM), which uses an Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach and a layered workflow to reduce network traffic and workload. Specifically, the ALKM distributes dynamic synchronous time-dependent keys among Road Side Units (RSUs) rather than static cryptographic keys. It provides three layers of secure communications: public, tunnel, and hierarchy. The public layer creates a flat secure layer between the Traffic Management Center (TMC) and all RSUs. Using AI-enabled features, the tunnel layer predicts short-term and long-term congestion areas by analysis of the acquired trajectory data, and then establishes a secure communication channel between the selected RSUs and the TMC. In the hierarchy layer, in multiple tiers, the TMC and higher-level RSUs assist lower RSUs in message decryption (but not vice-versa). Our extensive analysis shows that the ALKM generates overall between 48% and 99% less network traffic per generated key than the Master Key method, depending on the operational lifetime of the keys used.},

A secure and feasible IoT-assisted vehicle environment should include a robust data transmission mechanism for transferring and collecting data packets from both onboard and roadside sensors, resulting in the accurate delivery of packages without delay. When designing such Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks, the vulnerability of the network should be considered to facilitate data transmission in the remaining network under the condition that some nodes (e.g., vehicles) and channels are damaged due to the dynamic environmental factors and unpredicted failures at various nodes. Fractional Critical Deleted Graph (FCDG), which is used in graph theory, can act as Fractional Factor (FF) in the IoV networks to maintain the IoT network stable and provide reliable network connectivity when a part of data transmission network is damaged. Toughness is an important condition to measure the sturdiness of such FF-encoded network. In this work, we study the relationship between toughness and FCDG in IoV networks. Moreover, the graph conditions are considered together with the tight lower bound of the toughness for the existence of path factor. Such feasibility analysis of IoV networks help to find the bound in the effort to recover or realign lost links in networks, which is critical for the next generation of intelligent transportation systems where all vehicles are connected seamlessly.},

However, most of them focus on the prediction of the entire traffic network, which could lead to several problems: (1) the entire traffic network could have a large scale and a complex structure, for which the model training is likely to be time-consuming as well as inefficient; (2) processing a large amount of training data on the central cloud could cause much calculation pressure on the server and increase the risk of privacy leakage. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Attention Graph Convolution Network on Edge Cloud model (STAGCN-EC). We first divide the entire traffic network into several parts to reduce its scale and complexity. Then, we allocate each part of the network to a certain Roadside Unit (RSU) for training, thus there is no need to process all data on the central server. Besides, we utilize spatial-temporal attention and features extracting module that fits the low computational power devices like RSUs, to capture spatial-temporal dependence and predict traffic flow. At last, we use two highway datasets from District 7 and District 4 in California to validate our model. Through the experiments, we find out that our model performs well both in predicted precision and efficiency compared with the five baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a multi-intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)- and multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) system for 5G/6G networks. In the studied system, multiple UAVs are integrated for providing services to large-scale user equipment (UEs) with the help of multiple IRSs. This article aims to minimize the overall cost including energy consumption, completion time, and maintenance cost of UAVs by jointly optimizing the trajectories of UAVs and phase shifts of IRSs. When solving this problem, one has to count in mind the deployment of stop points (SPs) of UAVs, and consider the association among UEs, and UAVs (i.e., which UE will send data to which UAV at which SP), the order of SPs, and the phase shifts of IRSs. Therefore, traditional optimization techniques may not solve the above-mentioned problem in an efficient way. To tackle the above-mentioned problem, this article proposes an algorithm called TPaPBA that consists of four phases. The first phase optimizes the SPs’ deployment via using a differential evolution algorithm having variable population size. As a result, all the SPs of UAVs can be obtained. Then, the second phase optimizes the association among UEs, SPs, and UAVs. Specifically, TPaPBA first adopts a clustering algorithm to optimize the SPs-UAVs association, and then a close criterion is introduced to optimize UEs-SPs association. Subsequently, third phase adopts a low-complexity greedy algorithm to optimize the order of SPs for UAVs. Finally, the phase shifts of IRSs are optimized to enhance the data rate between UEs and UAVs. The simulation results of TPaPBA on ten instances having UEs ranging from 100 to 1000, reveals that TPaPBA has significantly improved the system performance contribution and outperforms other approaches in terms of reducing the overall cost of UAVs.},

  abstract     = {Automated container terminal (ACT) is considered as port industry development direction, and accurate kinematic data (speed, volume, etc.) is essential for enhancing ACT operation efficiency and safety. Port surveillance videos provide much useful spatial-temporal information with advantages of easy obtainable, large spatial coverage, etc. In that way, it is of great importance to analyze automated guided vehicle (AGV) trajectory movement from port surveillance videos. Motivated by the newly emerging computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, we propose an ensemble framework for extracting vehicle speeds from port-like surveillance videos for the purpose of analyzing AGV moving trajectory. Firstly, the framework exploits vehicle position in each image via a feature-enhanced scale-aware descriptor. Secondly, we match vehicle position and trajectory data from the previous step output via Kalman filter and Hungarian algorithm, and thus we obtain the vehicular imaging trajectory in a frame-by-frame manner. Thirdly, we estimate the vehicular moving speed in real-world via the help of perspective projection theory. The experimental results suggest that our proposed framework can obtain accurate vehicle kinematic data under typical port traffic scenarios considering that the average measurement error of root mean square deviation is 0.675 km/h, the mean absolute deviation is 0.542 km/h, and the Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.9349. The research findings suggest that cutting-edge AI and computer vision techniques can accurately extract on-site vehicular trajectory related data from port videos, and thus help port traffic participants make more reasonable management decisions.},

Due to the super degrees of freedom and the unpredictable physical state of deformed objects. It is difficult for robots to complete tasks under the environment of the deformable object. Therefore, we present a method based on imitation learning. In the generated expert demonstration, the agent is offered to learn the state sequence, and then imitate the expert’s trajectory sequence which avoid the above-mentioned difficulties.

Among that, how to optimize drone trajectory data and find optimal delivery path is a crucial problem. However, most existing studies fail to derive the feasible trajectory data due to underestimating drone energy consumption and delivery multi-variant constraints for air transportation. In this paper, we propose a novel self-driven learning procedure, named attention-based pointer network (A-Ptr-Net) model, which can solve drone delivery trajectory optimization problem. The generated A-Ptr-Net model coupled with attention mechanism is effective on adapting to the new drone trajectory data automatically, regardless of explicit distance matrix. We go into developing the convex function constraints related to drone nonlinear energy consumption, customer demand and service time windows, which is applied on A-Ptr-Net model for optimizing the drone logistics delivery. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed method performs significantly better than classical heuristics for drone trajectory analysis and optimization.},

Driven by the massive number of connected vehicles and the stringent requirements of the public traffic management system, the transportation of data to and from the centralized cloud servers poses a great challenge. As a result, to meet the computational requirements and handle the massive amount of sensory data efficiently, the potential solution is to process/analyze the data at the edge of the network. Motivated by the challenges mentioned above, in this paper, we design a new empirically intelligent XGboost (EIXGB)-enabled logistic transportation system at the edge network for analyzing the data efficiently. Besides that, the proposed EIXGB technique intends to obtain real-time results based on the monitoring parameters of the public traffic management system with higher accuracy and minimum error. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed EIXGB technique over the standard machine learning techniques using a set of parameters. The proposed technique achieves 87-97% accuracy over the different sets of features of a real-time dataset as per the simulation results.},

In terms of the input data, Transformer FRTS uses a new data form, so-called the random difference time series, to reduce the time dependency of the network prediction. In terms of the network architecture, the proposed network uses its encoder and decoder to obtain the data association from the forward and reverse time series. In addition, Transformer FRTS uses a post-processing decision criterion to improve the accuracy and reliability of prediction.

In this work, an integrated APC-GAN and AttuNet framework is proposed as an automated pavement surface crack pixel-level segmentation solution for small training datasets. First, an Automated Pavement Crack Generative Adversarial Network (APC-GAN) is designed for the pavement cracks data as an image augmentation method, which is modified and improved from a traditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN). Then, a novel pixel-level semantic segmentation structure, Attention modified U-Net (AttuNet), is proposed by introducing the attention module into the convolutional network structure. In order to assess the performance of our proposed framework, an open-source dataset DeepCrack is used, which only contains 300 training images. The results show that our proposed APC-GAN could augment the datasets by producing more clear and distinct pavement images than DCGAN and the generated images could feature more diversity than traditional image augmentation methods. APC-GAN demonstrated higher accuracy than DCGAN and traditional image augmentation methods. Apparently, our proposed APC-GAN and AttuNet framework gains the highest value in the evaluation metrices, including recall, F1 score, mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and mean Pixel Accuracy (mPA) among all models including U-Net, DeepLabv3, FCN, and LRASPP.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the problem of tracking a moving ground object that can be found in a number of applications such as surveillance, criminal and military situations. Ground vehicles can be employed for the tracking, but are greatly affected by surrounding obstacles, e.g. building blocks, roadside objects, other vehicles and passengers, etc. Hence, their cooperation with an aerial vehicle, e.g. a drone, which has a better vision from above, is proposed. This is inspired from the wolf-raven cooperative hunting behavior in nature, where the aerial vehicle acts as the raven and ground vehicles act as wolfs. However, the position and velocity sensing as well as the vision of ground and aerial vehicles are still perturbed by the surrounding environment. Therefore, a distributed robust control design is proposed for the ground-aerial vehicle cooperation to suppress the effects of the aforementioned disturbances. Conditions on the controller parameter are derived so that the proposed controller is robust in the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$H_{\infty }$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; or &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$H_{2}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; sense, depending on the disturbance types. Furthermore, the bounded input constraint, as often encountered in reality, is investigated, revealing that the proposed controller is input-to-state stable with environment disturbances.

  abstract     = {In this work, we introduce panoramic panoptic segmentation, as the most holistic scene understanding, both in terms of Field of View (FoV) and image-level understanding for standard camera-based input. A complete surrounding understanding provides a maximum of information to a mobile agent. This is essential information for any intelligent vehicle to make informed decisions in a safety-critical dynamic environment such as real-world traffic. In order to overcome the lack of annotated panoramic images, we propose a framework which allows model training on standard pinhole images and transfers the learned features to the panoramic domain in a cost-minimizing way. The domain shift from pinhole to panoramic images is non-trivial as large objects and surfaces are heavily distorted close to the image border regions and look different across the two domains. Using our proposed method with dense contrastive learning, we manage to achieve significant improvements over a non-adapted approach. Depending on the efficient panoptic segmentation architecture, we can improve 3.5–6.5% measured in Panoptic Quality (PQ) over non-adapted models on our established Wild Panoramic Panoptic Segmentation (WildPPS) dataset. Furthermore, our efficient framework does not need access to the images of the target domain, making it a feasible domain generalization approach suitable for a limited hardware setting. As additional contributions, we publish WildPPS: The first panoramic panoptic image dataset to foster progress in surrounding perception and explore a novel training procedure combining supervised and contrastive training.},

  abstract     = {Shared mobility services are useful for low-income people that are not satisfied with public transport and cannot comfortably afford their own vehicle. Among the low-cost shared mobility services, carsharing stands out because it avoids the cost of a driver. This work applies a polynomial-time linear programming formulation to optimize different carsharing business models for the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo. Real mobility data are used, focusing on inhabitants who are able to drive. Scenarios are evaluated varying distances that clients would be flexible to walk to get to an available vehicle or parking slot, comparing carsharing business models, and considering different rental prices. Results show that it is possible to offer a profitable low-cost carsharing service without performing vehicle relocations if clients are flexible enough to walk and if only a subset of trips is selected to be served. Results also demonstrate that trips selected to be served are similar among the different business models; are concentrated on São Paulo’s downtown region; are shorter than the average trip, but otherwise behave in a similar way as compared to the complete set of trips; and the lack of parking slots may be a risk to the carsharing company.},

  abstract     = {Automatic pavement defect segmentation is a big challenge because of the class diversity and extremely random distribution of defects. Most existing approaches focus on supervised strategies to achieve decent performance. Due to the difficulty of getting massive densely annotated samples and the limited prior knowledge of potential defects, these methods have significant bottlenecks in the actual pavement settings. This paper proposes a relevance-aware and cross-reasoning network (RCN) for anomaly segmentation of pavement defects, which can segment defects using merely non-defective images for training. A relevance-aware transformer-based encoder is first devised to model intrinsic interdependencies across local features, thus improving representations of complex non-defective images. Next, a dual decoder strategy is proposed to remap the encoder-generated latent dependencies at the local semantic and global detailed levels, respectively. Specifically, a cross-reasoning refinement module is built in the local decoder to reason the cross-relationship between spatial and channel dimensions. Finally, a context-aware abnormal distillation measurement is developed to evaluate the semantic reconstruction deviations during the inference. Under the guidance of semantic affinity, this measurement allows our model to highlight defective areas adaptively. Extensive experimental results on four datasets indicate that RCN outperforms other leading anomaly segmentation methods.},

Then, the fuzzy logic system (FLS) is used to identify the unknown nonlinear functions. A dead-zone inverse technique is introduced to eliminate the negative effects of the unknown dead-zone input nonlinearity. In the framework of backstepping, the tangent barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is introduced in this paper, and a distributed adaptive fuzzy control scheme is designed so that the position, velocity and acceleration of the vehicle platoon do not violate the given constrained boundaries. Finally, based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it is noted that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded and the tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin.

To this end, vehicles and customers are classified into different grades for scheduling and matching, according to their state of charge and travel distance, respectively. The number of grades is involved as a decision variable in the combinatorial optimization problem, with the objective of minimizing the maximum response time and the operating cost for both rebalancing and charging. A lower bound optimal solution of the problem is given analytically based on the Lagrangian analysis and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition, yielding a joint optimization algorithm that can ensure the quality of service and balanced demand-supply in the system.

  abstract     = {The multiple-predecessor following (MPF) topology is used in vehicle platoons to make it robustly string stable and reduce the minimum employable time headway. It has been demonstrated that communication imperfections such as time delays coming from wireless communications can affect string stability as well as the minimum time headway required to guarantee string stability. Specifically, it was shown that the larger the time delay, the longer the minimum time headway will be. However, by utilizing on-board vehicle sensors, such as radar, lidar and cameras, the distance and speed of nearby vehicles can be measured almost instantaneously, i.e., with almost no delay. Another effective parameter on string stability and minimum time headway is the heterogeneity of the vehicles. Due to the immense complexity of the MPF topology, string stability analysis of this topology in literature has been confined to homogeneous platoons. In this paper, we consider the case of heterogeneous platoons under the MPF topology with the use of the combination of sensors and wireless communications for receiving information. Following that, we find conditions to guarantee the internal and string stability for the heterogeneous case and propose the minimum time headway required to guarantee string stability. Finally, we provide a table, in which we propose the minimum time headway for two other wireless communication scenarios as well: (i) having no communication delay and (ii) having fully-delayed information, i.e., all information, whether it comes from the ego vehicle or its predecessors, is delayed. In addition to exploring the analysis of string stability for the vehicles with more possible connections (vehicles after the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$r^{th}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; vehicle, when information from &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$r$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; immediate vehicles is used), we study the string stability conditions (with which we aim at avoiding collisions) and find the minimum time headway for the first few vehicles (vehicle &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$r$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; and all its predecessors).

  abstract     = {Vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) aims at finding the target vehicle identity from multi-camera surveillance videos, which plays an important role in the intelligent transportation system (ITS). It suffers from the subtle discrepancy among vehicles from the same vehicle model and large variation across different viewpoints of the same vehicle. To enhance the robustness of Re-ID models, many methods exploit additional detection or segmentation models to extract discriminative local features. Some others employ data-driven methods to enrich the diversity of the training data, such as the data augmentation and 3D-based data generation, so that the Re-ID model can obtain stronger robustness against intra-class variations. However, these methods either rely on extra annotations or greatly increase the computational cost. In this paper, we propose the Bi-level Implicit semantic Data Augmentation (BIDA) framework to solve this problem from two aspects. (1) We implicitly augment the images semantically in the feature space according to the identity-level and superclass-level intra-class variations, which can generate more diverse semantic augmentations beyond the intra-identity variations. (2) We introduce the similarity ranking constraints on the augmented training set by extending the sample-wise triplet loss to the distribution-wise one, which can effectively reduce meaningless semantic transformations and improve the discrimination of the feature. We conduct extensive experiments on VeRi-776, VehicleID and Cityflow benchmarks to reveal the effectiveness of our method. And we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on VeRi-776.},

  abstract     = {Electrified railway is one of the major users of electricity in the power system. The access of energy storage system (ESS) effectively solves the problems of peak traction load (TL) shock and regenerative braking energy (RBE) recycling, and the access of photovoltaic (PV) system improves environmental and economic benefits. However, in the current control strategy based on the electrified railway with ESS and PV, there are still problems of less optimal overall peak clipping effect of TL and insufficient penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) due to low utilization and lack of pre-processing capacity of ESS. Therefore, this paper proposes a rolling-adaptive peak clipping (RAPC) control strategy coordinating RBE recycling and PV consumption. Firstly, perform rolling peak clipping through dynamically divided implementation windows to make full use of the available energy in each time period. Secondly, according to the state of charge (SOC) of ESS and the specific working condition of TL, the ESS output is modified accordingly to perform adaptive deep peak clipping maximizing the consumption of PV energy and RBE. The simulation verified that the proposed strategy can improve the overall peak-clipping effect of TL, and achieve full recovery of RBE and complete consumption of PV energy under the same ESS configuration compared to the global optimization method. The results show that the RAPC control strategy can realize optimal peak-clipping and RBE utilization, and increase the PV penetration with limited ESS capacity, thus improving the economic benefits of the traction power supply system (TPSS) and promoting the energy transition of TPSS.},

  abstract     = {As a significant part of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), vehicle Re-Identification (Re-ID) aims to retrieve all target vehicle images captured from non-overlapping cameras. Though the Re-ID methods based on supervised learning have achieved rapid progress, they are still difficult to be applied in real scenarios due to the domain bias between the training set and real scenarios. Recently, methods based on unsupervised learning have been proposed to address the problem of domain bias by exploring techniques of pseudo-label generation. However, these methods suffer from pseudo-label noise. To solve this problem, we propose the Mask-Aware Pseudo Label Denoising framework (MAPLD) consisting of three key components, i.e., Mask-Aware Feature Extraction (MAFE), Adaptive Threshold Neighborhood Consistency (ATNC), and Compact Loss (CL). Firstly, the MAFE is proposed to improve the distinguishability of feature representation and widen the gap in feature space among vehicles with different IDs. Next, the ATNC is introduced to filter out pseudo-label noise of hard negative samples by comparing the image ID of the samples in their neighborhood set i.e., neighborhood consistency. Moreover, the threshold of neighborhood consistency is adaptively adjusted according to feature similarity ranking, which is robust to hyper-parameter variation. Finally, consisting of regression term and compact term, the CL is designed to drive the cluster more compact and alleviate the impact of outliers of hard positive samples. Extensive experiments on VeRi-776 and VeRi-Wild datasets demonstrate that MAPLD can generate reliable pseudo-labels and achieve superior performance in unsupervised target-only and unsupervised domain adaptation tasks.},

The speeds of non-connected vehicles are modeled as stochastic processes. A fundamental theorem is proven which links the spectral properties of the motion signals to the average energy consumption.

However, for braking system faults in a train, the relevant documents and specifications don’t provide a theoretical basis or solutions to ensure the parking safety of the breaking-fault train. For the tracking scenario, when a braking-fault train tracks the normal train running ahead, a calculation model of the tracking operation between trains with a failure coefficient is proposed. By detecting the braking-fault train information and the operation parameters of the train ahead, the model can calculate the minimum non-collision distance or predict the collision speed and position of these two trains. Considering the Yumen station of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang high-speed railway as an example, a series of experimental analyses are conducted under multiple fault scenarios, and the operation schemes that can avoid collision accidents are investigated. The experimental results show that the actual distance between the faulty and the front trains and the maximum acceleration that the front train could achieve are the two most critical factors. Finally, based on the information obtained from the above model results, the process of calculating the anti-collision scheme of the front train is summarized, and a protection strategy is designed, which provides the calculation basis and overall execution framework for the dispatching system to ensure the safety of these two trains.},

To address above insufficiency, we propose a new and effective approach, named 3FL-Net, to elevate the performance of lightweight object detectors in the presence of rain.

The lightweight detection subnetwork achieved the accuracy improvement by learning diverse features from the feature enhancement subnetwork and feature extraction subnetwork via the feature adaptation subnetwork. To further drive the development in object detection induced by rain, we introduce a large-scale driving dataset, called iRain. The full iRain consists of 17,950 real-world rain images, which covers most of the driving scenarios and 85,081 instances explaining five prevalent object classes. Experiment results on divergent rain datasets expose that our 3FL-Net considerably improves the performance of lightweight detectors and surpasses that of the combination models between rain removal and object detection methods.},

  abstract     = {In an internet of vehicle (IoV) scenario, vehicular edge computing (VEC) exploits the computing capabilities of the vehicles and roadside unit (RSU) to enhance the task processing capabilities of the vehicles. Resource management is essential to the performance improvement of the VEC system. In this paper, we propose a joint task offloading and resource allocation scheme to minimize the total task processing delay of all the vehicles through task scheduling, channel allocation, and computing resource allocation for the vehicles and RSU. Different from the existing works, our scheme: 1) considers task diversity by profiling the tasks of the vehicles by multiple attributes including data size, computation amount, delay tolerance, and task type; 2) considers vehicle classification by dividing the vehicles into 4 sets according to whether they have task offloading requirements or provide task processing services; 3) considers task processing flexibility by deciding for each vehicle to process its tasks locally, to offload the tasks to the RSU via V2I (Vehicle to Infrastructure) connections, or to the other vehicles via V2V (Vehicle to Vehicle) connections. An algorithm based on the Generalized Benders Decomposition (GBD) and Reformulation Linearization (RL) methods is designed to optimally solve the optimization problem. A heuristic algorithm is also designed to provide the sub-optimal solution with low computational complexity. We analyze the convergence and complexity of the proposed algorithms and conduct extensive simulations in 6 scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our scheme in comparison with 4 other schemes.},

  abstract     = {In road transport systems, various traffic risks in certain condition could produce joint actions, which increases the complexity of traffic risk assessment. Previous single risk assessment fails to reflect the superposition effect of multi-type traffic risks, so the result may underestimate or overrate the total risk strength of transport system. To address this problem, a novel risk assessment perspective that aims to evaluate the superposition effect of several traffic risks is studied. In this study, the risk quantification and standardization for single traffic risks is conducted first. Then a GARCH-VaR model is developed to explore the superposition impact of these single traffic risks. The GARCH-VaR model integrates the VaR theory and GARCH model, from which the superposition traffic risk is obtained by assigning every single traffic risk a reasonable weight. Finally, an improved k-means clustering algorithm is proposed to classify the superposition risk level. Empirical results demonstrate that the superposition risk of crash risk and congestion risk is lower than a single traffic risk in certain condition, which attributes to the weak interactions between various traffic risks. This finding illustrates the superposition risk does not necessarily go up with the increase of the risk category. Then the superposition risks are classified into high-risk level, moderate-risk level, and low-risk level, among which the classification accuracy of high-risk level is 92.85%-95.23%. The proposed method provides a theoretical reference for collaborative assessment of multi-type traffic risks, and the results could be potentially used in the comprehensive management of traffic risks.},

Following the success of Social Generative Adversarial Networks (SGAN), recent works propose various GAN-based designs to better model human motion in crowds. Despite superior performance in reducing distance-based metrics, current networks fail to output socially acceptable trajectories, as evidenced by high collisions in model predictions. To counter this, we introduce SGANv2: an improved safety-compliant SGAN architecture equipped with spatio-temporal interaction modelling and a transformer-based discriminator. The spatio-temporal modelling ability helps to learn the human social interactions better while the transformer-based discriminator design improves temporal sequence modelling. Additionally, SGANv2 utilizes the learned discriminator even at test-time via a collaborative sampling strategy that not only refines the colliding trajectories but also prevents mode collapse, a common phenomenon in GAN training. Through extensive experimentation on multiple real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of SGANv2 to provide socially-compliant multimodal trajectories.},

However, there is a lack of comprehensive take-over performance measures that suitably combine multiple objective metrics based on an average evaluation from human drivers. In this study, we proposed a human-centered comprehensive measure of take-over performance (HCMTP). There are four main building blocks for the HCMTP. First, we adopted sparse principal component analysis to identify the main aspects of take-over performance based on multiple original objective take-over performance metrics. Second, we developed a scale of take-over performance assessment to obtain drivers’ original subjective self-assessments of take-over performance. Third, we established nonlinear individual mapping functions to acquire different drivers’ evaluation criteria for take-over performance. Fourth, we proposed a relabeling algorithm to obtain drivers’ average evaluation of take-over performance. To verify the effectiveness of the HCMTP, we conducted a verification experiment involving 68 participants. The results indicate that the HCMTP is effective and able to reduce the interference of individual differences, stochasticity, and data imbalance. This study contributes to identifying the main aspects of take-over performance, systematically understanding how human drivers subjectively evaluate take-over performance, and evaluating drivers’ take-over performance comprehensively.},

  abstract     = {In-advance availability of parking information plays an important role in parker/traveller decision-making for parking, curbing congestion, and managing parking lots efficiently. Specifically on-street parking poses many challenges compared to the off-street ones. Many users such as, store owners, municipal authorities, and police demand slots for on-street parking Free of Charges (FoC) for a short duration. In last few years, parking authorities collected data to attract the attention of researchers to present data-centric solutions for various problems such as, minimization of parking prices, maximization of revenue, and balacing the congestion at parking lots associated with smart parking systems. Motivated from the aforementioned problem, this paper proposes a scheme based on machine learning and game theory for dynamic pricing and allocation of parking slots in on-street parking scenarios. The dynamic pricing and allocation problem is modeled as Stackelberg game and is solved by finding its Nash equilibrium. Two types of Parking Users (PUs), i.e., Paid Parking Users (PPUs) and Restricted Parking Users (RPUs) are considered in this work. RPUs avail parking slots FoC once a day. PPUs compete to minimize the prices, and RPUs compete to maximize the FoC granted duration. The Parking Controllers (PCs) compete to maximize revenue generated from PPUs and to minimize total FoC parking duration granted to the RPUs. The random forest model is used to predict occupancy, which in turn is used to generate parking prices. Seattle city parking and its prices data sets are used to predict occupancy and to generate prices, respectively. In order to test the performance of communication system, the proposed DyPARK Pricing and Allocation Scheme (PAS) is compared with its four variants and is found worth. The proposed scheme is also compared with other state-of-the-art schemes using various performance evaluation metrics. Simulated results prove the superiority of the proposed scheme in comparison to the other state-of-the-art schemes.},

  abstract     = {Traffic speed prediction based on real-world traffic data is a classical problem in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Most existing traffic speed prediction models are proposed based on the hypothesis that traffic data are complete or have rare missing values. However, such data collected in real-world scenarios are often incomplete due to various human and natural factors. Although this problem can be solved by first estimating the missing values with an imputation model and then applying a prediction model, the former potentially breaks critical latent features and further leads to the error accumulation issues. To tackle this problem, we propose a graph-based spatio-temporal autoencoder that follows an encoder-decoder structure for spatio-temporal traffic speed prediction with missing values. Specifically, we regard the imputation and prediction as two parallel tasks and train them sequentially to eliminate the negative impact of imputation on raw data for prediction and accelerate the model training process. Furthermore, we utilize graph convolutional layers with a self-adaptive adjacency matrix for spatial dependencies modeling and apply gated recurrent units for temporal learning. To evaluate the proposed model, we conduct comprehensive case studies on two real-world traffic datasets with two different missing patterns and a wide and practical missing rate range from 20% to 80%. Experimental results demonstrate that the model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art traffic prediction with missing values methods and achieves steady performance in the investigated missing scenarios and prediction horizons.},

This study models the dynamic characteristics of lane-level traffic flow as complex networks and proposes a deep learning framework for network-scale prediction. Relying on the visibility graph, we transform the temporal dependence learning task into spatial correlation mining on temporal complex networks. For spatial dependency extraction in urban traffic flows, we establish three topological graphs from traffic, statistical, and semantic perspectives to investigate the static and dynamic correlations. Then, a network-scale traffic volumes prediction model, i.e., spatiotemporal multigraph gated network (STMGG), is proposed to learn spatiotemporal correlations on visibility graphs and spatial topological graphs. This model designs an attention-based gated mechanism to incorporate global features from multigraphs. Additionally, a Seq2Seq structure is integrated to enhance multistep prediction stability. We employ two license plate recognition (LPR) datasets as case studies, and STMGG expresses superiorities over various advanced deep learning models. Meanwhile, an ablation experiment is conducted to evaluate its components, and numerical tests further reveal its impressive inductive learning capability.},

As such, this paper proposes a Randomized Search Optimization Ensemble-based Falsification Detection Scheme (RSO-FDS). The RSO technique was used to construct the proposed Ensemble-based Random Forest (RF) model. The evaluation was performed on three different datasets developed to evaluate falsification in IoV. In addition, the six most popular supervised learning (SL) algorithms were investigated to evaluate the capability of the proposed RSO-FDS, which had the best performance across all datasets. The performance metrics considered are computational efficiency in terms of prediction time, validation accuracy for overall attack classification, precision, recall, and F1 scores. For validation, the performance of the proposed RSO-FDS was further compared with results from recent works. Furthermore, the irrelevance of data balancing was illustrated for real-life IoV scenarios.

To achieve this goal, passenger flow forecasting is a crucial and well-recognized task in metro operation. However, passenger flow forecasting is a challenging task as there exist many unquantifiable factors in resident travel. To address this problem, we propose an innovative model named Interaction Graph Network (IG-Net) to perform passenger flow forecasting at the station level, capable of capturing the non-Euclidean relationships between stations. Three kinds of inter-station interaction graphs are developed to model these inter-station interactions: connectivity, similarity, and temporal correlation graphs. Moreover, we apply multiple channels of graph convolutional neural networks to capture interaction representations and develop a multi-task learning architecture across multiple stations. The proposed IG-Net achieved better performance than the benchmark models when forecasting passenger flow over multiple stations, based on experiments with the Suzhou metro. Finally, we identify the significant effects of interaction graph combinations and multi-task loss functions via further experimentation.},

  abstract     = {The majority of existing energy management strategies (EMSs), merely considering external driving conditions, often allocate demand power in an irrational way, resulting in a waste of energy and a short service life of power sources. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate driving behavior in EMS to reduce the fuel consumption and improve the lifespan of power sources. In this paper, a driving-behavior-aware adaptive deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) based EMS is proposed for a three-power-source fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FCHEV). To fully utilize each power source, a hierarchical power splitting method is adopted by an adaptive fuzzy filter. Then, a high-performance driving behavior recognizer is employed, and Pontryagin’s minimum principle (PMP) method is used to compute the optimal equivalent factor (EF) of each driving behavior. To realize a trade-off between global learning and real-time implementation, an improved multi-learning-space DRL-based algorithm, applying driving-behavior-aware adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (A-ECMS) and soft learning mechanism, is proposed and verified by a series of simulations. Simulation results show that, compared with the benchmark method ECMS, the proposed P-DQL method can reduce the hydrogen consumption by 49.9% on average, and the total cost to use by 31.4%, showing a promising ability to increase fuel economy and reduce hydrogen consumption and the total cost to use of FCHEV.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian trajectory prediction in crowd scenes plays a significant role in intelligent transportation systems. The main challenges are manifested in learning motion patterns and addressing future uncertainty. Typically, trajectory prediction is considered in two dimensions, including temporal dynamics modeling and social interactions capturing. For temporal dependencies, although existing models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve high performance on short-term prediction, they still suffer from limited scalability for long sequences. For social interactions, previous graph-based methods only consider fixed features but ignore dynamic interactions between pedestrians. Considering that the transformer network has a strong capability of capturing spatial and long-term temporal dynamics, we propose Long-Short Term Spatio-Temporal Aggregation (LSSTA) network for human trajectory prediction. First, a modern variant of graph neural networks, named spatial encoder, is presented to characterize spatial interactions between pedestrians. Second, LSSTA utilizes a transformer network to handle long-term temporal dependencies and aggregates the spatial and temporal features with a temporal convolution network (TCN). Thus, TCN is combined with the transformer to form a long-short term temporal dependency encoder. Additionally, multi-modal prediction is an efficient way to address future uncertainty. Existing auto-encoder modules are extended with static scene information and future ground truth for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Experimental results on complex scenes demonstrate the superior performance of our method in comparison to existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning has demonstrated its potential in a series of challenging domains. However, many real-world decision making tasks involve unpredictable environmental changes or unavoidable perception errors that are often enough to mislead an agent into making suboptimal decisions and even cause catastrophic failures. In light of these potential risks, reinforcement learning with application in safety-critical autonomous driving domain remains tricky without ensuring robustness against environmental uncertainties (e.g., road adhesion changes or measurement noises). Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constrained adversarial reinforcement learning approach for robust decision making of autonomous vehicles at highway on-ramps. Environmental disturbance is modelled as an adversarial agent that can learn an optimal adversarial policy to thwart the autonomous driving agent. Meanwhile, observation perturbation is approximated to maximize the variation of the perturbed policy through a white-box adversarial attack technique. Furthermore, a constrained adversarial actor-critic algorithm is presented to optimize an on-ramp merging policy while keeping the variations of the attacked driving policy and action-value function within bounds. Finally, the proposed robust highway on-ramp merging decision making method of autonomous vehicles is evaluated in three stochastic mixed traffic flows with different densities, and its effectiveness is demonstrated in comparison with the competitive baselines.},

  abstract     = {The bus system is a critical component of sustainable urban transportation. However, the operation of a bus fleet is unstable in nature, and bus bunching has become a common phenomenon that undermines the efficiency and reliability of bus systems. Recently research has demonstrated the promising application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to achieve efficient vehicle holding control to avoid bus bunching. However, existing studies essentially overlook the robustness issue resulting from perturbations and anomalies in a transit system, which is of utmost importance when transferring the models for real-world deployment/application. In this study, we integrate implicit quantile network and meta-learning to develop a distributional MARL framework—IQNC-M—to learn continuous control. The proposed IQNC-M framework achieves efficient and reliable control decisions through better handling various uncertainties in real-time transit operations. Specifically, we introduce an interpretable meta-learning module to incorporate global information into the distributional MARL framework, which is an effective solution to circumvent the credit assignment issue in the transit system. In addition, we design a specific learning procedure to train each agent within the framework to pursue a robust control policy. We develop simulation environments based on real-world bus services and passenger demand data and evaluate the proposed framework against both traditional holding control models and state-of-the-art MARL models. Our results show that the proposed IQNC-M framework can effectively handle the general perturbations and various extreme events, such as traffic state perturbations and demand surges, thus improving both efficiency and reliability of the transit system.},

Along with this trend, a systematic collaboration among three essential elements of smart mobility services, namely devices, data and functions, is being studied to comprehensively break down the intrinsic barriers that existed in current solutions, to support the integration of connectable devices, the fusion of heterogeneous data, the composability of reusable functions, and the flexibility in their cooperations. To enable such a collaboration, this paper proposes a federated platform, called Future Mobility Sensing Advisor (FMSA), which can 1) manage the three elements through standardized interfaces separately and uniformly; 2) create a fully connected knowledge graph to orchestrate the three elements efficiently and effectively; 3) support the client-server interaction in centralized and federated modes to handle service requests and edge resources with various availability and accessibilities jointly and adaptively; and 4) accommodate various mobility services to foster harmonious and sustainable mobility tenderly and invisibly. Moreover, the efficiency and effectiveness of the platform are also tested through a performance evaluation, and a pilot supported at the Great Boston Area, respectively. As a result, it shows that FMSA can 1) achieve high performance by using the two interaction modes selectively, and 2) renovate smart mobility towards sustainability through personalized services that can measure user preferences and system objectives mutually.},

Furthermore, to address the rapid model deployment, this paper proposes a calculation method for the minimum number of supplements based on domain differences. The method selects the fewest images from the target domain scene and realizes the rapid deployment of the model through further annotation and training.

The drone actively reacts to the wind adopting the “most tailwind” trajectory available between the truck’s path and the delivery. The truck moves on a predefined route and carries the drone close to the delivery point. We propose the Minimum-energy Drone-trajectory Problem (MDP) which aims, when the wind affects the delivery area, at planning minimum-energy trajectories for the drone to serve the customers starting from and returning to the truck. We then propose two algorithms that optimally solve MDP under two different routes of the truck. We also analytically study the feasibility of sending drones with limited battery to deliver packages. Finally, we first numerically compare our algorithms on randomly generated synthetic and real data, and then we evaluate our model simulating the drone’s flight in the BlueSky simulator.},

  abstract     = {Pseudo-LiDAR based stereo 3D detectors have gained popularity due to their high accuracy. However, these methods need dense depth supervision and suffer from inferior speed. To solve these two issues, a recently introduced RTS3D builds an efficient 4D feature-consistency embedding (FCE) space for the object intermediate representation without depth supervision, where FCE space performs uniform sampling to generate feature sampling points, which ignores the importance of different object regions. In this paper, we observe that, compared with the inner region, the outer region of the object plays a more important role for accurate 3D detection. To fully exploit the useful information from the outer region, we propose a novel shape-aware non-uniform sampling strategy. Instead of uniform sampling, our proposed non-uniform sampling strategy performs dense sampling in outer region and sparse sampling in inner region. Therefore, more points are sampled from the outer region and more useful features are extracted for 3D detection. In addition, we design a high-level semantic enhanced FCE module to exploit more contextual information and suppress noise better. As a result, it further improves feature discrimination of each sampling point. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the baseline RTS3D, our proposed method has 2.57% improvement on car AP &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$_{3d}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; almost without extra network parameters.

  abstract     = {In smart factories, a variety of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) communicate with cyber-physical systems (CPSs) to autonomously deliver raw materials and workpieces among smart production facilities. In practice, instead of acquiring more costly AGVs to cause congestion in existing working space, most factories develop rule-based and model-based approaches to improve the AGV utilization rate and further the production efficiency. However, these charging strategies require predefined rules or models for estimating the internal information of batteries, so that they lead to huge computational costs and estimation errors. As a consequence, this work creates a Markov decision process problem for real-time charging scheduling of AGVs to fulfill uncertain AGV dispatching requests from the CPS for production lines, in which four bounds for charging heterogeneous AGVs are considered from practical experiences for increasing the AGV utilization rate. This work further improves a feature-based reinforcement learning approach, in which the state and action space can be effectively reduced through approximating the state-value function by five feature functions, including the estimated revenue for improving the utilization time, the total AGV charging cost, the cost of penalizing unfulfilled dispatching requests, the priority of charging newer batteries, and the priority of charging the batteries close to be fully charged, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm obtains better benefits than the current practical approach, and improves the AGV utilization rate.},

  abstract     = {For automated driving vehicles, trajectory planning is responsible for obtaining feasible trajectories with velocity profiles according to driving environments. From the perspective of trajectory planning, multiple uncertainties of environments and tracking deviations are two significant factors affecting driving safety. The former disturbs the judgment of trajectory planning on the environments, and the latter reduces the tracking accuracy of planned trajectories. To solve these problems, an improved model predictive control (MPC) trajectory planning method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a Kalman filter fusion method is carried out to predict obstacle trajectory and their uncertainty, which combines model-based and data-based prediction methods. Based on the prediction results, a tube-based MPC trajectory planning method is applied to plan a reference trajectory with a small tracking deviation. The tube-based MPC is composed of two parts. One is the MPC with tightened constraints that is used to plan a feasible trajectory according to a nominal vehicle system and driving environment. The other is a state feedback control that is proposed to adjust the above planned trajectory to reduce the tracking deviations. To our knowledge, this paper proposes Kalman filter fusion and tube-based MPC planning method for the first time to consider the uncertainties of trajectory prediction and tracking control meanwhile in the planning. The planning method is verified by simulations and experiments in multiple scenes. Results show that the method is suitable for both static and dynamic scenes. Compared with applying the basic prediction method, the lateral deviation of the proposed method from the ideal trajectory is decreased by 46.5%. Compared with the nominal MPC method, the lateral tracking deviations of the proposed method are decreased by 77.42%.},

To proceed, resorting to estimation results, an elliptical encircling guidance rule with a time-varying radius is established to preserve circumnavigation concerning targets. At the kinetic level, a new fuel-saving uncertainty mitigation scheme, i.e., event-triggered unknown system dynamics estimators (ETUSDEs) with the feature of a reduced transmission load and a concise structure are respectively developed in velocity and angular rate subsystems to reconstruct uncertainties with a prescribed decaying rate, where event-triggering conditions are enforced to schedule updating frequency of actuators and measurements in an aperiodic manner instead of a fixed time interval. Then, an event-triggered robust kinetic control protocol is synthesized to achieve an accurate command tracking without incurring Zeno behaviors.

  abstract     = {The potential functions (PFs) have generally shown good performances in real-time path planning with computation efficiency conforming to the requirements of lower control systems in autonomous driving. However, several inherent limitations exist in using the PFs, including a local minimum in specific scenarios and no passage between closely spaced obstacles. Recent studies have focused on conventional scenarios where PFs are assumed to work normally, without malfunctioning, occurring during perilous situations. Therefore, we propose a specific safety tunnel (ST)-based model predictive controller (MPC) combined with PFs (PF-STMPC) to handle path-planning in extreme-emergency traffic scenarios (e.g., emergency braking and lane-changing obstacles). To further guarantee driving safety, we improve PFs with the responsibility-sensitive safety (RSS) model that accurately calculates the minimum safe longitudinal and lateral distances. Furthermore, a sigmoid-based ST is designed for emergency navigation if the PFs fail to plan a safe path due to the aforementioned inherent limitations, enabling the controller with planning functionality if necessary. The ST is embedded in the MPC-based tracking controller as a safe constraint sensitive to surrounding environments (e.g., road structure and obstacles).

Compared with the state-of-the-art method, the proposed method demonstrated better performance in finding a safe path and eliminating severe yawing of the ego-vehicle (82.8% less in sideslip yawing amplitude and 57.7% shorter in the oscillation period of yaw angle) when facing traffic emergencies.},

  abstract     = {Self-driving vehicles promise many safety, mobility, and environmental benefits. However, users’ lack of trust and acceptance may threaten the success and potential of this technology. Monitoring the driver’s emotional state is one way to address this challenge. Empathetic automation can respond to the driver’s state and improve the experience and acceptance of self-driving vehicle drivers. In this study, 24 participants rode in a self-driving vehicle simulator and experienced three automation styles (aggressive, moderate, conservative) and four intersection types (with and without a stop sign, and with and without traffic.) We identified the observed drivers’ emotions from the video data and labeled the video frames using the dimensional and discrete emotion models to examine how automation behavior affects the driver’s emotional state. We used multilevel Bayesian linear regression and multilevel Dirichlet regression to model the continuous and discrete emotions, respectively. The automation driving style effect varied for each participant. The same conditions provoked positive responses for some participants, and negative for others. Furthermore, the results showed that intersection type, the position within the intersection, and their interaction affected the driver’s emotional state. This indicates that personalized driver state monitoring systems might enhance drivers’ experience in self-driving vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Loop closure detection (LCD) is an indispensable module in simultaneous localization and mapping. It is responsible to recognize pre-visited areas during the navigation of a robot, providing auxiliary information to revise pose estimation. Unlike most current methods which focus on seeking an appropriate representation of images, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline dominated by the estimation of spatial geometric relationship. Specifically, to avoid unnecessary memory costs, consecutive images are segmented into sequences as per the similarity of their global features. Then the sequence descriptor is incrementally inserted into hierarchical navigable small world for the construction of reference database, from which the most similar image for the query one is searched parallelly. To further identify whether the candidate pair is geometry-consistent, a feature matching method termed as bidirectional manifold representation consensus (BMRC) is proposed. It constructs local neighborhood structures of feature points via manifold representation, and formulates the matching problem into an optimization model, enabling linearithmic time complexity via a closed-form solution. Meanwhile, an accelerated version of it is introduced (BMRC*), which performs about 63% faster than BMRC in an image pair with 352 initial correspondences. Extensive experiments on nine publicly available datasets demonstrate that BMRC and BMRC* perform well in feature matching and the proposed pipeline has remarkable performance in the LCD task.},

In this paper, we propose a learning based intelligent train regulation method with dynamic passenger flow prediction. To capture the characteristics of the dynamic metro passenger flow, a convolutional neural network is established to predict the real-time passenger flow from two dimensions including space and time. As the prediction accuracy is restricted by the insufficiency of the practical passenger flow data, a deep convolutional generative adversarial network is constructed to generate data that have the same distribution as the original passenger flow dataset. Then, by considering the effects of the dynamic passenger flow on the train operation and the train capacity constraints, the dynamic train regulation is formulated as a multi-stage optimal control problem with the objective function of minimizing the train traction energy consumption and the total traveling time of passengers. To efficiently obtain the optimal regulation strategy at each decision step, a deep Q-network algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated problem such the dimensionality curse caused by the excessive state space is avoided. The numerical experiments demonstrate the high efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and model.},

  abstract     = {Traffic problems continue to deteriorate because of increasing population in urban areas that rely on many modes of transportation, the transportation infrastructure has achieved considerable strides in the last several decades. This has led to an increase in congestion control difficulties, which directly affect citizens through air pollution, fuel consumption, traffic law breaches, noise pollution, accidents, and loss of time. Traffic prediction is an essential aspect of an intelligent transportation system in smart cities because it helps reduce overall traffic congestion. This article aims to design and enforce a traffic prediction scheme that is efficient and accurate in forecasting traffic flow. Available traffic flow prediction methods are still unsuitable for real-world applications. This fact motivated us to work on a traffic flow forecasting issue using Vision Transformers (VTs). In this work, VTs were used in conjunction with Convolutional neural networks (CNN) to predict traffic congestion in urban spaces on a city-wide scale. In our proposed architecture, a traffic image is fed to a CNN, which generates feature maps. These feature maps are then fed to the VT, which employs the dual techniques of tokenization and projection. Tokenization is used to convert features into tokens containing Vision information, which are then sent to projection, where they are transformed into feature maps and ultimately delivered to LSTM. The experimental results demonstrate that the vision transformer prediction method based on Spatio-temporal characteristics is an excellent way of predicting traffic flow, particularly during anomalous traffic situations. The proposed technology surpasses traditional methods in terms of precision, accuracy and recall and aids in energy conservation. Through rerouting, the proposed work will benefit travellers and reduce fuel use.},

  abstract     = {Infrastructure-enabled autonomous driving systems have been increasingly applied in confined environments. Automated valet parking (AVP) in smart parking garages is one of the notable applications that require high-precision indoor positioning services. However, the performances of the existing wireless indoor positioning techniques, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ultra-wideband (UWB), tend to decline substantially as the working time increases and the building environment varies. In this paper, we propose a lifelong framework using crowdsourced data of fully instrumented autonomous vehicles(e.g. vehicles equipping with LiDAR), to maintain the availability and precision of indoor positioning systems. We establish a map-aided deep learning positioning correction model based on continuous data sequences, which utilizes convolution and long short-term memory (LSTM) modules to extract the spatial and temporal features of positioning errors. A local grid map generator is designed and embedded into the correction model to learn the influencing factors of errors from the building environment and facility. A deep-learning-based anomaly detector is designed to keep the lifelong stability of our framework. Based on the proposed method, we develop a lifelong UWB positioning correction system and apply it for the path tracking of AVP in a real underground parking garage. The test results show that the system can maintain positioning correction precision in the environment of varying sensor errors and reduce the positioning error by 60% and the tracking error by 40%. The study showcases an innovative infrastructure-enabled application that can accelerate the widespread use of autonomous driving systems.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow forecasting is crucial to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), particularly for route planning and traffic management. Spatiotemporal graph neural networks have been widely used for this purpose, where a global graph structure is mainly used, but local graph features are ignored. Multi-scale spatiotemporal features—the combined application of global and local graph features—can help effectively discover the underlying spatiotemporal patterns. This study proposed a multi-scale adaptive spatiotemporal forecasting model called Adaptive SpatioTemporal InceptionNet (AST-InceptionNet). To enrich the captured features and extract multi-scale spatiotemporal ones, the inception part is applied to combine local spatiotemporal features with several global ones. Additionally, we developed a fully adaptive graph convolution method, including topologically adaptive graph convolution and an adaptive adjacency matrix. It can autonomously and dynamically learn spatial heterogeneity and enable the proposed model to work with unknown adjacency relations. The proficiency of AST-InceptionNet was validated using four publicly available real-world traffic flow datasets. The experiments demonstrate a satisfactory performance from the proposed model, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by up to approximately 12%.},

  abstract     = {The electrification of shared mobility has become popular across the globe. Many cities have their new shared e-mobility systems deployed, with continuously expanding coverage from central areas to the city edges. A key challenge in the operation of these systems is fleet rebalancing, i.e., how EVs should be repositioned to better satisfy future demand. This is particularly challenging in the context of expanding systems, because i) the range of the EVs is limited while charging time is typically long, which constrain the viable rebalancing operations; and ii) the EV stations in the system are dynamically changing, i.e., the legitimate targets for rebalancing operations can vary over time. We tackle these challenges by first investigating rich sets of data collected from a real-world shared e-mobility system for one year, analyzing the operation model, usage patterns and expansion dynamics of this new mobility mode. With the learned knowledge we design a high-fidelity simulator, which is able to abstract key operation details of EV sharing at fine granularity. Then we model the rebalancing task for shared e-mobility systems under continuous expansion as a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem, which directly takes the range and charging properties of the EVs into account. We further propose a novel policy optimization approach with action cascading, which is able to cope with the expansion dynamics and solve the formulated MARL. We evaluate the proposed approach extensively, and experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, offering significant performance gain in both satisfied demand and net revenue.},

To overcome the problems, we propose a hierarchical traffic flow forecasting network by merging newly designed the long-term temporal Transformer network (LTT) and the spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (STGC). Specifically, LTT aims to learn the long-term temporal relations among the traffic flow data, while the STGC module aims to capture the short-term temporal relations and spatial relations among the traffic flow data, respectively, via cascading between the one-dimensional convolution and the graph convolution. In addition, an attention fusion mechanism is proposed to combine the long-term with the short-term temporal relations as the input of the graph convolution layer in STGC, in order to mitigate the over-smoothing problem of GCN.

These traffic models consist of many adjustable parameters which need to be calibrated before they are used in practice. This paper focuses on the offline calibration of origin-destination (OD) input parameters of a simulation-based traffic model to match its output with sensor data. An improved Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm called Metamodel Assisted Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (MSPSA) is proposed in this paper to calibrate high-dimensional OD parameters within a tight computational budget. The proposed MSPSA combines the gradient of SPSA with the gradient of a differentiable metamodel function to improve the calibration efficiency. An integer program is also used to fine-tune the OD estimates. The proposed MSPSA algorithm is tested on a simple synthetic toy network and complex road network of Kuala Lumpur (KL), Malaysia. The proposed MSPSA algorithm is compared against SPSA and state-of-the-art Weighted Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (WSPSA) in both transportation networks. For KL network, synthetic and real-world sensor measurements are used as ground truth references to evaluate the performance of each approach. Based on the simulation results, the proposed MSPSA algorithm is able to gain at least 50% of improvement as compared to SPSA and WSPSA in both synthetic and real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Accurate transit arrival time prediction is a critical factor for improving the quality of transit services. A significant factor that can affect transit arrival times is the other vehicles traveling on transit routes, as transit arrival time is significantly affected by traffic conditions. However, few previous studies considered traffic condition impacts in transit arrival time prediction due to a lack of real-time traffic data, reducing the accuracy in predictions under varying traffic conditions. To fill this research gap, crowdsourced speed data with wide coverage is utilized to indicate traffic conditions and to predict transit arrival time in conjunction with General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data. Interaction Networks (INs) are employed to model the interactions between transit speed, dwell time, and traffic speed for arrival time prediction. The proposed method only uses limited historical data and can predict arrival time at stops along a transit route. Ten days of data were collected from bus route #4 in Tucson, Arizona to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The evaluation results show the average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of predicted arrival time on weekdays and weekends is 13.5% and 14%, respectively, indicating that the proposed method is promising for predicting transit arrival time while considering real-time traffic conditions. Furthermore, six traditional methods are compared with the proposed method, and the comparison results show the proposed method outperforms the other six methods.},

  abstract     = {Since both visible and infrared images have their own advantages and disadvantages, RGBT tracking plays an important role in intelligent transportation systems. The key points of RGBT tracking lie in feature extraction and fusion of visible and infrared images. Current RGBT tracking methods mostly pay attention to both individual features (features extracted from images of a single camera) and common features (features extracted and fused from an RGB camera and a thermal camera). Still, they pay less attention to different and dynamic contributions of the individual and common features for different sequences of registered image pairs. This paper proposes a novel RGBT tracking method, called Dynamic Fusion Network (DFNet), which adopts a two-stream structure, in which two non-shared convolution kernels are employed in each layer to extract individual features. Besides, DFNet has shared convolution kernels for each layer to extract common features. Since non-shared and shared convolution kernels are adaptively weighted and summed according to different image pairs, DFNet can deal with different contributions for different sequences. DFNet has a fast speed, which is 28.658 FPS. The experimental results show that when DFNet only increases the Mult-Adds by 0.02% compared with the non-shared-convolution-kernel-based fusion method, Precision Rate (PR) and Success Rate (SR) reach 88.1% and 71.9%, respectively.

In order to tackle the uncertainty input covariance and sensor failures problems, a learnable observation model is introduced by joining the Type-2 FIS and factor graph optimization. In particular, the use of Type-2 Takagi-Sugeno FIS can learn the uncertainty by using particle swarm optimization before adding the observation model to the factor graph. The proposed design consists of four parts: sensor odometry, up-sampling, FIS based-learning observation model, and factor graph-based smoothing. We evaluate our system by using a mobile robot platform equipped with a sensor setup of multiple stereo cameras, an IMU, and a LiDAR sensor. We imitate the LiDAR odometry in structure environments without needing other bulky motion capture systems to learn the observation model of the visual-inertial estimators. The experimental results are deployed in real-world environments to present the accuracy and robustness of the algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Travel mode choice prediction is critical for travel demand prediction, which influences transport resource allocation and transport policies. Travel modes are often characterised by severe class imbalance and inequality, which leads to the inferior predictive performance of minority modes and bias in travel demand prediction. In existing studies, the class imbalance in travel mode prediction has not been addressed with a general approach. Basic resampling methods were adopted without much investigation, and the performance was assessed by commonly used metrics (e.g., accuracy), which is not suitable for predicting highly imbalanced modes. To this end, this paper proposes an evaluation framework to systematically investigate the combination of six over/undersampling techniques and three prediction methods. In a case study using the London Passenger Mode Choice dataset, results show that applying over/undersampling techniques on travel mode substantially improves the F1 score (i.e., the harmonic mean of precision and recall) of minority classes, without considerably downgrading the overall prediction performance or model interpretation. These findings suggest that combining over/undersampling techniques and statistical/machine-learning methods is appropriate for predicting travel mode, which effectively mitigates the influence of class imbalance while achieving high predictive accuracy and model interpretation. In addition, the combination of over/undersampling techniques and prediction methods enriches the model options for predicting mode choice, which would better support transport planning.},

  abstract     = {Due to the continuing colossal socio-economic losses caused by traffic accidents, it is of prime importance to precisely forecast the traffic accident risk to reduce future accidents. In this paper, we use dangerous driving statistics from driving log data and multi-graph learning to enhance predictive performance. We first conduct geographical and temporal correlation analyses to quantify the relationship between dangerous driving and actual accidents. Then, to learn various dependencies between districts besides the traditional adjacency matrix, we simultaneously model both static and dynamic graphs representing the spatio-temporal contextual relationships with heterogeneous environmental data, including the dangerous driving behavior. A graph is generated for each type of the relationships. Ultimately, we propose an end-to-end framework, called MG-TAR, to effectively learn the association of multiple graphs for accident risk prediction by adopting multi-view graph neural networks with a multi-attention module. Thorough experiments on ten real-world datasets show that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, MG-TAR reduces the error of predicting the accident risk by up to 23% and improves the accuracy of predicting the most dangerous areas by up to 27%.},

As the foundation to achieve such an optimization, a parking occupancy prediction method is required to address the emerging challenges of training a simple but effective model. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a novel approach that enables the integration of Time Series Decomposition (TSD), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and First-order Model-agnostic Meta-learning (FOMAML) for feature engineering, model building, and model pre-training, respectively. Moreover, as shown by a detailed evaluation, such an integration strengthens the proposed approach, named Meta TSD-GRU, which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with 1) prediction errors reduced by about 45% on average, 2) the speed of model adaptation and convergence improved about 2 and 102 times against the methods with and without pre-training, respectively, and 3) the generalizability of the model enhanced to handle various time intervals of forecasting and types of parking lots under a consistent and stable performance.},

While swift vaccine development and distribution have arrested the infection spread rate, it is necessary to design public policies that inform human mobility to curb outbreaks from future strains of the virus. While existing non-pharmaceutical approaches employing network science and machine learning offer promising travel policy solutions, they are guided by epidemiological and economic considerations alone and not human itineraries. We introduce an evolutionary algorithm (EA) based mobility scheduler that incorporates the personalized itineraries of individuals to determine the ideal timing of their mobility. We mathematically analyze the computational efficiency versus the optimality trade-off of the mobility scheduler. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the EA-based mobility scheduler can balance the trade-off between (1) optimality and computational cost and (2) fair and preferential human mobility while reducing contagion under lockdown and no-lockdown as well as even and uneven human mobility traffic scenarios. We show that for two human mobility models, the scheduler exhibits lower infection numbers than a baseline trip-planning approach that directs human traffic along the least congested route to minimize contagion. We discuss that the EA scheduler lends itself to intricate mobility schedules of multiple destination choices with varying priorities and socioeconomic and demographic considerations.},

In recent years, blockchain has been widely adopted in supply chain traceability to provide transparency and authenticity, while the efficiency issue is understudied. In practice, as the numerous product records accumulate, the time- and storage- efficiencies will decrease remarkably. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work studying the efficiency issue in blockchain-based supply chain traceability. Compared to the traditional method, which searches the records stored in a single chunk sequentially, we replicate the records in multiple chunks and employ parallel search to boost the time efficiency. However, allocating the record searching primitives to the chunks with maximized parallelization ratio is challenging. To this end, we model the records and chunks as a bipartite graph and solve the allocation problem using a maximum matching algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the time overhead can be reduced by up to 85.1% with affordable storage overhead.},

However, the validity of driving behavior data derived from driving simulators remains unclear. In this study, 30 Chinese drivers were recruited to participate in two experiments: on-road and simulator experiments. An instrumented vehicle and a high-fidelity simulator were used in the on-road and simulator experiments, respectively, to investigate the effects of high speed (60, 80, and 100 km/h) and a visual distraction task on the lateral driving performance, including lane deviation (LD), standard deviation of the lane position (SDLP) rate, standard deviation of the steering wheel angle (SDSWA) rate, and steering wheel reversal rates (SRRs) (at levels of 1.3° and 2.5°). It was found that the visual distraction task impaired the drivers’ lane-keeping ability. Furthermore, the driving task had similar effects on the LD, SDLP rate, and SRRs (2.5°) in the on-road and simulator experiments. The effects of the driving speed on the LD, SDLP rate, and SDSWA rate were comparable in both driving environments. However, the results confirmed that even a high-fidelity driving simulator could not achieve perfect absolute validity. The results provided preliminary evidence that the high-fidelity driving simulator used in this study might be an effective tool for investigating the effects of visual distractions task on lateral driving behavior.},

In this study, a short-term traffic speed prediction method based on the spatial-temporal analysis of traffic flow and a combined deep-learning model, and a hybrid spatial-temporal feature selection algorithm (STFSA) of a convolutional neural network–gated recurrent unit (CNN-GRU)) is initially developed. Specifically, the STFSA is firstly employed to reconstruct the spatial-temporal matrix of traffic speed based on temporal continuity and spatial characteristics, and then this matrix is considered as the input feature of the prediction model. After this, the nonlinear fitting ability of the CNN is adopted to extract deep features from the convolutional and pooling layers for model training. Finally, by combining the timing and long-range dependence of the captured data with the forward GRU and the reverse GRU, the accuracy of the prediction result is further improved. The validity of the proposed model can be verified by comparing the prediction results with the actual traffic data. Accordingly, in the case study, the performance is compared with various benchmark methods under the same prediction scenario, verifying the superiority of the proposed model.},

First, we establish a comprehensive MTP model for AUVs, by taking into account the complex underwater environments, the efficiency of each trajectory, and the diversity among different trajectories, simultaneously. Then, to solve the MTP, we develop an ant colony-based trajectory optimizer, which is characterized by a niching strategy, a decayed alarm pheromone measure, and a diversified heuristic measure. The niching strategy assists in identifying and maintaining a diverse set of high-quality solutions. The use of decayed alarm pheromone and diversified heuristic further improves the search effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm. Experimental results on practical datasets show that our proposed algorithm not only provides multiple AUV trajectories for a flexible choice, but it also outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the single trajectory efficiency.},

It has been recognized as a vital alternative form of transportation between public and private transportations in future sustainable cities. Constrained by the long charging time and limited driving range of EVs, an operator of an EMoD system demands for decision-making models and algorithms to manage the mobility and energy of EVs to best serve customers with least costs. In this paper, we propose a stochastic dynamic program (DP) to model three operational decisions of the EMoD system: i) dispatching EVs to serve mobility demand from customers, ii) repositioning EVs to accommodate the unbalanced mobility demands between service regions, and iii) recharging EVs to maintain their sufficient state-of-charge levels. To handle this large-scale DP problem, we first observe and prove that it has a coordinate-wise concave value function. Based on this structural property, we propose to use a separable piecewise linear function to approximate the value function and design an approximation-based algorithm to efficiently derive the decision policy. Numerical tests show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the existing model-free approaches (e.g., greedy heuristic and Q-learning) that fail to take into account the structural properties of the DP problem.},

This model uses as input track geometry data and train characteristics like mass, the parameters that model the running resistance, the maximum tractive effort and power, and the brake rates to be applied. It can reproduce and predict train dynamics accurately if the mentioned train characteristics are carefully calibrated. The model constitutes the core element of a broad variety of railway applications, from timetabling tools to Driver Advisory Systems and Automatic Train Operation. Among the existing train motion model calibration techniques, those that use operational data are of particular interest, as they benefit from on- board recorded data, capturing the train dynamics during operation. In this literature review article we provide an overview of the train motion model calibration techniques that have been published in the scientific literature between January 2000 and December 2021 and either use operational data or can be minimally adapted to use it. To this end, we present a critical overview of the existing train motion model calibration approaches, distinguishing online calibration that analyzes data on- the-go and offline calibration that analyzes historical data batchwise. We propose a research agenda and highlight some potential goals to be tackled in the near future: from devising accurate online calibrators for eco-driving applications to quantitizing the physical sources of parameter variation. Last, we discuss practical recommendations for practitioners and scholars inferred from the current state of the art.},

  abstract     = {Surround-view fisheye cameras are commonly used for near-field sensing in automated driving. Four fisheye cameras on four sides of the vehicle are sufficient to cover 360° around the vehicle capturing the entire near-field region. Some primary use cases are automated parking, traffic jam assist, and urban driving. There are limited datasets and very little work on near-field perception tasks as the focus in automotive perception is on far-field perception. In contrast to far-field, surround-view perception poses additional challenges due to high precision object detection requirements of 10cm and partial visibility of objects. Due to the large radial distortion of fisheye cameras, standard algorithms cannot be extended easily to the surround-view use case.

  abstract     = {The arrival of autonomous vehicles (AVs) promises many great benefits, including increased safety and reduced energy consumption, pollution, and congestion. However, these engines have many security and privacy issues that could undermine the expected benefits if not addressed. AVs will provide new opportunities for hackers to carry out malicious attacks, posing a great threat to the future of mobility and data protection. The research trend in this field indicates that combining Blockchain and AI could bring strong protection for AVs against malicious attacks. Blockchain and AI have different working paradigms, but when merged, they can empower each other, and solve many security and privacy issues of AVs. AI can optimise the construction of the Blockchain to make it more efficient, secure and energy-saving, where Blockchain provides data immutability and trust mechanism for AI-based solutions and makes them more transparent, trustful, and explainable. Although some research is being conducted on this area, the topic of applying Blockchain and AI for securing AVs is not deeply investigated. In this paper, we explore the possible application of an amalgamation of Blockchain and AI solutions for securing AVs. We first introduce a classification of security and privacy threats that may arise from the application of AVs. Then, we provide an overview of recent literature regarding Blockchain and AI usage for securing AVs. Finally, we highlight limitations and challenges that may face the integration of Blockchain and AI with AVs based on our systemic review and suggest potential future directions for research in this field.},

This problem is new and non-trivial due to its nature of mixed integer programming. The key idea behind the new algorithm is that we interpret the possible waypoints of the UAV as location-dependent tasks to incorporate routing and sensing in one task selection process. Another critical aspect is that we construct a new task-time graph to describe the process, where each vertex corresponds to a task associated with its location, time and reward, and each edge indicates the propulsion energy required for the UAV to travel between two tasks. By redistributing the weight of a vertex to its incoming edges, the new UAV routing and sensing task selection problem can be converted to a weighted routing problem in the new task-time graph and solved optimally using the Bellman-Ford algorithm. Validated by a real-world case study, our approach can outperform its alternatives by over 18% in task reward.},

To use the convenient ridesharing service, riders and drivers have to share with the service provider their private trip information, which impedes users from freely enjoying the benefits of ridesharing. However, existing studies in ridesharing mainly focus on the optimization of rider-driver matching but ignore the protection of privacy of users. In this paper, we propose P2Ride, a Practical and Privacy-preserving Ride-matching scheme for ridesharing, which enables the service provider to efficiently match drivers with appropriate riders without learning the privacy of both drivers and riders. In P2Ride, we first convert the complex ride-matching computation into equality testing by leveraging overlapping partition systems, and then achieve the privacy-preserving ride-matching by designing a novel non-interactive private equality testing protocol. We prove the security of the proposed P2Ride theoretically. Moreover, a prototype of the P2Ride is implemented, and the experiment results over a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed P2Ride can achieve both high ride-matching accuracy and practical efficiency.},

To improve the ability of the coupled system to resist attacks, this paper presents the framework of coupled transportation and cyber-physical power system with a defense mechanism. From a defense perspective, considering comprehensive load shedding loss of load buses, an active defense model driven by static Bayesian game theory is built at the information network (IN) level of CPPS, which provides a defense strategy selection method against attacks at a certain moment. Moreover, a charging guidance model for EVs based on dynamic vehicles travel simulation is developed to describe the impact of charging station (CS) outage induced by the unsuccessful defense, and to mitigate disturbance on the TN.

  abstract     = {The parking lot is one of the important components of the intelligent transportation system (ITS). The current parking lots mainly use instant parking, which has low parking efficiency, during peak hours, which leads to traffic congestion. To guarantee the stable operation of parking lots, we propose a blockchain-enabled parking reservation framework, called BPR. Traditional parking reservation systems may exist the condition of malicious reservations, and resulting in wasted parking spaces. Therefore, we design a reputation mechanism to manage the parking reservation behavior of vehicles and reduce the number of malicious nodes. In addition, to balance the performance of the blockchain at different times (especially during peak hours), we use deep learning (DL) to dynamically adjust the block size to make the blockchain run more efficiently and stably. We deploy the system in Hyperledger Fabric and conduct effectiveness experiments. The comprehensive evaluation results and analysis show that the proposed reputation mechanism can effectively curb malicious nodes from reserving parking spaces and reduce the waste of parking resources. And the block size will be dynamically adjusted to balance the performance of the blockchain at different periods, this method is also applicable to other blockchain performance-sensitive scenes.

  abstract     = {Potential fields have been integrated with local path-planning algorithms for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to tackle challenging scenarios with dense and dynamic obstacles. Most existing potential fields are isotropic without considering the traffic agent’s geometric shape and could cause failures due to local minima. We propose a three-dimensional potential field (TriPField) model to overcome this drawback by integrating an ellipsoid potential field with a Gaussian velocity field (GVF). Specifically, we model the surrounding vehicles as ellipsoids in corresponding ellipsoidal coordinates, where the formulated Laplace equation is solved with boundary conditions. Meanwhile, we develop a nonparametric GVF to capture the multi-vehicle interactions and then plan the AV’s velocity profiles, reducing the path search space and improving computing efficiency. Finally, a local path-planning framework with our TriPField is developed by integrating model predictive control to consider the constraints of vehicle kinematics. Our proposed approach is verified in three typical scenarios, i.e., active lane change, on-ramp merging, and car following. Experimental results show that our TriPField-based planner obtains a shorter, smoother local path with a slight jerk during control, especially in the scenarios with dense traffic flow, compared with traditional potential field-based planners. Our proposed TriPField-based planner can perform emergent obstacle avoidance for AVs with a high success rate even when the surrounding vehicles behave abnormally.},

Although the protection of model intellectual property by watermark has received much research attention, the existing works only deploy watermark in centralized models. Due to the difference of watermark distribution among vehicles, the global model accuracy of watermark in federated learning is significantly reduced or the local watermark is invalid. To solve these problems, we propose a multi-party entangled watermark algorithm in federated learning. Specifically, in the local training, we propose a watermark enhancement algorithm, which solves the problem of local watermark failure. Then, in the global aggregation, we propose an entanglement aggregation algorithm, which solves the problem of a great loss of global model accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets to show the superiority of our proposal. The results show that our scheme can obtain more than 16% and 31% advantages in model accuracy and watermark success rate, respectively, compared with existing watermark schemes in federated learning.},

However, connectionist AI lacks interpretability and usually needs large amount of data for learning. A Markov logic network (MLN), which combines first-order logic (FOL) with statistical learning, learns weighted FOL formulas for inference. MLNs can incorporate domain expert knowledge in the form of FOL formulas to achieve data-efficient learning and transparent decision process. In this paper, we propose a hybrid driving decision-making system, which integrates a MLN module and a deep Q-network (DQN) for enhanced driving safety. The MLN module evaluates the safety of ranked actions from DQN to reduce potential collisions. A collective MLN (Co-MLN) learning algorithm is proposed and it enables CAVs collectively learn a global MLN model for safe state transitions, given distributed small amount of noisy data. A hybrid DQN-MLN learning algorithm is also developed for CAVs to collectively learn to drive in new driving environments. Simulations performed using a highway driving simulator show that the proposed Co-MLN algorithm is highly data-efficient and the learned hybrid driving system can effectively reduce collisions. In addition, the learned MLN module provides transparency for safety-critical driving decisions.},

This paper proposed a novel prescribed time performance recovery fault tolerant control method to ensure nominal platoon performance under multiple faults, including actuator faults with deferred backup actuator switching and leader-follower link faults in consideration. A novel barrier function based prescribed time sliding mode controller is devised to assure platoon consensus errors and convergence time within prescribed constraints under normal conditions at first. Under multiple faults conditions, to tackle with leader-follower link faults problem, a novel distributed recursive estimator is proposed to estimate the leader’s states and recover the previous leader-follower platooning control protocol in a prescribed time. Besides, in the presence of actuator failures, the nominal constraints violated problem under faults is put into consideration. Owing to the unavoidable deferred actuator replacement time, the previous platoon consensus error constraints are violated and cause platoon performance degradation. Under such circumstances, by exploiting one novel barrier function-based sliding mode controller with an error shifting function, the unfavorable exceeding platoon consensus errors can be recovered into the nominal constraints domains within a prescribed time. Numerical simulations and hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiments are demonstrated to validate the effectiveness and superiority of our performance recovery fault tolerant control algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of vehicles (IoV) has a substantial impact on traffic efficiency improvement and accidents avoidance. Due to restricted resources, vehicles must share observed data with RSUs and other vehicles to execute some time-tolerant computing tasks. However, data provided by vehicles cannot always be trusted due to the presence of attackers. Fake messages could have catastrophic ramifications, such as vehicle collisions. Furthermore, extensive data sharing might cause channel congestion, resulting in the loss of vital messages during delivery. To overcome the aforementioned issues, we propose TRUCON, a blockchain-based trusted data sharing mechanism with congestion control in IoV. Firstly, we propose a Kademlia algorithm-based traffic data forwarding method to control channel congestion state. By adjusting the bucket size and distance threshold, source vehicles can limit the number of reference vehicles forwarded. Secondly, we present a cuckoo filter-based traffic data deduplication and discrimination approach. To avoid repetitive sharing, vehicles and RSUs can check their local filters to verify if the current data report has been shared. Based on the foregoing, we propose a blockchain-based trust management mechanism with congestion control. RSUs serve as full nodes while vehicles are light nodes in the blockchain. Finally, we develop a trust management prototype system with congestion control that incorporates both on-chain and off-chain parts. It signifies that our scheme is both feasible and effective.},

  abstract     = {Self-driving vehicles (SDVs) are becoming reality but still suffer from “long-tail” challenges during natural driving: the SDVs will continually encounter rare, safety-critical cases that may not be included in the dataset they were trained. Some safety-assurance planners solve this problem by being conservative in all possible cases, which may significantly affect driving mobility. To this end, this work proposes a method to automatically adjust the conservative level according to each case’s “long-tail” rate, named dynamically conservative planner (DCP). We first define the “long-tail” rate as an SDV’s confidence to pass a driving case. The rate indicates the probability of safe-critical events and is estimated using the statistics bootstrapped method with historical data. Then, a reinforcement learning-based planner is designed to contain candidate policies with different conservative levels. The final policy is optimized based on the estimated “long-tail” rate. In this way, the DCP is designed to automatically adjust to be more conservative in low-confidence “long-tail” cases while keeping efficient otherwise. The DCP is evaluated in the CARLA simulator using driving cases with “long-tail” distributed training data. The results show that the DCP can accurately estimate the “long-tail” rate to identify potential risks. Based on the rate, the DCP automatically avoids potential collisions in “long-tail” cases using conservative decisions while not affecting the average velocity in other typical cases. Thus, the DCP is safer and more efficient than the baselines with fixed conservative levels, e.g., an always conservative planner. This work provides a technique to guarantee SDV’s performance in unexpected driving cases without resorting to a global conservative setting, which contributes to solving the “long-tail” problem practically.},

In addition, in order to realize the effective fit between the multiple optimization objectives and the actual needs in intelligent driving, the segmented Bezier curve is used to design the vehicle trajectory, and the vehicle trajectory is divided into collision-avoidance process and lane-alignment process, so as to realize the dynamic optimization of trajectory design objectives. The results show that the proposed trajectory and velocity planning method based on segmented three-dimensional quartic Bezier curve can effectively improve the mobility of trajectory planning results, improve lane-changing efficiency and reduce lane-changing time while ensuring the design objectives of vehicle safety, comfort and stability.},

  abstract     = {Using light-weight architectures or reasoning on low-resolution images, recent methods realize very fast scene parsing, even running at more than 100 FPS on a single GPU. However, there is still a significant gap in performance between these real-time methods and the models based on dilation backbones. To this end, we proposed a family of deep dual-resolution networks (DDRNets) for real-time and accurate semantic segmentation, which consist of deep dual-resolution backbones and enhanced low-resolution contextual information extractors. The two deep branches and multiple bilateral fusions of backbones generate higher quality details compared to existing two-pathway methods. The enhanced contextual information extractor named Deep Aggregation Pyramid Pooling Module (DAPPM) enlarges effective receptive fields and fuses multi-scale context based on low-resolution feature maps with little time cost. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and speed on both Cityscapes and CamVid dataset. For the input of full resolution, on a single 2080Ti GPU without hardware acceleration, DDRNet-23-slim yields 77.4% mIoU at 102 FPS on Cityscapes test set and 74.7% mIoU at 230 FPS on CamVid test set. With widely used test augmentation, our method is superior to most state-of-the-art models and requires much less computation.

  abstract     = {Understanding driver response behavior to Connected Vehicle (CV) warnings is one of the fundamental tasks in improving road safety. However, previous studies often used aggregated safety measures and simulation environments to accomplish this task. Consequently, time-dependent driver response behavior under real-world conditions has rarely been investigated. This study proposes a new functional data analysis (FDA) approach to analyze time-dependent driver response behavior to CV warnings obtained from the New York City CV Pilot Deployment (NYC CVPD) project. Sparse functional design that can account for irregularly spaced functional measurements is adopted to accommodate the potential noise contaminated real-world CV data. Functional principal component analysis and nonparametric functional linear regression are used to smooth raw driver behavior profile and estimate time-dependent effect of driver response behavior, respectively. The speed compliance application implemented in the NYC CVPD project is used as the case study. By modeling time series of speed data after receiving warnings as continuous functions, the proposed FDA approach reveals new patterns of driver response behavior over time, such as the diminishing effect of drivers’ speed reduction and the increase in variability of driver response behavior over time, which have rarely been explored using traditional approaches. Moreover, the proposed FDA approach supports the extraction of certain traditional safety measures and has the potential to be generalized to analyze various CV applications. The findings of this study can support the calibration of detailed driver behavior in CV environments and facilitate better CV application design and further investigation of the benefits of CVs.},

These problems are essential in many real-world tasks such as video surveillance, traffic monitoring, public security, and urban planning, to aid intelligent transportation systems. Unlike existing auxiliary task learning-based methods, we develop an attention-enhanced adaptively shared backbone network to enable both task-shared and task-tailored features that are learned in an end-to-end manner. The network seamlessly combines a standard Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) for feature extraction and feature reasoning among different domains of tasks. Our approach gains enriched contextual information by iteratively and hierarchically fusing features across different task branches of the adaptive CNN backbone. The whole framework pays special attention to objects’ spatial locations and varied density levels, informed by object (or crowd) segmentation and density level segmentation auxiliary tasks. In particular, thanks to the proposed dilated contrastive density loss function, our network benefits from individual and regional context supervision, along with strengthened robustness. Experiments on six challenging multi-domain datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art auxiliary task learning-based counting methods.

  abstract     = {Understanding driver-vehicle interactions remains a challenge, particularly in the case of cornering. This is particularly the case for powered two-wheeler vehicle (PTWs) users, perhaps because PTW drivers play a greater role in controlling the stability of their vehicles than do four-wheeled vehicle drivers. This difficulty stems from the variety of practices of this population of road users when entering, controlling their path, and exiting turns. Thus, observing the evolution of rider behavior during a cornering maneuver is an essential step in identifying road environment features that are risk factors for this category of road users. The real data set used for the experiments reported here was collected in the framework of the VIROLO++ collaborative project to improve the knowledge of the real practices of PTWs drivers, particularly during cornering. The in-depth analysis of these data in order to better understand motorcyclists’ behavior can therefore be considered a challenge. For this purpose, a two-step methodology was applied: (1) a data segmentation and feature extraction step in which the multidimensional time series of roll angle and roll velocity data were segmented using a multiple regression hidden logistic process (MRHLP), and (2) a clustering step in which the two detected segments characterizing the curve entry were assigned to different clusters regarding the curve initiation and the control actions set up during the different phases of the turning maneuver based on the hierarchical clustering algorithm. The results obtained show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {Person re-identification (re-ID) has many applications in intelligent transportation systems. Clustering-based methods, which alternate between the generation of pseudo labels via clustering and the optimization of the feature extractor, have obtained leading performance in unsupervised person re-ID. But there are still two issues not well addressed: 1) Most methods measure the feature similarity without considering the domain shift between cameras, degrading the clustering performance. 2) Outliers, which usually correspond to hard samples with large discrepancy from other images of the identical person, are in most cases directly excluded from the network training. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a plug-and-play pseudo label rectification framework, which jointly utilizes CAmera Shift adapTation module and Outlier progressive Recycling strategy ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$CASTOR$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ) to improve the quality of pseudo labels from both pre-clustering and post-clustering. Specifically, we first compute the camera similarity of two samples by utilizing a pretrained camera classification network and subtract the feature similarity by the camera similarity, the value of which is weighted in an exponential decay manner throughout the network training, in order to adaptively remedy the adverse impact of inter-camera distribution shift upon clustering. Besides, we carefully design an outlier progressive recycling strategy to reassign part of the outliers into the clustered groups to make full use of the useful information of outliers. Extensive experiments on three large scale unsupervised and unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) person re-ID benchmarks validate the effectiveness of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$CASTOR$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; and its wide compatibility with the state-of-the-art clustering-based methods.},

  abstract     = {Driver identification has been popular in the field of driving behavior analysis, which has a broad range of applications in anti-thief, driving style recognition, insurance strategy, and fleet management. However, most studies to date have only researched driver identification without a robust verification stage. This paper addresses driver identification and verification through a deep learning (DL) approach using psychological behavioral data, i.e., vehicle control operation data and eye movement data collected from a driving simulator and an eye tracker, respectively. We design an architecture that analyzes the segmentation windows of three-second data to capture unique driving characteristics and then differentiate drivers on that basis. The proposed model includes a fully convolutional network (FCN) and a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block. Experimental results were obtained from 24 human participants driving in 12 different scenarios. The proposed driver identification system achieves an accuracy of 99.60% out of 15 drivers. To tackle driver verification, we combine the proposed architecture and a Siamese neural network, and then map all behavioral data into two embedding layers for similarity computation. The identification system achieves significant performance with average precision of 96.91%, recall of 95.80%, F1 score of 96.29%, and accuracy of 96.39%, respectively. Importantly, we scale out the verification system to imposter detection and achieve an average verification accuracy of 90.91%. These results imply the invariable characteristics from human factors rather than other traditional resources, which provides a superior solution for driving behavior authentication systems.},

It is well known that centralized communication of the desired trajectory is important to simultaneously guarantee both string stability and constant-spacing in platoons. However, the performance of the resulting connected vehicle system (CVS) is vulnerable to large communication delays and communication loss. The main contribution of this work is a new delayed-self-reinforcement-based (DSR-based) approach that approximates the centralized communication based control by a decentralized predecessor follower (PF) control. The resulting blending of centralized communication with the decentralized DSR approach results in predecessor-leader follower (PLF) control with (i) robustness of the convergence to consensus under large communication delays and (ii) substantially-smaller spacing errors under loss of communication. Comparative simulations show that, for the same level of robustness to internal-stability and string-stability, the variation in settling time to consensus for PLF with DSR under large communication delays is 95% less than PLF without DSR and the steady-state error with DSR under loss of communication is 80% less than PLF without DSR.},

Federal learning (FL) was introduced to reduce the pressure on the edge network and protect privacy. But the high dynamics of cars and limited resources lead to low accuracy and high training delay. We propose a joint optimization scheme of participant selection and resource allocation for federated learning. In each time slice, vehicles are determined whether to participate in training, which minimizes long-term training delay with limited energy consumption. To meet the delay and privacy requirements of high-precision map caching, we present an edge cooperative caching scheme based on federated deep reinforcement learning (F-DRL), which aims to achieve dynamic adaptive edge caching while protecting user privacy. The collaborative caching model is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). Dueling Deep Q Network (Dueling-DQN) is used to solve the optimal strategy, and federal learning is used for training. Enough comparative experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes. The aspects of reliability, cache hit rate, and training accuracy prove that the method effectively improves the training parameters of federated learning while meeting a high-precision map cache’s delay and reliability requirements.},

Results indicate that the tested method for reading markings through snow is effective at lower speeds. The main advantages of the tested technology are effectiveness in snowy and icy surface conditions, low upfront cost detection technology in some environments, robust system without moving parts, high sampling rate, and low operating costs.

The platoon composes of a group of vehicles interacting with each other via inter-vehicular spacing constraints, to avoid collision and reduce communication latency, and aims to make multiple vehicles driving on the same lane safely with a close range and the same velocity. Each vehicle is subject to both state constraints and input constraints, communicates only with neighboring vehicles, and may not know a priori desired setpoint. We divide the computation of control inputs into several local optimization problems based on each vehicle’s local information. To compute the control input of each vehicle based on local information, a distributed computing method must be adopted and thus the coupled constraint is required to be decoupled. This is achieved by introducing the reference state trajectories from neighboring vehicles for each vehicle and by employing the interactive structure of computing local problems of vehicles with odd indices and even indices. It is shown that the feasibility of MPC optimization problems is achieved at all time steps based on tailored terminal inequality constraints, and the asymptotic stability of each vehicle to the desired trajectory is guaranteed even under a single iteration between vehicles at each time. Finally, a comparison simulation is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed MPC method for heterogeneous vehicle control with respect to normal and extreme scenarios.},

In this paper, a novel passenger-oriented network model is developed for real-time timetable scheduling that can model time-dependent passenger origin-destination demands with consideration of a balanced trade-off between model accuracy and computation speed. Then, a model predictive control (MPC) approach is proposed for the timetable scheduling problem based on the developed model. The resulting MPC optimization problem is a nonlinear non-convex problem. In this context, the online computational complexity becomes the main issue for the real-time feasibility of MPC. To reduce the online computational complexity, the MPC optimization problem is therefore reformulated into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The resulting MILP problem is exactly equivalent to the original MPC optimization problem and can be solved very efficiently by existing MILP solvers, so that we can obtain the solution very fast and realize real-time timetable scheduling. Numerical experiments based on a part of Beijing subway network show the effectiveness and efficiency of the developed model and the MILP-based MPC method.},

  abstract     = {Platooning has the potential to significantly improve traffic flow, safety, and fuel consumption. In the foreseeable future, traffic will still be composed mainly of human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Thus, the importance of exploring mixed platoons consisting of automated vehicles (AVs) and HDVs. Mixed platoons control is challenging since HDVs incorporate major uncertainty and stochastic nature. In this paper, human driving stochastic behavior was analyzed. The findings of this analysis were incorporated in all aspects of controller development – modeling, estimation, and controller synthesis. An algorithm to find an optimal controller that attenuates the effect of HDVs stochasticity while keeping predefined safety constraints was developed. Using this algorithm, two &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; controllers are suggested: a robust controller and a gain-scheduling (GS) controller. The controllers were simulated using an information flow topology (IFT) that was suited for mixed-platoons. Results show that both controllers attenuates HDVs stochasticity. Compared to the robust controller, the GS controller improves performance mainly at high velocities.},

In this paper, we propose a new framework for spatiotemporal analysis of static and dynamic traffic elements from road scenes. In the first stage, a bottom-up analysis method for static traffic elements is proposed based on a hierarchical spatiotemporal model using hidden conditional random fields (HCRF). The bottom-level features are extracted from sub-regions in the hierarchical model, and the local and global features of the image sequence are then fully combined for spatial and temporal layers. In the second stage, a lightweight multi-stream 3DCNN network is developed for the behavior classification of dynamic traffic elements, which is composed of three parts. Firstly, a SELayer-3DCNN is designed to extract the appearance, motion and edge information from the image sequences. Secondly, the channel attention fusion strategy (CAF) is introduced to enhance the feature fusion ability. Finally, the 3D-RFB module is incorporated to expand the receptive field of the convolution kernel. The experimental results well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {The increase in perception capabilities of connected mobile sensor platforms (e.g., self-driving vehicles, drones, and robots) leads to an extensive surge of sensed features at various temporal and spatial scales. Beyond their traditional use for safe operation, available observations could enable to see how and where people move on sidewalks and cycle paths, to eventually obtain a complete microscopic and macroscopic picture of the traffic flows in a larger area. This paper proposes a new method for advanced traffic applications, tracking an unknown and varying number of moving targets (e.g., pedestrians or cyclists) constrained by a road network, using mobile (e.g., vehicles) spatially distributed sensor platforms. The key contribution in this paper is to introduce the concept of network bound targets into the multi-target tracking problem, and hence to derive a network-constrained multi-hypotheses tracker (NC-MHT) to fully utilize the available road information. This is done by introducing a target representation, comprising a traditional target tracking representation and a discrete component placing the target on a given segment in the network. A simulation study shows that the method performs well in comparison to the standard MHT filter in free space. Results particularly highlight network-constraint effects for more efficient target predictions over extended periods of time, and in the simplification of the measurement association process, as compared to not utilizing a network structure. This theoretical work also directs attention to latent privacy concerns for potential applications.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous intersection management has become a state-of-the-art control strategy customized for connected and autonomous vehicles. Combining the advantages of tile-based and conflict point-based approaches, this paper proposes a two-stage optimization method based on a developed intersection modeling approach. The first stage is a timing schedule optimization model, assigning vehicle arrival times at an intersection. Based on the output of the first stage, the second stage is a trajectory optimization model, which gives the eco-driving strategies. Moreover, a rolling optimization with a variable cycle length is adopted to run the method continuously. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the genetic algorithm-based method in terms of computation time, and can reduce vehicle delay and fuel consumption by 89.48% and 46.84%, respectively, under different traffic demands compared to the first-come-first-serve method. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method under asymmetric traffic demand is discussed. Sensitivity analyses suggest that (1) a long cycle length benefits the proposed method within certain limits and (2) a proper deceleration within the intersection can balance traffic delay with fuel consumption. In addition, an additional model with a heuristic rule is compared with the original timing schedule optimization model. It is found that reducing binaries in the first stage can make a tradeoff between the quality of the solution and efficiency, which can be used in conjunction with long cycles.},

Firstly, the dynamics of WVs is decomposed as the velocity subsystem and the altitude subsystem of non-affine formulations. Then, a new type of back-stepping controller without any approximation/estimation is devised based on FPPC, such that all tracking errors satisfy spurred finite-time prescribed performance. Moreover, the closed-loop stability and the guarantee of prescribed performance are proved via Lyapunov synthesis. The special contribution is that no fuzzy/neural approximation/estimation is required for the resistance of unknown dynamics, yielding a low computation and complexity design.

  abstract     = {Lane change for automated vehicles (AVs) is an important but challenging task in complex dynamic traffic environments. Due to difficulties in guaranteeing safety as well as a high efficiency, AVs are inclined to choose relatively conservative strategies for lane change. To avoid the conservatism, this paper presents a cooperation-aware lane change method utilizing interactions between vehicles. We first propose an interactive trajectory prediction method to explore possible cooperations between an AV and the others. Further, an evaluation on safety, efficiency and comfort is designed to make a decision on lane change. Thereafter, we propose a motion planning algorithm based on model predictive control (MPC), which incorporates AV’s decision and surrounding vehicles’ interactive behaviors into constraints so as to avoid collisions during lane change. Quantitative testing results show that compared with the methods without an interactive prediction, our method enhances driving efficiencies of the AV and other vehicles by 14.8% and 2.6%, respectively, which indicates that a proper utilization of vehicle interactions can effectively reduce the conservatism of the AV and promote the cooperation between the AV and others.},

The interaction between the AESs and island-based microgrids is modeled. Furthermore, the AESs are utilized to enhance the resilience of the power grids. The AESs can be dispatched to realize the load restoration under contingencies. The proposed methodology is verified on a three-island system. It can be concluded that under normal operation, the proposed voyage scheduling can reduce the total energy consumption cost of the AESs and the islands. Besides, the voltage violation can be improved. Under the emergency, the proposed method can help the grids restore more critical and normal loads.},

We formulate a mixed-integer optimal control problem (MIOCP) that is transcribed using multiple-shooting into a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) and then solved by nonlinear model predictive control. We present two different numerical strategies, a Selective Relaxation Approach (SRA), which decomposes the MINLP into several subproblems, and a Round-n-Search Approach (RSA), which is an enhancement of the known ‘relax-n-round’ strategy. Subsequently, the resulting algorithmic performance and optimality of the solution of the proposed strategies are analyzed against two benchmark strategies; one using rule-based gear selection, which is typically used in production vehicles, and the other using dynamic programming (DP), which provides a global optimum of a quantized version of the MINLP. The results show that both SRA and RSA enable about 3.6% cost reduction compared to the rule-based strategy, while still being within 1% of the DP solution. Moreover, for the case studied RSA takes about 35% less mean computation time compared to SRA, while both SRA and RSA being about 99 times faster than DP. Furthermore, both SRA and RSA were able to overcome the infeasibilities encountered by a typical rounding strategy under different drive cycles. The results show the computational benefit of the proposed strategies, as well as the energy saving possibility of co-optimization strategies in which actuator dynamics are explicitly included.},

Enlisting parking resources from commercial operators (e.g., lots) and individuals (e.g., doorways) and letting drivers make online reservations through mobile apps, those platforms seek to ease transactions between the two sides and best match parking supply with parking demand. This way they maximize their value for drivers and parking space providers but also their revenue out of charged commissions. We distinguish between two types of commissions these platforms typically charge, fixed per transaction and proportional to its value, and formulate the respective optimization problems for the platform revenue maximization. We show that the two problems are NP-hard and design a novel algorithm that can treat both by combining greedy and dynamic programming principles. We study its optimality properties both analytically and experimentally, showing that the algorithm closely tracks optimal solutions for small and moderate problem sizes at run times that are several orders of size smaller than those needed by off-the-shelf ILP solvers. We then analyze real parking data we collected for the period 2018-2020 from the Bournemouth city in UK to realistically model the rich spatiotemporal dynamics of parking demand such as the location, start times and duration of parking events. These datasets drive the experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm, which reports gains of up to 35% compared to the de facto parking resource reservation policy in such platforms. Notably, the highest gains are achieved when the platform operates under constrained supply conditions.},

Specifically, AV should be controlled by remote users during emergencies. It may lead to AV’s system facing the risk of being intruded on by a malicious party, resulting in unreasonable decisions. We, therefore, design the Internet of autonomous vehicle (IoAV) model to mitigate the problems arising from these limitations. To promote a secure remote control of the AV, a reliable authentication scheme, which can be used in IoAV, must be performed. Our proposed chaotic map-based authenticated key agreement (CMAKA) method provides secure remote control features for AVs. In this method, users, data centers, and AV establish a secure communication channel through the negotiation of three independent session keys. Furthermore, a physical unclonable function (PUF) is employed to produce a trusted private key during the authentication. The security of our scheme is evaluated using game hopping through the widespread Real-or-Random (ROR) model. Compared with other existing three-factor authentication schemes, the performance of our protocol is higher in both security requirements and total cost.},

  abstract     = {This article presents the design, implementation, and use cases of the Chattanooga Digital Twin (CTwin) towards the vision for next-generation smart city applications for urban mobility management. CTwin is an end-to-end web-based platform that incorporates various aspects of the decision-making process for optimizing urban transportation systems in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to reduce traffic congestion, incidents, and vehicle fuel consumption. The platform serves as a cyberinfrastructure to collect and integrate multi-domain urban mobility data from various online repositories and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, covering multiple urban aspects (e.g., traffic, natural hazards, weather, and safety) that are relevant to urban mobility management. The platform enables advanced capabilities for: (a) real-time situational awareness on traffic and infrastructure conditions on highways and urban roads, (b) cyber-physical control for optimizing traffic signal timing, and (c) interactive visual analytics on big urban mobility data and various metrics for traffic prediction and transportation performance evaluation. The platform is designed using a multi-level componentization paradigm and is implemented using modular and adaptive architecture, rendering it as a generalizable and extendable prototype for other urban management applications. We present several use cases to demonstrate CTwin’s core capabilities for supporting decision-making in smart urban mobility management.},

However, most related studies have ignored how to master arterial traffic signal control. We cannot easily extract useful information and search solution space because the arterial traffic control problem has large state-action spaces. Here we tackle these issues by proposing a multi-agent attention-base soft actor-critic (MASAC) model to master arterial traffic control. Specifically, we implement the attention mechanism in the actor and critic network to enhance traffic information extraction ability. More importantly, we are the first to apply the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm to train the arterial traffic control model to search more solution spaces. Testing results indicate that the MASAC method significantly outperforms existing MARL algorithms and the multiband-based method. These findings can help researchers to design better model structures for other MARL problems.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a promising paradigm for autonomous driving, where the sensing data from the onboard sensors can be disseminated and processed cooperatively via vehicle-to-vehicle links. Autonomous vehicles can share their local views for cooperative, reliable, and robust driving decisions. However, the limited wireless resources may become the bottleneck with the increasing number of vehicles. The technical challenges also arise from the decentralized control, the spatial couplings of decisions, and the complexity of combinatorial optimization. This paper proposes a novel fully distributed graph-based approach to jointly optimize multicast link establishment with data dissemination and processing decisions by only exchanging partial information among neighboring vehicles. The mixed-integer programming problem aims to maximize system energy efficiency while achieving maximum data throughput. We prove that maximizing data processing throughput is submodular optimization to find the local optimum efficiently. The optimization of data dissemination and processing is reformulated to a minimum-cost maximum-flow problem in a three-layer graph, and efficiently solved by exploiting the graphical interdependence. Both simulation-generated and trace-based datasets are evaluated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of data throughput and energy efficiency.},

With the emergence of the fifth-generation (5G) technology, the high bandwidth and low latency features in the 5G vehicle to everything (5G-V2X) network become possible. However, the current 5G mechanism specified by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 16 incurs high signaling overhead over the radio access network and the core network when a vehicle platoon moves from a source base station to the target base station. Moreover, it also has several security problems in terms of the failure of key forward secrecy (KFS) and lack of mutual authentication. In this paper, we propose an efficient authentication protocol for vehicle platoons in all handover scenarios. By the proposal, the identities of base stations and vehicles are mutually authenticated by certificateless aggregated signatures, which can also reduce signaling overhead and is free from key escrow problems. The proposed protocol has been formally evaluated by BAN-logic and the Scyther tool to show its ability to resist major typical malicious attacks. It has also been analyzed on its security functionality. The performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed protocol is efficient in terms of signaling, computational and communication cost.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances on road damage detection relies on a large amount of labeled data, whilst collecting pavement image is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) provides a promising solution to adapt a source domain to the target domain, however, cross-domain crack detection is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose domain adaptive road damage detection termed as DA-RDD, by incorporating image-level with instance-level feature alignment for domain-invariant representation learning in an adversarial manner. Specifically, importance weighting is introduced to evaluate the intermediate samples for image-level alignment between domains, and we aggregate RoI-wise feature with multi-scale contextual information to recover the crack details for progressive domain alignment at instance level. Additionally, a large-scale road damage dataset (based on Road Damage Dataset 2020 (RDD2020)) named as RDD2021 is constructed with &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$100k$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; synthetic labeled distress images. Extensive experimental results on damage detection across different countries demonstrate the universality and superiority of DA-RDD, and empirical studies on RDD2021 further claim its effectiveness and advancement. To our best knowledge, it is the first time to investigate domain adaptative pavement crack detection, and we expect the contributions in this work would facilitate the development of generalized road damage detection in the future.},

By using the sum of the cost function as Lyapunov function, the stability of the closed-loop platoon system is studied. Comparing with existing results, the string stability, which is the unique characteristics of the platoon system, is guaranteed under the bidirectional-based structure as well as the predecessor-follower-based information flow structure.

  abstract     = {A reliable self-contained navigation system is essential for autonomous vehicles. Based on our previous study on Wheel-INS [1] , a wheel-mounted inertial measurement unit (Wheel-IMU)-based dead reckoning (DR) system, in this paper, we propose a multiple IMUs-based DR solution for the wheeled robots. The IMUs are mounted at different places on the wheeled vehicles to acquire various dynamic information. In particular, at least one IMU has to be mounted at the wheel to measure the wheel velocity and take advantage of the rotation modulation. The system is implemented through a distributed extended Kalman filter structure where each subsystem (corresponding to each IMU) retains and updates its own states separately. The relative position constraints between the multiple IMUs are exploited to further limit the error drift and improve the system’s robustness. Particularly, we present the DR systems using dual Wheel-IMUs, one Wheel-IMU plus one vehicle body-mounted IMU (Body-IMU), and dual Wheel-IMUs plus one Body-IMU as examples for analysis and comparison. Field tests illustrate that the proposed multi-IMU DR system outperforms the single Wheel-INS in terms of both positioning and heading accuracy. By comparing with the centralized filter, the proposed distributed filter shows unimportant accuracy degradation while holding significant computation efficiency. Moreover, among the three multi-IMU configurations, the one Body-IMU plus one Wheel-IMU design obtains the minimum drift rate. The position drift rates of the three configurations are 0.82% (dual Wheel-IMUs), 0.69% (one Body-IMU plus one Wheel-IMU), and 0.73% (dual Wheel-IMUs plus one Body-IMU), respectively.},

By rearranging the problem variables, the Riccati recursion can be applied along the chain-like structure of the platoon and be used to solve the problem by repeatedly transmitting information up and down the platoon. Since each vehicle is only responsible for its own part of the computations, the proposed control strategy is privacy-preserving and could therefore be deployed by any group of vehicles to form a platoon spontaneously while driving. The energy efficiency of this control strategy is evaluated in numerical experiments for platoons of electric trucks with different masses and rated motor powers.},

  abstract     = {Visibility issues in intelligent transportation systems are exacerbated by bad weather conditions such as fog and haze. It has been observed from recent studies that major road accidents have occurred in the world due to low visibility and inclement weather conditions. Single image dehazing attempts to restore a haze-free image from an unconstrained hazy image. We proposed a dehazing method by cascading two models utilizing a novel parameter-adaptive dual-channel modified simplified pulse coupled neural network (PA-DC-MSPCNN). The first model uses a new color channel for removing haze from images. The second model is the improved brightness preserving model (I-GIHE), which retains the brightness of the image while improving the gradient strength. To integrate the results from these two models and provide a pleasing haze-free image, a PA-DC-MSPCNN-based fusion is used. Furthermore, the proposed approach is deployed on a Xilinx Zynq SoC by exploiting the recently released PYNQ platform. The dehazing system runs on a PYNQ-Z2 all-programmable SoC platform, where it will input the camera feed through the FPGA unit and carry out the dehazing algorithm in the ARM core. This configuration has allowed reaching real-time processing speed for image dehazing. The results of dehazing are analyzed using both synthetic and real-world hazy images. Synthetic hazy images are acquired from the O-HAZE, I-HAZE, SOTS, and FRIDA datasets, while real-world hazy images are taken from the RailSem19, E-TUVD dataset, and the internet. For evaluation, twelve cutting-edge approaches are chosen. The proposed method is also analyzed on underwater and low-light images. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods of qualitative and quantitative performances.},

To address those problems, in this paper, we propose a novel approach, named cross-modal generation and pair correlation alignment hashing (CMGCAH), which introduces transformer to exploit position information and utilizes cross-modal generative adversarial networks (GAN) to boost cross-modal information interaction. Concretely, a cross-modal interaction network based on conditional generative adversarial network and pair correlation alignment networks are proposed to generate cross-modal common representations. On the other hand, a transformer-based feature extraction network (TFEN) is designed to exploit position information, which can be propagated to text modality and enforce the common representation to be semantically consistent. Experiments are performed on widely used datasets with text-image modalities, and results show that the proposed method achieved competitive performance compared with many existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of the price of used vehicles can effectively reduce the undesirable behavior of intermediary platforms that mark up prices indiscriminately, make the link of vehicle sales more transparent and fair, reduce the losses of buyers and sellers, and have great economic significance. However, the previous used vehicle price prediction model suffers from redundant and noisy explicit features, resulting in its poor learning efficiency and prediction ability. Moreover, the previous models did not consider the interaction information among features, resulting in the model missing the acquisition of this information during the learning process, which determines its poor generalization effect during the prediction stage. Therefore, to overcome the shortcomings of previous models, we propose a novel used vehicle price prediction model with denoising autoencoder based on convolution operations (DAECO). Firstly, the DAECO model extracts the latent features of used vehicles using denoising autoencoder to remove the non-discriminatory redundant features. Then the DAECO model uses convolution operation to obtain the interaction information between the latent features. Finally, the DAECO model adds up the interaction information between the latent features and the linear combination information by assigning a certain weight to each of them to obtain the final prediction value. The values of the DAECO model on two real used vehicle transaction datasets with MSE, RMSE and MAE metrics are 1.523 and 2.278, 1.234 and 1.509, 1.009 and 1.226, respectively. Through the comprehensive experimental results on the real used vehicle price dataset, the DAECO model outperforms the current popular baseline algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a vehicle-level distributed coordination strategy to control a mixed traffic stream of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and connected human-driven vehicles (CHVs) through signalized intersections. We use CAVs as mobile traffic controllers during a newly introduced “white phase”, during which CAVs will negotiate the right-of-way to lead a group of CHVs while CHVs must follow their immediate front vehicle. The white phase will not be activated under low CAV penetration rates, where vehicles must wait for green signals. We have formulated this problem as a distributed mixed-integer non-linear program and developed a methodology to form an agreement among all vehicles on their trajectories and signal timing parameters. The agreement on trajectories is reached through an iterative process, where CAVs update their trajectory based on shared trajectory of other vehicles to avoid collisions and share their trajectory with other vehicles. Additionally, the agreement on signal timing parameters is formed through a voting process where the most voted feasible signal timing parameters are selected. The numerical experiments indicate that the proposed methodology can efficiently control vehicle movements at signalized intersections under various CAV market shares. The introduced white phase reduces the total delay by 3.2% to 94.06% compared to cooperative trajectory and signal optimization under different CAV market shares in our tests. In addition, our numerical results show that the proposed technique yields reductions in total delay, ranging from 40.2% – 98.9%, compared to those of a fully-actuated signal control obtained from a state-of-practice traffic signal optimization software.},

  abstract     = {Multi-sensor fusion is a mainstream method for localization of unmanned systems. How to achieve 6-degrees of freedom (DOF) pose estimation of the system is challenging in GPS-denied environments. Although map-aided localization methods normally perform well on intelligent transportation systems, prior maps are unavailable in some GPS-denied scenes (e.g., dense forests, tunnels, and underground parking lots). In this paper, we present a robust and consistent monocular visual-inertial-depth odometry (VIDO) to perform 6-DOF pose estimation without the need of prior information. The system contains a visual-inertial subsystem (VIS) based on tightly coupled optimization in a sliding window and a depth subsystem (DS) based on the iterative closest point (ICP) estimation using 3D point clouds obtained by a LiDAR or depth camera. The uncertainties of the estimation results in VIS and DS are rigorously calculated to consider measurement noises of the sensors. The obtained uncertainty estimates are fed into a covariance intersection (CI) filter for pose fusion, and the fused pose is further refined in the mapping process. We perform experiments on public datasets, as well as in various real-world outdoor and indoor scenes to verify the performance on localization and mapping in urban areas with buildings and cars, off-road environments with rugged terrains, as well as indoor structured environments. The results show that the proposed method can provide both a robust 6-DOF pose estimate and a precise 3D map for fully autonomous navigation in different scenes without a prior map, which presents an attractive complement to map-aided automated driving.},

  abstract     = {The intelligent connected vehicle (ICV) is an organic combination of connectivity and intellectuality, making it possible to exchange information and drive autonomously. How to assess and describe the traffic risk for the ICV is a fundamental and crucial problem. Unlike the existing studies that only obtain instantaneous and quasi-static risk fields due to the separation between space and time, this study proposes a novel Spatial-Temporal Risk Field (STRF) that represents the dynamic driving risk from the perspective of time-space coupling for ICVs in dynamic traffic is proposed. In order to generate the field for the different traffic elements, the influential traffic elements are divided into concrete elements and abstract elements according to their features and influencing mechanisms. And then, A biased sweeping method (BSM) is developed for concrete elements, and a modeling method based on Gaussian distribution is developed for abstract elements. The results of the STRF for a traffic scenario are visualized and analyzed in two forms: complete form and slice form. The results show that the STRF can precisely describe the risk distribution of each traffic element in a specific and characteristic shape according to the spatial-temporal situation. Additionally, this study also provides an application example of the STRF in trajectory planning to demonstrate the applicability and availability of the STRF. The STRF-based trajectory planning method greatly benefits from the STRF and shows the potential ability of flexible and personalized trajectory planning. The STRF proposed in this paper can express the dynamics and continuity of the spatial-temporal risk and describe the instantaneous risk by extracting the spatial risk distribution at a certain moment. The STRF can be used in risk assessment, decision making, trajectory planning, driving behavior modeling, and automatic testing.},

  abstract     = {Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) is a novel vibration sensing technology that can be employed to detect vehicles and to analyse traffic flows using existing telecommunication cables. DAS therefore has great potential in future “smart city” developments, such as real-time traffic incident detection. Though previous studies have considered vehicle detection under relatively light traffic conditions, in order for DAS to be a feasible technology in real-world scenarios, detection algorithms need to also perform robustly under a wide range of traffic conditions. In this study we investigate the potential of roadside DAS for the simultaneous detection and characterisation of the velocity of individual vehicles. To improve the temporal resolution and detection accuracy, we propose a self-supervised Deep Learning approach that deconvolves the characteristic car impulse response from the DAS data, which we refer to as a Deconvolution Auto-Encoder (DAE). We show that deconvolution of the DAS data with our DAE leads to better temporal resolution and detection performance than the original (non-deconvolved) data. We subsequently apply our DAE to a 24-hour traffic cycle, demonstrating the feasibility of our proposed method to process large volumes of DAS data, potentially in near-real time.},

  abstract     = {Fully-supervised vehicle re-identification (re-ID) methods are faced with performance degradation when applied to new image domains. Therefore, developing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) to transfer the knowledge from learned source domain to new unlabeled target domain becomes an indispensable task. It is challenging because different domains have various image appearances, such as different backgrounds, illuminations and resolutions, especially when cameras have different viewpoints. To tackle this domain gap issue, a novel Transformer-based Domain-Specific Representation learning network (TDSR) is proposed to dynamically focus on corresponding detailed hints for each domain. Specifically, with the source and target domain being trained simultaneously, a domain encoding module is proposed to introduce domain information into the network. The original features of source and target domains are enriched with these domain encodings first, and then sequentially processed by a Transformer encoder to model contextual information and a decoder to summarize the encoded features into the final domain-specific feature representations. Moreover, we propose a Contrastive Clustering Loss (CCL) to directly optimize the distribution of features at cluster level. Instances are overall pulled closer to the prototype of the same identity, and pushed farther from the prototypes of different identities. It helps compact the clusters in the latent space and improve the discriminative capability of the network, leading to more accurate pseudo-label assignment in TDSR. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art UDA methods on vehicle re-ID benchmark datasets VeRi and VehicleID on both real-world to real-world and synthetic to real-world settings.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative on-ramp merging control for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) can effectively improve traffic throughput and vehicle fuel efficiency at highway on-ramp merging bottlenecks. However, in the mixed traffic scenario where CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) coexist, the uncertain maneuvers of human drivers pose a major challenge to merging control in terms of safety and flexibility. To this end, this paper proposes a hierarchical cooperative on-ramp merging control strategy for CAVs to optimize flexible trajectories with safety guarantees in mixed traffic. First, the on-ramp merging control problem for CAVs is considered in the case of a three-vehicle coordination, resulting in an optimal control problem (OCP) coordinating on-ramp and main-lane CAVs for efficient operation while satisfying multiple safety-critical constraints. Second, a two-level hierarchical control architecture is developed to solve the OCP with mixed state-control constraints. The upper-level planner solves an unconstrained OCP with Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle to calculate an expected merging position, which is embedded in the variable time headway of safe merging constraints in the lower-level controller. Then, the controller converts the nonlinear OCP with safety-critical constraints to a quadratic programing (QP) problem by exploiting Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs). By solving the QP efficiently, the time and energy efficient trajectory for each CAV is obtained. In addition, a receding horizon control framework is employed, which enables CAVs to determine flexible merging opportunity and tackle the disturbances caused by HDVs. Finally, comprehensive simulation results show that the proposed cooperative on-ramp merging strategy has potential in enabling merging flexibility, improving traffic efficiency and energy economy in real time.},

This paper investigates the differential game-based approach to autonomous convoy control with the aim of deployment on automated highways. Under the noncooperative differential games, the coupled vehicles make their decisions independently while their states are interdependent. The receding horizon Nash equilibrium of the linear-quadratic differential game provides the convoy a distributed state-feedback control strategy. This approach suffers a fundamental issue that neither a Nash equilibrium’s existence nor the uniqueness is guaranteed. We convert the individual dynamics-based differential game to a relative dynamics-based optimal control problem that carries all the features of the differential game. The existence of a unique Nash control under the differential game corresponds to a unique solution to the optimal control problem. The latter is shown, as well as the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. Simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the presented convey control scheme and how it well suits automated highway driving scenarios.},

The model aims to minimize the facility deployment cost and maximize the charging income of the network operator while minimizing the user-centric costs. We have converted the proposed bi-level formulation into an equivalent single-level model using the lower-level objective function as complementary equations. Then, we have developed an iterative active-set based solution technique to determine the strategic decisions on charging network design. To partially overcome the computational burden, the arc travel times are estimated using a macroscopic fundamental diagram concept. The proposed integrated methodology is applied to a hypothetical and an empirical case study to evaluate its performance and solution quality.

  abstract     = {An open problem in autonomous vehicle safety validation is building reliable models of human driving behavior in simulation. This work presents an approach to learn neural driving policies from real world driving demonstration data. We model human driving as a sequential decision making problem that is characterized by non-linearity and stochasticity, and unknown underlying cost functions. Imitation learning is an approach for generating intelligent behavior when the cost function is unknown or difficult to specify. Building upon work in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) aims to provide effective imitation even for problems with large or continuous state and action spaces, such as modeling human driving. This article describes the use of GAIL for learning-based driver modeling. Because driver modeling is inherently a multi-agent problem, where the interaction between agents needs to be modeled, this paper describes a parameter-sharing extension of GAIL called PS-GAIL to tackle multi-agent driver modeling. In addition, GAIL is domain agnostic, making it difficult to encode specific knowledge relevant to driving in the learning process. This paper describes Reward Augmented Imitation Learning (RAIL), which modifies the reward signal to provide domain-specific knowledge to the agent. Finally, human demonstrations are dependent upon latent factors that may not be captured by GAIL. This paper describes Burn-InfoGAIL, which allows for disentanglement of latent variability in demonstrations. Imitation learning experiments are performed using NGSIM, a real-world highway driving dataset. Experiments show that these modifications to GAIL can successfully model highway driving behavior, accurately replicating human demonstrations and generating realistic, emergent behavior in the traffic flow arising from the interaction between driving agents.},

  abstract     = {Public concerns about energy crisis and environmental issues lead to higher fuel economy standards and more stringent limitations on greenhouse gas emissions for ground vehicles, and ecological cooperative adaptive cruise control (eco-CACC) is considered to be effective in reducing fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of vehicle platoons. In this paper, an eco-CACC strategy is presented for heterogeneous platoons with time delays and input saturations to achieve platoon stability, fuel economy, riding comfort and driving efficiency. The proposed eco-CACC strategy includes distributed linear feedback control (DLFC) for following vehicles and model predictive control (MPC) for the leading one. To obtain platoon stability, the DLFC protocol is designed using state errors between an ego vehicle and its preceding one, and the frequency domain method is employed to derive the sufficient conditions of platoon stability for the DLFC protocol. Then, to achieve fuel economy, passenger comfort and driving efficiency without violating the different input saturations of vehicles, the constrained fuel consumption optimization problem of the leading vehicle (CFCO-LV) is formulated based on delay MPC, where the weighted sum of the overall fuel consumption and velocity band-stop functions of vehicle platoon is minimized. To quickly obtain the MPC controller, an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to solve the CFCO-LV problem. Simulations are implemented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed eco-CACC strategy, and the simulation results demonstrate that, compared with benchmark, the proposed strategy can save 2.19%~8.24% of fuel for the heterogeneous platoon under different velocity ranges.},

In this research, we develop a collaborative optimization model for the lifecycle cost of BEB system, considering both overnight and opportunity charging methods. This model aims to jointly optimize the initial capital cost and use-phase operating cost by synchronously planning the infrastructure procurement and fleet scheduling. In particular, several practical factors, such as charging pattern effect, battery downsizing benefits, and time-of-use dynamic electricity price, are considered to improve the applicability of the model. A hybrid heuristic based on the tabu search and immune genetic algorithm is customized to effectively solve the model that is reformulated as the bi-level optimization problem. A numerical case study is presented to demonstrate the model and solution method. The results indicate that the proposed optimization model can help to reduce the lifecycle cost by 7.77% and 6.64% for overnight and opportunity charging systems, respectively, compared to the conventional management strategy. Additionally, a series of simulations for sensitivity analysis are conducted to further evaluate the key parameters and compare their respective life cycle performance.

  abstract     = {Recently the research of traffic flow prediction with deep learning framework has be largely developed, whereas most current methods are still faced with the following shortcomings. For spatial feature extraction, studies have shown that both local and non-local correlations exist on traffic networks. Considering the temporal dependencies, short-term impending and longer periodic components are two most critical patterns of traffic data, which further provide different information for the prediction task. Furthermore, multi-source heterogeneous external data, which naturally holds semantic gap with traffic data, also have impact on traffic flow. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes an AutoMSNet (Multi-Source Spatio-Temporal Network via Automatic neural architecture search). The AutoMSNet is composed of an encoder-decoder structure. The encoder takes neighboring data as inputs, while the decoder captures long-term periodic patterns. Thus, different functions of two temporal features are simultaneously extracted. Moreover, a neural architecture search space is designed for spatial feature extraction. Through architecture search technique, graph convolutions with different receptive fields are automatically selected and combined to form an optimal module structure. Therefore, both local and non-local spatial features can be adaptively captured. Besides, a meta learning feature fusion strategy is proposed to integrate external data, which can alleviate the semantic gap between different data sources. Extensive experiments on three real-world traffic datasets evaluate the superiority of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a pseudo-LiDAR point cloud extrapolation algorithm equipped with stereo cameras has been introduced, bridging the gap between the expensive 3D sensor LiDAR and relatively cheap 2D sensor camera in autonomous driving. In this paper, we explore an approach to further bridge this gap using only a monocular camera and extrapolate a wide field of view 3D point cloud from a limited 2D view. However, this task is extremely challenging as it requires inferring the occluded contents in the scene. To this end, we propose a ‘render-refine-iterate-fuse’ framework that takes advantage of both image view synthesis and image inpainting techniques, guiding the neural network to learn the potential spatial distribution. In addition, we design a hybrid rendering scheme to ensure that the visible content moves in a geometrically correct manner and fills the pixels caused by occlusion. Benefitting from the proposed framework, our approach achieves significant improvements on the pseudo-LiDAR point cloud extrapolation task. The gap between LiDAR and cameras is further bridged, showing an economical and practical application in the environment perception module of autonomous driving. The experimental results evaluated on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves superior quantitative and qualitative performance.},

  abstract     = {Monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is emerging in advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving, because a single camera is cheap and easy to install. Conventional monocular SLAM has two major challenges leading inaccurate localization and mapping. First, it is challenging to estimate scales in localization and mapping. Second, conventional monocular SLAM uses inappropriate mapping factors such as dynamic objects and low-parallax areas in mapping. This paper proposes an improved real-time monocular SLAM that resolves the aforementioned challenges by efficiently using deep learning-based semantic segmentation. To achieve the real-time execution of the proposed method, we apply semantic segmentation only to downsampled keyframes in parallel with mapping processes. In addition, the proposed method corrects scales of camera poses and three-dimensional (3D) points, using estimated ground plane from road-labeled 3D points and the real camera height. The proposed method also removes inappropriate corner features labeled as moving objects and low parallax areas. Experiments with eight video sequences demonstrate that the proposed monocular SLAM system achieves significantly improved and comparable trajectory tracking accuracy, compared to existing state-of-the-art monocular and stereo SLAM systems, respectively. The proposed system can achieve real-time tracking on a standard CPU potentially with a standard GPU support, whereas existing segmentation-aided monocular SLAM does not.},

  abstract     = {The essence of connection in vehicle network is the social relationship between people, and thus Vehicular Social Networks (VSNs), characterized by social aspects and features, can be formed. The information collected by VSNs can be used for context prediction of autonomous vehicles. Multivariate relations are common in square connected relations caused by geographic characteristics in VSNs. They can effectively reflect the high-order structural features of the network dataset. It is necessary to exploit the multivariate relations of VSNs to improve the performance of context prediction. However, The representation of entity-relationes in the network often adopts a binary form, and the existing graph learning methods rely on the neighborhood information of nodes to achieve the aggregation or diffusion of information. Using this to represent multivariate relations will result in partial omissions or even complete loss of valuable information, which ultimately affects the learning effect of learning methods. In order to better understand the social behavior of the VSNs, this paper uses the network motif to implement the representation of the multivariate relations in the network, and proposes the graPh learnIng with moTif mAtrix (PITA) method. This method can be used as a preprocessing step for the measurement strategy of the relations in VSNs and the graph learning, which can mine the information in VSNs and improve the accuracy of the original graph learning method by the multivariate relation information. We performed experiments on 6 network datasets. The experimental results show that in the node classification task, the baseline method modified by the PITA method has a higher classification accuracy than the original method.},

  abstract     = {Accurate truck arrival prediction is complex but critical for container terminals. A deep learning model combining Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN), is proposed to predict daily truck arrivals using fusion technology. The model can efficiently analyze sequence and cross-section data sets. The new feature in the new model lies in that it, for the first time, incorporates the new parameters influencing traffic volumes such as the vessel-related information, arrival weekdays, and weather conditions into the long-time series of truck arrivals. Furthermore, truck arrivals are predicted in three groups based on their movement purposes: pick-up, delivery, and dual. it also contributes to the literature in a sense that the performance of the model is tested using real big data from a world-leading container port in Southern China. The results generate insightful managerial implications for guiding port traffic management in a generic manner. It reveals the relation of export container arrivals with the Container Yard (CY) closing time of a specific vessel. It is demonstrated the proposed model outperforms the currently available methods with an improved accuracy rate of prediction by 23.44% (dual), 32.09% (pick-up), and 26.99% (delivery), respectively. As a result, the model can better reflect reality compared to the existing ones in the literature. It is also evident that the 3-categorized prediction model can significantly help increase prediction accuracy in comparison with the 2-categorized methods used in practice.},

Consideration of combined effects of temperature, internal resistance rise, and capacity loss is essential to accurately estimate the current state of charge (SOC) of the battery. Most of the existing algorithms fail to capture the combined effects of the aforementioned variables. Moreover, an analysis of the inter-dependencies between the states and parameters related to the driving conditions is required. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a hybrid and adaptive method of SOC estimation which captures the effects of initial SOC deviation and changes in SOC due to loss in capacity and rise in internal resistance. Modeling parameters related to the change in SOC, temperature, and capacity loss are continuously updated for the implemented battery model, whereby the equivalent circuit can be tuned to recent state of the battery. Simulation results are verified with experimental data from literature to prove the efficiency of the approach in terms of real-time applicability and accuracy.},

Unfortunately, current trajectory prediction methods have difficulty extracting hidden driving features across multiple time steps, which is important for long-term prediction. In order to solve this shortcoming, a temporal pattern attention-based trajectory prediction network, named TP2Net, was proposed, and vehicle of interest inception was established to construct an interaction model among vehicles. Experimental results show a 15% improvement in predictive performance over the previous best method under a 5-s prediction horizon. Moreover, in order to explain why temporal pattern attention was adopted and demonstrate its ability to extract hidden features that are intuitive to human beings, a layer interpretation module was included in TP2Net to quantify the mutual information contained between the input and the intermediate layer output tensor. The results of experiments using naturalistic trajectory datasets indicated that temporal pattern attention can extract three important stages in lane changing, showing that temporal pattern attention can effectively extract hidden features and improve prediction accuracy.},

In this work, a new cloud-based smart parking architecture is proposed that can help in predicting the available free parking slots in smart cities. Initially, the methodology collects the car count at any near by parking using Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud-based approach. Later, the approach uses the Kernel Least Mean Square algorithm to make heuristic predictions about future vacancy using auto-regression. The proposed approach thus utilizes the online learning or model training. To validate the efficacy of the proposed work, the testing is done on the real-time dataset. The extensive numerical investigation is performed on parking lots of four international airports of a smart city in actual deployment scenarios. The experimentation has revealed superior performance of the method in terms of vacancy prediction.},

However, the literature assessing their impacts is still fragmented and does not provide a solid evidence base about their potential contributions, particularly that they are not widely deployed yet. This study aims to establish this evidence using a systematic literature review (SLR) of the relevant body of knowledge. In this paper, 347 journal publications from 2000 to 2021, are analyzed and critiqued. Comprehensive bibliographic and co-citation analyses are conducted to uncover the key findings and bring out a valid and balanced perspective of CAVs and their impacts on traffic operations. A co-citation analysis of the body of knowledge on this topic resulted in the formation of four main clusters of research focus that included safety, efficiency, communication, and technology. This SLR presents an unbiased and objective summary of scientific findings on the topic and serves as a starting point for future investigations on CAVs by identifying research gaps, limitations and challenges, and potential areas of research to overcome these challenges.},

  abstract     = {Maritime ships and ports have become increasingly digital and intelligent. While intelligent maritime transportation systems bring convenience to the maritime industry, ship operation and management are also confronted with network risks. The Internet of Things (IoT) installed in the shipborne network collects and monitors the environmental data of the whole ship. It uses the collected data to make decisions to control the ship. The threat of Local Area Network (LAN) of IoT in ships has become an emerging issue. The DNS rebinding attack is a typical attack, which can bypass firewalls and seriously threaten the marine network in security and privacy of the local IoT. DNS rebinding attacks are difficult to model and detect, due to their sophisticated characteristics. In this work, we define threat models of DNS rebinding attacks and propose an effective method for the detection of and the defense against these attacks. First, we define threat models for DNS rebinding attacks. We employ a Markov chain to model the process of DNS rebinding attacks. With the threat modeling, the attack behaviors are clearly characterized and the most relevant attributes are thus extracted. Second, we propose an effective method for the detection of DNS rebinding attacks in the marine transportation system. The detection method includes the initialization method and the verification method, which manages and verifies access permission of equipment information and the service interface of the IoT in the shipborn network. Finally, we simulate the DNS rebinding attacks on the marine IoT. We analyze and test the security and the performance of the initialization method and the verification method in the simulated environment. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the IoT in marine networks is vulnerable to DNS rebinding. Our method is effective and efficient to detect and defend against DNS rebinding attacks. It thus secures security and privacy in the local IoT on shipboard.},

In marine transportation industry, malicious code injection attacks (webshell) has been widely exploited by hackers to take full control of Web servers. Traditional webshell detection methods based on pattern matching that are no longer effective against new types of webshell. This motivates us to investigate the problem of detecting obfuscation or unknown webshells, termed OUW problem. In this work, we propose a pattern-matching-deep-learning hybrid ASP.NET webshell detection method (H-DLPMWD) to address the OUW problem. H-DLPMWD is based on Yara-based pattern matching to clean dataset; modeling ASP.NET code files as an operation code index (OCI) vectors; and applying CNN method to train and predict webshell in OCI vectors. To validate H-DLPMWD, our rigorous experimentation demonstrates that H-DLPMWD achieves an excellent accuracy of 98.49%, F1-score of 99.01%, and a low false positive rate of 1.75%.},

  abstract     = {Internet of things (IoT) has emerged as a promising technology that can be widely used in various industries to realize real-time information collection, so as to improve production efficiency and reduce running costs. By combining the technology of IoT, maritime transportation systems (MTS) can prevent vessels collision, improve the efficiency of maritime transportation and reduce the loss of revenue for ports and shipbuilders. The large amount of real-time data generated in IoT-enabled MTS can be efficiently utilized to predict the future trajectories and hotspots of vessels on the sea combined with historical data. However, the maritime traffic data in MTS cannot be effectively processed in traditional big data analysis methods, and the integrity of it needs to be checked before being used to achieve the prediction of trajectories and high-density areas of vessels. In this paper, we propose a flexible data integrity checking scheme with original data recovery in IoT-enabled MTS. In the proposed scheme, the data blocks of vessels are encoded based on the technology of erasure coding. To ensure the availability of the historical data, the existence and the integrity of the data elements stored in the cloud can be checked. Moreover, the original data blocks can be recovered efficiently if the encoded data elements have been corrupted or deleted. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme can be proved to be correct and is secure against malicious attacks. Performance analysis shows that our scheme is more efficient than the previous schemes.},

  abstract     = {With global economic integration, transnational trade plays an important role, and maritime transportation is one of the important means of freight transportation. It is of great significance to build a secure and efficient maritime transportation system (MTS). The introduction of Internet of things technology makes MTS more perfect. The IoT-enabled MTS is composed of marine terminals and on-board sensors, land-based data centers and base stations, as well as satellite networks. Many researchers have carried out significant work to aggregate data in MTS. However, because the terrestrial base stations cannot cover most of the sea area, the isolated maritime terminals, those who drive to the area without base station coverage, need the assistance of satellite networks to complete the contact with the data center. In this paper, we propose an attribute based secure data aggregation scheme for isolated IoT-enabled MTS. In the novel scheme, the constant attributes of a maritime terminal are utilized to generate its certification. In addition, on-board sensors are introduced in the system to help aggregate the status and surrounding environment of the maritime terminal. These monitoring data are encrypted by the sensors and transmitted to the data center for the trustworthiness evaluation of the isolated maritime terminal. Besides, the zero-knowledge proof is utilized to confirm the legitimacy of participating users. What’s more, the security analysis and the simulation results show that the novel scheme is secure and efficient for IoT-enabled MTS.},

  abstract     = {Internet-of-Vehicle (IoV) enabled Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) communication is anticipated to support ultra-reliable and low latency, diverse quality-of-service (QoS) and large-scale connectivities. To meet such stringent demands, a cognitive ambient backscatter non-orthogonal multiple access (C-AmBC-NOMA) IoV-MTS network is proposed. We explore the reliable and secure performance of the proposed C-AmBC-NOMA IoV-MTS network with in-phase and quadrature phase imbalance (IQI) at radio-frequency (RF) front-ends and the existence of an eavesdropper. In particular, the analytical expressions on the outage probability (OP) and intercept probability (IP) are obtained after a series of calculations. For a deeper understanding, we discuss the asymptotic behavior of OPs in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region, the diversity orders of OPs, and IPs in the high main-to-eavesdropper ratio (MER) regime. The results of Monte-Carlo simulation and a series of corresponding theoretical analysis show that: i) As the SNR approaches infinity, the OPs tend to be fixed non-negative values, indicating that the diversity orders of the OPs have error floors; ii) When the MER approaches infinity, the IPs of legitimate users decrease continuously, while the IP of backscatter device (BD) increases; iii) Compared with the system performance under ideal condition, the system performance is less reliable under IQI condition, but the security performance is enhanced; iv) By carefully selecting the system parameters, a trade-off can be achieved between reliability and security.},

To guarantee the transmission security of confidential data, an important alternative in an untrustworthy IoT-enabled MTS is to apply the covert timing channels. This paper mainly introduces the construction of covert timing channel with low bit shifting rate and high reliability by multi-stage verification and error correction. For the covert timing channel schemes realized by active packet loss, the packet loss noise interferes with the channel’s reliability. However, due to the constraints of stealthiness, the active packet loss ratio during covert communication is low, so more effective reliable strategies are needed to reduce noise interference. In the excellent scenario, when the bit error rate is lower than 0.08%, the transmission performance is kept at 0.49 bps. In the good scenario with strong network noise, although this method loses some performance, it can still maintain the transmission performance of 0.2 bps under the condition of bit error rate less than 1%, which effectively proves the effectiveness of multi-stage verification and error correction.},

Motivated by that, in this paper, we design a blockchain-enabled edge-centric framework for analyzing the real-time data at the edge of the networks with minimum latency and power consumption while meeting the security and privacy issue of MTS. The introduction of blockchain and smart contract in the edge-centric MTS frameworks help to validate the transactions of each block at edge nodes by estimating the lifetime, belief, and trustfulness, and mitigate various types of security threats. Further, we introduce different classification models to predict the malicious vessels over the real-time maritime dataset at a secured edge-centric MTS framework.

However, CMTS also brings some security issues, where the integrity protection of outsourced data is one of the most important issues since it is crucial for the safety, reliability and efficiency of sea lanes. To solve this problem, we propose an identity-based dynamic data integrity auditing scheme for CMTS. Our scheme decreases the burden of key management and improves the auditing efficiency by batch auditing. Besides, our scheme also supports dynamic operations on the outsourced data for CMTS. The security analysis shows that our scheme can ensure the feature of storage correctness and resist common attacks. In addition, the performance comparison results with other related schemes show that our scheme not only has the lowest computational cost on all entities, but also greatly reduces the communication overhead of the auditing phase.

In computing and networking for maritime applications, Wireless Sensor Network (WSNs) is a rising inflexion because of its amazing features. Simultaneously, there are some challenges faced by WSNs and node localization is one of them. Node localization is an important factor because until the location of reporting node is unknown, the data sensed by that node is totally useless. The main aim of this paper is towards gaining more improvement in localization by using swarm intelligence algorithm. To achieve this aim, a range-free and distributed method by using the application of salp swarm algorithm for moving target node in network for maritime rescue is proposed. The results are compared with existing algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA). The proposed method has approximately 10% less localization error as compared to PSO and BOA. The proposed algorithm is validated in terms of localization accuracy, localized nodes, localization errors and computing time.},

Meanwhile, the IoT devices are resource-constrained and cannot implement the existing security systems, making them susceptible to various types of debilitating cyber-attacks. The dynamics in the attack processes in IoT-enabled MTS networks keep changing, which makes a traditional offline or batch ML-based attack detection systems intractable to apply. This paper provides a novel approach of using an adaptive incremental passive-aggressive machine learning (AI-PAML) method to create a network attack detection system (NADS) to protect the IoT devices in an MTS environment. In this paper, we propose an NADS that utilizes a multi-access edge computing (MEC) platform to provide computational resources to execute the proposed model at a network end. Since online learning models face data saturation problems, we present an improved approximate linear dependence and a modified hybrid forgetting mechanism to filter the inefficient data and keep the detection model up-to-date. The proposed data filtering ensures that the model does not experience a rapid increase in unwarranted data, which affects the model’s attack detection rate. A Markov transition probability is applied to control the MEC selection and data offloading process by the IoT devices. The performance of the NADS is verified using selected benchmark datasets and a realistic IoT environment. Experimental results demonstrate that AI-PAML achieves remarkable performance in the NADS design for an MTS environment.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative collision avoidance between inland waterway ships is among the envisioned services on the Internet of Ships. Such a service aims to support safe navigation while optimizing ships’ trajectories. However, to deploy it, timely and accurate prediction of ships’ positioning with real-time reactions is needed to anticipate collisions. In such a context, ships positions are usually predicted using advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Traditionally, ML schemes require that the data be processed in a centralized way, e.g., a cloud data center managed by a third party. However, these schemes are not suitable for the collisions avoidance service due to the inaccessibility of ships’ positioning data by this third party, and allowing connected ships to get access to sensitive information. Therefore, in this paper, we design a new cooperative collision avoidance system for inland ships, while ensuring data security and privacy. Our system is based on deep federated learning to collaboratively build a model of ship positioning prediction, while avoiding sharing their private data. In addition, it is deployed at multi-access edge computing (MEC) level to provide low-latency communication to ensure fast responses during collision detection. Furthermore, it relies on Blockchain and smart contracts to ensure trust and valid communications between ships and MEC nodes. We evaluate the proposed system using a generated dataset representing ships mobility in France. The results, which demonstrate the accuracy of our prediction model, prove the effectiveness of our cooperative collision avoidance system in ensuring timely and reliable communications and avoiding collisions between ships.},

The surveillance videos are captured with using optical sensors in shallow-deep water where marine vehicles are moving, e.g., ships, submarines, and underwater unmanned vehicles (UUVs). Access to efficient videos for maritime control and marine transportation system (MTS), particularly underwater optical videos, is still a critical demand for underwater tourism industry. As there are serious problems in underwater optical video imaging systems such as light scattering and absorption in water, low contrast, fog and haziness, detecting various underwater objects will be a difficult task. Moreover, a reliable and safe MTS with the capability of detecting and recognizing underwater objects is required to reduce the costs of movements. The current study addresses predictive challenges and evaluates many video frames with poor qualities of various aquatic species as a real dataset. Intelligent processing of vision computing-related extracted features is performed with the aid of a modified convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for underwater IoT platforms to support MTS. The decision-making structure in the proposed method is based on a modified residual neural network (mResNet) to recognize trained underwater objects through video frames. The mResNet approach uses the dilation feature to extract the most information from the video frames. Moreover, features extracted from the ResNet structure are designed using traditional learning approaches including feature selection and classification to identify the undersea objects. Also, an optimization process is employed to find the best kernel parameters of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier used in the proposed structure. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed model has a classification accuracy of 93.51% in real videos.},

The massive data collected during the voyage is usually disposed of with the assistance of cloud or edge computing, which imposes serious cyber security threats. For multifarious cyber-attacks, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the efficient mechanisms to prevent IoT devices from network intrusion. However, most of the methods based on deep learning train their models in a centralized manner, which needs uploading all data to the central server for training, increasing the risk of privacy disclosure. In this paper, we consider the characteristics of IoT-based MTS and propose a CNN-MLP based model for intrusion detection which is trained through Federated Learning, named FedBatch. Federated Learning keeps the model training local and only updates the global model through the exchange of model parameters, preserving the privacy of local data on vessels. First, the characteristics of the communication between different vessels are discussed to model the federated learning process during the voyage. Then, the lightweight local model constructed by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) is designed to save on computing and storage overhead. Moreover, to mitigate the straggler problem during the federated learning in MTS, we proposed an adaptive aggregation method, named Batch Federated Aggregation, which suppresses the oscillations of model parameters during federated learning. Finally, the simulation results on the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of FedBatch.},

  abstract     = {With the intelligentization of Maritime Transportation System (MTS), Internet of Thing (IoT) and machine learning technologies have been widely used to achieve the intelligent control and routing planning for ships. As an important branch of machine learning, federated learning is the first choice to train an accurate joint model without sharing ships’ data directly. However, there are still many unsolved challenges while using federated learning in IoT-enabled MTS, such as the privacy preservation and Byzantine attacks. To surmount the above challenges, a novel mechanism, namely DisBezant, is designed to achieve the secure and Byzantine-robust federated learning in IoT-enabled MTS. Specifically, a credibility-based mechanism is proposed to resist the Byzantine attack in non-iid (not independent and identically distributed) dataset which is usually gathered from heterogeneous ships. The credibility is introduced to measure the trustworthiness of uploaded knowledge from ships and is updated based on their shared information in each epoch. Then, we design an efficient privacy-preserving gradient aggregation protocol based on a secure two-party calculation protocol. With the help of a central server, we can accurately recognise the Byzantine attackers and update the global model parameters privately. Furthermore, we theoretically discussed the privacy preservation and efficiency of DisBezant. To verify the effectiveness of our DisBezant, we evaluate it over three real datasets and the results demonstrate that DisBezant can efficiently and effectively achieve the Byzantine-robust federated learning. Although there are 40% nodes are Byzantine attackers in participants, our DisBezant can still recognise them and ensure the accurate model training.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoTs) is envisaged to widely capture the realm of logistics and transportation services in future. The applications of ubiquitous IoTs have been extended to Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) that spawned increasing security threats; posing serious fiscal concerns to stakeholders involved. Among these threats, Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) is ranked very high that can wreak havoc on IoT artifacts of the MTS networks. Timely and effective detection of such attacks is imperative for necessary mitigation. Conventional approaches exploit entropy of attributes in network traffic for detecting DDoS attacks. However, the majority of these approaches are static in nature and consider only a few network traffic parameters, limiting the number of DDoS attack detection to a few types and intensities. In current research, a novel framework named “Dual Stack Machine Learning (S2ML)” has been proposed to calculate distinct entropy-based varying 10-Tuple (T) features from network traffic features, three window sizes and associated Rate of Exponent Separation (RES). These features have been exploited for developing an intelligent model over MTS-IoT datasets to successfully detect multiple types of DDoS attacks in MTS. S2ML is an efficient framework that overcomes the shortcomings of prevalent DDoS detection approaches, as evident from the comparison with Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Alternating Decision Tree (ADT) and Simple Logistic Regression (SLR) over different evaluation metrics (Confusion metrics, ROCs). The proposed S2ML technique outperforms prevalent ones with 1.5% better results compared to asserted approaches on distribution of normal/attack traffic. We look forward to enhancing the model performance through dynamic windowing, measuring packet drop rates and infrastructure of Software Defined Networks (SDNs).},

  abstract     = {The recent burgeoning of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in the maritime industry is successfully digitalizing Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS). In IoT-enabled MTS, the smart maritime objects, infrastructure associated with ship or port communicate wirelessly using an open channel Internet. The intercommunication and incorporation of heterogeneous technologies in IoT-enabled MTS brings opportunities not only for the industries that embrace it, but also for cyber-criminals. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is an effective security strategy that uses artificial intelligence models to understand cyber-attacks and can protect data of IoT-enabled MTS proficiently. Unsurprisingly, most of the existing CTI-based solutions uses manual analysis to extract relevant threat information, and has low detection and high false alarm rate. Therefore, to tackle aforementioned challenges, an automated framework called DLTIF is developed for modeling cyber threat intelligence and identifying threat types. The proposed DLTIF is based on three schemes: a deep feature extractor (DFE), CTI-driven detection (CTIDD) and CTI-attack type identification (CTIATI). The DFE scheme automatically extracts the hidden patterns of IoT-enabled MTS network and its output is used by CTIDD scheme for threat detection. The CTIATI scheme is designed to identify the exact threat types and to assist security analysts in giving early warning and adopt defensive strategies. The proposed framework has obtained upto 99% accuracy, and outperforms some traditional and recent state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {As an important means of obtaining information of marine situation, the marine monitoring system relying on UAV has been paid more and more attention by all countries in the world, and the demand for tasks is growing continually. In UAV ad hoc networks, routing protocols with immutable routing policies that lack flexibility are generally incapable of maintaining effective performance due to the complicated and rapidly changing environmental situation and application requirements. In this paper, we propose an intelligent clustering routing approach (ICRA) for UANETs. The ICRA is composed of three components: the clustering module, the clustering strategy adjustment module and the routing module. In the clustering process, each node needs to calculate its utility. In order to maintain high topology stability and long network lifetime in different network states, the reinforcement learning based clustering strategy adjustment module needs continuous learning the benefits brought by adopting different strategies to calculate the nodes utility in a specific network state. With the learned knowledge, clustering strategy adjustment module could determine the optimal clustering strategy according to the current network state. In the routing phase, the proposed scheme can reduce the end-to-end delay and improve the packet delivery rate by introducing inter-cluster forwarding nodes to forward messages among different clusters. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify ICRA’s robustness and superiority over existing schemes. The results demonstrate that ICRA could achieve better performance than its state-of-the-art counterparts with regard to the clustering efficiency, topology stability, energy efficiency and quality of service.},

  abstract     = {5G enabled maritime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is one of the important applications of 5G wireless network which requires minimum latency and higher reliability to support mission-critical applications. Therefore, lossless reliable communication with a high data rate is the key requirement in modern wireless communication systems. These all factors highly depend upon channel conditions. In this work, a channel model is proposed for air-to-surface link exploiting millimeter wave (mmWave) for 5G enabled maritime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication. Firstly, we will present the formulated channel estimation method which directly aims to adopt channel state information (CSI) of mmWave from the channel model inculcated by UAV operating within the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-Distributed Conditional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) i.e. (LSTM-DCGAN) for each beamforming direction. Secondly, to enhance the applications for the proposed trained channel model for the spatial domain, we have designed an LSTM-DCGAN based UAV network, where each one will learn mmWave CSI for all the distributions. Lastly, we have categorized the most favorable LSTM-DCGAN training method and emanated certain conditions for our UAV network to increase the channel model learning rate. Simulation results have shown that the proposed LSTM-DCGAN based network is vigorous to the error generated through local training. A detailed comparison has been done with the other available state-of-the-art CGAN network architectures i.e. stand-alone CGAN (without CSI sharing), Simple CGAN (with CSI sharing), multi-discriminator CGAN, federated learning CGAN and DCGAN. Simulation results have shown that the proposed LSTM-DCGAN structure demonstrates higher accuracy during the learning process and attained more data rate for downlink transmission as compared to the previous state of artworks.},

All tasks performed by the maritime transport system require continuous monitoring of the vessel performance, and for this, different IoT devices are installed on the vessel board. The IoT devices collect data related to the physical parameters of the vessel and share it with the coast-side servers. As the shared data contains confidential information about the vessel, there is a need for secure data sharing techniques, allowing only the authenticated personals to access the data received from the maritime IoT devices. In this context, we developed an identity-based secure information sharing scheme for the maritime transport system that maintains proper authentication measures.

Secure real-time data access from numerous smart IoT devices is the most critical and crucial exercise for Big Data acquisition in IoT-enabled MTS.

This solution enables the mobile user and IoT node to mutually authenticate each other via Cloud-Gateway before real-time data exchange and transmission in IoT-enabled MTS. The use of PUF in our solution brings invincibility against physical security threats. An inclusive security analysis under the assumption of the specified threat model is carried out to substantiate the security resilience of our solution. The conduct of our solution is realized through security features, communication, and computation cost and It has been observed that our solution achieves efficiency of 37.3% and 9.7% in communication and computation overhead, respectively.

However, abnormal trajectories of maritime transportation ships can have highly negative impacts on the management of IoT-MTS. Therefore, anomaly detection of trajectories is important for the successful deployment of IoT-MTS. In this paper, we propose a Transfer Learning based Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy, named TLTAD, for IoT-MTS. Specifically, a variational autoencoder is used to discover the potential connections between each dimension of the normal trajectory, while a graph variational autoencoder is used to explore the spatial similarity between normal trajectories. Based on internal connection of trajectories, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3), is employed to train the trajectory anomaly detection model. To reduce the model training time, transfer learning is used to migrate the trained anomaly detection model between different regions of an ocean area or between similar ocean areas. Moreover, an efficient data transformation module is designed to improve the efficiency of model transfer. The experiments were conducted on a real-world automatic identification system (AIS) dataset. The results indicate that the proposed TLTAD can provide accurate anomaly detection on ships’ trajectories in IoT-MTS with reduced model training times.},

  abstract     = {Rapid technological advancements have resulted in increasingly more efficient and lightweight devices that, coupled with low-power and wide-range wireless connectivity, have given rise to Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems. As a result, the concept of intelligent environments was developed, such as smart airports, where ubiquitous sensors seamlessly cooperate through several types of communication technologies, such as WiFi, BLE, ZigBEE and 5G, enable the collection of data and the dynamic adaption of the system to changing circumstances. However, along with certain benefits, such as augmented communication, enhanced business processes and improved efficiency, IIoT introduces new vulnerabilities, enabling cyber-attackers to compromise not only the digital infrastructure of IIoT architecture-enabled smart airports, but also affecting their physical assets. In this paper, we present a novel smart airport cybertwins security-oriented IIoT testbed, named SAir-IIoT, which comprises multiple heterogeneous IIoT devices and communication protocols, organised into distinct zones, automatically interconnected with each other, that can be remotely accessed as-a-service. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cybertwins security-oriented testbed that enables researchers and practitioners to remotely practice attack and defence scenarios in smart airport IIoT environments. Additionally, we introduce a new data management technique for dynamically collecting, analysing and tagging heterogeneous data from diverse data sources including IIoT devices and network flows. Finally, we compare SAir-IIoT with other IIoT-based testbeds, revealing its complexity and effectiveness to evaluate new cyber security methods.},

  abstract     = {The purposes are to explore the safety performance of the Maritime Transportation System (MTS) based on Digital Twins (DTs) Internet of Things (IoT) and develop maritime transportation towards intelligence and digitalization. Because the comprehensive operational security of modern MTS is not yet mature, historical transportation data of the Maritime Silk Road are acquired and preprocessed. Afterward, DTs are introduced, and relay nodes are added to data transmission paths to construct a maritime transportation DTs model based on relay cooperation IoT. Eventually, this model’s security performance is validated through simulation experiments. Relay security analysis suggests that interference information is a vital guarantee to assist in information non-disclosure, from which the constructed model can harvest energy to increase the data transmission power, thereby improving communication performance and secrecy rate. Outage probability analysis reveals that the simulated and the theoretical results are almost the same; moreover, given the system’s multi-hop paths in the same environment, the more the relays and the greater the fading index, the better the system performance and the lower the outage probability. Once the iterations reach a particular number, the node secrecy rate becomes optimal and cannot cause excessive burden to the system; besides, the power distribution can establish a new equilibrium when the nodes are in different locations, so that system security performance gets improved. The simulated value is closest to the actual result under 100% successful transmission probability and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$0.01\sim 0.05~\lambda $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; value. To sum up, the constructed maritime transportation DTs model presents extraordinary transmission and security performance, providing an experimental basis for intelligent and secure maritime transportation in the future.},

  abstract     = {Since 2002, hundreds of thousands of vessels have equipped the Automatic Identification System (AIS), which continuously broadcasts its identity and location information for vessel collision avoidance. To utilize these scattered AIS data for further analysis, there are multiple AIS data platforms collecting AIS data from vessels around the world through their satellites and land-based stations. Thus, users can obtain AIS data of vessels from these platforms without dedicated devices. However, existing platforms work in silos, and AIS data is distributed across different platforms, resulting in reduced data availability. In addition, AIS is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing attacks, which can undermine the authenticity of AIS data. In this paper, we propose AISChain, a secure and fast blockchain-based AIS data platform. AISChain adopts consortium blockchain, which only permits those authorized parties (i.e., AIS data providers) to participate in the consensus protocol, and is compatible with current commodity AIS hardware. Since the whole system is co-maintained by multiple authorized parties, AISChain can integrate AIS data resources in a secure way. For avoiding repeated recording of AIS data on the chain, we design the Dynamic Bloom Filter Tree (DBFT) to realize efficient duplication detection in the transaction verification phase. We also propose the dual signature scheme to clarify the AIS data ownership. Moreover, we leverage the geographical location-based blockchain sharding approach to further improve the scalability of AISChain. We implement a prototype of AISChain, and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of AISChain. Evaluation results show that the search time of DBFT is negligible (4.3 ms) with an extreme low error ratio (0.4%). Meanwhile, AISChain can achieve more than 730 tx/s throughput even when nodes scale to 36. To the best of our knowledge, AISChain is the first work to apply the blockchain technology to secure the AIS data platform.},

The involvement of different maritime parties in the marine transportation flow scheduling and management further escalates these challenges. Thus, we need an IoT-based collaborative processing system that unifies the modular structure and integrates multiple modules involved in MTS. Moreover, the need for a shared and controlled access mechanism that cannot be manipulated or tampered by unauthorized parties is also essential requirement in MTS. Blockchain, as an emerging technology, has become a key tool in data security protection because of its non-tampering and non-forgery characteristics. Keeping in view of this aspect, in this paper, an IoT-based collaborative processing system based on blockchain is proposed for marine transportation flow scheduling and management. In addition, we propose a novel consensus mechanism based on Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and reputation voting to reduce the communication cost in blockchain consensus communication process. The proposed scheme has been validated in a simulated environment and the results illustrate that the scheme has obvious effect in resisting replay attack and camouflage attack. Furthermore, the optimized consensus mechanism improves the security by 8% and the transaction processing speed by 6% on the premise that the communication cost is basically unchanged.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain can help edge IoT-enabled Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) in solving its privacy and security problems. In this paper, a lightweight blockchain called LBlockchainE is designed for edge IoT-enabled MTS to guarantee the security of sensor data stored in an edge computing environment. To save the resources of edge servers on ship, a data placement strategy is proposed. To encourage edge servers to positively contribute to storing data generated by sensor devices, storage resource consumption is employed as an influencing parameter, and servers with abundant resources are selected for priority storage. The data placement strategy also takes care of the access delay between servers and selects the nodes with the least access and storage costs as the priority storage choice. LBlockchainE applies the low-energy-consumption characteristics of Proof of Stake to determine the ownership of bookkeeping rights through a small number of competitive calculations and the resources of the node. Experimental results indicate that compared with Ethereum, the consensus mechanism of LBlockchainE consumes less energy and occupies less storage space. On average, the new system uses 1.6% less time and consumes 78% less battery power compared with traditional blockchain systems. In comparison to the random storage, the best storage, and the optimal data storage strategies, the proposed strategy maintains the same message costs.},

However, security and privacy of the information exchange between different entities are significant concerns keeping in view of the information exchange via an open channel, i.e., Internet among different entities such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), charging stations (CSs), and controllers in V2G environment. With an exponential rise in Electric vehicles (EVs) usage across the globe, there is a requirement of developing a seamless charging infrastructure for charging and billing. Moreover, secure information flow needs to be maintained at different levels in such an environment. Hence, this paper proposes a blockchain-based demand response management for efficient energy trading between EVs and CSs. In this proposal, miner nodes and block verifiers are selected using their power consumption and processing power. These nodes are responsible for the authentication of various transactions in the proposal. We also proposed a game theory-based solution to support energy management and peak load control off-peak and peak conditions. The proposed scheme has been evaluated using various performance evaluation metrics where its performance is found superior in comparison to the existing solutions in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Using the increasingly wireless communication capacity of 5G/6G technology, edge intelligence (EI) enables modern vehicles to leverage the powerful computing resources of edge servers scattered aside the roads to implement intelligent transportation applications (ITA). The running of these intelligent applications is always accompanied by the calculating and transmitting of massive amounts of road situation data. For the protection of drivers and passengers, these complex processes should be handled in an ultra-reliable and low latent manner. Intelligent processing function offloading from terminals to edge servers is a promising approach to address these issues. However, the runtime environment specification of each intelligent processing function and the interdependence between two consecutive functions pose a challenge for the assignment of the offloaded functions among edge servers. In this paper, we propose a dependence-aware edge intelligent function offloading scheme for 6G-based Internet of Vehicle (IoV). All traditional ITAs are split into different chains of standard intelligent functions. Each edge server can provide some specific intelligent functional services. These services can receive data from cars and serve as different intelligent functions. Then, an intelligent application offloading scheme is changed into an embedding scheme of a service chain. An NP-hard objective function is constructed using a multi-winner committee selection model for this offloading service chain embedding problem. We design two algorithms to get the optimal assignment of intelligent functions using a greedy strategy and dynamic programming strategy separately. Finally, experiments show that when the proportion of vehicles meeting the constraint conditions is not in [9%, 10%], our algorithms are fast.},

While a vehicle platoon can improve traffic efficiency, there are some challenges in maintaining communication among platoon members, especially when some vehicles join an existing platoon that includes long-body, heavy-duty or special vehicles. In order to solve this problem, we propose a spectrum sensing scheduling (SSS) scheme for communication resource management in platooning. First, we propose a three-level platoon architecture, which includes the cloud, road side unit (RSU), and vehicles to increase the communication coverage of a platoon and multiple platoons. Second, the spectrum sensing model, platoon control error model, and platoon communication delay model are established for the platoon delay under the SSS scheme. Third, we propose a greedy algorithm for resource allocation, which is based on the SSS scheme and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, to minimize platoon delay. Finally, we simulate platoon delay and platoon safety status of the SSS scheme when some vehicles join an existing platoon. Simulation results show that the proposed SSS scheme reduces the platoon communication delay by around 50% and achieves a smaller platoon error as compared with existing baseline schemes for resource scheduling.},

The results reveal that the proposed algorithm has a lower average delay cost, and the average unloading utility is stable at approximately 70%. In the prediction performance analysis, the recognition accuracy of the proposed algorithm reaches 98.06%. It is at least 1.14% higher than that of the advanced convolution neural network (CNN) algorithm proposed by other scholars and achieves a faster convergence rate. Therefore, the constructed short-term traffic prediction model implemented has a high-quality prediction performance while also ensuring a better unloading performance. The results can provide an experimental basis for traffic flow prediction and intelligent development of the smart city.},

  abstract     = {The upcoming Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) supported by sixth generation (6G) communication technologies is expected to face the great challenges of spectrum scarcity, large-scale connectivity, ultra-low latency, and various security threats. To mitigate these challenges and implement the ITS in practice, we propose an overlay cognitive ambient backscatter communication non-orthogonal multiple access (ABCom-NOMA) network for the ITS. Specifically, we elaborate on the secrecy performance the overlay cognitive ABCom-NOMA based on ITS in the presence of an eavesdropping vehicle by deriving the secrecy outage probability (SOP) between the primary network, overlay secondary network, and the eavesdropping vehicle of the considered networks, respectively. For comparison, the secrecy performance of secondary receiving vehicles is taken into account, and a series of numerical simulations by Monte-Carlo methods are carried out to investigate the secrecy performance. From the numerical results yielded by the simulations, we can conclude: 1) The secrecy performance of the proposed the overlay secondary network is superior to the one of the primary network; 2) The increasing of the power allocation factor yields a positive effect on the secrecy performance of the primary receiving vehicles but a negative effect on that of the secondary receiving vehicles.},

  abstract     = {This purpose of the research is to explore the construction status and prediction performance of intelligent transportation systems in the road network of smart cities based on 5G (5th Generation Mobile Communication Technology) network, and further intellectualize the smart city. Aiming at the diversity and complexity of regional traffic influencing factors of road network in the construction of smart city, this research carries out resource real-time load balancing scheduling from the perspective of 5G heterogeneous network. Meanwhile, CNN (convolutional neural network) in the introduced deep learning algorithm is improved, and finally an intelligent traffic prediction model is constructed based on 5G load balancing and AlexNet network. The model is simulated and its performance is analyzed. The results show that the algorithm proposed is compared with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), CNN, RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), VGGNet (Visual Geometry Group Network), and BN (Bayesian network) models regarding Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1. It is found that the road network prediction accuracy of the algorithm proposed is 94.05%, which is at least 4.29% higher than that of the model algorithm proposed by other scholars. The analysis of network data transmission synchronization performance suggests that there are obvious performance improvements in access delay, access collision rate, reliability, and network throughput. Among them, the packet loss rate is lower than 0.1, the access collision rate is basically stable at about 0, the access time is stable at about 75ms, and the sending throughput is basically maintained at about 1, which is significantly better than the performance of other algorithms. Therefore, the intelligent transportation system can achieve better data transmission performance under the premise of ensuring high prediction performance, with prominent instantaneity, which can provide experimental basis for the intelligent development of transportation in smart cities.},

  abstract     = {The transportation system has entered the era of 5G intelligent Internet of things (IoT), which can realize the comprehensive monitoring, perception, and intelligent decision-making of people, vehicles, roads, and the environment. The purpose is to solve the problems in the communication security of intelligent transportation system (ITS) and improve the vulnerability of traditional distributed architecture. The security issues of the Internet of vehicles (IoV) in 5G environment are analyzed from the perspective of big data. An access control mechanism based on risk prediction is proposed aiming at the problems existing in the node access control process. A Wasserstein Distance-based Combined Generative Adversarial Network (WCGAN) is proposed. It modifies the loss function to solve the gradient disappearance problem, and a combination of multiple generators is designed to solve the pattern collapse. The simulation experiment is carried out on the dataset of the intrusion detection evaluation project. The WCGAN model has the smallest prediction error than the other models regarding the node packet transmission rate. Its loss value is close to 0 after 10 iterations, while the loss value of the BP neural network (BPNN) is about 0.28. The prediction accuracy of the WCGAN model can reach 86.3% when the training set is 5000, which is much higher than that of BPNN (77.8%). The reason is that the WCGAN model increases the number of generators according to GAN, which improves the low accuracy caused by pattern collapse. The IoT-based ITS can implement corresponding strategies according to the prediction results and control the access rights of nodes, thus ensuring the security of information resources effectively. The research content reduces the communication delay under ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of information in the process of data transmission, and provides a reference for ensuring the safe communication of IoV.},

  abstract     = {The increasing number of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the low-altitude airspace and the increasing complexity of the work environment present new challenges for ensuring airspace security, especially the effective conflict detection and resolution (CD&amp;R) of UAVs. In the era of the sixth generation (6G) technology, there is an improvement in communication speed and capacity in comparison with the traditional communication technologies, which contributes to forming a UAV Internet of Things (IoTs) through remote intelligent control platform and improve the effect of CD&amp;R. In this paper, we innovatively develop a cooperative CD&amp;R method in the UAV IoT environment considering UAV relative motion relationships and UAV priorities. Using this method in 6G environment, the real-time and reactive conflict-free paths for UAVs can be generated. The developed method has the advantage of smaller calculation and needs fewer UAVs to take maneuvers than the CD&amp;R methods based on traditional Artificial Potential Field (APF). To verify the effectiveness of CD&amp;R methods, a safety assessment method (evaluate from both conflict feature and network structure perspectives) is also proposed. A Monte Carlo Simulation with “clone mechanism” is designed to incorporate the effect of CD&amp;R systems. Three cases of distributed CD&amp;R protocols are simulated and compared. The simulations with different parameter settings are also discussed. Quantitative simulation experiments show that the safety effect of CD&amp;R proposed in this paper is improved a lot due to the improved APF and the UAV priority determination. Meanwhile, the safety assessment method is demonstrated to be feasible for evaluating the safety of CD&amp;R systems.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has gained increasing interest due to its potential to provide low latency and reduce the load in backhaul networks. In order to meet drastically increasing computation demands from emerging ever-growing vehicular applications, e.g., autonomous driving, abundant computation resources of individual vehicles can play a crucial role in task execution in a VEC scenario, that can further contribute in considerably improving user experience. This is however an extremely challenging task due to high mobility of vehicles that can easily lead to intermittent connectivity, thereby disrupting on-going task processing. In this paper, we propose a task offloading scheme by exploiting multi-hop vehicle computation resources in VEC based on mobility analysis of vehicles. In addition to the vehicles within one hop from the task vehicle that generates computation tasks, certain multi-hop vehicles that meet the given requirements in terms of link connectivity and computation capacity, are also leveraged to carry out the tasks offloaded by the task vehicle. An optimization problem is formulated for the task vehicle to minimize the weighted sum of execution time and computation cost of all tasks. A semidefinite relaxation approach with an adaptive adjustment procedure is proposed to solve the formulated optimization problem for obtaining the corresponding offloading decisions. The simulation results show that our proposed offloading scheme can achieve significant improvement in terms of response delay by at least 34% compared with the other algorithms (e.g., local processing and random offloading).},

The 6th Generation (6G) communication technology is expected to provide 3-Dimensional (3D) wireless coverage and greatly improve the performance of UAV networks. The UAV-to-UAV (U2U) message exchange (or message exchange for short) is an important basis of multi-UAV cooperation. However, due to the unique characteristics of UAV networks, the U2U messages (or messages for short) are vulnerable to both the external and internal attackers. In this work, we propose a Lightweight Trustworthy Message Exchange (LTME) scheme for UAV networks by efficiently aggregating the cryptography and trust management technologies. In the LTME scheme, a centralized Ground Control Station (GCS) periodically updates the reputation levels of registered UAVs (or UAVs for short) and securely distributes secret values to the UAVs. Based on the received secret values, each trustworthy broadcasting UAV can generate its encrypted messages so that only trustworthy receiving UAVs can decrypt them, and each trustworthy receiving UAV can accurately judge whether the received messages and the corresponding broadcasting UAVs are trustworthy in a lightweight manner. Furthermore, we present a simplified LTME (sLTME) scheme and conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis and simulation evaluation for the LTME and sLTME schemes. The results demonstrate that the proposed schemes can provide rich functionality and strong robustness with low computation and communication overheads, and are significantly superior to the existing schemes in several aspects.},

An in-vehicle controller area network (CAN) bus is an important issue in in-vehicle security, and some hackers have mastered remote vehicle control methods through the CAN bus network. This paper proposes an improved isolation forest method with data mass (MS-iForest) for data tampering attack detection, in which we use data mass instead of the number of divisions and give an anomaly score ranking to quantify the degree of anomalies. This method is promising to be used as part of the intrusion detection system, like a security component in the onboard gateway, which can effectively avoid the data tampering attacks. We compare the proposed method with other anomaly detection schemes based on the data collected from an in-vehicle simulated dataset and two standard datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method performs better than the other anomaly detection schemes in terms of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC).},

  abstract     = {Satellite-ground integrated vehicular network can provision ubiquitous and unlimited network connectivity for massive vehicles, and is expected to play a vital role in 6G-supported intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, due to its high-dynamic channel environments and limited satellite payload, the uplink synchronization has become a major bottleneck to restrict vehicular communication performance. Focusing on maintaining reliable uplink synchronization, we propose an efficient timing advance (TA) update approach in this paper. Specifically, an enhanced preamble format is first presented based on the periodical pairing sounding reference signals (SRSs), which enables the satellite to continuously track uplink timing variation with a low signaling overhead. By taking full advantage of all the fourth-order autocorrelation produces from the received preamble, we further design a novel timing metric consisted of the correlation and differential normalization functions, which is capable of having a considerably increased correlation length and shaper mainlobe, as compared to the existing ones. Through theoretical performance analysis, it is indicated that the proposed approach not only notably promotes class distance between the correct and wrong timing indexes, but also can achieve the immunity to multi-path effect and large carrier frequency offset (CFO), while having a reduced computational complexity. Simulation results in a typical low-earth-orbit (LEO) scenario reveal the superiority of our approach in terms of the false alarm probability, the missed detection probability, as well as the timing mean square error.},

  abstract     = {Massive machine type communication (mMTC) is one of the core components of 6G communication systems to fulfil the demand of massive connectivity of billions of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Due to its various advantages, grant-free random access schemes are considered as a promising technique to implement mMTC. The key to grant-free random access is active device detection at the base station. In this paper, firstly we introduce the odd total squared correlation (OTSC) of binary signature sets, then derive a corresponding lower bound. Systematic constructions of optimal signature sets based on the known odd periodic complementary sets (OPCS), almost binary sequences, large Kasami subsets and ideal sequences are presented, which are all optimal with respect to the derived OTSC lower bound. Next, it is demonstrated that the optimal OTSC signature sets can be effectively used in massive device activity detection. Using efficient approximate message passing with minimum mean squared error (AMP-MMSE) algorithm, it is shown that the sensing matrices arising from OTSC-optimal signature sets and periodic total squared correlation (PTSC)-optimal signature sets performs better than the popular Gaussian random matrix.},

However, the growingly sophisticated attacks against 5G-enabled ITS (5G-ITS) might cause serious damages to the valuable data generated by various ITS applications. Therefore, establishing a secure 5G-ITS through trust evaluation against potential threats has become a key objective. Furthermore, as a distributed shared ledger and database, Blockchain has the characteristics of non-tampering, traceability, openness and transparency, can support both trust storage and trust verification for trust evaluation. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous Blockchain based Hierarchical Trust Evaluation strategy, named BHTE, utilizing the federated deep learning technology for 5G-ITS. Specifically, the trusts of ITS users and task distributers are evaluated using the federated deep learning and hierarchical incentive mechanisms are designed for reasonable and fair rewards and punishments. Moreover, the trusts of ITS users and task distributers are stored on heterogeneous and hierarchical blockchains for trust verification. The extensive experiment results show that: (i) the proposed BHTE can achieve reasonable and fair trust evaluations on both ITS users and task distributers; (ii) the BHTE performs excellently with high system throughput and low latency.},

  abstract     = {The huge amount of data produced in the 6G networks not only brings new challenges to the reliability and efficiency of mobile devices but also drives rapid development of new storage techniques. With the benefits of fast access speed and high reliability, NAND flash memory has become a promising storage solution for the 6G networks. In this paper, we investigate a protograph-coded bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative detection and decoding (BICM-ID) utilizing irregular mapping (IM) in the NAND flash-memory systems. First, we propose an enhanced protograph-based extrinsic information transfer (EPEXIT) algorithm to facilitate the analysis of protograph codes in the IM-BICM-ID systems. With the use of EPEXIT algorithm, a simple design method is conceived for the construction of a family of high-rate protograph codes, called irregular-mapped accumulate-repeat-accumulate (IMARA) codes, which possess excellent decoding thresholds and linear-minimum-distance-growth property. Furthermore, motivated by the voltage-region iterative gain characteristics of IM-BICM-ID systems, a novel read-voltage optimization scheme is developed to acquire accurate read-voltage levels, thus minimizing the decoding thresholds (in dB) of protograph codes. Analyses and simulations indicate that the proposed IMARA-aided IM-BICM-ID scheme and read-voltage optimization scheme remarkably improve the convergence and decoding performance of flash-memory systems. Thus, the proposed protograph-coded IM-BICM-ID can be viewed as a reliable and efficient storage solution for the new-generation mobile networks, such as Internet of Vehicles.},

  abstract     = {6G networks provide faster communication for connected vehicles. These vehicles are connected to the Internet, forming the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Due to the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), more and more vehicles are deployed with data-intensive applications. These applications interact heavily with IoT devices at the edge of the network, which causes IoT devices to consume a lot of limited and valuable power. Task offloading can help overcome resource constraints of IoT devices by offloading task to edge server which has sufficient computational power in ITS. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is a promising solution by serving as Computing-Communications Edge Server (CCES) for resource-constrained IoT devices that there is no edge server nearby that can offload task. Due to the IoT devices’ limited battery capacity and UAV energy budget, it is a challenging issue to reduce the energy for task offloading in UAV-enable edge network. In this paper, an UAV-enabled Computing-Communications Intelligent Offloading (UAV-CCIO) scheme is proposed to offload task energy-efficiently. First, some nodes with a large amount of data are selected as Task Gathering Nodes (TGNs), and TGNs collect all the tasks of the left nodes. In this way, the UAV can only fly the TGNs and so all the IoT devices’ tasks can be offloaded. The distance needed for the UAV can be greatly reduced and energy is saved. On the other hand, tasks that route to TGNs have a relatively small amount of data, while nodes with a large amount of data have already been selected as TGNs without routing, thus saving energy. Second, an optimization strategy for collection tasks is proposed to reduce UAV’s energy. The extensive experimental simulations indicate that the performance of UAV-CCIO scheme is better than the existing scheme.},

As a result, the requirements of securing data exchange between vehicles, autonomous or otherwise, have also increased tremendously. Securing data transfer and keeping a record of each transaction becomes a necessity in IoV/IATS. In this paper, we propose some optimized security algorithms using symmetric encryption for secure multimedia data transfer between vehicles. The main feature of these optimized algorithms is that they use a lower amount of data to generate fingerprints. The algorithms convert approximately &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$3.7 \times 10^{5}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; samples of data into 3600 samples to generate the fingerprint. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to fetch the highest three peak values of the signal in the frequency domain. A centralized server authenticates the data transfer by comparing the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$HASH$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; of the fingerprints and also keeps the transaction record.

In light of this disruptive transformation, the Right-Of-Way (ROW) composition of road space has the potential to be renewed. Design approaches and intelligent control models have been proposed to address this problem, but we lack an operational framework that can dynamically generate ROW plans for AVs and pedestrians in response to real-time demand. Based on microscopic traffic simulation, this study explores Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods for evolving ROW compositions. We implement a centralised learning paradigm and a distributive learning paradigm to separately perform the dynamic control on several road network configurations. Experimental results indicate that the algorithms have the potential to improve traffic flow efficiency and allocate more space for pedestrians. Furthermore, the distributive learning algorithm outperforms its centralised counterpart regarding computational cost (49.55%), benchmark rewards (25.35%), best cumulative rewards (24.58%), optimal actions (13.49%) and rate of convergence. This novel road management technique could potentially contribute to the flow-adaptive and active mobility-friendly streets in the AVs era.},

In addition, a novel coil-based detection system for wireless chargeable drone applications is proposed to activate the desired transmitter module based on the position of the receiver coil. The detection system consists of an array of coil rectennas integrated with a switching circuit to reduce the undesired magnetic field, enhancing the link efficiency. The prototype of the charging pad is fabricated using Litz wire, and the S21-based link efficiency is measured using an experimental setup. Besides, the fabricated coil rectenna sensor array system demonstrates a real-application model of the detection system. Hence, the proposed transmitter pad improves lateral misalignment tolerance and is considered a potential wireless drone charging system design.},

  abstract     = {As a significant topic in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), vehicle Re-Identification (Re-ID) has attracted increasing research attention. However, the variation of shooting scenes and the similar appearance among the vehicles with the same type and color lead to large intra-class variances and small inter-class variances, respectively. To address the problems, we propose a novel Mask-Aware Reasoning Transformer (MART) to extract the background-unrelated global features and perspective-invariant local features. The MART contains three effective modules including Foreground Global Features Extraction (FGFE), Mask-guided Local Features Extraction (MLFE) and Cross-images Local Features Reasoning (CLFR). Firstly, due to the complexity of background information in images, identity representation inevitably contains background elements, which may impact identity matching. To address this issue, we propose the FGFE to extract background-independent global features by introducing the mask semantic information to the inputs of Vision Transformer (ViT). Secondly, to fill the gap that the previous local features extraction methods cannot be directly applied to ViT, the MLFE is presented to extract distinctive local features by recombining token features according to vehicle mask. Thirdly, when local components are invisible in the image due to the occlusion problem, the corresponding local information is absent from the image, leading to unreliable local features. To solve this problem, the CLFR is proposed to reason the occluded local features by exploiting the correlation between cross-image local features. We carry out comprehensive experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of the MART on two challenging datasets.},

For outdoor point clouds in urban transportation scenes, the mismatch of sampling patterns and the transferability difference between classes make cross-domain segmentation extremely difficult. To overcome these challenges, we propose a category-level adversarial framework. Firstly, we propose a multi-scale domain conditioned block that facilitates to extract the critical low-level domain-dependent knowledge and reduce the domain gap caused by distinct LiDAR sampling patterns. Secondly, we make full use of multiple representation forms (i.e., point-based sets and voxel-based cells) and utilize the prediction consistency between the two forms to measure how well each point is semantically aligned. The model then focuses on the poorly-aligned points without affecting the well-aligned points. Experimental results on three autonomous driving point cloud datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods by a large margin, especially on the low-beam to high-beam cross-domain segmentation task.},

  abstract     = {Traditional path-finding studies basically focus on planning the path with the shortest travel distance or the least travel time over city road networks. In recent years, with the increasing needs of diverse routing services in smart cities, the bi-criteria optimum path-finding problem (i.e., minimizing path distance and optimizing extra cost or utility according to users’ preference) has drawn wide attention. For instance, in addition to distance, the previous studies further find routes with more scenery (utility) or less crime risk (cost). However, existing works are scenario-oriented which optimize specific cost or utility, ignoring that the routing planner should be universal to deal with both cost and utility in different real-life scenarios. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a generic bi-criteria optimum path-finding framework (cuRL) based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Specifically, we design a novel state representation and reward function for the DRL model of cuRL to overcome the challenges that 1) the cost and utility should be optimized with minimal path distance in a unified manner; 2) the diverse distributions of cost and utility in various scenarios should be well-addressed. Then, a transition preprocessing method is proposed to enable the efficient training of DRL and avoid detours. Finally, simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of cuRL, where two criteria (i.e., solar radiation and crime risk) are modelled based on the real-world data in downtown New York. Comparing with a set of baseline algorithms, the evaluation results demonstrate the priority of the proposed framework for its generality.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles are taking a leap forward by performing operations without human intervention through continuous monitoring of their surroundings using multiple sensors. Images gathered through vehicle mounted cameras can be large, requiring specialized storage such as cloud. However, cloud data centres can be prone to security and privacy challenges. A partial image-based, homomorphic searchable encryption scheme is proposed, which uses pixel-level encryption to identify objects within encrypted images. The scheme provides Object-Trapdoor and Trapdoor-Image indistinguishability – as the trapdoors are probabilistic. The proposed scheme is deployed on a cloud data centre and tested over a real data set. The proposed scheme reduces storage overhead by approximately 20 times, and is 33 times more efficient compared to the generic Paillier homomorphic searchable encryption scheme. Security analysis demonstrates that the scheme maintains high levels of security and privacy.},

  abstract     = {Road accidents are often caused by short abnormal events, including traffic violations, abrupt change in vehicular motion, driver fatigue, etc. Observing an accident event from the right camera perspective plays a crucial role while detecting accidents. However, it may not be possible to capture such abnormal events from a limited camera perspective. We present a deep learning framework to analyze the accident events recorded from multiple perspectives. First, we estimate feature similarity in videos recorded from multiple perspectives. We then divided the video samples into high and low feature similarity groups. Next, we extract spatio-temporal features from each group using two-branch DCNNs and fuse them using a rank-based weighted average pooling strategy followed by classification. We present a new road accident video dataset (MP-RAD), where each accident event is synthetically generated and captured from five independent camera perspectives using a computer gaming platform. Most of the existing road accident datasets use egocentric views or they are captured in fixed camera setups. However, our dataset is large and multi-perspective that can be used to validate ITS-related tasks such as accident detection, accident localization, traffic monitoring, etc. The dataset contains 400 accident events with a total of 2000 videos. We provide temporal annotations of all videos. The proposed framework and the dataset have been cross-validated with latest accident detection baselines trained on real-world road accident videos and vice-versa. The sub-optimal detection accuracy obtained using the baselines indicates that the proposed framework and the dataset can be useful for ITS related research.

This paper proposes a robust backtracking cubature Kalman filter (CKF) approach based on Krein space theory to overcome these issues. Specifically, considering the effect of dynamic model uncertainties of the alignment process, a linear robust filter and the existence conditions of optimal estimation are constructed to restrain the uncertainty interference according to Krein space theory. Meanwhile, an adaptive window adjustment algorithm is designed to intelligently determine the backtracking interval in different backtracking filtering stages and cross-scene motion environments, which is founded on the innovation variance gradient detection. Furthermore, using the statistical linearization scheme, the quasi-linear CKF model is derived to assist in resolving the nonlinear large misalignment angle within the Krein linear space framework for In-motion alignment. Experimental verification results from a vehicle In-motion alignment test illustrate that the proposed Krein backtracking CKF approach is effective in improving the alignment accuracy and shortening the alignment time simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {Accurate short-term traffic prediction plays a pivotal role in various smart mobility operation and management systems. Currently, most of the state-of-the-art prediction models are based on graph neural networks (Gnns), and the required training samples are proportional to the size of the traffic network. In many cities, the available amount of traffic data is substantially below the minimum requirement due to the data collection expense. It is still an open question to develop traffic prediction models with a small size of training data on large-scale networks. We notice that the traffic states of a node for the near future only depend on the traffic states of its localized neighborhoods, which can be represented using the graph relational inductive biases. In view of this, this paper develops a graph network (Gn)-based deep learning model LocaleGn that depicts the traffic dynamics using localized data aggregating and updating functions, as well as the node-wise recurrent neural networks. LocaleGn is a light-weighted model designed for training on few samples without over-fitting, and hence it can solve the problem of few-sample traffic prediction. The proposed model is examined on predicting both traffic speed and flow with six datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that LocaleGn outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline models. It is also demonstrated that the learned knowledge from LocaleGn can be transferred across cities. The research outcomes can help to develop light-weighted traffic prediction systems, especially for cities lacking historically archived traffic data.},

  abstract     = {Analyzing the impact of the environment on drivers’ stress level and workload is of high importance for designing human-centered driver-vehicle interaction systems and to ultimately help build a safer driving experience. However, driver’s state, including stress level and workload, are latent variables that cannot be measured on their own and should be estimated through sensor measurements such as psychophysiological measures. We propose using a latent-variable state-space modeling framework for driver state analysis. By using latent-variable state-space models, we model drivers’ workload and stress levels as latent variables estimated through multimodal human sensing data, under the perturbations of the environment in a state-space format and in a holistic manner. Through using a case study of multimodal driving data collected from 11 participants, we first estimate the latent stress level and workload of drivers from their heart rate, gaze measures, and intensity of facial action units. We then show that external contextual elements such as the number of vehicles as a proxy for traffic density and secondary task demands may be associated with changes in driver’s stress levels and workload. We also show that different drivers may be impacted differently by the aforementioned perturbations. We found out that drivers’ latent states at previous timesteps are highly associated with their current states. Additionally, we discuss the utility of state-space models in analyzing the possible lag between the two latent variables of stress level and workload, which might be indicative of information transmission between the different parts of the driver’s psychophysiology in the wild.},

  abstract     = {Detecting pedestrians is a challenging computer vision task, especially in the intelligent transportation system. Mainstream pedestrian detection methods purely utilize information of bounding boxes, which overlooks the role of other valuable attributes (e.g., head, head-shoulders, and keypoints) of pedestrians and leads to sub-optimal solutions. Some works leveraged these valuable attributes with a minor performance improvement at the expense of increased computational complexity during the inference phase. To alleviate this dilemma, we propose a simple yet effective method, namely Detachable crowd Density estimation Assisted pedestrian Detection (DDAD), which leverages the crowd density attributes to assist pedestrian detection in the real-world scenes (e.g., crowded scenes and small-scale pedestrian scenes). The advantage of the crowd density estimation is that it allows the network to focus more on the human head and the small-scale pedestrians, which improves the features representation of pedestrians heavily occluded or far from cameras. Our DDAD works on a principle of multi-task learning and can be seamlessly applied to both one-stage and two-stage pedestrian detectors by equipping them with an extra detachable branch of crowd density estimation. The equipped crowd density estimation branch is trained with the annotations derived from the existing pedestrian bounding box annotations, occurring no extra annotation cost. Moreover, it can be removed during the inference phase without sacrificing the inference speed. Extensive experiments conducted on two challenging datasets, i.e., CrowdHuman and CityPersons, demonstrate that our proposed DDAD achieves a significant improvement upon the state-of-the-art methods.

In this contribution, we propose a multi-sensor integration system for high-precision vehicle navigation, based on the fusion of GNSS PPP-RTK, MEMS IMU, and wheel odometer. Meanwhile, to fully use the physical characteristics of vehicle-specific motion, vehicle motion constraints (VMC) are used in conjunction with the wheel odometer. In the proposed system, the data from all sensors and vehicle motion constraints are tightly integrated into Kalman Filter. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed system, a series of real urban vehicle-borne experiments including different scenarios were conducted. Results indicate that using the proposed system, the position error RMS is (0.02 m, 0.02 m, 0.06 m) in the east, north, and vertical directions, with 95.2% availability of high-precision positioning (horizontal &lt;10 cm, vertical &lt;20 cm). The continuous and stable high-precision positioning could be maintained in the typical scenarios of GNSS degradation, such as boulevards, viaducts and tunnels. In addition, tests with simulated GNSS outages statistically demonstrate that this proposed system is capable of achieving 5.3 ‰ dead reckoning error with a maximum position error of 0.86 m in the case of simulated 30 s outages.},

  abstract     = {Flight Trajectory Prediction (TP) is an essential task in Air Traffic Control (ATC). Currently, the TP task is usually achieved by regression approaches, which concatenates several scalar attributes of the observation into a low-dimensional vector as the inputs. However, it is difficult to accurately model aircraft motion patterns using low-dimensional features in complex and time-varying ATC environments. To improve the performance of the TP task, in this paper, a novel framework, called FlightBERT, is proposed based on Binary Encoding (BE) representation, which enables us to tackle the TP task as a multi binary classification problem. Specifically, the scalar attributes of the flight trajectory are encoded into binary codes and transformed into a high-dimensional representation by the attribute embedding module. Considering the prior knowledge among flight attributes, an Attribute Correlation Attention (ACoAtt) block is designed to explicitly capture the correlations among the specific attributes. A stacked Transformer block is applied to serve as the backbone network, which is followed by the predictor to generate the outputs. Considering the nature of flight trajectory, a hybrid constrained loss, i.e., combining the mean square error loss with the binary cross-entropy loss, is innovatively designed to optimize the proposed framework. The proposed method is validated on a large-scale dataset, which is collected from the real-world ATC environment. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other baselines by quantitative and qualitative evaluations.},

  abstract     = {Various sensors are adopted by autonomous driving systems to perceive objects and surroundings. Thus, the multi-sensor data fusion techniques become essential to combine different sensors’ advantages for better perception performance. However, the current multi-sensor data fusion techniques suffer from the high cost of computation resources, low expansibility for more diverse sensors, and insufficient systematic consideration for modeling. This paper first constructs a detachable and expansible multi-sensor data fusion model based on three main modules: front fusion, global fusion, and synthesizer, where the methods for flexible association gating and virtual targets have been designed. The model can be disassembled and configured for different trim levels of vehicles and is easily expansible for adding more heterogeneous sensors. Next, the presented multi-sensor data fusion model is compared with the cheap Joint Probabilistic Data Association (C-JPDA) method. The comparison shows the superior accuracy of the designed model on false association and effective narrowing of the variance of object detection. Finally, the presented multi-sensor data fusion model is integrated into an embedded system and experimented on urban roads and highways with the engaged Level 3 autonomous driving function. The experiment results indicate that the proposed model has excellent sensor data fusion performance and provides accurate and timely object information in the Level 3 autonomous driving system.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in monocular 3D detection leverage a depth estimation network explicitly as an intermediate stage of the 3D detection network. Depth map approaches yield more accurate depth to objects than other methods thanks to the depth estimation network trained on a large-scale dataset. However, depth map approaches can be limited by the accuracy of the depth map, and sequentially using two separated networks for depth estimation and 3D detection significantly increases computation cost and inference time. In this work, we propose a method to boost the RGB image-based 3D detector by jointly training the detection network with a depth prediction loss analogous to the depth estimation task. In this way, our 3D detection network can be supervised by more depth supervision from raw LiDAR points, which does not require any human annotation cost, to estimate accurate depth without explicitly predicting the depth map. Our novel object-centric depth prediction loss focuses on depth around foreground objects, which is important for 3D object detection, to leverage pixel-wise depth supervision in an object-centric manner. Our depth regression model is further trained to predict the uncertainty of depth to represent the 3D confidence of objects. To effectively train the 3D detector with raw LiDAR points and to enable end-to-end training, we revisit the regression target of 3D objects and design a network architecture. Extensive experiments on KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks show that our method can significantly boost the monocular image-based 3D detector to outperform depth map approaches while maintaining the real-time inference speed.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is an emerging technology that can significantly improve the efficiency of transportation systems and mitigate traffic accidents by exchanging traffic-related messages or announcements. Nevertheless, there has not been a consensus on how to generate, distribute, and validate trustworthy announcements in such an untrusted wireless environment. Security and privacy, inspiration mechanism, and resource integration are significant challenges for announcement generation and dissemination. In this paper, a secure and trustworthy announcement dissemination scheme is realized for location-based service (LBS) application in VANET. A blockchain-assisted vehicular cloud (VC) architecture is proposed to harvest underutilized heterogeneous resources of vehicles participating in VANET. Moreover, the technologies of blockchain and smart contract are adopted to classify vehicles into different levels automatically by bidding for bonuses. What’s more, vehicles can generate trustworthy announcements with the help of neighbor vehicles by adopting the technology of threshold signature. Meanwhile, the reputation of announcements is evaluated for trust management. Formal security analysis shows that the proposed scheme satisfies fundamental security and privacy requirements in VANET. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is robust and efficient.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent maritime transportation is one of the most promising enabling technologies for promoting trade efficiency and releasing the physical labor force. The trajectory prediction method is the foundation to guarantee collision avoidance and route optimization for ship transportation. This article proposes a bidirectional data-driven trajectory prediction method based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) spatio-temporal data to improve the accuracy of ship trajectory prediction and reduce the risk of accidents. Our study constructs an encoder-decoder network driven by a forward and reverse comprehensive historical trajectory and then fuses the characteristics of the sub-network to predict the ship trajectory. The AIS historical trajectory data of US West Coast ships are employed to investigate the feasibility of the proposed method. Compared with the current methods, the proposed approach lessens the prediction error by studying the comprehensive historical trajectory, and 60.28% has reduced the average prediction error. The ocean and port trajectory data are analyzed in maritime transportation before and after COVID-19. The prediction error in the port area is reduced by 95.17% than the data before the epidemic. Our work helps the prediction of maritime ship trajectory, provides valuable services for maritime safety, and performs detailed insights for the analysis of trade conditions in different sea areas before and after the epidemic.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of self-driving vehicles, autonomous driving systems will have to rely on a vast number of heterogeneous sensors to perform dynamic perception of the surrounding environment. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems increase the resolution of conventional mass-market radars by exploiting the vehicle’s ego-motion, requiring very accurate knowledge of the trajectory, usually not compatible with automotive-grade navigation systems. In this setting, radar data are typically used to refine the navigation-based trajectory estimation with so-called autofocus algorithms. Although widely used in remote sensing applications, where the timeliness of the imaging is not an issue, autofocus in automotive scenarios calls for simple yet effective processing options to enable real-time environment imaging. This paper aims at providing a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the autofocus requirements in typical automotive scenarios. We analytically derive the effects of navigation-induced trajectory estimation errors on SAR imaging, in terms of defocusing and wrong targets’ localization. Then, we propose a motion estimation and compensation workflow tailored to automotive applications, leveraging a set of stationary Ground Control Points (GCPs) in the low-resolution radar images (before SAR focusing). We theoretically discuss the impact of the GCPs position and focusing height on SAR imaging, highlighting common pitfalls and possible countermeasures. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed technique employing experimental data gathered during open road campaign by a 77 GHz multiple-input multiple-output radar mounted in a forward-looking configuration.},

  abstract     = {The next-generation Internet of vehicles (IoVs) seamlessly connects humans, vehicles, roadside units (RSUs), and service platforms, to improve road safety, enhance transit efficiency, and deliver comfort while conserving the environment. Currently, numerous entities communicate in the IoVs environment via insecure public channels that are susceptible to a variety of security assaults and threats. To address these security challenges, we design an anonymous authenticated key exchange mechanism for the IoVs in smart transportation supported by blockchain, referred to as AAKE-BIVT. AAKE-BIVT securely transmits traffic information to a cluster head, before heading to a nearby RSU utilizing the established secret session keys via mutual authentication and key agreement. A cloud server (CS) then securely aggregates data from related RSUs and generates transactions. The CS combines the transactions into blocks in a peer-to-peer network of CSs, and the blocks are confirmed and added to the blockchain via a voting-based consensus method. By means of rigorous informal security studies and formal security analysis through the random oracle model, we reveal that the proposed AAKE-BIVT is resistant to a broad range of potential security assaults in the IoVs environment. Furthermore, a comparative study reveals that AAKE-BIVT outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques, in terms of security and functionality while being more efficient in terms of communication and computation. Additionally, the blockchain simulation validates the implementation viability of our proposed AAKE-BIVT.},

The railway alignment determining the layout of structures plays an important role in ecological protection. This paper presents a railway alignment optimization model based on multiobjective bi-level programming (MBRAO). The upper level of MBRAO is a horizontal alignment optimization for the minimization of investment and ecological impacts from tunnel drainage and train noise. A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) solves the horizontal alignment optimization and naturally maintains population diversity. The lower level of MBRAO is a vertical alignment optimization for investment minimization. A self-adaptive differential evolution (DE) algorithm adjusting essential parameters based on optimization status solves the vertical alignment optimization efficiently. MBRAO is applied in multistage at both levels to find the suitable numbers of horizontal and vertical points of intersection. This paper introduces three kinds of vertical feature data generated corresponding to horizontal feature data to define different site modification costs on the bridge, subgrade, and tunnel structures. A real-world case study at Wolong Reserve is studied to verify the effectiveness of MBRAO based on a customized geographic information system (GIS).},

This paper proposes an adaptive AirMatrix model to obtain the block size of AirMatrix that is calculated through the acceptable track deviation of quadcopters by considering GPS signal quality and wind field. First, the acceptable GPS-induced deviation is calculated to meet the safety tolerance by analyzing the distributions of GPS-induced deviation under different signal quality levels. Second, a dynamic modeling and simulation method is applied to assess the wind impact on the track deviation accurately. The wind-induced deviation is calculated using a wind effect model considering surface friction and turbulence. Results show that the proposed model can reduce airspace conserveness by providing 45 percent available blocks more than the previous model. By considering the wind impact, the adaptive AirMatrix improves the safety performance of blocks at levels ranging from 4.9% to 95.5%, compared with the model without considering wind impact. The adaptive AirMatrix model provides a delicate and targeted approach to design airspace for quadcopters, which benefits traffic management in Urban Air Mobility.},

  abstract     = {Recently significant progress has been made in 3D detection. However, it is still challenging to detect small contour objects under complex scenes. This paper proposes a novel Attention-based Multi-phase Multi-task Fusion (AMMF) that uses point-level, RoI-level, and multi-task fusions to complement the disadvantages of LiDAR and camera, to solve this challenge. First, at the feature extraction phase, AMMF uses the Low and High-level Fusion with Matching Attention (LHF-MA) and efficient FPN (eFPN) to perform point-level fusion for cross sensors and single sensor, respectively. Instead of merging each level and using expensive 3D CNN like other methods, LHF-MA fuses low-level spatial location and high-level contextual feature of 2D CNN customized feature extractors and ignores the fusion of middle levels, reducing the computational cost. Then, at the proposal generation phase, Progressive Proposal Fusion (PPF) with learned attention map is used to perform coarse-to-fine RoI-level fusion, instead of only combining coarse-grained features at high-level of network. PPF using progressively increasing IoU thresholds could avoid overfitting and improve the performance. Note that the matching attentions and learned attention maps are utilized to weigh the priority of different sensors. Moreover, to solve the sparseness of point-wise fusion between LiDAR BEV and RGB image, AMMF uses multi-task fusion that generates pseudo-LiDAR from camera by depth estimation task, to guide this point-wise fusion. Finally, AMMF performs excellently for detecting small contour objects like pedestrians, cyclists, and distant cars. On the KITTI, AMMF finishes 3.62% improvements in the moderate instance for pedestrians. It achieves a 2.21% improvement in the &gt;50 instance of LEVEL_2 level for vehicle on the Waymo Open Dataset. And AMMF is further verified on our customized dataset consisting of challenging scenarios like strong illumination and heavy shadow cases.},

The goal of MRRP is to plan the shortest route that meets the requests specified by the user. However, because MRRP is an NP-hard problem, most existing methods involve the use of greedy search in the planning of approximate routes, leaving much room for improvement in route quality. Therefore, in this study, an anytime algorithm called one-way search (OWS) was proposed to efficiently solve MRRP queries. OWS integrates branch-and-bound and greedy search. It not only helped rapidly detect an accepted route but also allowed for more optimal routes to be iteratively generated until the most optimal route was identified. OWS has three pruning mechanisms named Filter, Potential, and Petrifaction and three operations named Wilting, Selection, and Reverse Update to avoid unnecessary searches and improve search efficiency. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study of MRRP queries that investigates both optimal route planning and searching efficiency. The experimental results obtained on real-world POI datasets indicated that OWS outperformed state-of-the-art anytime algorithms in terms of quality and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning-based pavement cracks detection methods often require large-scale labels with detailed crack location information to learn accurate predictions. In practice, however, crack locations are very difficult to be manually annotated due to various visual patterns of pavement crack. In this paper, we propose a Deep Domain Adaptation-based Crack Detection Network (DDACDN), which learns domain invariant features by taking advantage of the source domain knowledge to predict the multi-category crack location information in the target domain, where only image-level labels are available. Specifically, DDACDN first extracts crack features from both the source and target domain by a two-branch weights-shared backbone network. And in an effort to achieve the cross-domain adaptation, an intermediate domain is constructed by aggregating the three-scale features from the feature space of each domain to adapt the crack features from the source domain to the target domain. Finally, the network involves the knowledge of both domains and is trained to recognize and localize pavement cracks. To facilitate accurate training and validation for domain adaptation, we use two challenging pavement crack datasets CQU-BPDD and RDD2020. Furthermore, we construct a new large-scale Bituminous Pavement Multi-label Disease Dataset named CQU-BPMDD, which contains 38994 high-resolution pavement disease images to further evaluate the robustness of our model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDACDN outperforms state-of-the-art pavement crack detection methods in predicting the crack location on the target domain.},

More importantly, it is difficult for different CAVs to collaborate and share knowledge. To remedy that, this paper proposes a selective federated reinforcement learning (SFRL) strategy to achieve online knowledge aggregation strategy to improve the accuracy and environmental adaptability of the autonomous driving model. First, we propose a federated reinforcement learning framework that allows participants to use the knowledge of other CAVs to make corresponding actions, thereby realizing online knowledge transfer and aggregation. Second, we use reinforcement learning to train local driving models of CAVs to cope with collision avoidance tasks. Third, considering the efficiency of federated learning (FL) and the additional communication overhead it brings, we propose a CAVs selection strategy before uploading local models. When selecting CAVs, we consider the reputation of CAVs, the quality of local models, and time overhead, so as to select as many high-quality users as possible while considering resources and time constraints. With above strategic processes, our framework can aggregate and reuse the knowledge learned by CAVs traveling in different environments to assist in driving decisions. Extensive simulation results validate that our proposal can improve model accuracy and learning efficiency while reducing communication overhead.},

The spatio-temporal mismatch between supply (available vehicles) and demand (passenger requests) deteriorates e-hailing platforms’ performance. Hence, repositioning available vehicles can be productive. In this paper, we propose a real-time repositioning method in ride-sourcing systems that considers both the responsiveness to immediate demand and the long-term (i.e., several hours) operational efficiency simultaneously. The proposed approach integrates the solutions of two procedures: i) a single-agent Markov Decision Process (MDP) model to evaluate the long-term influence of the repositioning on platform efficiency and ii) a binary linear program (BLP) to tackle the multi-driver repositioning problem in real-time taking into account the elapsed time of each not-responded order. Numerical experiments using real-world demand data with impatient passengers and contractors (i.e., drivers) demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several repositioning benchmarks with regard to platform efficiency, e.g., reducing order cancellations, passengers’ experience, e.g., reducing waiting times, and drivers’ gains, e.g., increasing occupied rates.},

Since the human body is much sensitive to the vertical vibration of 4 -8 Hz, the main objective is dedicated to deal with the vibration challenge that matches the characteristics of the human body by applying the finite-frequency technique. Firstly, the uncertain quarter-vehicle active suspension model with dynamic damping in-wheel motor driven system is established, in which in-wheel motor is suspended as dynamic vibration absorber(DVA) to isolate the force transmitted to motor bearing in IWM-ASS. Based on the framework of generalized Kalman–Yakubovich–Popov lemma and stability theory, then the performance index of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${H} _{\infty }$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; norm from external disturbance to controlled output for IWM-ASS is attenuated within the concerned frequency range while other system requirements such as parameter uncertainty, suspension deflection constraint and actuator saturation are also guaranteed in controller design. The resulting robust finite frequency state feedback &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${H} _{\infty }$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; controller is finally designed utilizing two new theorems, and solved via a set of linear matrix inequalities. Simulations for frequency-domain and time-domain responses are implemented and compared with the entire frequency control method to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. It can be concluded from the results that the developed control strategy can effectively attenuate the negative vibration and enhance ride comfort and road-holding ability for electric vehicles of IWM-ASS.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic environments are challenging for anchor-free mapping using lidar in intelligent driving. This study imitates anchor-based approaches such as magnetic nails by applying novel Static Confidence Criteria (SCC) to the point-cloud semantic candidates to ensure their robustness. We name such verified features Pseudo-Anchors (P-A) as they hold similar properties to the anchor nodes: The P-A nodes are improbably formed by dynamic objects, and nodes’ blockage state can be immediately noticed once they are occluded. Another major challenge for mapping is improving large-scale global performance without sacrificing local consistency. Unrecognized GNSS pose drift may deteriorate local trajectory accuracy through post-processing such as graph optimization. In this study, we use the road network to provide the intersection information as a prior so that the GNSS can be better regarded as a reliable anchor factor. Three experiments are designed for this study. The first is ablations to verify the P-A concept; The second proves that the P-A-based lidar odometry outperformed the LOAM-based mainstream methods in highly dynamic scenarios; The third shows that our usage of the GNSS strengthens large-scale maps’ global consistency while causing less deterioration towards the local one. As a knowledge-based method, the P-A concept shows a high deployment efficiency, indicating the potential for migration to other features or even other sensors.},

  abstract     = {Safely and efficiently completing unprotected left turns at intersections is challenging for both automated vehicles and human drivers, given that it is hard to predict the intentions of other road users. Currently, automated vehicles are inclined to adopt an overly conservative policy for safety reasons. And experienced drivers respond to right-of-way competition by employing “negotiation” skills to improve efficiency, mainly through steering, braking and acceleration. However, negotiations do not always go smoothly, and a phenomenon similar to “pedestrian face-off” is called “vehicle face-off”, specifically speaking, this host vehicle and vehicles involved in the competition perform the same maneuvers (acceleration or deceleration) continuously and simultaneously, leading to reduced efficiency and safety. In this paper, a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method is proposed based on deep convolutional fuzzy systems (DCFS) for automated vehicles to deal with unprotected left-turn scenarios on urban roads. A total of 30 subjects participated in the experiment, and the results show that the proposed method can provide human-like driving skills for automated vehicles, and effectively avoid “vehicle face-off” to improve the efficiency of unprotected left turns on the premise of ensuring safety.},

  abstract     = {According to the surveys of the World Health Organization, distracted driving is one of main causes of road traffic accidents. To improve road traffic safety, real-time detection of drivers’ driving behavior is very important for the development of highly reliable Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). At present, the deep learning architecture based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has disadvantages such as large number of parameters and weak global feature extraction ability. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative driver distraction detection model based on the fusion of a transformer and a CNN, referred to as FPT, which is the first exploration in the field of driver distraction detection. First, we introduce the latest Twins transformer as a benchmark. Then, we design residual embedding to replace block embedding, which can further integrate the convolutional neural network with Transformer and improve the feature extraction ability. In addition, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) module with a large parameter occupancy rate in the original transformer structure is replaced with a lightweight group convolution module to reduce computational complexity. Finally, a cross-entropy loss function for label smoothing is designed to guide network learning with significantly differentiated features. Comparison results on two large-scale driver distraction detection datasets show that the proposed FPT offers a better compromise between computational cost and performance compared to the state-of-the-art CNN and Transformer architectures.},

  abstract     = {Spatiotemporal graph neural networks (GNNs) have been used successfully in traffic prediction in recent years, primarily owing to their ability to model complex spatiotemporal dependencies within irregular traffic networks. However, the feature extraction processes in these methods are limited in their exploration of the inner properties of traffic data. Specifically, graph and temporal convolutions are local operations and can hardly utilize information from wider ranges, which may affect the long-term prediction performance of such methods. Furthermore, deep spatiotemporal GNNs easily suffer from poor generalization owing to overfitting. To address these problems, this study presents a novel traffic prediction method that integrates self-supervised learning and self-distillation into spatiotemporal GNNs. First, a self-supervised learning module is used to explore the knowledge from the input data. An auxiliary task based on temporal continuity is designed to capture the contextual information in traffic data. Second, a self-distillation framework is developed as an implicit regularization approach that transfers knowledge from the model itself. The combination of self-supervision and self-distillation further mines the knowledge from the data and the model, and the generalization ability and stability of the prediction model can be improved. The proposed model achieved superior or competitive results compared with several strong baselines on six traffic prediction datasets. In particular, the maximum performance improvement ratios for the six datasets were 3.0% (MAE), 5.2% (RMSE), and 3.8% (MAPE). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The progress achieved in transportation systems and artificial intelligence has amplified the use of intelligent transportation systems and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Indeed, AV systems have attracted much research in recent years, which enabled multiple autonomous driving tasks, including scene understanding, visual prediction, decision-making, and communication. The latter may create a bottleneck in low-resource autonomous driving systems that send the collected images to remote edge servers for processing and decision-making. Such an issue can be addressed by compressing the images in the AV and ensuring a good-quality reconstruction at the edge. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network for Compressed Sensing (CS) based image reconstruction that integrates image semantic perception to improve the reconstruction process for visual prediction tasks. The reconstruction process is optimized using a perception-inspired loss in an end-to-end model learning process. The trained model is evaluated on autonomous driving car datasets. Obtained experimental results outperform state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both image reconstruction quality and processing time. Finally, we perform semantic urban scene segmentation on the reconstructed image to evaluate reconstruction quality for visual task prediction. Obtained results on three semantic urban scene datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.},

The proposed framework is suitable for real-time traffic management, especially in urban areas, due to its reliance on minimal assumptions, its flexibility in adapting to various data sources, and its scalability to higher-dimensional data. The Gaussian process (GP) model is adopted as the base model for learning the optimal mapping from these input features to traffic volume. To enhance the GP model, an in-depth analysis of the properties of its kernel and likelihood function is provided. To cope with the hyperparameter optimisation of the GP, a modified Newton method for GP-based traffic flow model is also designed, which can jump over regions with small gradients. Experiments based on simulation data demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to capture complex relationships between traffic state variables and supply-side factors, and show its value for estimating dynamic road capacity.},

  abstract     = {Multi-modal transportation recommendation plays an important role in navigation applications. It aims to recommend a travel plan with various transport modes, such as bus, metro, taxi, bicycle, and a hybrid. Analysis of real-world large-scale navigation data shows that the correlation between the data can be represented by a graph containing different types of nodes and edges. As an emerging technology, graph neural networks (GNN) have shown powerful capabilities in representing graph data. However, existing solutions based on GNN only consider converting heterogeneous graph data into homogeneous graph data, ignoring the effects of different types of nodes and edges. In addition, those methods usually face the over-smoothing problem, which reduces the accuracy of recommendation. To this end, we propose a multi-modal &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${T}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ransportation recommendation algorithm with &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${H}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; eterogeneous graph &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${A}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ttention &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${N}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; etworks (THAN) based on carefully constructed heterogeneous graphs. We first design a novel graph embedding method to represent the correlation between the origin and the destination, as well as the correlation between origin-destination (OD) pairs and users. Next, a heterogeneous graph from large-scale data is built to describe the relationship between users, OD pairs, and transport modes. Then, we design a hierarchical attention mechanism with residual blocks to generate node embedding in terms of homogeneity and heterogeneity. Finally, a fusion neural layer is designed to fuse embeddings from different views and predict the proper transport mode for users. Extensive experimental results on a large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that the performance of THAN outperforms five baselines.},

The emergence of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) provides new capabilities for traffic state estimation using extended floating car data such as position, speed and spacing information. In this work we propose a Bayesian Traffic State Estimation (BTSE) methodology for estimating the traffic density based on extended floating car data. BTSE utilizes the Bayesian paradigm to express any prior information to derive probability distributions of the traffic density of different road segments of the traffic network. Two variations of the BTSE methodology are developed to handle the offline and online estimation problem. The BTSE methodology is evaluated both using realistic SUMO micro-simulations for M25 Highway, London, U.K., and a real-life vehicle-trajectory dataset from German highways, extracted from videos recorded by drones. The efficiency and accuracy of the BTSE methodology is compared to an existing methodology in the literature. We present results for the estimation performance of the methods showing that the Bayesian methodology consistently results in lower mean absolute percentage error than the compared literature method. The BTSE methodology yields high-quality estimation results even for a low penetration rate of CAVs (e.g. 5%).},

Moreover, it can be conveniently used in various applications, such as autonomous driving, robotics, realistic navigation, and smart cities. However, extracting global contextual information from images and predicting a geometrically natural depth map remain challenging. In this paper, we present DLNet for pixel-wise depth estimation, which simultaneously extracts global and local features with the aid of our depth Linformer block. This block consists of the Linformer and innovative soft split multi-layer perceptron blocks. Moreover, a three-dimensional geometry smoothness loss is proposed to predict a geometrically natural depth map by imposing the second-order smoothness constraint on the predicted three-dimensional point clouds, thereby realizing improved performance as a byproduct. Finally, we explore the multi-scale prediction strategy and propose the maximum margin dual-scale prediction strategy for further performance improvement.

  abstract     = {Targeting at improving door-to-door accessibility, efficiency and reducing environmental impact, recent decades have witnessed vigorous development of multimodal transport. Coupled through passenger transfer, the failure of one mode, however, is likely to cause cascading disruptions to the complete system. Therefore, to maintain safe and efficient operations, the integrated recovery of the multimodal transportation system becomes an important, timely topic, given increasingly complex schedule interactions. This study proposes a mathematical model to handle the integrated recovery problem of multimodal transportation network by minimizing the passenger travel cost and mode recovery cost under failures of multiple critical infrastructures. For a case study on air/HSR interaction in China, our model incorporates decisions in terms of aircraft recovery, railway timetable rescheduling, and passenger routing with realistic constraints (e.g. max travel time, max transfer time). A column-and-row generation based heuristic solution algorithm is developed in order to solve the complex model with given computational budgets. Results reveal that real-world test disruption scenarios can be solved within 20 minutes with a small relaxation gap. A significant amount of passenger traveling time can be reduced in contrast to a sequential recovery approach with independent reaction decisions for each transport mode. This work contributes towards the development of support tools for integrated disruption management of multimodal transportation.},

  abstract     = {This paper models an operation problem of an unmanned aerial vehicle for the emergency medical service (UEMS) system. The model is set up as a location-allocation problem. The coverage distance and capacity of the UEMS facility are modeled as functions of UAVs assigned. The allocation of the demand point is constrained by the variable coverage distance of each facility. The robust optimization approach is used over the cardinality-constrained uncertain demand, which leads to a nonlinear optimization problem. The UEMS location-allocation problem (ULAP) is reformulated to a solvable problem. An extended formulation and corresponding branch-and-price (B&amp;P) algorithm are also proposed, which strengthen the linear programming relaxation bound. The subproblem of the B&amp;P algorithm is defined as a robust disjunctively constrained integer knapsack problem. Two solution approaches of mixed-integer linear programming reformulation and decomposed dynamic programming are designed for the subproblem. To provide time-efficient solutions for large-scale problems, a restricted master heuristic (RMH) is proposed based on the extended formulation. In computational experiments, the B&amp;P algorithm provided a strong lower bound, and the RMH could find an effective feasible solution within an applicable computation time.},

  abstract     = {The network connectivity while traveling in a vehicle is an important issue, which needs to be addressed by mobile vehicular networks. This paper proposes a novel scheme to improve the connectivity of mobile vehicular networks. In particular, the paper proposes a medium access control (MAC) layer hybrid mmWave and microwave scheme for vehicular networks, and leverage their capabilities to improve the vehicle’s connectivity. The novel computational model is derived to evaluate the connectivity for the proposed scheme. The model is used for performance analysis of vehicles moving on a multi-lane highway road and getting connectivity with road-side-units (RSUs) deployed along the roads. Our analysis considers that reference VN has perfect channel state information. It is assumed that the RSU radiates ubiquitously on the road surface using microwave radio access technology (RAT), while it radiates directionally towards reference VN using mmWave RAT. For mathematical analysis, the directionality in mmWave RAT is well approximated by a sectored antenna model. The analysis for the proposed scheme is compared with the existing mmWave network and packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer hybrid scheme. The analysis claims that the proposed hybrid scheme significantly improves the connectivity performance in mobile vehicular networks over the existing schemes. The computation results are validated with the simulation results. Also, the paper offers parametric analysis for connectivity probability with vehicle speed and slot duration to enable its practical implementation in 5G/6G technologies.},

Following the operational capabilities of IoTs, this emerging technology could be extremely helpful in the area, where human access is not possible. Because IoT devices are employed in an infrastructure-less environment, where they communicate with each other via the wireless medium to share accumulated data in network topological order. However, the unstructured deployment with wireless and dynamic communication make them disclosed to various security threats, which need to be addressed for their efficient results. Therefore, the primary objective of this work is to present a comprehensive survey of the theoretical literature associated with security concerns of this emerging technology from 2015-to-2022. To follow up this, we have overviewed different security threats of UAV-aided IoT applications followed by their countermeasures techniques to identify the current challenges and requirements of this emerging technology paradigm that must be addressed by researchers, enterprise market, and industry stakeholders. In light of underscored constrains, we have highlighted the open security challenges that could be assumed a move forward step toward setting the future research insights. By doing this, we set a preface for the answer to a question, why this paper is needed in the presence of published review articles.

  abstract     = {Will Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Highly Automated Driving (HAD) perform in the expected manner? Will they actually make road traffic safer, or will they potentially introduce new critical situations or road accidents? It is almost impossible to address these questions solely through real-world tests. A promising tool to provide appropriate answers in a time- and cost-efficient way without exposing subjects to risk are virtual assessment methods. Reliable safety assessments are only possible, if the traffic simulations provide realistic traffic, including critical situations and road accidents. This paper provides a review of how human error contributes to critical situations and accidents in road traffic. The focus is on the causes and mechanisms of human error, which driver behavior models must address in order to simulate realistic traffic. For this purpose, Rasmussen’s error taxonomies are applied to the traffic context and extended with further research. The paper shows the causes of those human errors and that the underlying mechanisms thereof should be taken into account in order to obtain more transparent and realistic driver behavior models. It is shown, which concepts for modelling realistic traffic exist and how virtual safety assessment could benefit from this development. In addition, the driver behavior model DReaM (Driver Reaction Model) is presented to address the issues resulting from existing cognitive driver models.},

  abstract     = {Traffic estimation is imperative for conducting fundamental transportation engineering tasks such as transportation planning and traffic safety studies. Additionally, traffic prediction is vital for many data-driven intelligent transportation system applications. Most traffic estimation and prediction methods rely on infrastructure-based sensors to collect traffic parameters. However, infrastructure-based data collection can be costly and time consuming to set up and maintain. Additionally, the spatial distribution of the collected traffic data is limited by the location of the deployed hardware sensors. Probe vehicle data can be used to overcome these limitations. Traffic modeling for estimation and prediction is a complex task due to the stochastic nonlinear spatiotemporal dependencies exhibited by traffic parameters. In this paper, a deep learning-based sequence-to-sequence architecture called Seq2seq GCN-LSTM was proposed to estimate and predict network-wide traffic volume and speed. The proposed method utilizes short-term historical traffic data collected from a low-penetration rate probe vehicle fleet to estimate and predict traffic parameters up to 60-minutes ahead. The method utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks for spatial dependency extraction and Long Short-Term Memory networks to model temporal dependencies. The proposed method generated superior traffic results compared to the baseline models. Additionally, the model demonstrated robustness against perturbations caused by the low rate. Furthermore, the probe vehicle penetration rate was varied to test its effect on the proposed method’s modeling capability. The model was able to maintain traffic volume and speed estimation and prediction performance within a reasonable margin of error using penetration rates as low as 1.5% and 0.5%, respectively.},

Several machine learning (ML) based approaches have been studied in the literature, and most of them focused on prediction accuracy rather than the end use of real-time control and implementation. These ML models tend to be very complex and non-linear in nature, making it challenging to achieve fast inferences and are computationally heavy for real-time signal control implementation. In this paper, a simple yet accurate hybrid modeling method is proposed to predict traffic delay one-step ahead with the model made suitable for real-time implementation to control traffic flow. Since real-time road-side measurements are recorded in unstructured form, the paper also discusses other issues related to data extraction and the pre-processing process. Finally, a simple signal control loop is developed to demonstrate the proposed modeling approach, which has shown advantages in model accuracy and computation efficiency compared against several existing modeling methods.},

The main contribution of this work is to propose a simple and entirely V2V-based methodology to estimate, in real-time, traffic density based on data collected by moving observers in co-directional and on- coming traffic. To estimate traffic density in a privacy-preserving manner, our methodology uses tallies consisting of the number of times a vehicle is passed by other vehicles, minus the number of times it passes other vehicles. As it turns out, keeping tallies is a non-trivial task since vehicles are allowed to vary their speed in arbitrary ways and, as a result, the same two vehicles may pass each other any number of times. We provide a detailed proof of correctness of our methodology; to assess its accuracy, we have performed extensive simulations and sensitivity analyses using SUMO-generated synthetic traffic traces over a wide range of penetration rates and traffic flows.},

In our proposed scheme, an urban region is divided to many traffic management areas. Based on the real-time dynamic traffic tightness degrees and the static correlation degrees between these divided management areas, we can obtain the complete real-time regional traffic correlations of these divided management areas. Further, when a traffic congestion occurs, the fog servers use the constructed measures to control the signal lights in real time and effectively guide the traffic flow through the cooperation between these divided management areas. The experimental results show our proposed scheme can effectively implement the road guidance and traffic light control to alleviate or eliminate traffic congestion when a traffic congestion occurs.},

Ignoring these sources may lead to inaccurate modeling of the VRP. Moreover, the area of green logistics and the environmental issues associated received significant attention. This paper aims to study the stochastic multi-objective Vehicle Routing Problem in a green environment. The stochastic Green VRP (GVRP) presented deals with three objectives simultaneously that consider economic, environmental, and social aspects. First, a new hybrid search algorithm to solve the VRP is presented and validated. The algorithm is then employed to solve the stochastic multi-objective GVRP.

Particularly, in the proposed framework, a manager agent learns to divide mTSPTWR into sub-routing tasks by assigning customers to each vehicle via a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) based policy network. A worker agent learns to solve sub-routing tasks by minimizing the cost in terms of both tour length and rejection rate for each vehicle, the maximum of which is then fed back to the manager agent to learn better assignments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms strong baselines in terms of higher solution quality and shorter computation time. More importantly, the trained agents also achieve competitive performance for solving unseen larger instances.},

In this paper, fault detection is carried out according to the distance between the normal current curve and the test curve calculated by fast dynamic time warping algorithm. In view of the singular point problem involved, a segmentation method for current curve based on the key nodes in the turnout conversion process is proposed and applied to the fault detection of single action and double action turnouts. Experimental results show that proposed approach can effectively improve the matching accuracy of adaptive diagnosis model which is more than 96%.

  abstract     = {Indirect method to identify dynamic properties of bridge by a passing vehicle is attractive recently since it does not require pre-installed sensors on bridge. However, the extracted dynamic properties are not accurate enough to identify local damages due to road surface roughness. To overcome this issue, a method to identify mode shapes and detect local damages in a simply supported bridge by movable sensory system is proposed in this study. Instead of using passing vehicles, two stationary vehicles are adopted in this study to perform as movable sensory system. They stay stationary at two different locations on the bridge subject to ambient environmental excitation, and their vertical accelerations are collected to calculate the vertical displacement of the two contact points between vehicles and bridge. Then they move to another two locations and the same procedures are repeated. After all locations along the bridge are tested, a matrix similar to frequency response matrix can be constructed and SVD method is used to extract the mode shapes. The element stiffness is thereafter evaluated by the fundamental mode shape, which can be then used to detect local stiffness reduction in the bridge. Numerical study has been conducted to validate the proposed method, and the effect of bridge damping, vehicle damping, measurement noise, and traffic flow is investigated. Moreover, field testing was conducted on Li-Zi-Wan Bridge and the results showed that the proposed method can re-construct the mode shapes and evaluate element bending stiffness as accurately as conventional direct approach. The proposed method is convenient and easy to implement in practice; and it is more robust because it is not affected by road surface roughness.},

  abstract     = {Transport accessibility and urban-rural connectivity are seen as critical aspects of rural economic development. In the transit network, passenger flow between urban-rural corridors demonstrates directional imbalances and low utilization of scarce resources. Freight transportation, on the other hand, lags due to poor geography, high operating costs, and scattered demand. This paper proposes a new mode of public transit that integrates passenger and freight transport, providing a carrier for logistics while compensating for the low utilization of passenger transport. In this mode, each timetabled round trip is divided into one dedicated passenger trip with high demand and one mixed-flow trip with on-demand requests. A space-time-state network is constructed considering the picking-up time window, loading/unloading service time, and electric bus energy replenishment. A mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to optimize the bus schedule that covers the travel demands and the charging requests with minimized travel costs. A Lagrangian relaxation framework with a dynamic programming algorithm and sub-gradient method is presented for problem-solving. The real-life rural-urban transport instance and a simulated network demonstrate the operation of the new mode and validate the efficiency of the proposed method. The innovative concept and the optimization framework are expected to serve as a reference for public administration to alleviate passenger and freight transportation bottlenecks in the urban-rural context.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we investigate the use of drones in a delivery scenario formed by two contiguous areas. In one area the drones can freely fly on straight lines between any two locations (Euclidean metric), while in the other one the drones must follow the open space above the roads (Manhattan metric). We model this delivery scenario as a Euclidean-Manhattan-Grid (EM-grid). Given a set of customers to be served in an EM-grid, the objective is to find the distribution point (DP) for the drone that minimizes the overall traveled distance, considering that the drone has to do multiple round trips to/from the DP. In our view, the DP is optimized with respect to the set of customers and its computation must be light because it needs to be recomputed every time the set of customers varies. Accordingly, we define the Single Distribution Point Problem (SDPP) and devise sub-optimal time-efficient algorithms for solving it. We numerically compare the cost of our sub-optimal solutions with that of an optimal solution computed with a brute-force approach. Finally, using the BlueSky open air simulator, we compare the cost of our best solution with the cost of a solution that serves the costumers from a fixed DP, like the location of a delivery company’s depot. The fixed DP can perform very poorly for some customer instances, while our solution is highly adaptive and reduces the time and the distance covered by the drone.},

Despite the rapid development of road detection technology based on visual images, it is still challenging to robustly identify road areas in visual images due to the influence of illumination changes and noise. In order to solve this problem, we introduce a new optimized lidar and camera sensor fusion method for road environment sensing of intelligent vehicles. In road boundary detection based on laser data, a median point filtering method of ordered pole cloud is proposed. A method of boundary search, boundary seed point growth and obstacle clustering is proposed to identify road boundary. In the lane line classification based on visual image, a lane line search classification method is proposed, which can effectively classify lane lines and extract single lane lines. On the basis of the optimization of sensors, several constraint conditions are proposed based on the fusion of the two data, and the location of missing lane lines is predicted by using the road information identified by lidar and image, and the lane lines are identified again. Finally, a large number of experiments are carried out on kitti-Road benchmark data set, and a test platform is built to verify the results of the identification method proposed in this paper in rainy day, cloudy day, night and other special scenarios. Experimental results show that this method is superior to existing methods.},

However, some unpredicted factors for construction of traffic stations results in a low utilization rate of public transportation resources, for example, the layout of bus stops is chaotic, there is no clear layout scope, and there is a lack of integration with residents’ travel hotspots. Towards these challenges modern transport faces, we firstly analyze the distribution of bus stops and subway stations to determine the area range needs to be optimized in the traffic net from the perspective of time and space. And then, we propose an optimization method, called ’partial area clustering’ (PAC), to improve the utilization by changing and renewing the original distribution. The novel method was based on the K-means algorithm in the field of machine learning. PAC worked to search the suitable bus platforms as the center and modified the original one to the subway. Experiment has shown that the use of public transport resources has increased by 20%. The study uses a similar cluster algorithm to solve transport networks’ problems in a novel but practical term. As a result, the PAC is expected to be used extensively in the transportation system construction process.},

Due to the high degree of urbanization and the high number of vehicles, longer response time caused by massive concurrent queries, as well as more attacks caused by malicious vehicles, results in low efficiency of the transportation system and huge waste of computation resources. Thus, it is necessary to provide an efficient and safe transportation service for intelligent transportation planning. To achieve it, we utilize and improve the trust model to prevent the waste of computation resources. Meanwhile, we introduce a Trusted Parallel Optimization on Route Planning (T-PORP) based on Dual-level Grid (DLG) index to continuously handle the process of route planning in parallel. Considering the evolving traffic condition, we employ an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to periodically predict the weights of roads. Experimental results indicate that T-PORP is effective to sorts of trust model attacks and reduces the response time by an average of about 46.7% and saves the processing time by an average of about 27.6% compared with CANDS (Continuous Optimal Navigation via Distributed Stream Processing) algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Infrared and visible data fusion (IVF) aims to generate a fused output that simultaneously highlights salient thermal radiation features and preserves texture information, which can not only grasp the necessary information for traffic movement, but also highlight the invisible objects that need to be dodged in intelligent transportation system (ITS). Therefore, IVF is capable of improving the environmental perception ability for various challenging traffic situations, e.g., foggy scenarios, rainy environments, and low-light illumination. However, current available IVF algorithms cannot offer a theoretical manner to integrate a priori knowledge and the network structure into a unified model. Moreover, they always fail to handle infrared and visible data pairs with different resolutions, which is a common occurrence in real ITS scenarios. To this end, this study develops a novel model-inspired unsupervised network termed IVF-Net. Specifically, an enhanced IVF model (IVFM), which pays more attention on detailed texture information and salient objects, is first established. According to proximal gradient theory, then we map this model into a deep network with learnable feature extraction parameters, aiming to draw on the strengths of the fusion model and deep learning to better describe the IVF task. Finally, a multiple task-driven loss function is designed to train the mapped network. Unlike previous work, our IVF-Net is motivated by IVFM, each layer in which has a semantic interpretability and a clear mission, thereby leading to a significantly enhanced fusion effect. Another advantage is that it is only composed of simple convolution-based structures, which ensures its lightweight and efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that IVF-Net can have a stronger ability to capture the key traffic information and highlight the salient feature of imperceptible objects, which makes it an excellent candidate to improve the reliability of subsequent applications in ITS.},

In this approach, first, we divide the related factors into three dimensions by their work methods, which are the inputs of the network. Second, the data of three original dimensions are extracted through fully connected layers to obtain embedding dimensions. Third, a new dimension indefensible factor is obtained by filter operation to eliminate the correlation between external factors and internal factors, which denotes the degree that the internal abnormal operational behavior can be explained by the external environment. Last, we regard the driving information as four channels of driving behaviors and extract the channel information through convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The numerical calculation and comparison results with real traffic data demonstrates the superior performance of our framework, and the accuracy of the proposed method in vehicle hazard classification is 95%.},

The FCGCN prediction process has four steps: dividing the local subnetwork with community detection, local training based on the global parameters, uploading the local model parameters, and constructing a global model prediction based on the aggregated parameters. Numerical results on the PeMS04 and PeMS08 datasets show that the FCGCN outperforms four benchmark models, namely, the long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN), ChebNet, and graph attention network (GAT) models. The FCGCN prediction is closer to the real value, with nearly the same performance as the global model at a lower time cost, thus achieving accurate and secure short-term traffic flow predictions with three parameters: flow, speed, and occupancy.},

  abstract     = {Cognitive radio (CR) provides an effective solution to meet the huge bandwidth requirements in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which enables secondary users (SUs) to access the idle spectrum of the primary users (PUs). However, the high mobility of users and real-time service requirements result in the additional transmission collisions and interference, which degrades the spectrum access rate and the quality of service (QoS) of users in ITS. This paper proposes a spectrum access algorithm (Feilin) based on federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL) to improve spectrum access rate, which maximizes the QoS reward function with considering the hybrid benefits of delay, transmission power and utility of SUs. To guarantee the utility of SUs, the warranty contract is designed for SUs to obtain compensation for data transmission failure, which promotes SUs to compete for more spectrum resources. To meet the real-time requirements and improve QoS in ITS, a spectrum access model called FDQN-W is proposed based on federated deep Q-network (DQN), which adopts the asynchronous federated weighted learning algorithm (AFWLA) to share and update the weights of DQN in multiple agents to decrease time cost and accelerate the convergence. Detailed simulation results show that, in the multiuser scenario, compared with the existing methods, the proposed algorithm Feilin increases the spectrum access success rate by 15.1%, and reduces the collision rate with SUs and the collision rate with PUs by 46.4% and 6.8%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Location-based services (LBSs) are widely used in vehicular networks. Privacy leakage from LBS is a key issue to be solved. However, the existing schemes fail to provide differentiated protection for users’ different locations, which may lead to the leakage of location information. In this paper, we propose a personalized location privacy protection scheme based on differential privacy to protect the privacy of location-based services in vehicular networks. Firstly, we propose a normalized decision matrix to describe the efficiency and the privacy effect of navigation recommendations. We then establish a utility model integrated with users’ privacy preferences to compute the effective driving route. Secondly, for different service request locations in the driving route, we define sensitivity distance as an index to quantify their privacy requirements. The privacy budget will be added to the service request location to generate a false location. Moreover, due to the limitation of road range in the driving route, if the privacy budget value allocated is small enough, the false location generated by the Plane Laplace will be deviated. As a result, the attacker can deduce users’ real request locations. Consequently, considering the factors of trajectory leakage, attack strategy and QoS, we establish a multi-objective optimization model to optimize the false location. Based on the real data set, we conduct a series of comparison simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. The experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can satisfy users’ personalized services needs and provide an optimal solution to privacy and QoS.},

  abstract     = {With the large-scale commercialization of 5G, the global industry has started the exploration of the next generation mobile communication technology (6G). From mobile Internet, to IoT, and then to the smart connection of everything, 6G will transform from 5G’s service objects of people and things to the intelligent networking of agent that supports human–machine–object. 6G networks should have the characteristics of ubiquitous intelligence and ubiquitous perception, which poses challenges for 6G network construction. Therefore, we propose a 6G Semantic Communication Scheme based on Intelligent Fabrics for transportation in-cabin scenarios (6GSCS-IF), which can provide senseless intelligent interaction in transportation in-cabin environment through widely and flexibly deployed intelligent fabrics, demonstrating the superiority of intelligent fabrics in realizing human–machine–object intelligent sensory interaction. Then, we propose a Deep Learning-based Semantic Communication Model for Time-series data (DL-SCMT), and use deep learning for semantic sensing and information extraction to build an end-to-end semantic communication system. The experimental results show that the semantic communication services provided by this model can achieve better signal reconstruction and higher-order intelligent services compared with traditional communication methods.},

  abstract     = {The paper proposes light convolutional neural network (CNN) models for the use of cognitive networking in an intelligent transportation system (ITS). There are two CNN models, one with 1D convolution and connectors, and the other with a tree-like structure. The 1D CNN model is deployed to process 1D temporal data such as the driver’s body temperature and electrocardiogram (ECG) data to measure emotion, while the deep tree CNN model is used to process image data obtained from car camera sensors. As the driver’s cognitive state can frequently change depending on the situation and location of the car, different edge controllers should handle the car sensors’ data within a short period of time. The tree-based deep learning model that can be branched and processed independently in the edge devices can be executed with less computation. This reduces the load and the time of the execution of the model. The light 1D CNN model has less learnable parameters, and hence can be executed in real-time. The cognitive state of a driver is measured by the facial emotion, body temperature, and ECG signal of the driver. The proposed is tested using a publicly available facial emotion database, and the accuracy and the information density are around 94-96% and 4.4, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET), as an inseparable part of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), enable data communication between vehicles to promote road safety and traffic efficiency. But adversaries can also spread false information across these networks. Therefore, vehicles’ cognitive capabilities with respect to received data must be improved. This requires spatial intelligence and a mechanism to evaluate the trustworthiness of received data. But the dynamic nature of VANETs with intermittent connections, lack of infrastructure and real-time constraints make fulfilling this task very challenging. In this paper, we propose a trust-aware cognitive framework that exploits the redundancies in the exchanged DENM and CAM packets as well as spatial intelligence to filter malicious messages and prevent attackers from disrupting network operation. A novel supplementary mechanism is also presented that applies subjective logic on the pieces of information collected from all network vehicles to detect and isolate malicious entities. To assess the reliability of the proposed scheme, we made extensive comparisons between our model and two others. In the obtained results, our approach outperformed both of them and yielded an accuracy of over 90%, even when 50% of network participants were attackers. The supplementary malicious node detection mechanism of ours similarly yielded high accuracy and F1 scores in the simulations.},

  abstract     = {The detection of 3D objects with high precision from point cloud data has become a crucial research topic in intelligent transportation systems. By effectively modeling global and local features, it can be acquired the state-of-the-art detector for 3D object detection. Nevertheless, regarding the previous work on feature representations, volumetric generation or point learning methods have difficulty building the relationships between local features and global features. Thus, we propose a multi-feature fusion network (MFFNet) to improve detection precision for 3D point cloud data by combining the global features from 3D voxel convolutions with the local features from the point learning network. Our algorithm is an end-to-end detection framework that contains a voxel convolutional module, a local point feature module and a detection head. Significantly, MFFNet constructs the local point feature set with point learning and sampling and the global feature map through 3D voxel convolution from raw point clouds. The detection head can use the obtained fusion feature to predict the position and category of the examined 3D object, so the proposed method can obtain higher precision than existing approaches. An experimental evaluation on the KITTI 3D object detection dataset obtain 97% MAP (Mean Average Precision) and Waymo Open dataset obtain 80% MAP, which proves the efficiency of the developed feature fusion representation method for 3D objects, and it can achieve satisfactory location accuracy.},

Recently, many traffic control schemes have been studied, such as access class barring (ACB) scheme and back-off (BO) scheme. However, the dynamics of traffic and the heterogeneous requirements of different IoV applications are not considered in most existing studies, which is significant for the random access resource allocation. In this paper, we consider a hybrid scheme, combining the priority dynamic ACB (PDACB) scheme and BO scheme. The IoV devices are classified depending on different delay characteristics, where the delay-sensitive devices are classified as high priority. The target is to maximum the successful transmission of packets with the success rate constraint by adjusting the various ACB factors. Proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm as a unique deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method is utilized in this paper, which can obtain continuous action space and solve for the optimal ACB factors without estimating backlog of nodes. A quick convergence is achieved by designing sensible state space, action space and reward. The access capability of the PDACB traffic control scheme is verified by simulations.},

Federated Learning, a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm shows promise in being applied in this field. However, the data and device heterogeneity, and highly dynamic environment in ITS pose challenges to the performance of federated learning. One of the recent approaches to address the challenges are to choose proper participants from available clients during training. However, this research field is not fully investigated yet, and many works are still based on the classic random-based selection scheme. In this paper, we present Newt, an enhanced federated learning approach. On one hand, it includes a new client selection utility that explores the trade-off between accuracy performance in each round and system progress. On the other hand, it highlights a feedback control on the selector. Specifically, we implement a control on the selection frequency as a new dimension of client selection method design. We evaluate the proposed system with DNN training tasks on large scale FEMNIST-based datasets that are of different heterogeneity properties. The experiments show that our method outperforms the other baseline methods by as large as 20%.},

This paper focuses on the problem of the quality and real-time assurance of collaborative decision-making response in large-scale ITS during multi-task parallelism execution. First, a collaborative decision architecture with cognitive networking is developed, which introduces the advanced 6G communication technology to enhance information interaction capability of vehicle-road-cloud collaboration, and lays the foundation for multi-task real-time decision-making with inevitable fuzzy information in the perception process. Then, a multi-task parallel multi-granularity collaborative decision model (MPMCD) is designed to improve knowledge discovery ability for decision-making process by building multi-granularity information structures. An AI-driven cognitive networking collaborative decision-making (ACNCD) algorithm is further proposed based on MPMCD model to support multi-task parallel vehicle-road-cloud collaborative real-time decision. Extensive simulation experiments are carried out to evaluate ACNCD algorithm in terms of several performance criteria including decision response time, accuracy, and accident rate. The obtained results show that the comprehensive decision-making performance of ACNCD outperforms other relevant existing algorithms.},

In this paper, we propose a graph optimized data offloading algorithm leveraging a crowd-AI hybrid method to minimize the data offloading cost and ensure the reliable urban tracking result. To be specific, we first formulate a crowd-AI hybrid urban tracking scenario, and prove the proposed data offloading problem in this scenario is NP-hard. Then, we solve it by decomposing the problem into two parts, i.e., trajectory prediction and task allocation. The trajectory prediction algorithm, leveraging the state graph, computes possible tracking areas of the target object, and the task allocation algorithm, using the dependency graph, chooses the optimal set of crowds and cameras to cover the tracking area while minimizing the data offloading cost separately. Finally, the extensive simulations with large real world data set are conducted showing that the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmarks in reducing data offloading cost while ensuring the tracking success rate in intelligent transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {Technological interventions are becoming commonplace in everyday vehicles. But utilization of biosignals that can enhance the overall driving experience is still limited. Microsleep is one such issue that needs intervention, owing to the difficulty in its detection and social acceptance of using wearable BCI devices during transit. Microsleep is a short duration of sleep that lasts from few to several seconds. It could occur unconsciously without the person in context realizing it. This, therefore, happens before the deep sleep and could also occur when performing critical tasks such as driving on a highway. By using modern-day advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning, we can provide efficient solutions to prevent accidents due to microsleep during vehicular transit. However, it is noteworthy that distinguishing microsleep using a single channel system is a challenge. We have explored this using datasets provided by International BCI Competition Committee. Given the fact that the participants’ values might not match the exact scenario, approaches for exploiting transitory phases using ANN/CNN have been developed and discussed in this paper. Transitory phases could include Wakefulness &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\leftrightarrow $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; Non-Rapid Eye Movement-1 phase (NREM-1). Results show ≈95% increase in mean statistical agreements, which are represented by kappa values (CNN NREM &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$1~\rightarrow $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; CNN Transition) and ≈77% increase in mean kappa (ANN NREM &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$1~\rightarrow $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ANN Transition).

  abstract     = {Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are closely connected in the Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System (C-ITS). They are equipped with various sensors and controlled by Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) to provide high-level autonomy. The vehicles exchange different types of real-time data with each other, which can help reduce traffic accidents and congestion, and improve the efficiency of transportation systems. However, when interacting with the environment, AVs suffer from a broad attack surface, and the sensory data are susceptible to anomalies caused by faults, sensor malfunctions, or attacks, which may jeopardize traffic safety and result in serious accidents. In this paper, we propose ADS-Lead , an efficient collaborative anomaly detection methodology to protect the lane-following mechanism of ADSs. ADS-Lead is equipped with a novel transformer-based one-class classification model to identify time series anomalies (GPS spoofing threat) and adversarial image examples (traffic sign and lane recognition attacks). Besides, AVs inside the C-ITS form a cognitive network, enabling us to apply the federated learning technology to our anomaly detection method, where the vehicles in the C-ITS jointly update the detection model with higher model generalization and data privacy. Experiments on Baidu Apollo and two public data sets (GTSRB and Tumsimple) indicate that our method can not only detect sensor anomalies effectively and efficiently but also outperform state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods.},

The anomalies could span broad temporal and spatial ranges, including fine-grain (e.g., unsafe interactions among moving vehicles in real-time), medium-grain (e.g., aggressive/unsafe driving styles of individual vehicles over extended periods/distances), and coarse-grain (e.g., ensemble properties of the traffic over even longer time horizons). Unlike traditional approaches that utilize deep learning to recognize individual activities, C-FAR does so only for primitive movements and activities and then builds a comprehensive event logic framework. It also provides an optimal resolution of the detected/predicted anomalies by identifying the minimal changes in the controllable parameters of the system. We implemented a prototype system and tested it on three distinct real-world traffic data sets. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme can predict anomalies with over 84% recall level at 95% confidence level approximately 4.05 seconds before the incident.},

  abstract     = {The security of safety-critical IoT systems, such as the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), has a great interest, focusing on using Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to recognise cyber-attacks in IoT networks. Deep learning methods are commonly used for the anomaly detection engines of many IDSs because of their ability to learn from heterogeneous data. However, while this type of machine learning model produces high false-positive rates and the reasons behind its predictions are not easily understood, even by experts. The ability to understand or comprehend the reasoning behind the decision of an IDS to block a particular packet helps cybersecurity experts validate the system’s effectiveness and develop more cyber-resilient systems. This paper proposes an explainable deep learning-based intrusion detection framework that helps improve the transparency and resiliency of DL-based IDS in IoT networks. The framework employs a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) mechanism to interpret decisions made by deep learning-based IDS to experts who rely on the decisions to ensure IoT networks’ security and design more cyber-resilient systems. The proposed framework was validated using the ToN_IoT dataset and compared with other compelling techniques. The experimental results have revealed the high performance of the proposed framework with a 99.15% accuracy and a 98.83% F1 score, illustrating its capability to protect IoV networks against sophisticated cyber-attacks.},

  abstract     = {Traffic signal control and cooperation are extremely important to alleviate traffic congestion in a large traffic network. This study develops a higher-order conflict graph approach for network-wide traffic signal control and cooperation. A conflict graph is applied to model the traffic signal configurations, which identifies the conflict and unconflicted movements for each intersection. In conflict graph, the node represents each movement. The weight of each node can be defined as traffic volume, queue length, fuel consumption, or any weighted combinations of these measurements. The calculation of the optimal green light duration and green light sequence (for different movements) is equivalent to sequentially finding the maximum weight independent set (MWIS) in the conflict graph. The conflict graph also provides a uniform and efficient way to connect traffic signal operations among nearby intersections spatially. Then, we introduced the concept of the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -th order neighborhood to model the degree of connectivity between each movement to the movements at upstream or downstream intersections. The weight of each node in the higher-order conflict graph not only represents its own congestion level, but also relates to the traffic conditions of nearby intersections. Through this approach, the cooperation of multiple intersections can be realized by incorporating their spatial connectivity into conflict graph and solving the MWIS problem. A simulation network is built in SUMO to test the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results suggested that the proposed model outperformed other state-of-the-art signal control methods. Also, the scheme maintains good performance under varying traffic demands.},

However due to the dynamic environment, communication is interrupted by the adversaries, resulting in non-privacy issues. This article introduces an Agreement-induced Data Verification Model (ADVM) for securing vehicular communication against adversaries. The connected vehicles in a grid communicate with each other based on direct and indirect recommendation. This recommendation is based on mutual identity sharing between the vehicles for masked information exchange. Non-replicated and recommendation based verifications are performed using the vector classification learning. In this learning process, the credential validity and communication tolerance amid adversaries are augmented. The constraint-failing vehicles are disconnected from the communication grid, preventing its insecure impact over the communication. The proposed model’s performance is verified using false rate, success ratio, processing time, complexity, and recommendation ratio. For the different vehicles, the proposed model achieves 9.69% less false rate, 10.3% success ratio, 10.49% less processing time, 10.3% less complexity, and 12.87% high recommendation ratio.},

A dynamic convergence method is proposed to help identify vehicle system load factors and compare their termination criteria. We also propose a packet-level intrusion detection model. After all load balancing, the model can track the attack on the network. The proposed model further combines the entropy-based active learning and the attention-based model to efficiently identify the attacks. Experiments are then conducted on the standard KDD data to validate the developed models with and without an attention-based active learning mechanism.

The messages generated by each vehicular node or base station are encrypted with Paillier cryptosystem. Because Paillier cryptosystem is featured by homomorphic addition, message aggregation reduces large amount of decryption.

Moreover, since the central premise to support the IVS is timely and effectively sensing data processing, Age of Information (AoI) can precisely reflect the timeliness and effectiveness of the communication process in the UAV-aided traffic monitoring network. However, recent researches pay little attention to AoI minimization issue, especially when the malicious attacker attempts to deteriorate the network performance. The accurately modelling of the adversarial relationship between legitimate UAVs and attacker is not fully investigated. To make up this research gap, we start from the Stackelberg game viewpoint to investigate the AoI optimization problem in the UAV-aided traffic monitoring network under attack. Firstly, the system model and three-layer Stackelberg game-based optimization goal are established. Secondly, based on the Backward Induction (BI) analysis, the follower’s data sensing rate, transmission power, and the leader’s attacking power are determined by the Lagrange duality optimization technology successively. Moreover, the sub-gradient update-based optimization technology is used to achieve the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE). Finally, simulations are performed under various parameters. The evaluation results present better performance of our proposed approach when compared with the typical baselines.},

The first index, the electric vehicle (EV) flexibility index, determines the ability of any particular controllable load to avoid the EV charging intervals during its operation. The second index, the photovoltaic (PV) flexibility index, evaluates the ability of any controllable load to absorb PV power during its operation. Both these indices can be utilized by homeowners or policymakers in installing/updating PVs and controllable home appliances. Higher index values imply more flexibility and thus those devices are more beneficial for the homeowners. In order to capture different consumption patterns in different homes, five home clusters are considered in this study. In each cluster, the controllable loads are grouped into three groups based on their flexibility level and utilization purpose. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed for the two commonly used charging levels in the residential sector, i.e. level 1 and level 2. In addition, sensitivity analysis of different uncertain factors such as PV power, the arrival time of EVs, and daily mileage of EVs is also carried out.

To achieve the maximum efficiency from the transportation system, the ideas of vehicle-to-subway (V2S) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) are utilized to develop a bilateral power flow strategy (charging/discharging or idle mode) to provide the chief charging requirements of energy systems. In this regard, the proposed model suggests a novel stochastic architecture based on unscented transformation (UT) to handle the operational uncertainties of the transportation systems when considering the correlated power generation of wind turbines (WTs). Moreover, blockchain technology is deployed to guarantee the security of data transfer within the smart city. Hence, there is a secure collaboration within all sub-systems in the smart cities, which has triggered the integrated management in this structure. The simulation results are discussed on a typical smart city test system to show the quality of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow forecasting is indispensable in today’s society and regarded as a key problem for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), as emergency delays in vehicles can cause serious traffic security accidents. However, the complex dynamic spatial-temporal dependency and correlation between different locations on the road make it a challenging task for security in transportation. To date, most existing forecasting frames make use of graph convolution to model the dynamic spatial-temporal correlation of vehicle transportation data, ignoring semantic similarity between nodes and thus, resulting in accuracy degradation. In addition, traffic data does not strictly follow periodicity and hard to be captured. To solve the aforementioned challenging issues, we propose in this article CRFAST-GCN, a multi-branch spatial-temporal attention graph convolution network. First, we capture the multi-scale (e.g., hour, day, and week) long- short-term dependencies through three identical branches, then introduce conditional random field (CRF) enhanced graph convolution network to capture the semantic similarity globally, so then we exploit the attention mechanism to captures the periodicity. For model evaluation using two real-world datasets, performance analysis shows that the proposed CRFAST-GCN successfully handles the complex spatial-temporal dynamics effectively and achieves improvement over the baselines at 50% (maximum), outperforming other advanced existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent transportation systems, especially Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are emerging as a paradigm with the potential to change modern society. However, with this, there is a strong need to ensure the security and privacy of such systems. AV ecosystems depend on machine learning algorithms to autonomously control their operations. Given the amount of personal information AVs collect, coupled with the distributed nature of such ecosystems, there is a movement to employ federated learning algorithms to develop secure decision-making models. Although federated learning is a viable candidate for data privacy, it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly data poisoning attacks, where malicious vectors would be injected in the training phase. Additionally, hyperparameters play an important role in establishing an efficient federated learning model that can be resilient against adversarial attacks. In this paper, to address these challenges, we propose a novel Optimized Quantum-based Federated Learning (OQFL) framework to automatically adjust the hyperparameters of federated learning using various adversarial attacks in AV settings. This work is innovative in two ways: first, a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization technique is used to update the hyperparameters of the learning rate, local and global epochs. Second, the proposed technique is utilized within a cyber defense framework to defend against adversarial attacks. The performance of the proposed framework was evaluated using two benchmark datasets: MINST and Fashion-MINST, where they include images that would be extracted from smart cameras of AVs. This framework is shown to be more resilient against various adversarial attacks compared with peer techniques.},

We tried to bring together the ideas from researchers and experts on both transportation and smart grid areas to tackle the technological challenges in future power systems with more electric vehicles and intelligent systems. Theoretically, vehicles consist of different electrical and electronic hardware devices, which are connected with each other through the so-called ECUs being controlled by different software tools. As a well-perceived technology, all sensing instruments located at different points in an electric vehicle will direct their data to the ECU, wherein these data are analyzed and processed, and the demanding orders are sent to the pertinent actuators. With the advance of automobile technology, the electric vehicles are not only an electric load consumer anymore, but are appearing at different parts of human life, ranging from the smart homes and smart buildings to smart grid and smart cities. Owing to the complex and interconnected cyber-physical nature of electric vehicles, they can are getting a more appealing and accessible target for cyber hackers to penetrate the entire system through car hacking. This can result in long-term effects on the security and privacy of the electric vehicle owners, smart buildings, smart grids, and smart cities of the future. Be on that, this Special Issue scope includes methods, tools, applications, and solutions for analyzing, processing, and improving the electric vehicles as a complex cyber-physical system considering its direct or indirect effects on the modern human life factors.

  abstract     = {Guaranteeing real-time and accurate object detection simultaneously is paramount in autonomous driving environments. However, the existing object detection neural network systems are characterized by a tradeoff between computation time and accuracy, making it essential to optimize such a tradeoff. Fortunately, in many autonomous driving environments, images come in a continuous form, providing an opportunity to use optical flow. In this paper, we improve the performance of an object detection neural network utilizing optical flow estimation. In addition, we propose a Lyapunov optimization framework for time-average performance maximization subject to stability. It adaptively determines whether to use optical flow to suit the dynamic vehicle environment, thereby ensuring the vehicle’s queue stability and the time-average maximum performance simultaneously. To verify the key ideas, we conduct numerical experiments with various object detection neural networks and optical flow estimation networks. In addition, we demonstrate the self-configurable stabilized detection with YOLOv3-tiny and FlowNet2-S, which are the real-time object detection network and an optical flow estimation network, respectively. In the demonstration, our proposed framework improves the accuracy by 3.02%, the number of detected objects by 59.6%, and the queue stability for computing capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Adverse weather conditions such as haze can deteriorate the performance of autonomous driving and intelligent transport systems. As a potential remedy, we propose an enhanced multi-scale network, dubbed GridDehazeNet+, for single image dehazing. The proposed dehazing method does not rely on the Atmosphere Scattering Model (ASM), and an explanation as to why it is not necessarily performing the dimension reduction offered by this model is provided. GridDehazeNet+ consists of three modules: pre-processing, backbone, and post-processing. The trainable pre-processing module can generate learned inputs with better diversity and more pertinent features as compared to those derived inputs produced by hand-selected pre-processing methods. The backbone module implements multi-scale estimation with two major enhancements: 1) a novel grid structure that effectively alleviates the bottleneck issue via dense connections across different scales; 2) a spatial-channel attention block that can facilitate adaptive fusion by consolidating dehazing-relevant features. The post-processing module helps to reduce the artifacts in the final output. Due to domain shift, the model trained on synthetic data may not generalize well on real data. To address this issue, we shape the distribution of synthetic data to match that of real data, and use the resulting translated data to finetune our network. We also propose a novel intra-task knowledge transfer mechanism that can memorize and take advantage of synthetic domain knowledge to assist the learning process on the translated data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art on several synthetic dehazing datasets, and achieves the superior performance on real-world hazy images after finetuning.},

  abstract     = {Lane change is a common-yet-challenging driving behavior for automated vehicles. To improve the safety and efficiency of automated vehicles, researchers have proposed various lane-change decision models. However, most of the existing models consider lane-change behavior as a one-player decision-making problem, ignoring the essential multi-agent properties when vehicles are driving in traffic. Such models lead to deficiencies in interaction and collaboration between vehicles, which results in hazardous driving behaviors and overall traffic inefficiency. In this paper, we revisit the lane-change problem and propose a bi-level lane-change behavior planning strategy, where the upper level is a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based lane-change decision model and the lower level is a negotiation based right-of-way assignment model. We promote the collaboration performance of the upper-level lane-change decision model from three crucial aspects. First, we formulate the lane-change decision problem with a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning model, which provides a more appropriate paradigm for collaboration than the single-agent model. Second, we encode the driving intentions of surrounding vehicles into the observation space, which can empower multiple vehicles to implicitly negotiate the right-of-way in decision-making and enable the model to determine the right-of-way in a collaborative manner. Third, an ingenious reward function is designed to allow the vehicles to consider not only ego benefits but also the impact of changing lanes on traffic, which will guide the multi-agent system to learn excellent coordination performance. With the upper-level lane-change decisions, the lower-level right-of-way assignment model is used to guarantee the safety of lane-change behaviors. The experiments show that the proposed approaches can lead to safe, efficient, and harmonious lane-change behaviors, which boosts the collaboration between vehicles and in turn improves the safety and efficiency of the overall traffic. Moreover, the proposed approaches promote the microscopic synchronization of vehicles, which can lead to the macroscopic synchronization of traffic flow.},

  abstract     = {With the development of intelligent transportation technologies, on-demand food delivery has become a prevalent logistics service that brings convenience to our daily life. However, problems such as inappropriate assignment and delayed delivery still exist in current food delivery platforms. To address these issues, this paper presents a Crowdsourced Recommending-and-Grabbing (CRG) system for order allocation in on-demand food delivery service. Unlike other traditional logistics systems, the CRG system considers the preferences of crowdsourced riders and allocates orders by recommending them to suitable crowdsourced riders. Riders can grab their favorite orders from personalized order lists. To optimize the experience of both customers and crowdsourced riders, a hierarchical solution framework composed of prediction and optimization is proposed to generate satisfactory order allocation schemes. First at the prediction part, we predict the preferences of crowdsourced riders by establishing a predictive model using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Then at the optimization phase, an allocating-and-sequencing algorithm is designed to appropriately expose orders to crowdsourced riders and sequence the order list for each rider. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world datasets and the comparative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, suggesting that the presented CRG system is promising to facilitate the on-demand food delivery effectively and efficiently.},

The loss function is formulated as a weighted-mean-squared error, where the weights are tuned based on the influence of uncertainty at an individual prediction step on the energy consumption of the automated following vehicle. The efficacy of the proposed loss function is validated by applying it to training representative predictors and testing the predictors in the energy-optimal control of the following vehicle. The energy saving of the optimal controller is evaluated by comparing the electricity consumption of a battery electric vehicle with the human driver following, emulated by an intelligent driver model. Simulation results show that the energy consumption of an electric vehicle is reduced by an average of 12% compared to a human driver following demonstrated by an intelligent driver model, whereas using a conventional loss function, a mean-squared error loss function, reduces by 10%.},

Moreover, spillback avoidance is incorporated during the queue formation oversaturated regime by adopting a mixed delay and probability of spillback objective function. Microsimulation experiments demonstrate the optimality, practicality, and robustness to system uncertainties of the proposed signal control method.

Furthermore, no existing works on this topic can provide a unified framework to address multiple performance and safety constraints during the cooperative transportation operation. In this paper, we propose and investigate a new constrained cooperative control architecture for an UAV team, which are collaboratively carrying a three-dimensional load, subject to multiple user-defined time-varying performance and safety constraint requirements. A unified framework using universal barrier functions has been proposed to deal with different types of constraint requirements. Moreover, control saturation and uncertainties in UAV inertia matrices are dealt with by employing adaptive estimators. Exponential convergence on the distance and attitude tracking errors can be guaranteed by the algorithm.

Under the vector-backstepping design framework, the classification reconstruction idea and adaptive neural-based state observer are used to resolve the control design issue for MSVs. To improve the control performance, the serial-parallel estimation model is introduced to obtain a prediction error, and then a composite learning law is designed by embedding the prediction error and estimate of lumped disturbance. To reduce the mechanical wear of actuator, a dynamic event triggering protocol is established between the control law and actuator. Finally, a new dynamic event-triggered composite learning adaptive neural output feedback control solution is developed.

  abstract     = {Compaction is a critical step in asphalt roadway construction to determine the pavement’s quality and service life. Current field compactions are mainly based on test strips and engineers’ experiences. Such empirical-based approaches sometimes cause compaction problems especially when new materials are implemented. Intelligent compaction (IC) technology was invented to improve compaction quality. The real-time collection and visualization of the pavement responses and temperature can greatly improve compaction uniformity. However, the material viscoelastic property and the complex pavement structure still hinder the establishment of the correlation between the Intelligent Compaction Measurement Value (ICMV) and the compactability of asphalt pavement. This paper aims to establish compaction prediction models based on machine learning (ML) algorithms and sensing technology. Given the strong correlation between the mixture’s compactability and the particle compaction characteristics, a particle-size wireless sensor, SmartRock, was used to collect the particle kinematic behaviors during compaction. 11 asphalt mixtures were compacted with an embedded SmartRock sensor. Three ML models and three dataset scenarios were applied to predict the compaction condition, and a higher than 98% prediction accuracy was achieved. The results revealed that combining the ML approach and sensing data is appropriate and practical for predicting the compaction condition of the asphalt mixture. Future studies shall further evaluate the algorithm based on field compaction data so that intelligent sensing technology can be implemented to improve compaction quality.},

  abstract     = {The number of traffic accidents has been continuously increasing in recent years worldwide. Many accidents are caused by distracted drivers, who take their attention away from driving. Motivated by the success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision, many researchers developed CNN-based algorithms to recognize distracted driving from a dashcam and warn the driver against unsafe behaviors. However, current models have too many parameters, which is unfeasible for vehicle-mounted computing. This work proposes a novel knowledge-distillation-based framework to solve this problem. The proposed framework first constructs a high-performance teacher network by progressively strengthening the robustness to illumination changes from shallow to deep layers of a CNN. Then, the teacher network is used to guide the architecture searching process of a student network through knowledge distillation. After that, we use the teacher network again to transfer knowledge to the student network by knowledge distillation. Experimental results on the Statefarm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset and AUC Distracted Driver Dataset show that the proposed approach is highly effective for recognizing distracted driving behaviors from photos: (i) the teacher network’s accuracy surpasses the previous best accuracy; (ii) the student network achieves very high accuracy with only 0.42M parameters (around 55% of the previous most lightweight model). Furthermore, the student network architecture can be extended to a spatial-temporal 3D CNN for recognizing distracted driving from video clips. The 3D student network largely surpasses the previous best accuracy with only 2.03M parameters on the Drive&amp;Act Dataset.

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation is an important task for intelligent vehicles to understand the environment. Current deep learning based methods require large amounts of labeled data for training. Manual annotation is expensive, while simulators can provide accurate annotations. However, the performance of the semantic segmentation model trained with synthetic datasets will significantly degenerate in the actual scenes. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation is used to reduce the domain gap and improve the performance on the target domain. Existing adversarial-based and self-training methods usually involve complex training procedures, while entropy-based methods have recently received attention for their simplicity and effectiveness. However, entropy-based UDA methods have problems that they barely optimize hard samples and lack an explicit semantic connection between the source and target domains. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage entropy-based UDA method for semantic segmentation. In stage one, we design a threshold-adaptative unsupervised focal loss to regularize the prediction in the target domain. It first introduces unsupervised focal loss into UDA for semantic segmentation, helping to optimize hard samples and avoiding generating unreliable pseudo-labels in the target domain. In stage two, we employ cross-domain image mixing (CIM) to bridge the semantic knowledge between two domains and incorporate long-tail class pasting to alleviate the class imbalance problem. Extensive experiments on synthetic-to-real and cross-city benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. It achieves state-of-the-art performance using DeepLabV2, as well as competitive performance using the lightweight BiSeNet with great advantages in training and inference time.},

Current research methods to measure trust mainly rely on subjective scales, with several intrinsic limitations. This empirical experiment proposes a novel method to measure trust objectively, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Through manipulating participants’ expectations regarding driving automation credibility, we have induced and successfully measured opposing levels of trust in automation. Most notably, our results evidence two separate yet interrelated cortical mechanisms for trust and distrust. Trust is demonstrably linked to decreased monitoring and working memory, whereas distrust is event-related and strongly tied to affective (or emotional) mechanisms. This paper evidence that trust in automation and situation awareness are strongly interrelated during driving automation usage. Our findings are crucial for developing future driver state monitoring technology that mitigates the impact of inappropriate reliance, or over trust, in automated driving systems.},

Therefore, this article presents a novel bi-level &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$l_{1}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; optimization based approach for reducing interferences between automotive radars for range, velocity and angle measurement. Firstly, sparse difference analysis between the interfering signal and the target signal is investigated. According to the analysis results, one bi-level based signal optimization model is further derived by using &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$l_{1}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -norm penalized least squares. This bi-level optimization enables a trade-off between suppressing interference and preserving radar targets. Specifically, in the first &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$l_{1}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; level, the interfering signal is first optimized as the “desired signal”, while the target is considered as “noise”. Meanwhile, sparse optimization is applied on the target signals in the frequency domain at the second &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$l_{1}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; level. Finally, the iterated soft-thresholding algorithm is used to optimize the proposed model. In real road interference suppression experiments, the proposed method improves the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) for the target from 5.06 dB to 19.26 dB in the range-Doppler domain and from 6.86 dB to 22.10 dB in the azimuth spatial domain.},

  abstract     = {In the future, the role of the human factor in the driving processes is expected to decrease continuously. At the same time, based on the global trends, the role of computer-supported decision systems and artificial intelligence (AI)-based control solutions increases in relation to driving processes, which carries a significant safety-enhancing potential. To assess the possible social benefits of automated vehicle systems objectively, it is necessary to analyze the possible negative effects in detail as well. Accordingly, the aim of this article is to present a statistical survey of crashes involving automated vehicles today in order to identify and evaluate the factors that are relevant in the crashes. The analyzed data showed that when the autopilot mode was turned off and the human driver made the control decisions, the severity of crashes on straight roads was greater at &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\alpha \,\,=0.1$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; significance level than when the vehicle was in autopilot mode and the vehicle system made the control decisions.

  abstract     = {Traffic forecasting aims to capture complex spatial-temporal dependencies and non-linear dynamics, which plays an indispensable role in intelligent transportation systems and other domains like neuroscience, climate, etc. Most recent works rely on graph convolutional networks (GCN) to model the dependencies and the dynamics. However, the over-smoothing issue of GCN would produce indistinguishable features among nodes, leading to poor expressivity and weak capability of modeling complex dependencies and dynamics. To address this issue, we present a novel clustering spatial-temporal (ClusterST) unit, which incorporates unsupervised learning into GCN for extracting discriminative features. Specifically, we first exploit a neural network to learn a dynamic clustering, i.e., learning to partition the neighbors of each node into clusters at each time step. Two probabilistic losses are proposed to improve the separability of clusters. Then, the extracted features of different clusters can be distinguished. Based on the dynamically formed clusters, a vanilla GCN is applied to aggregate features within each cluster. By purely exploiting such a ClusterST unit, large improvements over the state-of-the-art are achieved. Furthermore, ClusterST units with a different number of clusters can be regarded as basic components to construct an inception-like ClusterST network for going deeper. We evaluate the framework on two real-world large-scale traffic datasets and observe an average improvement of 18.19% and 7.62% over state-of-the-art baselines, respectively. The code and models will be publicly available.},

Our objective is to minimize their total fuel consumption by jointly optimizing path planning, speed planning, and platooning configuration. Such a two-truck platooning problem is pervasive in practice yet challenging to solve due to hard deadline constraints and enormous platooning configurations to consider. We first leverage a unique problem structure to significantly simplify platooning optimization and present a novel formulation. We prove that the two-truck platooning problem is weakly NP-hard and admits a Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS). The FPTAS can achieve a fuel consumption within a ratio of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$(1+\epsilon)$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; to the optimal (for any &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\epsilon &amp;gt;0$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ) with a time complexity polynomial in the size of the transportation network and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$1/\epsilon $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; . These results are in sharp contrast to the general multi-truck platooning problem, which is known to be APX-hard and repels any FPTAS. As the FPTAS still incurs excessive running time for large-scale cases, we design an efficient dual-subgradient algorithm for solving large-/national- scale instances. It is an iterative algorithm that always converges. We prove that each iteration only incurs polynomial-time complexity, albeit it requires solving an integer linear programming problem optimally. We characterize a condition under which the algorithm generates an optimal solution and derive a posterior performance bound when the condition is not met. Extensive simulations based on real-world traces show that our joint solution of path planning, speed planning, and platooning saves up to 24% fuel as compared to baseline alternatives.},

  abstract     = {Crowd-Sourced Delivery Services (CDS) use in-store customers, as crowd-shippers, to deliver online orders directly to other customers. As independent contractors, the crowd-shippers are free to decide whether to accept or reject the online orders assigned by the retailer. High order rejection rates can significantly influence the retailer’s delivery costs due to frequent reassignments and shifting the orders to more expensive professional fleet. To incentivize crowd-shippers to accept the matched orders, in this work, we propose a two-stage optimization framework that integrates bipartite matching with an individual compensation scheme. The first stage of the optimization framework computes the optimal matching between crowd-shippers and online orders to minimize the delivery detours and unassigned orders. Given the matching solutions as inputs, the second stage computes personal compensation for each crowd-shipper based on the characteristic of the matched order and his or her acceptance behavior uncertainty, with the goal of minimizing the expected total delivery cost of the retailer. Numerical experiments are conducted using the survey data to illustrate the performance of the proposed framework and compare it with existing matching and pricing strategies in the literature. Our results show that the proposed framework reduces the delivery cost by up to more than 15% and reduces the crowd-shippers’ rejection rate by an average of 55%.},

  abstract     = {Adapting to the navigational high-precision tracking tasks, this paper develops an event-triggered adaptive neural asymptotic tracking control framework for underactuated ships. The prescribed performance control (PPC) technique is employed to address spatial constraints in navigation, where the positional tracking errors are transformed via the transformation functions. By using the approximation of radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs) in the form of minimum learning parameters (MLPs), the uncertainties coming from the unknown model dynamics, the environmental disturbances and the derivation of virtual control laws are offset all together, and a succinct computation is guaranteed. Assisted by the property of neural basis function, the “algebraic loop” problem in the backstepping design is released. To achieve the asymptotic tracking performance, the hyperbolic tangent functions are incorporated into the control laws, which are characterized by the integral-bounded terms. The event-triggered control (ETC) is designed in the controller-to-actuator (CA) channel. Two separate triggering conditions are constructed for the surge and the yaw motions respectively, which are characterized by the compound thresholds composed of a variable and a constant. The “Zeno” behaviors can thereby be avoided. The proposed scheme has three notable characteristics: 1) the computational complexity is reduced by using the MLP technique with lumped uncertainties; 2) the high-precision tracking performance can be achieved through the asymptotic tracking control; 3) the practical problems of spatial constraints and communication burdens can be solved by fabricating a uniform control framework including PPC and ETC. With the aid of direct Lyapunov candidates and the Barbalat’s lemma, the asymptotic convergence of all the tracking errors is proved. Finally, a numerical experiment corroborates the feasibility of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Trip purpose is essential information supporting tasks in intelligent transportation systems, such as travel behaviour comprehension, location-based service, and urban planning. The observation of trip purpose is a necessary aspect of travel surveys. However, owing to the sampling volume, survey budget, and survey frequency, relying solely on travel surveys in the era of big data is a difficult task. There has long been a demand for an accurate, generalizable, and robust inference method for trip purposes. Although existing studies contributed significant efforts to improve the trip purpose inference, the potential of leveraging the trip chain is insufficient. The spatial correlations and chaining patterns hidden in travelled zones are worthy of further exploration. The unequal importance within trip chains has not been clearly represented. Additionally, complex activity-zone mutual interdependence has not been considered in previous models. Herein, we propose a framework- D ual-Flow A ttentive Network with Feature Cross ing (DACross), specifically for inferring the chained trip purpose. We form trip chains innovatively that treat trip activities and travelled geographic zones as two chains with mutual interactions. We propose DACross, which consists of two parallel attentive branches and a co-attentive feature crossing module, for fully learning the intra- and inter-chain dependencies. We conducted extensive experiments on four large-scale real-world datasets to evaluate not only the performance of DACross but also the generalizability of the proposed framework among different cities and scenarios. Notably, the Experimental results prove the overall superiority of the proposed DACross.},

  abstract     = {Accurate airport capacity estimation is crucial for the secure and orderly operation of the aviation system. However, such estimation is a non-trivial task as capacity depends on various meteorological and operational features. The complex coupling characteristics among these multi-source features have proved to be challenging for most of the traditional regression models. Recently, enhanced by its excellent ability to mine nonlinear relationships, the machine learning methods trigger widely applications. However, due to the imbalance of features scatter and the neglect of temporal dependences in aviation systems, existing machine learning methods for airport capacity prediction still have room for improvement. In light of these, this paper presents a novel airport capacity prediction method based on the multi-channel fusion Transformer model (MF-Transformer). Besides the commonly used aviation features, we unprecedentedly harness the power of the high-dimensional meteorological feature for accurate prediction. As to the model, we construct a multi-channel feature fusion structure, which includes a three-channel network for multi-source features extraction and an attention-based feature fusion module between channels. In each channel, the Transformer-based model is utilized to capture the temporal dependences of features. We conduct experiments on the capacity prediction tasks of the Beijing Capital International Airport which is the largest airport in China and verify that the proposed MF-Transformer outperforms benchmarks under different prediction horizons.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle platoon has the potential to significantly improve traffic throughput and reduce fuel consumption and emissions and thus has attracted extensive attention recently. In this study, we propose a vehicle platoon of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) with a combined spacing policy to enhance traffic performance. First, a combined spacing policy composed of the constant time gap (CTG) and constant spacing (CS) is formulated for the proposed vehicle platoon, where the leader adopts the CTG and the followers use the CS policy. Based on the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$h_{2}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -norm string stability criteria, the notion of exogenous-head-to-tail string stability is newly introduced, and the sufficient conditions of the local stability and string stability in the frequency domain are derived using the Routh-Hurwitz criterion and Laplace transform respectively. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the string stability. The effectiveness of the proposed vehicle platoons is verified by theoretical analysis and numerical experiments using two typical scenarios and several measurements of effectiveness (MOE) in various performance aspects, including efficiency, safety, energy, and emission. The results show that the proposed vehicle platoon performs better than the CS-based vehicle platoon in all aspects except for efficiency. It also indicates that the proposed vehicle platoon has obvious advantages over the CTG-based vehicle platoon in efficiency and safety aspects. The findings have demonstrated the merits of the combined application of CTG and CS policies for the vehicle platoon in enhancing stability and traffic performance.},

  abstract     = {Low Emission Zones (LEZ)s are areas where access restrictions to polluting vehicles are enforced. These infrastructures have become a main mechanism in large cities to deal with urban traffic and environmental pollution. A main problem of practical LEZs is that they generally depend on a camera network that identifies users and jeopardizes their privacy. In the literature, there are some privacy-preserving works that rely on camera-free approaches; however, they still suffer from a major issue: they depend on centralized entities to manage the vehicles’ accesses/departures and their corresponding fee payment. Those centralized entities represent a critical single point of failure in the system, endangering its security and availability. In order to address this situation, this paper proposes a new scheme that decentralizes the LEZ management, dealing with vehicle accesses as blockchain transactions, and pricing and charging them using smart contracts. In order to validate the deployability of the new scheme in real scenarios, it has been implemented and tested in both a controlled environment and a low-traffic street. The evaluation of the smart contracts’ costs in terms of gas has been included in the performed tests. The results obtained are satisfactory and show the feasibility of the new proposal.},

  abstract     = {Off-road semantic segmentation with fine-grained labels is necessary for autonomous vehicles to understand driving scenes, as the coarse-grained road detection cannot satisfy off-road vehicles with various mechanical properties. Pixel-wise annotation of fine-grained labels in off-road scenes is very hard because a large part of the pixels could suffer from severe semantic ambiguity. Furthermore, semantic properties of off-road scenes can be very changeable due to various precipitations, temperature, defoliation, etc. To address these challenges, this research proposes an active and contrastive learning-based method. A few image patches are annotated mainly to distinguish semantic differences rather than semantic categories, which can greatly reduce the burden of manual annotation. A feature representation is learnt using the contrastive pairs of image patches, and semantic categories are adaptively modeled from the data. To actively adapt to new scenes, a risk evaluation method is developed to discover and select hard frames with high-risk predictions for supplementary labeling, to update the model efficiently. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted on self-developed and public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-grained semantic segmentation can be learned with only dozens of weakly labeled frames, and the model can efficiently adapt across scenes by weak supervision, while achieving competitive performance with the typical fully supervised ones.},

From the aspect of macro-traffic flows, its impact on traffic efficiency and safety has been investigated. However, as a non-essential lane-changing type, a single discretionary lane-changing’s impact on surrounding traffic is still difficult to be quantified by real-word traffic data. To solve this problem, this paper first proposes a trajectory data-based analytic method to calculate response time of the lane-changing vehicle and its following vehicles, then develops a time sequence data processing method based on feature points to analyze the change pattern of the variable minimum space, and then a lane-changing’s temporal and spatial on surrounding traffic can be captured by the decreasing-increasing pattern of minimum space. Besides, a high-precision trajectory data set, called Zen-traffic, is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and reach conclusions. Given the condition that the speed of a discretionary lane-changing vehicle is between 6 to 20 m/s, i.e., the traffic condition at which lane changes more likely occur, the results of the paper include (1) on average, 4 or 5 vehicles are usually impacted by a discretionary lane change; (2) the average impact time is 12 to 13 seconds and it has little relationship with the distance between the lane-changing vehicle and the following vehicle on the target/initial lane; (3) the lateral movement direction (i.e., changing to left or to right) of a lane change has a significant impact on the number of the vehicles affected.},

By exploiting the attention mechanism in this work, it is demonstrated that most of the features used for classifying a vehicle are extracted from its headlight, grill, scoop, and bumper sections. These areas are designated as the regions of interest (ROIs) in our approach. Contrary to the other methods in which a whole ROI is fed to a deep convolutional neural network, in this scheme, different ROIs are extracted from each image, and then a preprocessing block and a distinctive network are designed for each ROI, which is considered as a single agent. Each agent is then trained separately, and a vehicle’s type is determined with the collaboration of these agents and based on the blackboard classification system. Also, a new dataset (DeepCar 5.0) is compiled by using the data from the top 50 automakers. This dataset contains 40,185 images of the front views and the front three-quarters of vehicles in 480 different classes, and all the parts of dataset are labeled manually. The proposed technique is able to achieve the accuracies of 92.14 and 96.72% in the automated and the manual scenarios, respectively; and contrary to the current methods, it can perform flawless classification even when just a portion of a vehicle’s front view image is available for processing.

It is considered that the BSCS locally incorporates the battery swapping and charging processes, and the two processes are managed by two operators, called a battery swapping operator (BSO) and a battery charging operator (BCO), respectively. Our main contribution is to propose a bilevel model where the BSO acts as the leader to receive and serve the battery swapping requests from EV users, and the BCO acts as the follower to interact with the grid and control battery charging and discharging power. We reformulate the bilevel optimization problem into an equivalent single-level problem that is a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), and its size can easily become very large. To solve the problem efficiently, we develop a new heuristic composed of two parts, i.e., an estimation of the integer solution and an algorithm based on the alternating direction method (ADM). The results show that the proposed heuristic performs well in solving large-scale problems, providing close-to-optimal solutions quickly. In addition, compared to a social welfare maximization model that follows most existing related works, the proposed bilevel model can increase the number of swapped-out batteries by 35% and the batteries’ average energy state by 6%, improving the quality of battery swapping services.},

With the development of autonomous driving, highly dynamic and complex road environment brings rising need to understand the type and motion status of objects, thus element list has became the mainstream environment model. However, along comes the reliablity problem caused by missed detection and irregular objects, which is still inevitable despite the detection accuracy improvement. In view of this, a new view of driving environment is proposed as the unified state-extended boundary (USEB), aiming to improve the reliablity of element-oriented model. For driving decision requirements, different types of elements are consistently converted into driving constraints. Semantics and dynamics are expressed as the status of drivable area boundary, making it possible to merge space occupation to improve reliability against missed detection and irregular objects. Evaluation of USEB is carried out on the nuScenes dataset. Comparative results show that the proposed USEB could cover the required information for driving decision, whereas achieving higher reliability than the commonly applied element-oriented model.},

  abstract     = {Due to the high integration of wireless communication and networking technologies, the communication-based train control (CBTC) systems are exposed to additional cyber-attack surfaces, allowing sophisticated attackers to combine cyber attack vectors with physical attack means to achieve malicious goals. Notably, the decentralized authentication features are missing in existing communication protocols which make the CBTC be easily compromised by data tampering attacks, and lead to serious operational accidents. With outstanding advantages in decentralized authentication, blockchain provides new effective solutions for decentralized identity authentication in CBTC. Consequently, it is critical to study the complex physical consequences of cyber breaches from a cross-layer defense perspective. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-layer defense method for cyber security in blockchain empowered CBTC against data tampering attacks. In the physical layer, the joint Kalman filter and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\chi ^{2} $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; detector is proposed for the train state estimation and detection. In the cyber layer, an asymmetric encryption-based secure communication protocol with identity authentication and the blockchain-based distributed key management system with the adaptive consensus mechanism are designed for data communication security. Considering the unavailable direct observation of the CBTC cyber security states, a partially observable Markov (POMDP) decision model is constructed to derive the optimal adaptive consensus strategies for balancing cyber security and efficiency. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed blockchain empowered CBTC cross-layer defense method can effectively improve the cyber security protection capability and minimize the impact of data tampering attacks on the train operation.},

Absolute pose regression, directly estimating the mapping from a scene to a 6-DoF pose, has achieved impressive results in learning-based localization. Different from traditional map-based methods, it does not need a pre-built 3D map during inference. However, current regression networks typically suffer from scene ambiguities, especially in challenging traffic environments, leading to large wrong predictions (e.g., outliers) and limited applications. To address this problem, a novel LiDAR localization framework with spatio-temporal constraints is proposed, termed STCLoc, to reduce scene ambiguities and achieve more accurate localization. First, we propose to regularize regression in the spatial dimension with a novel classification task to reduce outliers. Specifically, the classification task categorizes the point cloud in terms of position and orientation and then couples it with the regression task to conduct multi-task learning. Second, to learn discriminative features to reduce scene ambiguities, we propose using attention-based feature aggregation to capture the correlation in LiDAR sequences. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, where the localization takes 97ms on each dataset. Results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 43.33%/36.76% (position/orientation) on the Oxford Radar RobotCar dataset, verifying the effectiveness of our method.

  abstract     = {Merging is, in general, a challenging task for both human drivers and autonomous vehicles, especially in dense traffic, because the merging vehicle typically needs to interact with other vehicles to identify or create a gap and safely merge into. In this paper, we consider the problem of autonomous vehicle control for forced merge scenarios. We propose a novel game-theoretic controller, called the Leader-Follower Game Controller (LFGC), in which the interactions between the autonomous ego vehicle and other vehicles with a priori uncertain driving intentions is modeled as a partially observable leader-follower game. The LFGC estimates the other vehicles’ intentions online based on observed trajectories, and then predicts their future trajectories and plans the ego vehicle’s own trajectory using Model Predictive Control (MPC) to simultaneously achieve probabilistically guaranteed safety and merging objectives. To verify the performance of LFGC, we test it in simulations and with the NGSIM data, where the LFGC demonstrates a high success rate of 97.5% in merging.},

  abstract     = {The berth allocation and quay crane assignment problem (BACAP) is an important port operation planning problem. To obtain an effective and reliable schedule of berth and quay crane (QC), this study addresses the BACAP with stochastic arrival times of vessels. An efficient method combining scenario generation is presented to simulate the stochastic arrival times. After then, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is established, aiming to minimize the expectation of the vessels’ total stay time in port. A multi-objective constraint-handling (MOCH) strategy is adopted to reformulate the developed model, which converts constraint violations into an objective, thus transforming the single-objective optimization model with complex constraints into a dual-objective optimization model with only easy-handling constraints. Then an enhanced non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (ENSGA-II) is proposed to solve the dual-objective model, in which a neighborhood search algorithm and a search bias mechanism are incorporated to strengthen the local exploitation capability. Furthermore, a repair method (RM), penalty function (PF) and the superiority of feasible solutions (SF) strategy for constraint handling are designed respectively and incorporated with genetic algorithm to solve the original single-objective optimization model. Finally, numerical experiments on instances in the literature are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the MOCH and the proposed ENSGA-II. The results show that the average total stay time of vessels is reduced when stochastic arrival times are considered. Comparison results with another two multi-objective methods and three single-objective methods combined with different constraint-handling strategies corroborate the superiority of the proposed ENSGA-II and MOCH.},

Specifically, the proposed adaptive forgetting factor recursive least squares (AFFRLS) algorithm allows the open-circuit voltage and other parameters to be jointly identified without the open circuit voltage-state of charge (OCV-SOC) test. An online capacity estimation approach with the extended Kalman particle filter (EPF) is put forward for capacity estimation. Further, an improved GMM is proposed to visualize battery pack inconsistency, using the K-means++ algorithm to initialize category centers. The standard deviation coefficient approach quantifies the inconsistency. Finally, the real-life vehicle data are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can evaluate the battery parameters accurately.

As a kind of optimal method, reinforcement learning (RL) has been used to solve the SPO problem. In the learning process of a common RL algorithm, a soft constraint (punishment) is always used to keep the agent away from unsafe states. However, a soft constraint can not guarantee and explain the safety of the result. For the SPO problem, it means that the optimized speed profile obtained by a simple RL may break the speed limit which is unacceptable in reality.

  abstract     = {Traffic congestion has a negative economic and environmental impact. Traffic conditions become even worse in areas with high volume of trucks. In this paper, we propose a coordinated pricing-and-routing scheme for truck drivers to efficiently route trucks into the network and improve the overall traffic conditions. A basic characteristic of our approach is the fact that we provide personalized routing instructions based on drivers’ individual routing preferences. In contrast with previous works that provide personalized routing suggestions, our approach optimizes over a total system-wide cost through a combined pricing-and-routing scheme that satisfies the budget balance on average property and ensures that every truck driver has an incentive to participate in the proposed mechanism by guaranteeing that the expected total utility of a truck driver (including payments) in case he/she decides to participate in the mechanism, is greater than or equal to his/her expected utility in case he/she does not participate. Since estimating a utility function for each individual truck driver is computationally intensive, we first divide the truck drivers into disjoint clusters based on their responses to a small number of binary route choice questions and we subsequently propose to use a learning scheme based on the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) principle that allows us to learn the parameters of the utility function that describes each cluster. The estimated utilities are then used to calculate a pricing-and-routing scheme with the aforementioned characteristics. Simulation results in the Sioux Falls network demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed pricing-and-routing scheme.},

The two objectives considered are: the minimization of total transportation cost and the maximization of service quality. Given a set of transportation orders described by an origin, a destination and a time window, solving BMTPP involves determining the delivery path for each order in a capacitated network as well as selecting the carrier with the best service quality for each edge of the path.

As the NP-hardness of the single-objective problems derived from BMTPP, a Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) heuristic which can not only provide a near-optimal solution but also a lower bound for each of the single-objective problems is developed. 100 randomly generated instances are tested and the computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the heuristic in obtaining a tight lower bound and a high-quality near-optimal solution for the derived single-objective problem. Various performance indicators show the high-quality of the Pareto front of the bi-objective problem obtained by the heuristic.

In most lane reservation problems (LRPs), the parameters underlying the system traffic conditions (e.g., vehicle speed and traffic flow) cannot be effectively specified. This paper addresses a new dynamic lane reservation problem (DLRP), which aims to optimize lanes that need to be reserved in different time periods based on trajectory data for existing transit network optimization. For passengers in reserved lanes, their travel time is minimized to guarantee traffic priority. Considering that the reserved lanes cause travel time growth on regular lanes, an improved multiobjective mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) is established to minimize the delay. The problem complexity of this paper is NP-hard. This paper applies a preprocessing method for the actual traffic flow data analysis for link travel time calculation. We developed a hybrid evolutionary algorithm decomposing a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) to a collection of simple MOPs. These subproblems are collaboratively solved. The hybrid crossover strategy exploits the advantages of different crossover operators for a better performance. The experimental results of MOEA/D and NSGA-II with standard test functions show that the proposed algorithm can improve the convergence and distribution of the results. Through numerous analyses and calculations of instances, the proposed algorithm is proven to be effective.},

This paper illustrates that proper train scheduling is one of the effective approaches to optimize the system energy. Accordingly, comprehensive modeling is proposed considering different affecting factors such as the slope of different lines, the speed limits in each section, the time limit between the arrivals of trains to each station, and different modes of operation such as motoring and braking. Using the proposed model, an optimization problem with the objective function of energy-saving is solved. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the proposed scheduling scheme is applied to Line 2 of Tehran Urban &amp; Suburban Railway Operation Company.

Therefore, there would be a long period of time during which self-driving vehicles and human-driven vehicles coexist. However, for a mixed platoon, it is hard to control the formation due to the existence of the manual vehicles resulting in weak robustness and slow consensus rate on this system of platoons because of uncertainties caused by human factors for manual vehicles. In order to solve this problem, we establish models of mixed platoons with mixed types of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and HDVs without the vehicle awareness device (HDVWs). We subsequently design &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathcal {H}_{\infty} $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; controllers for the mixed platoons to realize the formation consensus.

Furthermore, conditions are proved to maintain the stability of the mixed platoons, and the stability is analyzed based on the variation of the penetration rate of the manual vehicles. Finally, we formulate conditions for parameters according to the definition of string stability to avoid the collisions of vehicles. The results in this study are tested with simulations and suggest that the presented controllers can ensure the consensus of mixed platoons under uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {The petrol station replenishment problem (PSRP) refers to the process of transporting petroleum products from oil depots to petrol stations via tank trucks. It mainly consists of two parts: allocating petroleum products to tank trucks and planning the travel route of each truck. In this study, we examine a new variant of PSRP by considering a multi-depot vehicle routing problem with open inter-depot routes (MDVRPOI). Each depot can act as an intermediate replenishment facility, and each truck can be reloaded at any depot any number of times within the working period. Moreover, trucks can end their routes at any depot instead of making a long empty drive to the start depot. The trucks are heterogeneous with multiple load-specific compartments. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. Given the problem’s complexity, a tabu-based adaptive large neighborhood search (T-ALNS) algorithm is proposed, which integrates the tabu search approach into ALNS to solve the problem effectively. The T-ALNS executes multiple problem-tailored destroy/repair operators on the station, trip, and route levels. A local search procedure with problem-specific operators and an adaptive strategy is further embedded into T-ALNS. We use the real data of an oil company in China to evaluate our algorithm. Computational results show that our T-ALNS significantly outperforms the CPLEX solver and other algorithms in terms of solution quality and computation time. Further, it realizes an average reduction in transportation cost of about 45% compared to the company’s actual strategy.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have the potential to generate socioeconomic benefits by reducing commute times, accidents and energy consumption. Ergonomists have foreseen the future of these vehicles as comfortable pods where the passengers will be watching movies, reading or simply relaxing. Motion Sickness (MS) is thought to be a human comfort issue which needs to be addressed to enable such a vision. The present study endeavours to address this issue by firstly proposing three algorithms for mitigating MS during various manoeuvres, namely: (1) Single Lane Change (SLC), (2) Double Lane Change (DLC) and (3) Cornering. This is done in 3 phases; phase 1 is the identification of coordinates using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), phase 2 is the MS-free block that minimizes MS, and the last phase is shaping and symmetry block for minimizing postural instability and maximizing handling comfort. This is believed to be the first time an ultimate motion sickness mitigating algorithm is introduced. The second proposed solution is a control strategy to ensure real-time adaptive MS reduction while the AV is on the move with the help of modern &amp; traditional controllers. Ultimately, The proposed hybrid solution is compared against other recent studies, with results illustrating a substantial MS reduction in AV’s of about 75%.},

  abstract     = {We present an integrated spatio-temporal framework for multi-range traction power and speed prediction for connected vehicles (CVs). It combines data-driven and model-based strategies to enable CVs energy efficiency optimization. The proposed framework focuses on urban arterial corridors with signalized intersections, and leverages the historical and real-time data collected from CVs and infrastructure to predict location-specific traction loads (e.g. acceleration at intersections), and augment them with time-specific speed profiles (e.g., stop duration at intersections). A Bayesian network is developed to provide a long-term load prediction informed by probabilistic analysis of historical traffic data at intersections and between intersections. Moreover, a shockwave profile model is adopted for modeling the queuing process at intersections by leveraging vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, providing a short-range prediction of the vehicle speed with an enhanced accuracy. The benefits of the proposed load prediction framework are demonstrated for energy management of connected hybrid electric vehicles (C-HEVs). By incorporating the predicted loads into a multi-horizon model predictive controller (MPC), integrated power and thermal management of light-duty C-HEVs is enabled over real-world driving cycles, demonstrating a near globally-optimal fuel consumption over the entire trip with a &lt; 1% deviation from dynamic programming (DP) results.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of planning trajectories for multiple cooperative agents along specified paths through a static road network. Vehicle trajectories are coupled through interactions at shared areas, including intersections and road segments. A motion model is presented that includes the combined trajectories of all vehicles. The trajectories are optimized for travel time by solving a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) that incorporates constraints to ensure collision avoidance. To improve the computation time of solving the MILP, two model modifications are introduced related to interactions: 1) The use of binary variables is reduced by grouping them at targeted travel times. 2) The relative travel order of interacting vehicles is constrained, guided by a heuristic solver. To further reduce computation time, an iterative method solves a sequence of smaller MILPs by targeting essential vehicle interactions with an algorithm that predicts interactions. Experiments are run on a simulated road network based on a real surface mine and haul truck trips. The proposed MILP methods are shown to significantly reduce solution costs compared to a reactive approach based on common driving practices. The MILP modifications significantly reduce computation time, trading off marginal solution quality. The reduction is extended by the iterative MILP scheme without degradation of solution quality.},

At the same time, these opportunities require innovative solutions to protect the drivers’ privacy in a complex environment like an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). This need is even more relevant when data are used to retrieve personal behaviors or attitudes. In our work, we propose a privacy-preserving solution, called Private Driver DNA, which designs a possible architecture, allowing drivers of an ITS to receive customized services. The proposed solution is based on the concept of Driver DNA as characterization of driver’s driving style. To assure privacy, we perform the operations directly on sanitized data, using the Order Revealing Encryption (ORE) method. Besides, the proposed solution is integrated with ITS architecture defined in the European project E-Corridor. The result is an effective privacy-preserving architecture for ITS to offer customized products, which can be used to address drivers’ behaviors, for example, to environmental-friendly attitudes or a more safe driving style. We test Private Driver DNA using a synthetic dataset generated with the vehicle simulator CARLA. We compare ORE with another encryption method like Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and some other privacy-preserving schemas. Besides, we quantify privacy gain and data loss utility after the data sanitization process.},

They are capable of reducing environmental degradation without compromising driving performance. Power management strategies (PMS) are particularly essential for electrified vehicles to ensure optimal power split between on-board energy storage sources and to meet operational requirements of each source. However, optimization concept in PMS, have been constantly addressed in literature to achieve optimal power handling decisions in real-time, particularly under unknown driving conditions. In this contribution, an intelligent rule-based PMS with embedded offline-optimized control parameters and online driving state recognition is proposed to achieve optimal power handling decisions for EVs situatively and adaptively. A set of characteristic variables defining driving states have been extracted from representative segments of several driving cycles, to which optimized control strategies are tuned offline. Three different driving cycles representing urban, highway, and mixed trip conditions have been implemented for comparative investigation of achieved results. The analysis of results reveals the potential of proposed PMS to reduce the energy consumption by 13.6 – 30.9 %.},

We show the effectiveness of applying a smoothing filter to the output neurons of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) when estimating vehicle viewpoint. We point out the overlooked fact that, under the same viewpoint, the appearance of a vehicle is strongly influenced by its position in the image plane, which renders viewpoint estimation from appearance an ill-posed problem. We show how, by inserting in the model a CoordConv layer to provide the coordinates of the vehicle, we are able to solve such ambiguity and greatly increase performance. Finally, we introduce a new data augmentation technique that improves viewpoint estimation on vehicles that are closer to the camera or partially occluded. All these improvements let a lightweight CNN reach optimal results while keeping inference time low. An extensive evaluation on a viewpoint estimation benchmark (Pascal3D+) and on actual vehicle camera data (nuScenes) shows that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in vehicle viewpoint estimation, both in terms of accuracy and memory footprint.},

  abstract     = {Traffic congestion at signalized intersections often leads to serious impacts on adjacent intersections on a corridor. To enhance intersections’ throughput efficiency, traffic signals are commonly coordinated across intersections. Traditional signal coordination methods control the adjacent intersections by setting a fixed phase offset. However, these traditional coordination methods may have poor adaptability to dynamic traffic conditions, which can cause additional congestion. To reduce arterial traffic delays, this paper develops an adaptive coordination control method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Most existing MARL-based methods rely on impractical assumptions to improve their performance in complex and dynamic traffic scenarios. To overcome these assumptions, this paper proposes a fully scalable MARL algorithm for arterial traffic signal coordination based on the proximal policy optimization algorithm. We apply a parameter-sharing training protocol to mitigate the slow convergence due to nonstationarity and to reduce computational requirements. In addition, a new action setting is designed by using the lead-lag phase sequence to simultaneously improve the implementation and coordination flexibility of the method. Extensive simulation experiments and comparisons with existing methods demonstrate that the proposed method performed stably in both simulated and real-world arterial corridors. Hence, the proposed signal coordination method can alleviate traffic congestion more effectively than existing traditional and MARL-based methods.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative vehicle management emerges as a promising solution to improve road traffic safety and efficiency. This paper addresses the speed planning problem for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) at an unsignalized intersection with consideration of turning maneuvers. The problem is approached by a hierarchical centralized coordination scheme that successively optimizes the crossing order and velocity trajectories of a group of vehicles so as to minimize their total energy consumption and travel time required to pass the intersection. For an accurate estimate of the energy consumption of each CAV, the vehicle modeling framework in this paper captures 1) friction losses that affect longitudinal vehicle dynamics, and 2) the powertrain of each CAV in line with a battery-electric architecture. It is shown that the underlying optimization problem subject to safety constraints for powertrain operation, cornering and collision avoidance, after convexification and relaxation in some aspects can be formulated as two second-order cone programs, which ensures a rapid solution search and a unique global optimum. Simulation case studies are provided showing the tightness of the convex relaxation bounds, the overall effectiveness of the proposed approach, and its advantages over a benchmark solution invoking the widely used first-in-first-out policy. The investigation of Pareto optimal solutions for the two objectives (travel time and energy consumption) highlights the importance of optimizing their trade-off, as small compromises in travel time could produce significant energy savings.},

  abstract     = {3D object detection has become an emerging task in autonomous driving scenarios. Most of previous works process 3D point clouds using either projection-based or voxel-based models. However, both approaches contain some drawbacks. The voxel-based methods lack semantic information, while the projection-based methods suffer from numerous spatial information loss when projected to different views. In this paper, we propose the Stereo RGB and Deeper LIDAR (SRDL) framework which can utilize semantic and spatial information simultaneously such that the performance of network for 3D object detection can be improved naturally. Specifically, the network generates candidate boxes from stereo pairs and combines different region-wise features using a deep fusion scheme. The stereo strategy offers more information for prediction compared with prior works. Then, several local and global feature extractors are stacked in the segmentation module to capture richer deep semantic geometric features from point clouds. After aligning the interior points with fused features, the proposed network refines the prediction in a more accurate manner and encodes the whole box in a novel compact method. The decent experimental results on the challenging KITTI detection benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing both stereo images and point clouds for 3D object detection.},

  abstract     = {Lane Keeping Assistance and Adaptive Cruise Control in Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) requires road parameters for better control of the vehicle. Therefore, in this paper we present the Iterative Least Squares with Optimization (ILSO) method based on a monocular front camera which estimates the horizontal, vertical parameters, lateral slope and the camera’s distances to the left/right line as road parameters and longitudinal range. The ILSO algorithm is smartly divided into two steps LS and optimization depending on their estimation capabilities. First of all, the horizontal and vertical parameters, lateral slope, and distances to the left and right lines are estimated by Least Squares (LS). Then, the longitudinal range is estimated by convex optimization. LS and convex optimization are executed in an alternating manner. ILSO is in advance prior to changes on roads and a simple technique due to its analytical solution which does not require complex geometric calculations and does not need a match between left and right lines. In a simulation environment, given the noisy road lines, ILSO outperforms covariance based and multilayer perceptron (MLP) based methods under different noise variances. In addition, ILSO provides plausible numerical results in both virtual and real road images.},

  abstract     = {A connected network of automated vehicles on roads can increase the driving safety of driverless vehicles (i.e., autonomous vehicles). The critical level of dangerous situations on the road while driving can be increased by the speed, orientation, and traffic density of the vehicles involved. Therefore, there is a need for a maneuvering mechanism that handles both the current driving vehicle and the oncoming vehicles headed toward an emergency zone (e.g., road hazard and road accident spot). In this paper, we present a context-aware navigation protocol (CNP) that enhances the safety of vehicles driving in urban roads. Firstly, CNP includes a collision avoidance module that builds on both vehicular networks and on-board sensors to track vehicles’ behaviors, and this module analyzes the driving risks to determine the necessary maneuvers in dangerous situations. Secondly, CNP establishes a collision mitigation strategy that limits the severity of collision damages in hazardous road during non-maneuverable scenarios. We conducted a theoretical analysis as well as extensive simulations to prove and evaluate the effectiveness of CNP. The results show that CNP can reduce communication overhead from a baseline scheme by up to 60% while the risk of road collisions is less than 5%.},

  abstract     = {This work proposes a new modeling framework for jointly optimizing the charging network design and the logistic mobility planning for an electric vehicle fleet. Existing literature commonly assumes the existence of a single entity – the social planner, as a powerful decision maker who manages all resources. However, this is often not the case in practice. Instead of making this assumption, we specifically examine the innate non-cooperative nature of two different entities involved in the planning problem. Namely, they are the charging service provider (CSP) and the fleet operator (FO). To address the strategic interaction between entities, a bi-level mixed integer program is formulated, with the CSP/FO’s problem expressed in the upper/lower levels respectively, in a joint decision making process. These decisions involve the CSP’s infrastructure siting, sizing, substation capacity upgrades, the FO’s fleet composition, vehicle routing, charging, and delivery assignment. To solve the problem, an iterative fashion is adopted to solve and reach optimality. We conduct detailed numerical studies on a synthesized small network and the simulation results reveal the unique aspects of this two-entity framework. This modeling perspective can be generalized to other system design problems with two interacting agents planning and operating resources across networks.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic demand prediction is a key issue in ride-hailing dispatching. Many methods have been developed to improve the demand prediction accuracy of an increase in demand-responsive, ride-hailing transport services. However, the uncertainties in predicting ride-hailing demands due to multiscale spatiotemporal granularity, as well as the resulting statistical errors, are seldom explored. This paper attempts to fill this gap and to examine the spatiotemporal granularity effects on ride-hailing demand prediction accuracy by using empirical data for Chengdu, China. A convolutional, long short-term memory model combined with a hexagonal convolution operation (H-ConvLSTM) is proposed to explore the complex spatial and temporal relations. Experimental analysis results show that the proposed approach outperforms conventional methods in terms of prediction accuracy. A comparison of 36 spatiotemporal granularities with both departure demands and arrival demands shows that the combination of a hexagonal spatial partition with an 800 m side length and a 30 min time interval achieves the best comprehensive prediction accuracy. However, the departure demands and arrival demands reveal different variation trends in the prediction errors for various spatiotemporal granularities.},

In this paper, we propose a factorized Spatial-Temporal Tensor Graph Convolutional Network for traffic speed prediction. Traffic networks are modeled and unified into a graph tensor that integrates spatial and temporal information simultaneously. We extend graph convolution into tensor space and propose a tensor graph convolution network to extract more discriminating features from spatial-temporal graph data. We further introduce Tucker decomposition and derive a factorized tensor convolution to reduce the computational burden, which performs separate filtering in small-scale space, time, and feature modes. Besides, we can benefit from noise suppression of traffic data when discarding those trivial components in the process of tensor decomposition. Extensive experiments on the three real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is more effective than traditional prediction methods, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a new multi-input multi-output optimal bilinear signal control method in which a bilinear dynamic model approximation is used to capture the nonlinear dynamics of the urban traffic networks. With signal green time splits as the control input and traffic delay changes as the output for each intersections in the network, a bilinear system model was developed, which, on the basis of linear system modeling, takes interactions among traffic delays and signal timing splits into consideration. Based on the bilinear system modeling framework, we conducted two steps in each time interval to derive traffic control strategies: (1) we used the normalized least-squared algorithm to estimate system parameters; and (2) we solved an online optimization problem to obtain the updated traffic control inputs for the signal timing that minimizes future traffic delays. We evaluated the proposed method in a microscopic traffic simulation environment (VISSIM) with a 35-intersection network of Bellevue city in Washington. Two different traffic demand patterns: (1) normal traffic demands; and (2) time-varying traffic demands were simulated to compare the performance of different control strategies. Experimental results show that (1) the proposed bilinear system model can better describe traffic system dynamics than linear-model based methods, such as our previously developed linear-quadratic regulator control; and (2) the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art signal control strategies, namely the max-pressure and the self-organizing traffic light control methods. We have also shown that the proposed method is applicable to all other possible network layouts and signal controller phasing structures.},

In this paper, we integrate the human factors that are represented by driving styles to design a new DLC decision-making model. Specifically, our proposed model takes not only the contextual traffic information but also the driving styles of surrounding vehicles into consideration and makes lane-change/keep decisions. Moreover, the model can imitate human drivers’ decision-making maneuvers by learning the driving style of the ego vehicle. Our evaluation results show that the proposed model captures the human decision-making strategies and imitates human drivers’ lane-change maneuvers, which can achieve 98.66% prediction accuracy. Moreover, we also analyze the lane-change impact of our model compared with human drivers in terms of improving the safety and speed of traffic.},

Context-aware machine learning is often adopted in intelligent services by endowing meaning to Internet of Things(IoT)/ubiquitous data. Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are at the forefront of applying context awareness with marked success. In contrast to non-context-aware machine learning models, context-aware machine learning models often perform better in traffic prediction/classification and are capable of supporting complex and more intelligent ITS decision-making. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent studies in context-aware machine learning for intelligent transportation, especially focusing on road transportation systems. State-of-the-art techniques are discussed from several perspectives, including contextual data (e.g., location, time, weather, road condition and events), applications (i.e., traffic prediction and decision making), modes (i.e., specialised and general), learning methods (e.g., supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised and transfer learning). Two main frameworks of context-aware machine learning models are summarised. In addition, open challenges and future research directions of developing context-aware machine learning models for ITS are discussed, and a novel context-aware machine learning layered engine (CAMILLE) architecture is proposed as a potential solution to address identified gaps in the studied body of knowledge.},
