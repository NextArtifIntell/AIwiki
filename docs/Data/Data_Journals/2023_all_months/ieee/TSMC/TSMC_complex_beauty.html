However, existing HCI and SCI fusion are sensitive to some uncertainties, i.e., the hierarchy structure and the fusion order, which make their fusion performances unreliable.

We present integer linear programming models of the order assignment and vehicle routing problems to minimize indirect contact as well as its extension with multiple objectives. We prove that the problem is NP-hard even with a fixed number of drivers, but polynomial under two special cases that are commonly seen in real-life situations. Exact methods with dominance rules and a heuristic algorithm for the dynamic problem are proposed. We conducted an extensive numerical study on real-world meal delivery data. Apart from the computational advancement of our algorithms, the experimental results also show that minimizing indirect contact does not significantly increase the transportation cost and is applicable to the vehicle routing system of service providers.},

  abstract     = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered increased attention in the field of artificial general intelligence (AGI) research due to their low power consumption, high computational efficiency, and low latency induced by their event-driven and sparse communication features. However, efficiently and robustly training an SNN presents a challenge. In this study, we introduce a novel framework for spike-based machine learning called spike-based nonlinear information bottleneck (SNIB). This framework utilizes an information-theoretic learning (ITL) approach and a surrogate gradient learning (SGL) method to achieve robust, accurate, and low-power performance. The proposed SNIB framework includes three variants: 1) squared information bottleneck (SIB); 2) cubic information bottleneck (CIB); and 3) quartic information bottleneck (QIB) strategies, which use a mapping mechanism to compress spiking representations. We systematically evaluate these strategies using different types of input noise and neuromorphic hardware noise. Our experimental results demonstrate that all three strategies effectively enhance the robustness of SGL in SNN architectures. Furthermore, SNIB can significantly reduce the power consumption of SNNs. As a result, SNIB offers a new and significant perspective for hardware-constrained general mobile devices for embedded edge intelligence and represents a progressive step toward realizing AGI.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the noncooperative game of multiple clusters composed by double-integrator agents subject to set constraints. In particular, by decomposing each cluster cost function into multiple individual ones and allocating them to respective agents, the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) associated with the upper cluster layer is sought by the lower agent layer in terms of a hierarchical structure. A particular agent in each cluster is appointed as the messenger that is specialized in interacting with adjacent messengers from other clusters. It is first shown that the concerned seeking objective is achieved provided that the agents from the same cluster reach a consensus on their corresponding component of the GNE. Motivated by this consensus idea, a distributed seeking strategy through the intracluster interaction is first developed, which is applicable to the case where each agent has access to the information of the messengers from other clusters. Based on this result, we next consider a relaxed case where the messenger information is absent for each agent and the inter-cluster information interaction is only allowed via their messengers. Another distributed seeking strategy resorting to a distributed observer is developed via both the inter- and intra-cluster interactions. It is shown that both the developed distributed seeking strategies are capable of seeking out the concerned GNE. As extensions to the double-integrator model, we further consider two evolved models, i.e., Euler–Lagrange model and multi-integrator model. Two modified distributed seeking strategies are developed for achieving the concerned NE seeking objective. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed distributed seeking strategies is validated by an application.},

In real-world AI applications, there is another popular kind of machine learning paradigm—regression. The threats of adversarial attack may also exist in the regression scenario, however, the research on the adversarial vulnerability of the regression model has been basically neglected. This article first systematically explores the adversarial attack on regression problems. Starting from analyzing the difference between the attacking classification models and regression systems, we show the existing attack framework of classification problems is unsuitable for attacking regression systems. Then, we discuss the essence of regression tasks and design an appropriate attack objective for regression problems. After that, we propose two algorithms with different properties based on gradient optimization to achieve the attack objective. The proposed attack methods are evaluated on three real-world regression cases, and the results show that our attacks can successfully make the prediction deviate a lot from its original value by only exerting a tiny perturbation on the inputs. Finally, we conduct further experiments and analyses to discuss the effectiveness and characteristics of the proposed methods from various perspectives.},

Specifically, the proposed method, namely, constrained penalty boundary intersection (CPBI), is an improved aggregation function based on the penalty boundary intersection. In CPBI, the normalized overall constraint violation (CV) is embedded to pursue feasibility. In this way, by the optimization of CPBI, convergence, diversity, and feasibility can be optimized simultaneously. Furthermore, the weight of the normalized overall CV is adjusted adaptively based on the feasible ratio of the current population. To evaluate the performance of CPBI, it is combined with three decomposition-based algorithms. Ten benchmark problems with 50 instances are chosen as the test suite. In addition, the proposed method is compared with nine advanced algorithms. Experimental results have demonstrated the promising performance of CPBI for different problems.},

  abstract     = {Constraint handling is a core part when using surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) to solve expensive constrained optimization problems (ECOPs). However, most existing SAEAs for ECOPs train a surrogate for each constraint. With the number of constraints increasing, the training burden of surrogates becomes heavy and the efficiency of the algorithm is greatly reduced. To solve this issue, this article proposes an efficient two-stage surrogate-assisted differential evolution (eToSA-DE) algorithm to handle expensive inequality constraints. eToSA-DE trains one surrogate for the degree of constraint violation and the type of the surrogate varies during the evolution process. In the first stage when there are only a few feasible individuals, a Gaussian process regression model is trained to fit the degree of constraint violation. In the second stage when more feasible individuals are accumulated, a support vector machine classification model is trained to classify whether candidates are feasible. Both types of surrogates are constructed by individuals which are chosen by the boundary training data selection strategy. These selected individuals are located around the feasible boundaries and helpful for the surrogate to approximate the feasibility structure. Besides, a feasible exploration strategy is devised to search for promising areas. To alleviate the error caused by the regression model, a nearest neighbor rectification is adopted to modify the prediction results.

  abstract     = {The issue of event-based asymptotic tracking control for constrained multi-input–multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems by designing a single-parameter adaptation method is addressed in this work. Different from some works that rely on prior knowledge of the gain function, this work allows for unknown gain functions. This harsh condition is handled by introducing a new affine variable. Meanwhile, to eliminate the step of turning state constraints into new bounds for tracking errors, a new barrier function is provided instead of continuing to use the Log- or Tan-type barrier Lyapunov function (BLF). This imposes constraints on the system states instead of tracking errors, removing the strict feasibility conditions for virtual controllers. To reduce the computational burden, only one adaptive parameter is designed in this work. Then, an event-triggered strategy is integrated into the control scheme to reduce the waste of communication resources. The systems output can asymptotically track the desired trajectory even if the state of the closed-loop system meets the constraints. Simulation results confirm the validity of this scheme.},

To address optimal tracking, a novel augmented system consisting of tracking error and its integral value, along with an uncertain desired trajectory, is constructed. A barrier function (BF) with a tradeoff factor is incorporated into the cost function to keep the state trajectories to remain within a compact set and to balance safety with optimality. Next, by using the modified value functional, the ZSG formulation is introduced wherein an actor-critic neural network (NN) framework is employed to approximate the value functional, optimal control input, and worst disturbance. The critic NN weights are tuned once at the sample instants and then iteratively within sampling instants. Using control input errors, the actor NN weights are adjusted once a sampling instant. The concurrent learning term in the critic weight tuning law overcomes the need for the persistency excitation (PE) condition. Further, a weight consolidation scheme is incorporated into the critic update law to attain lifelong learning by overcoming catastrophic forgetting. Finally, a numerical example supports the analytical claims.},

To address this problem, offline RL considers learning policies from fixed datasets, which is promising in utilizing large-scale datasets, but still suffers from the unstable estimation for out-of-distribution data. Recent developments in RL via supervised learning methods offer an alternative to learning effective policies from suboptimal datasets while relying on oracle information from the environment. In this article, we present an offline RL algorithm that combines hindsight relabeling and supervised regression to predict actions without oracle information. We use hindsight relabeling on the original dataset and learn a command generator and command-conditional policies in a supervised manner, where the command represents the desired return or goal location according to the corresponding task. Theoretically, we illustrate that our method optimizes the lower bound of the goal-conditional RL objective. Empirically, our method achieves competitive performance in comparison with existing approaches in the sparse reward setting and favorable performance in continuous control tasks.},

E-commerce business processes rely on the distributed and concurrent interaction process among Web applications of participants, such as clients, merchants, third-party payment platforms (TPPs), and bank systems. Such complex business interactions bridge the gap of trustiness among participants and introduce new security challenges in the form of logical vulnerabilities, which are prevalent in the business process at the application level. The most pressing challenge is to guarantee security throughout the checkout process at the conceptual design phase such that the logic errors can be detected before the actual implementation. Maintenance and repair of implemented e-commerce systems can be extremely costly. To this end, this article proposes a novel modeling and analyzing methodology for multiparticipants and multisessions e-commerce interaction processes based on colored Petri nets (CPNs). First, we define a novel model that can efficiently depict the key properties of e-commerce business interaction processes. Second, several modeling principles are formulated based on the design specification of e-commerce systems. Finally, the concept of Transaction-Logical Consistency is defined to analyze and verify the logical vulnerabilities of e-commerce systems. Through a discussed case study, we demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed methodology and its efficiency in detecting problems those can potentially lead to logical vulnerabilities.},

  abstract     = {The main aim of this article is to provide a systematic move blocking (MB)-based robust model predictive control (MPC) for nonlinear systems due to the model uncertainties and disturbances based on Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy models. The suggested robust MPC (RMPC) consists of an offline H∞ fuzzy controller (OHFC) and an online MB-based MPC. In the first step, by considering a nonquadratic Lyapunov function (NQLF), a new one-step linear matrix inequality (OSLMI) problem is proposed to guarantee robust tracking performance. Then, the provided OHFC is considered in the design procedure of the online MB-based MPC to calculate the overall control signal. So, the MB-based MPC is developed based on a prerobustly stabilized system. This means that the online part focuses on the optimality of the overall control law in a constrained scheme. The proposed Lyapunov function of the OHFC and an ellipsoidal terminal constraint (ETC) are utilized as the terminal cost and terminal set in the design process of the MB-based MPC to improve the feasibility of the online optimization problem (OP). Since the online OP is solved due to the prerobustly stabilized system and the MB scheme, so, the online computational burden is significantly reduced. In summary, the main objective of this article is to propose an RMPC synthetized with an offline $H_{\infty }$ controller to satisfy the system constraints and guaranteeing the robust and optimal performance with a low computational complexity. A numerical example and a truck–trailer system (TTS) are simulated to illustrate the superiority and conservatism reduction of the proposed MB-based RMPC.},

For the SMPC problem, the greatest difficulty lies in how to solve a finite time domain optimal control problem in the corresponding sampling step while ensuring that the probabilistic path constraints are rigorously satisfied. Aiming at the above problem, this article presents a new method for SMPC with guaranteed rigorous satisfaction of probabilistic path constraints. Specifically, first, to convert thorny probabilistic path constraints into computationally solvable and equivalent deterministic constraints, a transformation technique is proposed by utilizing a designed ancillary feedback controller and the information on the probabilistic distribution of disturbances. Then, a probabilistic path-constrained dynamic event-triggered SMPC (DETSMPC) algorithm is further designed where not only control input can be obtained but also the probabilistic path constraints can be rigorously satisfied over the entire time domain. In addition, to mitigate redundant computation consumption, a novel event-triggering sampling scheme with two dynamic thresholds is proposed by the virtue of prediction horizon, real-time sampled data, and previous predicted and triggered states. Furthermore, it is proved that the proposed algorithm is feasible for the overall probabilistic path-constrained closed-loop DETSMPC system. Moreover, the convergence in probability of the closed-loop system is presented. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

To overcome these issues, we design a novel domain correction latent subspace learning (DCLSL) algorithm for gas sensor drift compensation by integrating subspace learning and domain adaptation into a unified framework in this study. First, domain correction is applied to alleviate the distribution difference before and after sensor drift by exploiting the mean distribution discrepancy criterion. Second, for better-local representation and classification results, we consider both discriminative information of the source data and structural information of the target data, revealing the intrinsic geometric structure in the latent subspace and forming a compact intraclass and interclass separated discriminative data layout. In addition, to improve the consistency of features and labels, we use a projection term, a reconstruction term, and a regularization term to simultaneously implement joint learning of the label space and the latent subspace and impose a row-sparsity constraint to enhance the model robustness to noise. Inspired by non-negative matrix factorization, we skillfully adopt multiplication update rules and thus solve the proposed optimization problem. Finally, we conduct experiments for different drift compensation tasks on two common gas sensor datasets, and the results are encouraging.},

Unlike the prevailing gradient estimation approach of the fast ES which uses a Luenberger observer without an explicit way to obtain the observer gains, a systemic complete PPIO is established based on a complete parametric solution to a type of generalized Sylvester matrix equations. The proposed PPIO presents complete parameterization of all the gain matrices as well as the left eigenvectors in terms of some sets of design parameters that represent the degrees of design freedom. Then, the gradient estimator is constructed by multiplying the states of PPIO and the demodulation signal. Moreover, a synthetic objective function, which includes weighted performance indices of the transient error and the steady-state accuracy, is formulated. The performance of the gradient estimator is improved by minimizing the synthetic objective function through adjusting the degrees of freedom of the PPIO, and all explicit values of the parametric gain matrices are derived with the adjusted degrees of freedom. In turn, a faster and more accurate gradient estimation scheme can be obtained and significantly improve the convergence of the closed-loop system. Besides, the proposed PPIO-based estimator has excellent performance under the noise condition. Simulation examples and an application to the lean-burn combustion system are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed gradient estimation scheme.},

First, RGB-T features extracted by a given backbone are regrouped as high- or low-level features. Second, multimodal high-level features are sent to a dynamic bilateral cross-fusion module for further refinement. Third, a bounded high-level semantic-feature integration module is added to provide feature guidance, and a multitask supervision mechanism is used for fine-tuning.

  abstract     = {Differential evolution (DE) has emerged as an effective technique for single-objective optimization problems (SOPs). Due to its efficient and straightforward framework, it has been extended further to address multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). However, the existing multiobjective DE (MODE) algorithms focus on developing control strategies of mutation operators and parameters for a given population at every iteration, regardless of whether the population has insufficient distributions in objective space. Furthermore, several technical challenges exist when extending MODE approaches to deal with many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs). To break through such limitations, in this article, we propose a preference-inspired DE for multi and many-objective optimization (Pre-DEMO), which effectively and efficiently deals with a wide range of MOPs and MaOPs. First, a preference-inspired mutation operator is developed to generate individuals with good convergence and distribution properties. The local knee points are obtained among the nondominated individuals to articulate preferences in the mutation operator. Also, an adaptive strategy based on a clustering method is proposed to determine the local knee points. Second, a two-stage environmental selection is suggested in Pre-DEMO to preserve promising individuals for the next generations. Experimental results demonstrate that the Pre-DEMO approach outperforms the eight state-of-the-art algorithms on 35 benchmark problems.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the distributed consensus tracking problem for high-order nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) with nonidentical output constraints under directed switching graphs. Such a practical and important issue has only been taken into limited consideration by the existing literature. In this article, the heterogeneous followers are considered to suffer from nonidentical output constraints, which take precedence over consensus tracking. To this end, a series of intermediate dynamic variables are introduced for each agent to isolate the effect of topologies switching and estimate the output of the leader. Then, distributed adaptive protocols are designed based on a novel constraint transformation. By using an improved mode-dependent average dwell-time lemma, sufficient conditions on switching graphs are given to achieve consensus tracking. Compared with existing results, the proposed scheme can not only guarantee output constraints but also significantly reduce the communication burden and tolerate a certain degree of graph switching. Finally, the proposed method is verified by the inverted pendulum simulation example.},

This article proposes a physics informed trajectory inference of a class of nonlinear systems. The approach combines the advantages of state and parameter estimation algorithms to infer the trajectory that follows the nonlinear system using online noisy state measurements. The algorithm is composed of a parallel estimated model constructed in terms of a low-pass filter parameterization. The estimated model defines a physics informed model that infers the trajectory of the real nonlinear system with noise attenuation capabilities. The parameters of the estimated model are updated by a closed-loop output error identification algorithm which uses the estimated states instead of the noisy measurements to avoid biased estimation. Stability and convergence of the proposed technique is assessed using Lyapunov stability theory. Simulations studies are carried out under different scenarios to verify the effectiveness of the proposed inference algorithm.},

By the designed state observer and introduced first-order filter technique, a new event-triggered mechanism consisting of both the sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator channels is constructed. To avoid the virtual controller nondifferentiability problem by using backstepping control theory directly, this article redesign the virtual controller and controller obtained by the backstepping control technique without considering the event-triggered signals.

Most feature extraction-based methods for tackling multioutput problems neglect the local correlation between different outputs, while most sample extraction-based methods overlook the gap between inputs and outputs. To overcome these two major limitations, in this article, we propose a topic-aware method where we assume inputs and outputs can be jointly embedded in a topic space. Both feature and sample extraction are performed in a latent topic space that encodes output correlation at a topic level and aligns inputs and outputs in an explainable manner. Different from current topic models, we extract independent and interdependent topics based on informative topics. These two components are verified as useful in performance improvement in an ablation study. The proposed method can also be easily extended and applied in multiview learning. The experimental results of the proposed topic-aware model on multiple benchmarks for different multioutput tasks in single-/multi-views with $p$ -values less than 0.05 indicate that the improvement achieved by the proposed method over compared baselines is statistically significant.},

  abstract     = {This study aims to address a novel production and intralogistics synchronization (PiLSync) problem in multiresource-constrained assembly systems (MRCASs). PiLSync is highly complex due to the presence of multiple resources (operators, workstations, and materials) and the dynamic interactions between the resources and decisions. Moreover, various uncertainties, such as new/urgent job arrivals, uncertain operating times, equipment failures, and operator absences, further complicate this problem. Emerging Industry 4.0 technologies help capture and monitor the real-time PiL workflow, while existing methods are typically formulated to handle static or periodically updated inputs. Thus, it is difficult to explicitly incorporate real-time data into models, leading to a gap between production and intralogistic (PiL) decisions and actual executions under various uncertainties. In this article, out-of-order synchronization (OoOSync) is developed to facilitate flexible, resilient, and coordinated PiL operations in MRCASs. A sliding synchronization window is proposed as an effective decomposition tool to limit system complexity and localize demand uncertainty. Ticket validation governs interactions between resources and constraints under uncertainty. Finally, real-time data-driven synchronization mechanisms are developed for PiL decision/adjustment. The superiority of OoOSync is confirmed in computational experiments. This article is a pioneering study considering multiresource-constrained PiL operations under uncertainty. Additionally, this article offers a new perspective on using real-time data for decisions and operations subject to the dynamic interactions of resources.},

  abstract     = {Accurate transmission performance prediction of the balise system is important for reliable ground–train communication in high-speed rails. However, the combined effects of ground–train coupling and on-board demodulation make it difficult to predict long-term and volatile holistic transmission performance under multisource disturbances. To address these issues, this article proposes a gate-steered residual interweave architecture. A new gated double-dilated temporal convolutional network (GDTCN) is introduced by combining large and small receptive fields with gating units to extract multiscale features and filter out useless information. It can learn multisource parameter disturbances induced by transient coupling and intermittent demodulation to reduce the prediction errors of occasional volatilities in holistic transmission performance. A new residual interweave GDTCN structure with linear gated cross connections is built to remit the differences between signal and telegram parameter features in view of the inconsistent data transfer modes during coupling and demodulation. This structure can facilitate multipath feature interaction and fusion to enrich discriminative correlation information, thereby improving the prediction accuracy of holistic transmission performance. An adaptive gated attention mechanism is designed to exploit correlation and dependent information between coupling and demodulation in a weighted fusion manner. It can minimize prediction error accumulation to enhance long-term holistic transmission performance forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture can perform predictions with high accuracy and efficiency under different rail conditions. The proposed method can provide early warning before ground balise or on-board module failures to improve the reliability and availability of ground–train communication.},

For stabilizing impulses with time delays, the design of impulse time sequence is proposed, under which the estimation of settling time relying on the impulse jump, the time delays, and the initial condition is obtained. For destabilizing impulses with time delays, some constraints of the impulse time sequence affected by two different size scopes of time delays are put forward. Our results show that delayed impulses may contribute to or destroy the FTS and lead to different estimations of the settling time. The analysis is illustrated by two numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {In dynamic multiobjective optimization, the Pareto front (PF) or Pareto set varies over time as the problem environment changes. In such scenarios, optimization algorithms are required to efficiently find and continuously track a set of Pareto-optimal and diverse solutions. However, existing algorithms often result in the imbalanced approximation of PFs since some objectives are usually harder to optimize than others. In addition, the prediction strategies of the existing algorithms usually entail additional parameters (e.g., reference points, weights, and clustering parameters) to match available Pareto-optimal solutions for prediction in dynamically changing environments. This article presents a cooperative differential evolution algorithm with an attention-based prediction strategy. Multiple populations are adopted to optimize multiple objectives in search of subparts of PFs. Every population adopts a new fusion-based mutation strategy for coevolution. In addition, an expanding procedure is proposed on archived solutions to further expand the objective space covered by the populations to the entire PF. Specifically, once an environment change is detected, the populations are updated by using a new attention-based prediction strategy according to the historical variation of the objective functions. In this way, every population is adapted to the change of its attentive objective in the dynamic environment. Experimental results on a recent test suite of scalable dynamic multiobjective optimization problems are elaborated to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Besides, the convergence accuracy of these methods is only bounded but unknown and uncertain. This study proposes a neural adaptive prescribed-time control method to solve such a problem. Specifically, a critical design step is that the practical prescribed-time control problem is converted into a practical stabilization problem by developing a new singularity-avoidance error-dependent scalar transformation. Guided by this idea, an adaptive neural prescribed-time controller is constructed, ensuring prescribed transient behavior and all tracking errors to achieve preset accuracy within the prescribed time simultaneously. Furthermore, by utilizing extended multiple Lyapunov functions, a new mode-dependent average dwell time condition is derived to ensure that all signals in the controlled system remain bounded. Finally, simulations demonstrate the feasibility of the developed scheme.},

However, higher-order networks are becoming a more effective means for modeling epidemic spread and characterizing the topology of group interactions. In this article, we propose a composite effective degree Markov chain approach (CEDMA) to describe the discrete-time epidemic dynamics on higher-order networks. In this approach, nodes are classified according to the number of neighbors and hyperedges in different states to characterize the topology of higher-order networks. By comparing with the microscopic Markov chain approach, CEDMA can better match the numerical simulations based on Monte Carlo and accurately capture discontinuous phase transitions and bistability phenomena caused by higher-order interactions. In particular, the theoretical solution to CEDMA can well predict the critical point at continuous phase transition and corroborate the existence of the discontinuous phase transition in the susceptible–infectious–susceptible (SIS) process. Moreover, CEDMA can be further extended to depict the susceptible–infectious–recovered (SIR) process on higher-order networks.},

In this article, we introduce a novel initiative advisor-in-the-loop actor–critic (AC) framework, termed as Ask-AC, that replaces the unilateral advisor-guidance mechanism with a bidirectional learner-initiative one, and thereby enables a customized and efficacious message exchange between learner and advisor. At the heart of Ask-AC are two complementary components, namely, action requester and adaptive state selector, that can be readily incorporated into various discrete AC architectures. The former component allows the agent to initiatively seek advisor intervention in the presence of uncertain states, while the latter identifies the unstable states potentially missed by the former especially when environment changes, and then learns to promote the ask action on such states. Experimental results on both stationary and nonstationary environments and across different AC backbones demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the learning efficiency of the agent, and achieves the performances on par with those obtained by continuous advisor monitoring.},

And the prescribed constant upper bound for the trigger interval can prevent the system performance from deteriorating. Under the framework of the DDET scheme, the situation of no system switching or multiple system switching over a trigger interval is considered, and a unified closed-looped system (CLS) which incorporates the above two situations is established. Then, by constructing a series of multiple Lyapunov functionals, the exponential stability of the unified CLS is studied based on the average dwell-time (ADT) method. Moreover, a design procedure for the feedback gain is provided.

First of all, infinite-dimensional backstepping transformation is adopted. The original PDE-ODE cascade system is changed to a new system that is easier to design. On this basis, finite-dimensional backstepping transformation and adaptive compensation technology are combined to develop a state-feedback controller. Then, the boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop system is proved by the Lyapunov functional analysis.

However, ensuring the reliability of service relays necessitates the evaluation of vehicle trustworthiness, particularly considering the potential presence of malicious behaviors. To address this problem, a trusted service prerequest (TSPR) system is proposed. First, we design a trust evaluation mechanism based on backtracking to incentivize vehicles to participate in the relay process and ensure reliable delivery of service requests. Additionally, we consider the dynamic traffic condition and present a trust-aware relay vehicle selection mechanism that guarantees the effectiveness of service relays. Specifically, the selection process is optimized by jointly considering cost and trust. Furthermore, we establish an evolutionary game model involving the system supervision center and vehicles, analyzing the factors that influence strategy selection.

  abstract     = {The information of the shaft torque and the resistance torque is crucial to develop advanced control and fault diagnosis/detection schemes for electrified powertrain systems. However, reliable physical sensors for torque measurement are not affordable for commercial vehicle applications. This article investigates the simultaneous estimation problem of the state dynamics and the resistance torque for integrated motor-transmission (IMT) systems of electric vehicles. To this end, the IMT system is first reformulated as a nonlinear switched model, where the resistance torque is considered as an unknown input (UI). This modeling reformulation allows taking into account not only the nonlinear nature of IMT dynamics but especially also the intrinsic discontinuity of the gear-shifting process. Then, we propose a nonlinear switched observer (NSO) structure to simultaneously estimate the nonlinear IMT dynamics, thus the shaft torque, and the unknown resistance torque. The observer design does not require any a priori information on the unknown resistance torque as for the classical proportional-integral observer design, nor the well-known matching condition for UI decoupling techniques. Using the Lyapunov stability theory, we derive sufficient conditions, expressed in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints, to design an NSO with a guaranteed $\ell _{\infty }$ performance to mitigate the negative effect of sensor noises and disturbances. In particular, we propose to incorporate LMI-based bumps limitation conditions in the optimization-based observer design to reduce the impacts of expressive discontinuities at switching instants. Comparative studies are performed between the related estimation methods to show the practical effectiveness of the proposed solution.},

In this article, we interpret block mining in a permissionless sharded-Blockchain as a repeated $M$ -player noncooperative game with finite actions, and propose a new multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework to allow the miners to maximize their profits in a decentralized fashion by scheduling their resources across the shards without centralized coordination. We formulate the rewards, and design a two-scale action space for each miner to reduce the action space and expedite convergence. We also propose a new MADRL model, named Rainbow-WoLF-PHC, which allows each miner to learn its resource allocation online and converge fast to a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Extensive experiments show the superiority of the Rainbow-WoLF-PHC to its alternatives in terms of convergence, stability, and profitable actions.

The addressed systems are considered to suffer from the unknown nonrandom perturbations with bounded peak, and thus the existing filtering or estimation approaches for switched SNs become inapplicable. To tackle this situation, a novel reachable-set-based distributed filtering strategy is established. With the proposed piecewise Lyapunov function approach and the minimum dwell time switching mechanism, sufficient conditions are then formulated for the existence of admissible filters in both the secure and nonsecure communication channels. We prove that the resultant filtering error is ultimately confined to a bounded closed set, which can also be minimized to achieve an optimal perturbation attenuation level in the sense of reachable set. Finally, the practicability and effectiveness of the developed design technique are demonstrated via the distributed event-driven filtering of a two-spring-mass mechanical system monitored by the SN.},

By equipping the MAS with estimation capabilities so as to estimate the lost measurements caused by DoS attacks, we present a hybrid dynamic event-triggered strategy (HDETS) for the consensus of MAS subject to unreliable networks. Based on the proposed HDETS, we can preserve the consensus of MASs provided that the DoS attacks satisfy a condition on its frequency and duration. In addition, it can guarantee the Zeno-freeness with a designed strictly positive minimum event-triggered interval as well.

Although several studies have discussed conflict modeling and resolution in technology transfer disputes, scant research attempted to model third-party (or mediator) mediation, let alone develop effective approaches to minimize cost in the conflict resolution process. This study uses a graph model and minimum cost to investigate the conflict resolution and mediation in the technology transfer dispute of new product collaborative development. On the one hand, the conflict in technology transfer of new product collaborative development is modeled using the graph model theory, in which the stakeholders (or decision makers), their options, the feasible states, and the preferences of decision makers are analyzed. On the other hand, an inverse graph model with minimum cost is designed to tackle the problem of specifying which decision-makers’ preferences lead to a desired solution, thereby making it easier for a mediator or other third party to influence the course of the conflict. In the inverse graph model with minimum cost, two 0–1 mixed linear approaches are constructed to judge the Nash and general merataionality stabilities within the graph model, and several optimization-based models that minimize mediation cost are designed for the mediator to guide the technology transfer conflict resolution process to achieve the desired solution.

  abstract     = {Road surface condition monitoring and bike riding event detection are crucial in densely populated cities for travel efficiency and rider safety. However, most current approaches are either costly, unreliable in different scenarios, or not adaptable in new environments. This article proposes a novel automated approach leveraging widely used shared bikes to intelligently detect road surface conditions and riding events suitable for interactive Internet of Things (IoT) cities. We propose a novel dual stream meta learning approach to solve the reliability problem when bike types for the training and testing are different with a limited set of new samples and the self-adaptive problem when classifying new classes without retraining the model, both via dual stream meta learning. Results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed IoT-based solution with 98.9\% accuracy for road surface conditions and 99.6\% accuracy for riding events via the proposed dual stream deep learning method in the conventional scenario. With few samples per class, the proposed method is more reliable than other commonly used approaches in the different-bike scenario (e.g., proposed 92.4\% versus random forest 74.6\%). In cases of predicting new classes, the algorithm is 95.6\% accurate using only one sample per class without explicit training (compared to 78.0\% for $K $ -nearest neighbor). This article proposes a robust IoT framework for smart cities involving road surface conditions and rider events which could be critical for many applications, including city mapping, shared bike rental maintenance and rider performance, and city maintenance services.},

The social planner is faced with efficiency losses where a Nash equilibrium of the lottery game may not coincide with the social optimum. We propose an optimal bilevel lottery design problem as finding the least reward and perturbations such that the induced Nash equilibrium produces the socially optimal payoff. We formally characterize the price of anarchy and the behavior of public goods and Nash equilibrium with respect to the reward and perturbations. We relax the optimal bilevel lottery design problem via a convex approximation and identify mild sufficient conditions under which the approximation is exact.},

Taking advantage of the error-tracking approach, a novel integral Lyapunov function, developed specifically for tackling state-dependent control gains, is incorporated into the approximation-based backstepping design. In addition, the technical challenges associated with nonstrict-feedback structures are successfully overcome, by employing the key property of neural networks in the ALC design. It is shown that with the aid of the technique lemma for robustness analysis, the proposed ALC control strategy guarantees robust convergence of the tracking error, despite the complex uncertainties involved. The design method guarantees the tracking performance and facilitates the implementation of the suggested algorithm.

Unfortunately, little research has been reported to solve them. To fill the gap, we propose a tailored enhanced decomposition-based algorithm to handle the VMMOPs. Specifically, a variable-length coding structure is designed to flexibly represent the solutions of VMMOPs. In order to facilitate the solution generation, a simple dimensionality incremental learning strategy is developed to choose representative solutions for the training of two learning models. The one is the fast-clustering-based histogram model, which is built for the sampling of solutions in the continuous decision space, while the other one is the incremental learning-based histogram model, designed to sample solutions in discrete decision space. Following the traditional constructor of the DTLZ test suite and the features of CSAOPs, we present a test suite of VMMOPs for the verification of the performance of the methods in handling VMMOPs. Experimental results on a number of benchmark problems and two real CSAOPs have shown the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed method in handling VMMOPs.},

Existing studies mainly focus on learning evolving concepts on distributed data streams, while the privacy issue is little investigated. In this article, for the first time, we develop a federated learning framework for distributed concept-drifting data streams, called FedStream. The proposed method allows capturing the evolving concepts by dynamically maintaining a set of prototypes with error-driven representative learning. Meanwhile, a new metric-learning-based prototype transformation technique is introduced to preserve privacy among participating clients in the distributed data streams setting. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets have demonstrated the superiority of FedStream, and it even achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art distributed learning methods.},

  abstract     = {Computer-aided assessment using whole slide images (WSIs) is one of the critical steps in clinical procedures. How do doctors recognize cancer in a WSI? A quick answer is that they consider the spatial structure of a WSI rather than only considering single patches. We argue that two clues are essential for computer-aided deep learning: 1) global spatial context and 2) local semantic information. This is because local, semi-local, and global tissue observing are the principal assessment means of pathologists, perfectly corresponding with both clues. However, most existing methods only consider local spatial information learning within each patch rather than developing an effective local-to-global reaction, leading to an incapable of capturing robust and enriched representation. Toward a new area for computer-aided assessment, we propose novel neural networks to learn the global–local spatial context in WSIs, called GLSCL. The GLSCL is among the first trials that understand both clues for WSI understanding. Furthermore, the proposed novel operators enable the GLSCL to learn spatial semantic representation sufficiently. We evaluate the GLSCL using renal cell carcinoma (RCC) samples with synthetic ambiguity collected from the public benchmark and clinical procedures. Enhanced by global and local spatial information, the GLSCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, including classification accuracy, survival prediction index, and cancer tissue attention rate.},

We show, both analytically and numerically, that for weak interlayer coupling, increasing layer similarity can first promote synchronization and then hinder synchronization, while for strong interlayer coupling, synchronization can be suppressed. However, increasing the number of layers can always facilitate synchronization only if the interlayer coupling is strong. Finally, the theoretical results are verified by numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Image denoising aims to remove the noise from noisy images. With the increasing complexity of the noise within the noisy images, current denoising methods cannot satisfactorily address this issue. This article proposes a graph attention in attention network (GAiA-Net) for image denoising. First, we introduce a novel approach to graph construction for the GAiA-Net. In the process of such graph construction, the noisy images are divided into patches to formulate the nodes in a graph. The edges are initialized using $k $ -nearest neighbors. Hence, through iterative transformation and learning, both the pixel-level and structure-level features can be captured by different information exchanges and aggregation within (pixel-level) and outside (structure-level) of the nodes, respectively. Second, we propose the graph attention in attention (GAiA) in the GAiA-Net. The proposed GAiA produces the pixel-level attention within nodes to be further induced to the nodes with various distances to generate the final attention. Therefore, our GAiA-Net can capture the long dependencies on both the pixel-level and structure-level features, which can effectively reduce the complex noise in the denoising process. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GAiA-Net produces state-of-the-art performances on both synthetic noise image and real noise image datasets. Especially, when experimenting on complex noisy Nam datasets, our GAiA-Net achieves a PSNR of 40.40 dB and SSIM of 0.989. These results prove the satisfactory potential and effectiveness of our GAiA-Net.},

  abstract     = {The power system measurement data has high-dimensional features and strong noise, which is difficult to be directly used for intrusion detection. Traditional machine learning methods used in the power system intrusion detection take the feature processing as a preprocessing step and perform separately from the training, which makes the features not well adapted to the training. Therefore, this article proposes a novel binary particle swarm-wrapped feature selection optimization framework (BPSWO), which can improve the intrusion detection accuracy of machine learning methods by strengthening the coupling between the feature selection and the training. First, the improved transfer function is used to make the method converge to the global optimal particle. Second, the chaotic transformation and the Hamming distance are used to solve the premature problem of the traditional particle swarm optimization. Then, the different classifiers can be embedded in the particle swarm for training. The BPSWO trains the classifier while selecting features and the final training classifier is used for intrusion detection. The proposed method is examined on the public power system from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA and the IEEE 57-bus system. Compared with the existing power system intrusion detection methods based on machine learning, the experimental results show that the BPSWO can achieve the state-of-the-art in the detection accuracy, which proves the effectiveness and stability of the proposed method.},

To ensure formation safety, a collision avoidance term is introduced into the DLMPC framework. To guarantee the feasibility and stability of the DLMPC, we first construct the Lyapunov-based adaptive auxiliary controller and then use its stability to construct the stability constraint. The DLMPC inherits the characteristic of the Lyapunov-based adaptive auxiliary controller and employs online optimization to guarantee better formation tracking performance. As a novel framework for spacecraft formation control, the proposed DLMPC has the advantage of improving the formation tracking performance through persistently online optimization, especially, in adversarial dynamic environments.

  abstract     = {Human activity recognition (HAR) for boxing training typically requires specialized hardware or large labeled datasets to identify different types of punches and analyze their basic properties. However, measuring the unpredictability of boxers, a key characteristic to deceive opponents during combats, has remained an unexplored challenge. We tackled this challenge by combining a series of novel techniques and ideas. Unpredictability was computed as the entropy of the trajectories of the Markov chain characterizing the training session, estimated from the combinations (sequences of punches) thrown by the boxer to the training bag. Punch combinations were obtained by detecting punches as outliers in the raw acceleration sensor datastream coming from the bag, and separating them by type with an ensemble of PCA+GMM clusters. Punches were then divided into combinations using statistical analysis of separation intervals. The detection procedure works even with noisy data, in contrast to force-threshold methods commonly reported in the literature. As distinctive features of our system, it uses only unlabeled data from the current training session, and sensor positions and orientations inside the bag are unconstrained. However, punch clustering achieves up to 94\% accuracy, comparable to state-of-the-art supervised approaches. These features are currently unseen in the literature and demonstrate the capacity for unsupervised learning techniques to address challenging problems in sports. Multiple validation experiments were consistent with boxers’ level and session performance. Overall, our approach provides significant contributions to the field of HAR and has the potential to improve the way boxing and other sports are trained and evaluated.},

In order to improve the reliability of data transmission, an MDEM is put forward, with which the data is encoded into two descriptions of identical importance before being transmitted to the decoders through two individual communication channels. The aim of this article is to develop a PID tracking controller for guaranteeing the ultimate boundedness of the resulting tracking error, and the corresponding controller gains are obtained by solving an optimization problem. Moreover, the effect of the packet dropouts on the decoding accuracy is explicated via assessing the boundedness in respect to the decoding error.

To this end, the application of a data-driven control method for vehicle stability control represents a novel, feasible opportunity. This article introduces Givens rotation and forgetting factors to efficiently update the subspace prediction equation with online data. An online data-driven predictive control (ODPC) method is proposed on this basis. To address the problem that persistently excited (PE) condition will cause fluctuations in the steady-state response of ODPC, a data-driven switched predictive control strategy (DSPCS) employing attenuated excitation (AE) signals and hysteresis comparisons based on posterior prediction errors is proposed. In addition, an implementation method involving the Laguerre function (LF) parameterization of the control input is proposed to improve the computational efficiency further. Numerical simulation results show that both the ODPC method and the DSPCS can effectively track given yaw rate and sideslip angle reference under the influence of ruts. Furthermore, the DSPCS can effectively reduce steady-state response fluctuations. In addition, the LF parameterization is superior regarding computational time.},

To rapidly deal with these two problems, a fixed-time fuzzy adaptive fault-tolerant control (FTC) algorithm is proposed. Specifically, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) and Pade approximation method are applied to address the unknown nonlinearity and the input delay issues, respectively. Besides, command filter technique is applied to replace the traditional backstepping method to eliminate “complexity explosion” issue in calculation process. Under the role of fixed-time controller, the effects of input delay and actuator fault are rapidly suppressed, and the controlled system can obtain the better control performance on convergence speed and steady-state error. The comparative simulation examples demonstrate that the controller utilizing fixed-time stability has better control and fault tolerance performance, thus verifying the superiority of the proposed method.},

This outcome requires assurance that a system composed of a set of processes with shared and dedicated resources will operate smoothly. Shared resources can introduce deadlock problems through circular waits. In most methods to investigate the deadlock issues, shared and dedicated resources are assumed to never fail. However, the failure of one resource may cause the real crash of an entire system such that no finished products can output. Systems with unreliable resources are classified in this article into three types: 1) nonrobust systems; 2) weakly robust systems; and 3) strongly robust systems. A robust control method based on this classification is necessary for a system. Two approaches to robust control are developed. First, systems of sequential systems with shared and copied resources $(S^{4} C R\text{s}$ ), which is a new type of petri nets, is designed to strengthen the robustness of systems. It ensures that processes with unreliable resources complete their products. In addition, based on a deadlock-avoidance algorithm, a robustness algorithm is proposed.

  abstract     = {This article investigates fault detection (FD) for discrete-time T–S fuzzy systems via an iterative interval estimation method. By means of system output and the iterative estimation of unknown disturbances, two iterative subsystems are employed to establish iterative state reconstruction free of faults. Resorting to a structure separation technique and the $H_{\infty }$ requirement imposed on estimated errors, a sufficient condition is formulated in terms of linear matrix inequality to guarantee the asymptotically stability of the error systems. With the help of the zonotope reachability technique, the state interval without faults consideration is rebuilt in terms of the error boundary. Subsequently, an FD scheme is proposed by checking residual signals whether exceed the residual interval generated from the established error interval. Simulation comparison is provided to verify the validity of the proposed iterative FD scheme.},

  abstract     = {For the consensus tracking of multiagent systems (MASs), most of existing distributed control methods need to design the controller structure with availability of physical model or structural information of each agent, which is sometimes impractical due to the difficulty of modeling each agent or obtaining its structural information if the physical model of each agent is complicated and the underlined MAS is heterogeneous. To handle this issue, in this article we first integrate the controller-based dynamic linearization method into distributed control using only the local measurement information exchanging among neighbors in a directional graph and the input of each agent. Then we propose a data-driven distributed adaptive control (DAC) method for nonlinear nonaffine heterogeneous discrete-time leader–follower MASs. We show that the proposed method has ultimately bounded tracking error in both of the cases with fixed and switching communication topologies. The numerical simulation results show that in contrast with two DAC methods, the proposed one can give smaller tracking errors.},

To solve the problem of adaptive control, on subsystems of switched systems, some mild assumptions, such as ZDs with input-to-state stability (ISS), nonlinear terms with a growth condition and some well-known small signal conditions, have been imposed. State-feedback control laws are designed and an adaptive law is constructed in a systematic way by revamping the so-called adding a power integrator (AAPI) technique, a special back-stepping-like method. In order to cope with output constraints (OCs), a common Lyapunov function, including a tangent-type barrier Lyapunov function term, is constructed. The method is proposed in a unified manner which can tackle adaptive stabilization of switched systems due to that it can deal with the cases of uncertain cascade switched systems with/without OCs, no need to change the structure of the controller.

  abstract     = {The $L$ th order Rice model can effectively describe imperfect transmission, including amplitude attenuation, time delays, and stochastic disturbance, and is a popular channel fading model in one-dimensional (1-D) systems. However, due to the state evolution feature of two-dimensional (2-D) systems, the previous state signals of 2-D systems are not as directly determinable as those of 1-D systems such that the construction of the conventional and obvious $L$ th order Rice model become difficulty for 2-D systems. Motivated by these, this work will investigate the sliding mode control (SMC) problem of the 2-D Fornasini–Marchesini (FMII) system under Rice fading channels. First, the previous $p$ -step state signals are defined according to the evolution feature of the FMII model. Afterwards, a new applicable $L$ th-order Rice fading model for 2-D FMII systems is constructed, which not only has 2-D structural characteristics but also has similar properties to 1-D cases. A 2-D-type sliding function involving the predefined previous $L$ -step state signals and channel attenuation coefficients is designed, which exhibits a similar structural feature to the FMII model. A feasible SMC law is designed via the available fading states to achieve the ultimately uniformly boundedness in the mean square of the closed-loop system and the reachability of the sliding domain around the specified sliding surface. Furthermore, an optimization-solving algorithm is introduced to minimize the convergent bound. Finally, an example is applied to demonstrated the proposed results.},

To more effectively and efficiently solve practical-size instances, a new iterative two-stage heuristic algorithm based on $\varepsilon $ -constraint is proposed. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that 1) the improved model with valid inequalities can solve 78.4\% of 500 benchmark instances, more than 29.8\% for the state-of-the-art one and the Pareto solutions obtained by the former are much superior to that of the latter and 2) the proposed iterative two-stage heuristic algorithm can solve all benchmark instances and its performance is significantly superior to the widely adapted nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II in obtaining high-quality Pareto solutions.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces an adaptive memristor-programming neurodynamic approach (AMPNA) to tackle optimization problems that are nonconvex and nonsmooth with inequality and equality constraints. In the circumstance that requiring neither estimating penalty parameters, nor the coerciveness of inequality constraints, the state of the AMPNA can go into the feasible region from any initial points within a finite amount of time and ultimately converge to the critical point set of the aforementioned optimization problem. Differ from the existing neurodynamic approach (NA), AMPNA has superiority in using memristor. On the one hand, with regard to power consumption, AMPNA makes the most of memristor’s unconventional characteristics to execute within the flux-charge realm. Compared with conventional NA executing within the voltage-current realm, AMPNA executes within the flux-charge realm and consumes power only in the analog transient. Once the analog transient is complete, all voltages, currents and powers in the AMPNA disappear. On the other hand, in terms of result storage, since the memristor has the ability to calculate and save information at the same physical location, the AMPNA no longer needs additional memories, and can implement the calculation scheme by the principle of in-memory computation. Therefore, the AMPNA presented in this article has significant advantages in reducing power consumption and storage space. Finally, AMPNA’s optimization capacity and exceptional performance are confirmed through numerical simulations.},

First, the engagement of the missile and the target is formulated as nonlinear planer pursuit-evasion dynamics, and the interaction between the obstacle and the missile are determined. Then, the maneuvering target knowledge is estimated online by the extended disturbance observer (EDO) and incorporated into a separated feedback term of the input channel for the implementation of an approximately optimal actor–critic guidance law framework. To render the safety, the obstacle is thought as constraint objects and mathematically described by high-order control barrier functions (HO-CBFs). Furthermore, HO-CBFs are synthesized with the proposed guidance framework to intercept the maneuvering target with obstacle settings.

  abstract     = {The job-shop scheduling problem (JSSP) is one of the best-known combinatorial optimization problems and is also an essential task in various sectors. In most real-world environments, scheduling is complex, stochastic, and dynamic, with inevitable uncertainties. Therefore, this article proposes a novel framework based on graph neural networks (GNNs) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to deal with the dynamic JSSP (DJSSP) with stochastic job arrivals and random machine breakdowns by minimizing the makespan. In the proposed framework, JSSP is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and is associated with a disjunctive graph to encode the information of jobs and machines as nodes and arcs. We propose a GNN architecture to perform representation learning by transforming graph states into node embeddings. Then, the agent takes actions using a parameterized policy in terms of policy learning. Operations are used as actions, and an effective reward is well designed to guide the agent. We train our proposed method using proximal policy optimization (PPO), which helps minimize the loss function while ensuring that the deviation is relatively small. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can achieve excellent results considering different criteria: efficiency, effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. Once the proposed method is trained, it can directly schedule new JSSPs of different sizes and distributions in static benchmark tests, showing its excellent generalizability and effectiveness compared to another DRL-based method. Furthermore, the proposed method simultaneously maintains the win rate (a quantitative metric) and the scheduling score (a qualitative metric) when scheduling in dynamic environments.},

  abstract     = {Cloud virtualization technology, ingrained with physical resource sharing, prompts cybersecurity threats on users’ virtual machines (VMs) due to the presence of inevitable vulnerabilities on the offsite servers. Contrary to the existing works which concentrated on reducing resource sharing and encryption/decryption of data before transfer for improving cybersecurity which raises computational cost overhead, the proposed model operates diversely for efficiently serving the same purpose. This article proposes a novel multiple risks analysis-based VM threat prediction model (MR-TPM) to secure computational data and minimize adversary breaches by proactively estimating the VMs threats. It considers multiple cybersecurity risk factors associated with the configuration and management of VMs, along with analysis of users’ behavior. All these threat factors are quantified for the generation of respective risk score values and fed as input into a machine learning-based classifier to estimate the probability of threat for each VM. The performance of MR-TPM is evaluated using benchmark Google Cluster and OpenNebula VM threat traces. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model efficiently computes the cybersecurity risks and learns the VM threat patterns from historical and live data samples. The deployment of MR-TPM with existing VM allocation policies reduces cybersecurity threats up to 88.9\%.},

An unknown nonlinear nonaffine system is considered, whose input–output dynamics is then equivalently reformulated into a modified linear data model (mLDM) in which both a linear parametric increment description that is affine to the control input and the unmodeled uncertainties along with disturbances are included without omission or approximation. The uncertain parameter of the mLDM is estimated in real time by designing an adaptive mechanism, and the unmodeled uncertainties and disturbances are considered as a total extended state which is further estimated by developing a linear ESO. Subsequently, a modified DL-and-ESO-based data-driven adaptive control (mDLESO-DDAC) is proposed by using knowledge from previous control input to improve the control performance. The theoretical results are mathematically proved and then verified by simulations.},

  abstract     = {Parallel machine scheduling (PMS) is a common setting in many manufacturing facilities, in which each job is allowed to be processed on one of the machines of the same type. It involves scheduling $n$ jobs on $m$ machines to minimize certain objective functions. For preemptive scheduling, most problems are not only NP-hard but also difficult in practice. Moreover, many unexpected events, such as machine failure and requirement change, are inevitable in the practical production process, meaning that rescheduling is required for static scheduling methods. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which combines deep learning and reinforcement learning, has achieved promising results in several domains and has shown the potential to solve large Markov decision process (MDP) optimization tasks. Moreover, PMS problems can be formulated as an MDP problem, inspiring us to devise a DRL method to deal with PMS problems in a dynamic environment. We develop a novel DRL-based PMS method, called DPMS, in which the developed model considers the characteristics of PMS to design states and the reward. The actions involve dispatching rules, so DPMS can be considered a meta-dispatching-rule system that can efficiently select a sequence of dispatching rules based on the current environment or unexpected events. The experimental results demonstrate that DPMS can yield promising results in a dynamic environment by learning from the interactions between the agent and the environment. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze DPMS in the context of developing a DRL to deal with dynamic PMS problems.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates a robust path-following control problem of multiple autonomous vehicles along an implicit elliptical curve. At the kinematic level, by formulating a novel coordinated error in terms of projective arc length instead of relative distance, a new distributed guidance law is developed for multiple vehicles evolving along a geometric path, achieving an equal arc separation and a uniform forward speed. Based on simple filtering operations upon available states and invariant manifold, unknown system dynamics estimators (USDEs)-based robust kinetic controllers with a concise structure are derived to enable a satisfied nominal tracking of velocity and angular rate subject to uncertainties while eliminating the computational complexity encountered in the available function approximators. The remarkable merit of the explored solution lies in that robust cooperative behaviors over an implicit elliptical curve can be attained by specifying successive projective arc length for nonholonomic vehicles, avoiding the time-consuming path variable synchronization calculation inherent in parameterized reference-guided paradigms, eliminating temporal limitations of time-related function in trajectory tracking strategies. It is proven that all signals of a closed-loop system are convergent by using the input-to-state stable (ISS) principle. Simulation and experimental outcomes are both delivered to substantiate the efficacy and superiority of the presented method.},

The stochastic packet loss phenomenon, which arises from the plant to the filter, obeys Bernoulli distribution. Then, aiming at the phenomenon that the system performance is degraded or even unstable due to packet loss, a new packet loss compensation strategy is proposed, which adopts the single exponential smoothing method. Considering the limited communication channel, a static logarithmic quantizer with mode-dependent property is used to quantify the measured output. Besides, since the system modes are not always fully available, a quantized periodic filter, which is partially mode-dependent, is constructed to guarantee that the filtering error system is stochastically stable. Furthermore, by constructing a periodic Lyapunov function with mode-dependent property, the existence conditions of periodic filter are presented. Eventually, to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach, a practical example of a boost converter is presented.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) unites multiple participants to collaboratively learn a global consensus model on the centralized server by aggregating their individual models trained locally on clients. To meet the goal of obtaining an optimal model, sufficient labeled data and myriad communications are required during training. However, the major problems are the limited budget for manually annotating unlabeled instances and the restricted bandwidth of server and clients. This article presents a communication-efficient federated active semi-supervised learning (CEFedASSL) framework that unites active learning (AL) clients and a semi-supervised learning (SSL) client to train models on unlabeled data while achieving communication efficiency. In each AL client, different query strategies are, respectively, applied for the local model to obtain a more robust model and query only the optimal samples which significantly reduces the cost of annotation. Subsequently, these optimal samples are encrypted as input to fine-tune the pretrained model of the SSL client by performing self-training, thereby enhancing the model performance while preserving the privacy of data. Furthermore, we propose an efficient selective aggregation strategy to reduce the communication cost between clients and the server. Empirical experiments on four different learning tasks demonstrate that the proposed CEFedASSL distinctively outperforms the common FL algorithms in terms of both model performance and communication costs.},

Third, a novel IDLN with a recurrent topological structure is exploited to find the time-varying theoretical solution. The proposed IDLN with strong robustness to bounded noise with unknown amplitude regardless of the value of hyperparameters, can be implemented through electronic circuits as a method of parallel computing and achieve global convergence from any initial state.

Alternatively, offline simulations with human-like race driver models could make this vehicle development process more effective and efficient but are hard to obtain due to various challenges. With this work, we intend to provide a better understanding of race driver behavior from expert knowledge and introduce an adaptive human race driver model based on imitation learning. Using existing findings in the literature, complemented with an interview with a race engineer, we identify fundamental adaptation mechanisms and how drivers learn to optimize lap time on a new track. Subsequently, we select the most distinct adaptation mechanisms via a survey with 12 additional experts, to develop generalization and adaptation techniques for a recently presented probabilistic driver modeling approach and evaluate it using data from professional race drivers and a state-of-the-art race car simulator. We show that our framework can create realistic driving line distributions on unseen race tracks with almost human-like performance. Moreover, our driver model optimizes its driving lap by lap, correcting driving errors from previous laps while achieving faster lap times. This work contributes to a better understanding and modeling of the human driver, aiming to expedite simulation methods in the modern vehicle development process and potentially supporting automated driving and racing technologies.},

In this article, we present a novel framework called graph evolution recurrent unit (GERU), which uses a dynamic graph neural network to automatically learn the evolving dependencies from historical stock features, leading to better predictions. Our approach consists of three parts: first, we develop an adaptive dynamic graph learning (ADGL) module to learn latent dynamic dependencies from stock time series. Second, we propose a clustered ADGL (clu-ADGL) to handle large-scale time series by reducing time and memory complexity. Third, we combine the ADGL/clu-ADGL with a graph-gated recurrent unit to model the temporal evolutions of stock networks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our proposed methods outperform existing methods in predicting stock movements, capturing meaningful dynamic dependencies and temporal evolution patterns from the financial market, and achieving outstanding profitability in portfolio construction.},

  abstract     = {Background: Human workers are indispensable in the human–cyber-physical system in the forthcoming Industry 5.0. As inappropriate work content induces stress and harmful effects on human performance, engineering applications search for a physiological indicator for monitoring the well-being state of workers during work; thus, the work content can be modified accordingly. The primary aim of this study is to assess whether heart rate variability (HRV) can be a valid and reliable indicator of acute work-content-related stress (AWCRS) in real time during industrial work. Second, we aim to provide a broader scope of HRV usage as a stress indicator in this context. Methods: A search was conducted in Scopus, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Web of Science between 1 January 2000 and 1 June 2022. Eligible articles are analyzed regarding study design, population, assessment of AWCRS, and its association with HRV. Results: A total of 14 studies met the inclusion criteria. No randomized control trial (RCT) was conducted to assess the association between AWCRS and HRV. Five observational studies were performed. Both AWCRS and HRV were measured in nine further studies, but their associations were not analyzed. Results suggest that HRV does not fully reflect the AWCRS during work, and it is problematic to measure the effect of AWCRS on HRV in the real manufacturing environment. The evidence is insufficient for a reliable conclusion about the HRV diagnostic role as an indicator of human worker status. Conclusion: This review is valuable in the Operator 4.0 paradigm, calling for more trials to validate the use of HRV to measure AWCRS on human workers.},

Based on investigating shared control modes, a driving activity parameter for drivers is introduced, which aims to modulate the shared control authority and mitigate the conflicts between aggressive drivers and ADAS. A polytope represented by finite vertices is employed to handle uncertain parameters, including driving activity and longitudinal velocity. Then, an H $\infty $ robust output-feedback control method satisfying the regional pole assignment is presented to provide robustness and stability of the polytope space while simplifying the control structure through reducing vertices. The driver-in-the-loop simulator experiments are carried out to verify the proposed controller, in which the driver model parameters are identified.

  abstract     = {In today’s semiconductor manufacturing industry, wafer foundries often face the challenge of producing a variety of integrated circuit chip products using a single manufacturing line. To address this, multicluster tools have become a popular choice for processing multiple wafer types simultaneously. Operating such tools involves coordinating the robots in adjacent individual tools to transport multitype wafers through a shared buffer. This study aims to develop a scheduling method for the concurrent fabrication processes of two wafer types, performed by a multicluster tool with wafer residency time constraints. The proposed approach presents a two-backward sequence, based on a backward strategy of a single wafer type, to convert a one-wafer cyclic schedule into a one-wafer-per-type cyclic schedule while revealing its temporal properties. To ensure a smooth operation of a single-arm multicluster tool system and synchronize multiple robots, several necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the first time. Two efficient algorithms are then proposed to determine the feasibility of a periodic schedule and obtain a schedule that achieves the lower-bound cycle time under a two-backward strategy, maximizing the productivity of such a multicluster tool. Finally, numerical simulations and two practical examples are presented to demonstrate the applications and performance of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The conflicts in human societies have often been studied through evolutionary games. In social dilemmas, for example, individuals fair best if they defect, but the society is best off if everybody cooperates. Cooperation therefore often requires a mechanism or third parties to evolve and remain viable. To study how third parties affect the evolution of cooperation, we develop a novel game theoretic framework composed of two layers. One layer contains cooperators and defectors, while the other, the third-party layer, contains interveners. Interveners can be peacemakers, troublemakers, or a hybrid of these two. Focusing on two-player two-strategy games, we show that intervention, as an exogenous factor, can stimulate (or inhibit) cooperation by weakening (or strengthening) the dilemma strength of the game the disputant plays. Moreover, the outcome in the disputant layer that is triggered by intervention, in turn, stimulates its own evolution. We analyze the co-evolution of intervention and cooperation and find that even a minority of interveners can promote higher cooperation. By conducting stability analyses, we derive the conditions for the emergence of cooperation and intervention. Our research unveils the potential of third parties to control the evolution of cooperation.},

These data are sampled from the output of dynamical systems with uncertain dynamics. Based on deterministic learning, a rapid recognition approach is presented from the viewpoint of the sample-data observer. It comprises two phases: 1) training and 2) recognition. In the training phase, locally accurate dynamical modeling of the underlying dynamics of training time series can be accomplished by merging a sampled-data observer and radial basis function network (RBFN) identifiers. In the recognition phase, several RBFN-based estimators with non-high-gain designs are constructed. In this case, the stability analysis of the generated estimator error systems will conduce to conduct non-high-gain recognition of a test time series. We demonstrate that these estimator errors can depict dynamics differences between the dynamical patterns of the test and training time-series data. Based on the average $L_{1}$ norms of the output errors, a decision-making scheme is developed to generate recognition results rapidly. More concise and relaxed recognition conditions are derived through rigorous analysis to ensure accurate recognition results.

Meanwhile, in the fuzzy setting, the possibilistic model checking has been well studied by Li et al. in recent years. However, nondeterminism of choices was not considered in previous work. The nondeterminism is crucial for modeling open systems interacting with the environment. To fill the gap, we propose the possibilistic decision processes (PDPs) to model fuzzy systems with nondeterminism and introduce possibilistic strategy computation tree logic (PoSCTL) to specify properties with nondeterministic choices. More importantly, optimal strategy model checking over PDPs has been investigated, which is an important formal verification method for quantitatively checking the degree of satisfiability of properties in a model. We give mathematical methods to calculate the maximum and minimum possibilities for a system modeled by PDPs satisfies a property specified by PoSCTL when ranging over all strategies. We prove memoryless strategies are sufficient for PoSCTL model checking without the step-bounded until operator, and give the algorithms to output the corresponding optimal strategy.

Considering the imprecision of system modeling and unknown external disturbances, we employ a fuzzy adaptive technology to achieve compensation. By incorporating the actuator fault term and backlash error, the adaptive FTC is developed to resolve loss faults in the actuator and compensate for the unknown backlash to some extent.

Owning to the existence of DoS attacks, it is challenging to investigate the event-triggered control of multiagent systems in a fully distributed manner. This article presents a novel dynamic event-triggered mechanism to alleviate the limited communication resources. Moreover, the designed mechanism is fully distributed and scalable owing to the introduction of some adaptive coupling weights. Since the DoS attacks have been considered in the event-triggered rule design, a novel adaptive parameter with an additional exponential term is adopted to deal with DoS attacks. The Lyapunov design also introduces such a term for the subsequent stability analysis. Sufficient conditions guaranteeing the asymptotic consensus of the studied system are developed in light of the controller’s parameters, duration, and frequency of the DoS attacks. Strict proof is provided to demonstrate that a secure consensus can be reached effectively under the proposed control mechanism. Furthermore, it is shown that the Zeno behavior can be excluded from the designed triggering mechanism. Finally, simulations on a multiagent system consisting of interconnected unmanned intelligent vehicles are conducted to verify the results.},

Each agent aims to optimize a total cost function that accounts for its own interests as well as those of its cooperators, considering both cooperative and noncooperative interactions with other agents. It is worth noting that, unlike in existing N-coalition games, the agents in this study only have knowledge of whether they are cooperative or noncooperative with their neighboring agents; they do not have information about non-neighboring agents who might be cooperators. As a result, due to potential disconnections in the communication topology within the cluster, it is not possible to consider the entire cluster as a virtual player to optimize its objective functions. To address this issue, we developed an algorithm using the singular perturbation technique, which divides the system into two distinct timescales. We propose a novel estimation algorithm to estimate the total cost function of disconnected subnetworks within the fast system. In the slow system, the search for NE is based on a gradient algorithm, while the Lyapunov stability theory is utilized to analyze the convergence of the algorithms. Furthermore, we extend the problem to accommodate scenarios where multiple subnetworks exist within the network. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate their capability for resolving the noncooperative game problem in cooperation–competition networks.},

This study proposes a model of embedding-based computable access control (ECAC), by employing the idea of representation learning in artificial intelligence. According to ECAC, access control rules can be embedded into a Euclidean vector space, and the security of arbitrary behavior can be computed by numerical vector operations, without any traditional querying or traversing of rules, and thus the workload of access control is reduced. Furthermore, by the embedding-based computation, the security of unknown behaviors can be predicted. Potentially, due to the use of numerical vectors instead of traditional semantic symbols, the risk of privacy leakage via semantics can be reduced. Finally, as the first embedding-based access control model, the effectiveness of ECAC is evaluated and concluded by the experiment-based analyses and discussions.},

  abstract     = {High-dimensional (HD) chaotic map has wide applications in various research fields such as neural networks and secure communication. Designing HD chaotic maps with expected dynamics and robust hyperchaotic behaviors is an interesting but challenging topic. In this article, we propose an $n$ -dimensional hyperchaotic map $(n\text{D}$ -HCM) generation method on the basis of the Gershgorin-type theorem. First, the general form of the proposed $n\text{D}$ -HCM is built using $n$ parametric polynomials. Then, the entity and coefficient parameter matrices are configured according to the Gershorin-type theorem. Theoretical analysis shows that the generated $n\text{D}$ -HCM has $n$ positive Lyapunov exponents and thus can show robust hyperchaotic behaviors. Two examples of hyperchaotic map with specified equations are provided and their properties are analyzed to show the availability of the proposed method. Performance evaluations display that our $n\text{D}$ -HCM possesses abundant properties and complex behaviors, and it can outperform some representative HD chaotic maps. Moreover, to show the application of our $n\text{D}$ -HCM, we apply it to a secure communication scheme and the experimental results exhibit that it shows much better performance than these representative HD chaotic maps in resisting transmission noise.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the problem of using a multirobot system to conduct sweep coverage over a region with uneven and unknown workload distribution. Uneven workload distribution means that a robot has to spend different amounts of time covering a unit area at different locations in the region. Unknown workload distribution means that the amount of workload at any location is unknown prior to the operation, hence online sensing and allocation of workload is needed for better efficiency. In this work, we adopt the formulation in which the entire region is separated into multiple stripes, and a discrete-time distributed workload allocation algorithm is used to allocate workload on a stripe to each robot. Previous works that adopt similar formulations do not provide rigorous stability analysis and experimental verification and lack consideration of practical aspects, such as limited sensor range. This work addresses these weaknesses and bridges the gap between theory and practice. First, compared with the existing works, the convergence of the distributed workload allocation algorithm to the optimal workload assignment is established under a more realistic assumption, and less conservative error bounds are derived, which serve as a better indicator of the effectiveness of the algorithm. Second, we propose a new algorithm that addresses the limited sensor range of robots, which is an important constraint in applications, such as agricultural spraying and building inspection. The stability analysis and error bound of the proposed algorithm are also provided. Third, realistic simulations and actual flight experiments using unmanned aerial vehicles are carried out to demonstrate the practicality and validate the theoretical results.},

First, we constructed a Fornasini-Marchesini comprehensive feedback error model, considering the state deviation and output error. Using this model, we developed a switching model considering the match and mismatch cases. Furthermore, an iterative learning-based predictive control mechanism was designed for asynchronous switching with a greater freedom of adjustment and fast learning ability in the batch direction. Second, the asymptotic and exponential stability were discussed based on the related methods and theories, and the system stability conditions were expressed in the form of linear matrix inequality (LMI). Following an online mechanism to determine the LMI conditions, we derived the real-time optimal gains of the control law, the maximum dwell period (Max-DT) for the mismatch case, and the minimum dwell period for the match case. The switching signal was transmitted in advance according to the Max-DT to ensure the stability of the system during switching. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method was confirmed by utilizing the injection molding process.},

  abstract     = {A High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) matrix is regularly adopted to portray the inherent non-negativity of interactions among numerous nodes, which is involved in countless industrial applications driven by big data. An inherently non-negative latent factor (LF) model can take out the intrinsical features from such data conveniently and effectually due to its unimpeded training process. However, it constructs the learning objective relying on a standard Euclidean distance, thereby seriously restricting its representative ability to HDI data generated by different domains. To address this issue, this work proposes an adaptive divergence-based non-negative LF (ADNLF) model following: 1) constructing a generalized objective function based on $\alpha - \beta $ -divergence to inflate its ability to represent various HDI data; 2) connecting the optimization variables with output LFs by a smooth and single LF-dependent bridging function to satisfy the non-negativity constraints constantly; and 3) facilitating adaptive divergence in the learning objective through particle swarm optimization for high scalability. Empirical studies on eight HDI matrices validate that an ADNLF model evidently outstrips state-of-the-art models in terms of estimation accuracy as well as computational efficiency for missing data of an HDI dataset.},

Trajectory tracking, the end-effector’s errors feedback, and the joint multilevel physical limits (joint angle, -velocity, and -acceleration limits) avoidance are also incorporated into this optimization scheme. Meanwhile, the velocity–acceleration minimization (VAM) measure is developed. Combining the ASOA strategy with the VAM measure, the ASOA-VAM scheme is formed and further reformulated as a quadratic program (QP). Moreover, a recurrent neural network with theoretically provable convergence is designed to solve the QP online.

In this study, we presented the feasibility of classifying the various specific AbSs (namely, low fatigue, high fatigue, low workload, high workload, low distraction, and high distraction) by applying the deep learning method. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to classify multiple AbSs of pilots. We proposed the hybrid deep neural networks with five convolutional blocks and two long short-term memory layers for decoding multiple AbSs. We designed the model to extract the informative features from electroencephalography signals. A total of ten pilots conducted the experiment in a simulated flight environment. Compared with five conventional models, our proposed model achieved the highest grand-average accuracy of 68.04(± 5.26)\% which is at least 6.55\% higher than other conventional models for classifying seven mental states across all subjects. Our proposed model could distinguish and classify low and high levels for each status category and give appropriate feedback to the subjects. In addition, we found nine indicators that showed the statistically significant differences between two mental states ( ${p} &amp;lt; 0.05$ ).

It is considered that the Markov chain parameter, denoted by $\theta (k)$ , is not observable but, instead, only an estimation, represented by $\hat \theta (k)$ , is available for the filter design. Sufficient synthesis conditions for the filter design, based on linear matrix inequalities, are provided. These conditions for the $H_{2}$ and $H_{\infty }$ filters are not conservative in the sense that, for the full-order case and perfect information of the Markov parameter, they become also necessary. Simplified conditions are derived for the Bernoulli case. This article is concluded with an illustrative example in the context of networked control systems, in which we study the effects of reducing the order of the filter on the estimation performance.},

A new quantization model is described by a hidden Markov chain, where the emission probability depends on the network status and sampling interval. Two variables called hidden mode and observed mode are defined based on the assumption that the data receiver can recognize the quantization density instead of the sampling interval, and the associated observed mode-dependent estimator is designed. An augmented estimation error system is obtained, and the strict $(\mathcal {Q},\mathcal {S},\mathcal {R})-\gamma -$ dissipativity for the nonuniformly sampled neural networks is investigated. Then the estimator gain is calculated by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated via an example.},

Although failure analyses of such systems are abundant, the risk mitigation methodology through elaborate maintenance scheduling is still insufficient. To address such deficiency, we innovatively designed a two-threshold group maintenance policy for $k$ -out-of- $n$ load-sharing systems. Such policy aims to save costs by mitigating the failure risks and minimizing the disturbance of maintenance activities to ensure continuous operation. Compared with existing studies, the proposed policy and modeling approach have two prominent superiorities. First, they are not limited to basic two-component systems which are addressed most. Second, arbitrary lifetime distribution is allowed in maintenance decision-making, which effectively expands the realistic application scope. To relieve the computation burden arising therefrom, a surrogate-aided approach is proposed to enhance the practicability for large-scale systems. We demonstrate the generality and superior performance of the approach through numerical experiments.},

By orchestrating the sensor outputs with a prescribed dynamic transmission order, a new multinode Round-Robin protocol (RRP) under the 2-D setting is developed on the sensor-to-filter channel to ease the communication overheads, and a novel compensation strategy is proposed for enhancing the deconvolution filter performance. A sufficient condition is established for ensuring the dissipativity of the deconvolution filter in terms of coupled matrix inequalities. Furthermore, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is formulated to design the filter gain with certain optimized performance. Finally, by transforming the color image into three gray images, the proposed algorithms are applied to the remote color image restoration problem under RRP. It is shown that the use of RRP saves 33.3\% communication burden, and the saving of communication resources reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by 18.5\%. In comparison to the RRP using zero-input compensation strategy in available literature, the introduction of the novel multinode RRP with compensation strategy can indeed improve the reconstruction SNR.},

Here, we propose the susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) model with detection, contact tracing, and dynamical social distancing to quantify the effectiveness of joint interventions. Under the framework of time-varying networks, we analytically derive the epidemic threshold and the effective reproductive number under joint interventions by using the mean-field approach. Experimental results show that detection and contact tracing can significantly reduce the epidemic scale, while social distancing can remarkably delay the peak time and suppress the second outbreak of the epidemic. Compared with constant social distancing, the effectiveness of dynamical social distancing depends on the starting time and the intervention period, and extensive detection can greatly reduce its dependence on them. Further, we explore the effects of heterogeneous distributions of physical distance and contact duration on the effectiveness of joint interventions in high-resolution empirical contact networks. We find that extensive contact tracing is more effective in decreasing the “false negatives,” but at the expense of unnecessary large-scale quarantines of the “false positives.” Meanwhile, the early implementation of long-term social distancing can effectively reduce the “false negatives” and “false positives.” In conclusion, it is very important to ensure extensive detection and contact tracing, while maintaining moderate social distancing to suppress the epidemic spread and prevent epidemic recurrence.},

  abstract     = {Optimization problems whose evaluations of the objective and constraints involve costly numerical simulations or physical experiments are referred to as expensive constrained optimization (ECO) problems. Such problems can be solved by evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in conjunction with computationally cheap surrogates that separately approximate the expensive objective and constraint functions. During the process of the ECO, the interested regions of surrogate models for the objective and constraints usually have a small overlap only. Specifically, the surrogate model for the objective function should focus on the prediction accuracy in the promising region, while the models for constraint functions should concentrate on the accuracy at the boundary of the feasible region. However, most existing methods neglect such differences and train those different models using the same training data, barely resulting in satisfactory performance. Therefore, we propose a general framework for solving expensive optimization problems with inequality constraints. In the proposed framework, the objective and constraints are separately trained with two different sets of training data to enhance the prediction accuracy and reliability in the interested regions. A novel infill sampling criterion is tailored to decide whether potentially better or more uncertain solutions should be sampled. Moreover, a new strategy, termed search intensity adjustment, is designed for adjusting the number of search generations on new surrogate models. We attempt to embed three competitive constrained EAs into our framework to verify its generality. The experimental results obtained on numerous benchmark functions from CEC2006, CEC2010, and CEC2017 have demonstrated the superiority of our approach over three state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted EAs.},

Besides, the existing approaches of predefining tracking performance work under local initial conditions, available nonlinearity knowledge, disturbance-free cases, or have complexity issues. In this article, a novel smoothing function is first designed for the online automatic generation of smooth trajectories in place of the quantized reference. Then, the tangent barrier functions are combined with a new form of performance functions (inverse proportional functions) to form a control. The strong robustness of the resulting controller against model uncertainties and disturbances evades the need for approximation, observation, etc., yielding simplicity of the control. The new performance functions relax the specific initial condition. Their combination ensures for any initial condition, the tracking error converges to a given bound. Simulation results on vehicular platoons illustrate the theoretical findings.},

To this end, this article presents a novel heterogeneous stochastic variational linear model of coregionalization ( HSVLMC ) model for simultaneously learning the tasks with varied input domains. Particularly, we develop the stochastic variational framework with Bayesian calibration that: 1) infers posterior domain mappings to consider the effect of dimensionality reduction raised by domain mappings for achieving effective input alignment and 2) employs a residual modeling strategy to leverage the inductive bias brought by prior domain mappings for better-model inference.

This article proposes a new probabilistic MF (PMF)-based CF method that integrates multiple information sources to provide reliable predictions. First, we introduce a sentiment-based PMF to handle user reviews and fit the normalized sentiment information obtained from our previously proposed sentiment analysis method. We also consider the helpfulness of reviews to highlight their reliability and effectiveness in this model. Subsequently, our proposed noise detection method is adopted to determine the reliability of user ratings, and then the rating matrix is transformed into a binary reliability matrix. A rating reliability-based PMF through Bernoulli distribution is then proposed to factorize it. To effectively integrate three types of information (ratings, reviews, and rating reliability) into a PMF procedure, we design a weight matrix using the proposed weighting strategy to generate a set of comprehensive prediction ratings with corresponding reliability probabilities. Experiments on four Amazon datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms comparison methods in terms of comprehensive evaluation.},

  abstract     = {In traditional social network analysis-based large-scale group decision making (LSGDM), decision makers (DMs) often trust others based on social prestige/status without sufficient information to understand others’ credibility. Notably, this ignores the inherent risks of trust, resulting in the LSGDM process being subject to trust risk behaviors (blind trust/lack of trust), which ultimately causes unreasonable aggregation weights allocation and unreliable decision results. Therefore, this article develops a trust risk analysis-based social network LSGDM model to mine and manage trust risk behaviors, reasonably assign aggregation weights and reach consensus. In this model, DMs are divided into different communities by a clustering method. The performances of DMs in each community are observed during the decision-making process and their credibility is evaluated. Community’s credibility is modeled by a multicriteria credibility assessment matrix (MCAM). Combined with external network structure information, community’s synthetical trust assessment matrix (STAM) is constructed. Furthermore, group’s MCAM and STAM are obtained by information collection from all communities. The aggregation weights of communities and DMs are dynamically derived from STAMs of group and communities, respectively. Afterward, a trust risk behaviors mining and detection method is presented to mine communities’ different behaviors and determine the trust risk degree of the group. When the group is deemed too risky, the trust risk behaviors management mechanism allows to compensate or punish the weights of communities with different behaviors, and give recommendations for information modification. Sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis, as well as a case study, verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed methods.},

To reduce the computational burden, in phase two, denoted as the exploitation phase, an interior penalty function method with the dynamic penalty coefficients is developed, which enhances the search ability by using the information of constraints in feasible solutions. During the optimization process, differential evolution is adopted as the search algorithm to produce the offspring population. Experiment results on four benchmark test suites, namely, IEEE CEC 2006, IEEE CEC 2010, IEEE CEC 2017, and IEEE CEC 2020, indicate that TPDE is competitive with other popular algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In this article, based on the classical Degroot and Friedkin–Johnsen model, two opinion dynamics models with antagonistic relationship and multiple interdependent topics are proposed. The proposed models aim to characterize the evolution of individual opinions when individuals in a signed social network are able to discuss multiple interdependent topics simultaneously. Considering that different individuals may have different perceptions of the same thing, a set of heterogeneous logical matrices is used to represent the logical interdependence between different topics. In Model I with time-varying topologies, both the structurally balanced and unbalanced network topologies are investigated. Some sufficient conditions for the modulus consensus about topics are obtained in our study. About Model II with the stubborn individuals, we rigorously concentrate on its convergence and stability for the structurally balanced and unbalanced social networks. And some conditions on the convergence and stability are obtained. All the obtained conditions depend on the network topology and logical matrices and fully show how the network topology and logical matrices influence the evolution of opinions. Finally, two examples are used to verify our results.},

On the basis of the reformulated model, we propose two stabilization criteria for the uncertainty-free case, including both Lyapunov-type and Riccati-type criteria. More generally, we extend the stabilization result to the uncertain model, and propose a necessary and sufficient stabilization criterion utilizing matrix homogeneous polynomials.

Noticing the prominent feature of HSTs operation, i.e., the spatial repetitiveness, a novel spatial iterative learning control (ILC) scheme is proposed. First, the motion dynamic model of HSTs is constructed with the aid of temporal-spatial conversion. Meanwhile, input saturation constraint is introduced to address the limitation of system power supply capability and the loss of traction/braking force in neutral section. Then, the ILC law and the associated parametric updating law are devised to address the system uncertainties and realize the adaptive tracking control simultaneously. The stability of the closed-loop system and the convergence of the tracking errors are confirmed based on a space-weighted Lyapunov–Krasovskii-like composite energy function (CEF). Finally, numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {In order to enable intelligent robots to recognize unknown objects as accurately as human beings, object perception research is of great significance in service and industrial robot application scenarios. However, object perception using spectral measurements under few-shot learning usually leads to a poor result because of inadequate training samples. To overcome this problem, this work proposes a novel few-shot learning with coupled dictionary learning (FSL-CDL) framework. First, a hybrid feature fusion method is developed to extract the multiple dimension-reduced features of original spectral measurements to build the hybrid features. Then, based on the hybrid features, a multitask coupled learning method is developed to effectively recognize unknown objects under few-shot learning. In this method, two coupling patterns, i.e., interspectroscopy coupling and intraspectroscopy coupling, effectively bridge the gap between two spectral measurements. Finally, the proposed FSL-CDL is compared with other advanced algorithms on the SMM50 dataset, and reaches 97.5\% and 98.4\% recognition accuracy under one-shot and five-shot learning, respectively, which are better than other algorithms. Besides, FSL-CDL can be extended to other perception tasks which contains multiple heterogeneous measurements.},

In traditional coverage control, the paths of UAVs are preplanned to achieve regional coverage. Additionally, the quantity of UAVs remains unchanged, resulting in a waste of resources and a lack of flexibility. To overcome these problems, we present a novel coverage algorithm. First, the tracking coverage algorithm is designed, in which the positions of the UGVs are sampled at a certain interval, and $k$ -means is used to obtain the optimal expected positions of UAVs. Then, to realize the quantity-adjustment behavior of UAVs, an evaluation mechanism is proposed to determine whether the UAVs should be added or withdrawn. UAVs should reach the expected positions during the sample interval. As a result, a finite-time terminal sliding-mode controller is designed to drive the UAVs to follow expected positions. Furthermore, we design a Lyapunov function to prove the stability of the controller. Finally, three simulation examples are put forward, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and controller.},

Tire cornering properties, namely, lateral force, aligning moment, and pneumatic trail, are crucial factors that should be accurately estimated for vehicle dynamics control purposes. In this work, a soft sensor for estimating tire cornering properties based on intelligent tire and machine learning is developed. The intelligent tire system is based on a triaxial accelerometer mounted on the inner liner of the tire tread, which provides acceleration measurements from the $x$ , $y$ , and $z$ directions. Partial least squares and variable importance in the projection scores (PLS-VIP) are used in the feature extraction of the acceleration signals over the contact patch. A Gaussian process regression (GPR) model is trained to predict the cornering properties with confidence intervals under different input conditions. Based on the variances in the GPR predictions and minimum mean-square error criterion, a data fusion method for pneumatic trail estimation is proposed. It is demonstrated that the developed GPR models for cornering properties and the data fusion method for pneumatic trail estimation have satisfactory accuracy and reliability. The experimental results show that the soft sensor proposed in this work is a strong candidate for further applications in the development of vehicle state estimation and control algorithms.},

With the definitions, a new robustness analysis method of BRB is proposed, which is conducted from four aspects: 1) the input transformation; 2) the matching degree calculation; 3) the matching degree normalization; and 4) the rule aggregation. Moreover, five guidelines for BRB construction are proposed by analyzing its robustness, which can offer a practical guide for users to establish, adjust, and improve the BRB model for specific applications.

  abstract     = {This article addresses the three-dimensional (3-D) path-following problem of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of multiple uncertainties and nonlinearities, including unmodeled dynamics, actuator hysteresis, input saturation, and oceanic disturbance. First, the AUV kinetic model is reconstructed as a second-order nonlinear system by coupling the smooth saturation function and hysteresis dynamics of actuators. Second, the 3-D tracking error is derived in a simplified manner based on the relative motion theory. Then the approach angle-based symmetrical hyperbolic-tangent line-of-sight (SHLOS) guidance and kinematic control scheme are designed to ensure the global asymptotic stability of the kinematic system. Third, two sets of kinetic control schemes are designed without prior knowledge of AUV dynamics and disturbance, where the Nussbaum gain technique is applied to deal with the unknown hysteresis parameter. The application of the reconstructed kinetic model avoids the degraded performance caused by actuator nonlinearities. The first scheme is improved by adaptively estimating the bound of the generalized disturbance-like term which lumps the unmodeled dynamics, external disturbance, and saturation approximation error. The improved scheme guarantees the global stability of the system and transient tracking performance. Finally, comparative simulation studies under dynamic oceanic environments prove the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control schemes.},

The selection conflict problem may arise when many providers choose the same task at the same time, especially when there are more providers than consumers. At this moment, how to choose the appropriate manufacturing services, which should both satisfy the users’ requirements and enhance the participation of the providers, is of utmost importance. To increase the number of collaboration chances, the functional and quantitative manufacturing service collaboration is carried out simultaneously in this article. The variable utility models are used to represent the satisfaction levels of users while taking into account the bilateral coupling between providers and consumers and the unilateral irrationality of the provider. Finally, it is advised to choose providers with a short-term preference in situations where there is a strict time limit based on the findings and analysis of the manufacturing service collaboration optimization. At the same time, we can find that the providers, who get lower utilities when they focus on the current, are more likely to get greater utilities than others when they concentrate on long-term gains.},

Taking the inaccurate velocity measurement into consideration, an extended state observer (ESO) based on a fractional order faster nonsingular terminal sliding mode (FNTSM) is proposed for velocity and disturbance estimation simultaneously. An FNTSM control algorithm based on the double power reaching law is developed to reach fast platooning while guaranteeing string stability of the connected vehicular systems regardless of zero or nonzero initial spacing error conditions. The salient features of the proposed platoon controller are that system convergence can be achieved in finite time and the time-varying external disturbances can be estimated accurately.

Such task becomes more challenging when data arrives in stream since it requires concept drift adaptative, robust, and fast algorithm. In this article, we present an online semi-supervised classification algorithm (OSMTS) for multilabel text streams. By leveraging a few labeled instances, OSMTS dynamically maintains the subspace of terms for each label with a set of evolving micro-clusters. For multilabel classification, $k$ nearest micro-clusters are employed for prediction by using a nonparametric Dirichlet model. To handle the gradual concept drift in term space, the triangular time function is adopted to calculate the difference between term arriving time and cluster life span. Whereas, abrupt concept drift is dealt by considering two procedures: 1) deleting outdated micro-cluster by exploiting the exponential decay function and 2) creating new micro-clusters by adopting the Chinese restaurant process based on the Dirichlet process. The conducted experimental study provides a comparison with 12 state-of-the-art algorithms on nine datasets in terms of classification performance, runtime, and memory consumption.},

A novel controller is designed to make allowances for four cases that are common in practical situations: 1) a network delay; 2) false data injection (FDI) attacks; 3) asynchrony between system modes and controller modes; and 4) an event-triggered scheme. First, to avoid traditional assumptions about system delays, a novel Lyapunov function is proposed, based on which a new stability theory is formulated to guarantee exponential stability. Second, an FDI attack is represented as a stochastic process, which can be dealt with properly by the designed controller. Third, a new delay-based event-triggered scheme is brought into the controller design to reduce the network bandwidth consumption and save the network transmission resources. Then, an asynchronous controller is engineered with the aid of a hidden-Markov model, which can extend the application scope of the proposed method. Note that we put the above four factors into one framework, which implies a co-design of an anti-attack controller and an event-triggered scheme is developed. Finally, an operational amplifier circuit is simulated to verify the feasibility and superiority of the designed controller.},

A novel connectivity-preserving mechanism based on the potential function is designed to guarantee the connectivity of initial edges. Then, we introduce an event triggering mechanism to save communication resources. It is noted that connectivity-preserving control often requires continuous communication as the system states needs to be monitored in real time to ensure that the connection will not be destroyed. Thus, it is difficult to combine event-triggered control with connectivity-preserving control.

To accomplish precise current-sharing/voltage-regulation without additional communication devices, this article proposes a communication-free intelligent edge control regarding voltage and current for dc-microgrids. First, the power-information dual modulation (PIDM) is designed to achieve information exchange among DGs and eliminate additional communication devices. Second, the cooperative control problem with two coupled targets, i.e., accurate voltage-regulation and current-sharing, is converted into a matter of optimal control. Therefore, the voltage-regulation and current-sharing could be solved concurrently. In addition, the control objective function of each DG is switched to provide the optimal controller and minimize the voltage/current control deviation, which is further switched to solve the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) function. In order to solve this HJB function, which is difficult to obtain analytical solution, an intelligent edge control strategy with PIDM is proposed to solve the HJB function. Therefore, the precise voltage-regulation and current-sharing can be accomplished. Finally, the proposed control approach is verified through simulation results.},

Then, we present an event-driven Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equation (ED-HJIE) corresponding to the zero-sum game for lowering down the computational load. To solve the ED-HJIE, we propose a dynamic triggering mechanism together with a sole critic neural network (CNN) being built under the ADP framework. The CNN’s weights are tuned via the gradient descent approach. After that, we prove uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system and the CNN’s weight estimation error via Lyapunov’s method.

The existing models, however, have various limitations, such as being limited to the exponential time-to-failure distribution, constant component performances, or performances without constraints. In this article, we make contributions by modeling a dynamic load-sharing system (DLSS), where the performance of each component is dynamic according to prespecified load-sharing principles and is limited by its capacity constraint. Moreover, the capacity constraint of a component can reduce due to degradations. In the proposed model, increasing failure rates are also involved since the surviving components must share the load of the failed component and continue working with increasing stresses. When the desired performance for a component exceeds the limitation, the entire system fails. An extended Markov process (EMP) method is proposed for evaluating the reliability of the considered DLSS with nonrepairable components. The proposed analytical method is flexible in handling arbitrary component time-to-failure distributions and in handling diverse load allocation mechanisms. Numerical studies of a power transmission system and a water transmission system are provided to validate the proposed method and its advantages. Effects of several model parameters are also investigated through case studies.},

Importantly, the good/bad coupling effects are assessed through a well-designed nonlinear function. By means of determining if the sign of disturbances conforms to the expected motion or not, the addition of beneficial disturbance effects or removal of detrimental disturbance effects is implemented. Noticeably, by employing a bioinspired nonlinear reference model, beneficial nonlinear stiffness and damping effects are thus utilized, leading to the possibility of energy-saving performance. As a result, the proposed control method exhibits a unique feature, i.e., fully employing potential contribution from the coupling and disturbance effects, and presents a totally new coupling and disturbance effects-triggered control framework, leading to obvious performance improvement.

First, the data tampering rate and estimation error caused by the network attack are derived. From the perspective of the attacker, it is investigated how to achieve the maximum attack effect with the minimum energy. Second, the compensation-type defense scheme is designed. Under this, the identification algorithm is constructed, and its strong convergence is proved. Taking the covariance matrix of the estimation error as the performance index, the optimal defense scheme is given. Finally, the results obtained are verified by simulation example.},

  abstract     = {Federated edge learning (FEEL) is a rapidly growing distributed learning technique for next-generation wireless edge systems. Smart systems across various application domains face challenges, such as data heterogeneity, limited wireless resources, and device heterogeneity, which necessitate intelligent participant selection schemes that accelerate convergence rates. Consequently, this article presents joint participant selection and bandwidth allocation schemes to address these challenges. First, we formulate an optimization problem that considers communication and computation latencies, as well as imbalanced data distribution, while meeting round deadlines and bandwidth constraints. To address the combinatorial problems of participant selection, we employ a relaxation method followed by a proposed priority selection algorithm to select near-optimal participants. The proposed algorithm initially prioritizes participants with larger datasets, effective channel states, and better CPU speeds. To address data heterogeneity, we propose a randomized deadline-controlling algorithm that diversifies updates by allowing the edge server to include different participants with fewer data samples in training rounds. The proposed algorithms offer near-optimal performance compared to the brute-force method. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed scheme accelerates the convergence rate by up to 55\% under extensive non-IID settings compared to benchmarks. Furthermore, the deadline-controlling algorithm improves performance at high levels of data heterogeneity, resulting in faster FEEL systems.},

  abstract     = {Difficult-to-cut materials, such as superalloys and titanium alloys, have been increasingly used in aerospace and other fields. However, commonly used mechanical milling methods for difficult-to-cut materials have problems, including low processing efficiency and severe tool wear. Electrical discharge assisted arc milling (EDAAM) is a novel high-efficiency machining method proposed by the authors to solve these processing problems. The machining efficiency achieved by EDAAM when processing difficult-to-cut materials is much higher than that achieved by mechanical milling and conventional electrical discharge machining (EDM) milling. However, if EDAAM adopts the traditional EDM servo control method, it will easily form deep and large discharge craters on the surface of the workpiece, which may lead to high machining errors and cause the workpiece to be scrapped. To ensure normal processing, low-energy discharge parameters that may reduce the processing efficiency have to be adopted. To address the above issues and achieve the optimal machining condition of difficult-to-cut materials, mathematical models and system of intelligent servo for EDAAM are proposed. An EDAAM discharge information dataset is obtained, and the intelligent recognition and classification method for discharge states is proposed. The EDAAM intelligent servo control system is proposed based on mathematical models created. The experimental results of superalloy Inconel 718 by EDAAM show that, compared with the nonintelligent servo control system, the intelligent servo control system can increase the material removal rate by up to ten times, reduce the relative electrode wear rate by 37\%, and avoid the scrapping of the workpiece.},

With the estimated velocities, a distributed containment controller is designed for each AUV to follow a convex hull spanned by trajectories of the leader AUVs. For the developed velocity observer, a double power reaching law is employed to reduce the chattering and improve the convergence rate. Besides that, an adaptive strategy is incorporated into the containment controller, such that the steady-state errors caused by stochastic environment disturbances can be compensated. Stability conditions for the velocity observer and containment controller are also provided. Finally, we conduct the simulation and experimental studies to verify the effectiveness.},

However, whether experts engage in a vigorous debate, it can result in the use of aggressive language that may diminish consensus, which is the major objective of GDM. To avoid it, we present a novel method for GDM problems that can identify aggressive comments during the debate by incorporating a classifier based on sentiment analysis techniques. According to the information extracted during the debate, two procedures are developed to assign weights to the experts, which are used to introduce two new consensus measures and to make the final decision. Unlike the existing GDM methods, this new one can take advantage of the information extracted during the debate (i.e., experts’ behavior) throughout the decision process, making it in rapport with real-world GDM processes.},

  abstract     = {Detection of rail surface defects using deep learning largely relies on supervision with pixel-level ground truths, where the detection accuracy suffers due to unseen image domains. In order to streamline the laborious labeling process and accurately identify defects on rail surfaces a U-Net-based network that integrates spatial and channel attention (SA) modules, multistep domain adaptation (MSDA), and progressive histogram matching (PHM) is developed in the context of pixel-level defects detection in this research. MSDA with an unlabeled intermediate dataset is used to reduce the domain gap underlying different domains. To further improve the adaptation of the transferred model, the PHM method and the self-training method are employed to enhance detection accuracy. Trained in the source domain with ground truths, the deep learning model is then tested in the target domain with no annotations. Experimental results on the RSDD dataset and the Rail-Joint dataset demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach. By alleviating the domain discrepancy, the developed model drastically enhances the average precision (AP) score of unsupervised detection from 0.103 to 0.861, which shows competitive performance compared with the AP score of 0.895 by the state-of-the-art supervised models. The novelty of this research lies in the development of a hybrid deep learning approach that is able to achieve competitive detection accuracy with a low overlap ratio between domains and few data labeling.},

First, a distributed control protocol is designed and a novel decentralized dynamic self-triggering mechanism (DDSTM) is proposed, with which, each agent can not only compute its own next triggering instant but also is able to compute the neighbors’ next triggering instant. Then, a hybrid system model is constructed to completely describe the close-loop system with jump dynamics. Based on the hybrid model, Lyapunov conditions are derived for MAS consensus analysis. The proposed DDSTM can overcome some limitations of the existing distributed STMs in the sense of synchronously acquiring consensus error or uniquely determining triggering instants, moreover, it allows transceivers to be turned on only at triggering instants and enter into sleep mode at the rest time, such that node energy is efficiently saved. Preadjustable minimum triggering interval is imposed between any consecutive triggering events; thus, a minimum sleep period for transceivers is always guaranteed. Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

In order to save limited network bandwidth, a compressed coding scheme is developed by preprocessing the measurement output. With the aid of a stochastic Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, a sufficient condition is first obtained under which the consensus error system is mean-square stable for DT-MASs over identical fading channels. Then, the consensus gain is formulated as the feasible solution to a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) whose dimensions are independent of the number of agents. Furthermore, for the case that agents communicate over nonidentical fading channels, the mean-square consensus problem is transformed into an analyzable edge agreement issue in the mean-square sense by means of properties of the edge Laplacian combined with a mapping technique. Next, a sufficient condition is derived to ensure the mean-square consensus performance, based on which the existence of the controller can be guaranteed by the feasibility of a set of LMIs. Finally, the validity and feasibility of the developed design scheme are shown by two illustrative examples.},

Because of the inherent unknown nonlinearity and actuator failure existing in the considered system, it is fundamentally different from the systems studied in most related studies. To simplify the stability analysis, the original PDE–ODE cascaded system is redescribed as a new target system by leveraging finite- and infinite-dimensional backstepping techniques. In the newly transformed system, the compensation term in the form of the smoothing function is used to eliminate the influence caused by actuator faults. Then, a novel fault-tolerant control strategy is further developed, which can not only eliminate the influence of uncertainty, but also overcome the difficulties of actuator faults. The system stability and the asymptotic convergence of all states in the original system are proved by applying the Lyapunov function theory. The simulation example shows that the presented control method ensures the realization of the control objectives.},

However, the existing collective opinion generation approaches fail to model the behavioral characteristics associated with individuals, and thus, cannot reflect the fairness concerns among them when they consciously or unconsciously incorporate their judgments on the fairness level of distribution into the formulations of individual opinions. In this study, we propose a multiobjective optimization-driven collective opinion generation approach that generalizes the bi-objective optimization-based PDF aggregation paradigm. In doing so, we adapt the notion of fairness concern utility function to characterize the influence of fairness inclusion and take its maximization as an additional objective, together with the criteria of consensus and confidence levels, to achieve in generating collective opinion. The formulation of fairness concern is then transformed into the congregation of individual fairness concern utilities in the use of aggregation functions. We regard the generalized extended Bonferroni mean (BM) as an elaborated framework for aggregating individual fairness concern utilities. In such way, we establish the concept of BM-type collective fairness concern utility to empower multiobjective optimization-driven collective opinion generation approach with the capacity of modeling different structures associated with the expert group with fairness concern. The application of the proposed fairness-aware framework in the maturity assessment of building information modeling demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of multiobjective optimization-driven approach for generating collective opinion when accomplishing complicated assessment and evaluation tasks with data scarcity.},

Furthermore, fault detectability criterion is derived with the help of the developed fault detectability indicator. The relationship between fault detectability indicator and fault detection index is then investigated to analyze fault detection performance. To enhance fault isolability, a solution of appropriate fault cluster center model and radius is provided under the condition of fault isolation. Third, a gap metric fault-tolerant control strategy is exploited to guarantee system stability when a large fault is diagnosed by the developed FDI approach.

  abstract     = {Preferences that verify the transitivity property are usually referred to as rational or consistent preferences. Existent methods to improve the consistency of inconsistent fuzzy reciprocal preference relations (FPRs) fail to retain the original preference values because they always derive a new FPR. This article presents a new inconsistency identification and modification (IIM) method to detect and rectify only the most inconsistent elements of an inconsistent FPR. As such, the proposed IIM can be considered a local adjustment method to improve multiplicative consistency (MC) of FPRs. The case of inconsistent FPRs with missing values, i.e., incomplete FPRs, is addressed with the estimation of the missing preferences with a constrained nonlinear optimization model by the application of the IIM method. The implementation process of the proposed algorithms is illustrated with numerical examples. Simulation experiments and comparisons with existent methods are also included to show that the new method requires fewer iterations than existent methods to improve the MC of FPRs and achieves better MC level, while preserving the original preference information as much as possible than the existent methods. Thus, the results presented in this article demonstrate the correctness, effectiveness, and robustness of the proposed method.},

Then, the proper non-quadratic Lyapunov functional (non-QLF) is taken into account. By employing the time derivatives of non-QLF, Jensen’s inequality techniques, some stabilization conditions are attained in the formulation of linear matrix inequalities to guarantee that the concerned NS is stochastically asymptotically stable together with the $H_{\infty }$ perturbation damping criterion.

  abstract     = {Different from other deep scalable architecture-based neural architecture search (NAS) approaches, broad NAS (BNAS) proposes a broad scalable architecture which consists of convolution and enhancement blocks, dubbed broad convolutional neural network (BCNN), as the search space for amazing efficiency improvement. BCNN reuses the topologies of cells in the convolution block so that BNAS can employ few cells for efficient search. Moreover, multiscale feature fusion and knowledge embedding are proposed to improve the performance of BCNN with shallow topology. However, BNAS suffers some drawbacks: 1) insufficient representation diversity for feature fusion and enhancement and 2) time consumption of knowledge embedding design by human experts. This article proposes Stacked BNAS, whose search space is a developed broad scalable architecture named Stacked BCNN, with better performance than BNAS. On the one hand, Stacked BCNN treats mini BCNN as a basic block to preserve comprehensive representation and deliver powerful feature extraction ability. For multiscale feature enhancement, each mini BCNN feeds the outputs of deep and broad cells to the enhancement cell. For multiscale feature fusion, each mini BCNN feeds the outputs of deep, broad and enhancement cells to the output node. On the other hand, knowledge embedding search (KES) is proposed to learn appropriate knowledge embeddings in a differentiable way. Moreover, the basic unit of KES is an over-parameterized knowledge embedding module that consists of all possible candidate knowledge embeddings. Experimental results show that: 1) Stacked BNAS obtains better performance than BNAS-v2 on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet; 2) the proposed KES algorithm contributes to reducing the parameters of the learned architecture with satisfactory performance; and 3) Stacked BNAS delivers a state-of-the-art efficiency of 0.02 GPU days.},

  abstract     = {In time series forecasting with outliers and random noise, parameter estimation in a neural network via minimizing the $l_{2}$ loss is unreliable. Therefore, an adaptive rescaled lncosh loss function is proposed in this article to handle time series modeling with outliers and random noise. It overcomes the limitation of the single distribution of traditional loss functions and can switch among $l_{1}$ , $l_{2}$ , and the Huber losses. A tuning parameter in the loss function is estimated by using a “working” likelihood approach according to estimated residuals. From the proposed loss function, a robust adaptive rescaled lncosh neural network (RARLNN) regression model is developed for highly accurate predictions. In the training phase of the model, an iterative learning procedure is presented to estimate the tuning parameter and train the neural network in iterations. A new prediction interval construction method is also developed based on quantile theory. The proposed RARLNN model is applied to two groups of wind speed forecasting tasks. The results show that the proposed RARLNN model is more conducive to enhancing forecasting accuracy and stability from the perspectives of noise distribution and outliers.},

Moreover, in the case of complete transmission (no missing case), a nominal H∞ filter with more superior performance is developed by the discontinuous Lyapunov function, which provides a complement for the tradeoff between filter schemes with and without missing measurements.

First, the concept of (strongly) GSPG is given and how to design two kinds of games is shown through the semi-tensor product (STP) of matrices. Subsequently, it is confirmed that their corresponding dynamics will converge almost surely to a strategy invariant set of (strongly) group-based recurrent state equilibriums and remain stable.

Ten simple heuristic rules as low-level operations are utilized to search the solution space. The estimation of distribution algorithm is integrated into the framework of hyper-heuristic as the high-level strategy to control the low-level heuristics sequence in the solution space. The destruction and construction procedures are conducted on products and jobs in order to enhance the exploitation competence of EDA-HH.

Attack graphs are an effective approach to depict these complex attack scenarios, assisting security administrators in determining how to best safeguard their systems. However, due to time and financial constraints, it is frequently not possible to address all atomic-level flaws at the same time. In this article, we propose a method for automatically detecting a minimal set of critical attacks that, when defended against, render the system secure. Finding a minimal label cut is typically an NP-complete problem. However, we propose a linear complexity approximation that uses the attack graph’s strongly connected components (SCCs) to create a simplified version of the graph in the form of a tree over the SCCs. Then, we perform an iterative backward search over this tree to find a set of backward-reachable SCCs, as well as their outward edges and labels, in order to find a cut of the tree with the fewest labels, which is a critical attack set. We put our proposed method to the test on real-world case studies, such as IT and SCADA networks for a cyber–physical system for water treatment, and outperformed previous state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of approximation accuracy and/or computational speed. Our solution provides security administrators with a practical and efficient method for prioritizing efforts to address vulnerabilities in SCADA/ICS networks.},

Conflicts are present in the information fusion process and decision makers (DMs) have to negotiate and reconcile differences. To address this issue, it becomes inevitable to consider intelligent GDM method. In this article, we propose the granular neural network (GNN) to realize the aggregation process from the perspective of granular computing and machine learning. Our study is involved in an extension of best–worst method to the GDM scenario. The procedure is outlined as follows: first, information granules are allocated around the prototype of individuals’ preferences, complying with the principle of justifiable granularity. Thereby, the granular inputs are brought into a well-trained GNN. An adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to optimize allocation of information granules. We calculate the threshold of consistency index for this granular model. Finally, a case study about hotel selection on Booking.com is presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed model. In addition, we use the stochastic analysis method to randomize the weights of group members with the objective to assess the robustness of the model. The feasibility and validity of the model are demonstrated by completing comparative analysis. The originality of this article is to establish a real data-driven granular GDM model both considering the optimization of group consistency and consensus.},

It envisions the interaction between electric vehicles and the charging infrastructure to match supply and demand in a decentralized and collaborative fashion. For this reason, the assignment issue is regarded as a linear integer programming problem and a Lagrangian relaxation heuristic is proposed to solve it. Thus, each electric vehicle selects the charging station and the most convenient path to minimize its own completion time. The completion time of each electric vehicle is composed of the travel time (TT), the waiting time (WT) at the station, and the charging time. The Lagrangian relaxation heuristic results are more effective compared to other local heuristic procedures performances and demonstrate a fair allocation of the electric vehicles to the charging stations. The analysis of the time components of the solution on a real urban network highlights that the TT is negligible with respect to the WT and charging time, that are comparable. Therefore, a reservation policy is also considered.},

In the context of knowledge automation and machine learning, simulated images are widely used for visual environmental perception. However, even the most inspirational applications have not fully exploited the potential of simulated images in solving real-world problems. In this article, we propose a novel framework “ParallelEye Pipeline,” which uses image-to-image translation and simulated images to automatically generate realistic synthetic images with multiple ground-truth annotations. Specifically, this method has three steps: first, we use Unity3D software to simulate driving scenarios and generate simulated image pairs (including raw images and six ground-truth labels) from the simulated scenes; second, advanced image-to-image translation algorithms can generate realistic and high-resolution synthetic images from simulated image pairs; third, we exploit publicly datasets, simulated images, and synthetic images to conduct experiments for visual perception. The experimental results suggest: 1) synthetic images and simulated images can improve the performance of detectors in real autonomous driving scenarios and 2) image-to-image translation algorithms can be affected by occlusion condition.},

In this article, a switched energy-based swing-up and neural network (NN) controller is proposed to solve the swing-up and tracking control problem of the DIP system when the desired position is time varying. The implementation of the proposed controller can be divided into three steps. In step one, the energy-based control method is adopted to drive the first pendulum from the downward position to the neighborhood of the upright position. In step two, the sliding mode control method is adopted to stabilize the first pendulum. Meanwhile, a method combining energy-based control and “equivalent cart” is adopted to swing up the second pendulum. In step three, on the basis of approximate nonlinear output regulation theory, the NN controller is used for achieving satisfactory position tracking performance. Finally, the effectiveness of our design is verified by experimental results.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a new control scheme with a nonlinear quadratic regulator (NQR) associated with a hybrid switching stage for permanent magnet synchronous generator-based wind turbines (WTs). The proposed method shows a new approach combining a nonlinear optimal control method with a hybrid switching stage for WT generations (WTGs). As the WTG is a nonlinear system, NQR control design is directly employed to deal with the nonlinearity while a hybrid switching scheme can deal with constrained control inputs as discrete nonlinear characteristics of switch-mode power converters. A polynomial-based dynamic model is derived for the new NQR design. Unlike the previous state-dependent Riccatti equation (SDRE) technique where the solution of the nonlinear optimal controller is approximated, this technique finds the exact online solution of SDRE with nonlinear feedback gains flexibly depending on the tracking error. Then, the optimal control laws are implemented via a hybrid switching stage ensuring a smooth current regulation under a reduced switching frequency while avoiding any complicated modulator or finite state search. The proposed control design is investigated via comparative studies with linear quadratic regulator (LQR), direct switching, and space-vector pulse-width-modulation stages (SV-PWMs) implemented in both platforms of MATLAB/Simulink and real-time OPAL-RT. Comparative results exhibit flexible optimal performances via online hyper-parameter tuning to reduce the speed tracking error and low current ripples under a reduced switching frequency.},

In particular, a new condition that is easy to verify is established for the boundedness of EEC. Further, the properties of EEC with respect to the delay probability are studied. We found that there exists a critical probability such that the EEC is bounded if the delay probability is below the critical probability.

Since system switching has no regularity and the controller is only updated at triggering instants, the mismatch behavior may happen between the controller and its corresponding subsystem, which may lead to a destroyed system performance. To derive a flexible triggering condition and solve this problem, two dynamic gains are introduced and a mode-dependent dynamic triggering mechanism is designed. Then, by using the weighted homogeneity and inequality techniques, a mode-dependent dynamic event-triggered controller is developed by output feedback, under which the system states can globally enter an adjusted neighborhood of the origin. Meantime, by the skillful use of the right-continuous property of the switching signal, the Zeno behavior is proved to be avoided.

The adopted method no longer needs to integrate the Lyapunov function $V$ on the two integral intervals, which is quite different from the existing ones. Some new estimations of the settling times are provided. Also, the steepness exponents of the Lyapunov function $V$ in the previous fixed-time stability lemmas are improved. In order to further study the nondifferentiable delayed neural networks modeled by the Filippov system, a class of discontinuous uncertain Cohen–Grossberg neural networks (CGNNs) with mixed delays is formulated and the distributed delays are nondifferentiable, which is more general. Due to the existence of nondifferentiable distributed delays, the existence of the periodic solutions is proved by Kakutani’s fixed-point theorem before considering the stability. By virtue of the obtained fixed-time stability lemmas and the constructed delay-product-type Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, the fixed-time stabilization is obtained via a no-chattering controller. Clearly, the designed controller does not contain integral terms and delay terms for dealing with the time delays in the closed-loop system, which is more simplified and practical.

The problem at each level can include multiple conflicting objective functions and its own constraints. This survey aims to study the solution approaches proposed to solve MOBO problems, including exact methods and approximate techniques such as metaheuristics (MHs). This work explores classical literature to investigate why most classical methods, theories, and algorithms focus on linear and some convex MOBO problems to solve the optimistic MOBO. Moreover, we study and propose a taxonomy of MH-based frameworks for solving some MOBO instances, highlighting the pros and cons of five main approaches. Finally, a growing interest in MOBO has been detected in the optimization community. A significant number of possible applications and solution approaches establish an early research line to find solutions to these types of problems.},

First, a new error auxiliary system between the high-order closed-loop system and the reduced-order closed-loop model is obtained. The sufficient conditions to guarantee that the corresponding error system is asymptotically stable with a prescribed $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance index are developed. Then, the parameters of the desired reduced-order controller are derived by utilizing the projection lemma and the cone complementary linearization algorithm.

Besides, to cope with the adverse impact resulting from external disturbances, a finite-time disturbance observer is developed to provide accurate estimations of unknown terms within a finite time. A finite-time backstepping control scheme with a fast convergence rate is then proposed for each follower based on estimated disturbances to track the estimated states of the leader. Regardless of how close or how far away from the equilibrium point the follower states are, this method accelerates the convergence rate. An approximation technique using piecewise functions is also employed to bring the upper estimate of the convergence time closer to its real value. Finally, the efficiency of the presented control protocol is verified by some simulations on a number of connected wheeled mobile robots under external disturbances.},

However, current planning methods only consider VAs as decision choices. Because VAs and CAs have different activity spaces, planning a joint verification-correction strategy (JVCS) is challenging, especially for large-scale systems. Here, we introduce a UCB-based tree search approach to search for near-optimal JVCSs. First, verification planning is simplified as repeatable bandit problems and an upper confidence bound rule for repeatable bandits (UCBRBs) is presented with the optimal regret bound. Next, a tree search algorithm is proposed to search for feasible JVCSs. A tree-based ensemble learning model is also used to extend the tree search algorithm to handle local optimality issues.

In this article, we propose a general hierarchical framework to resolve the within-vision-range (WVR) air-to-air combat problem under six dimensions of degree (6-DOF) dynamics. The core idea is to divide the whole decision-making process into two loops and use reinforcement learning (RL) to solve them separately. The outer loop uses a combat policy to decide the macro command according to the current combat situation. Then the inner loop uses a control policy to answer the macro command by calculating the actual input signals for the aircraft. We design the Markov decision-making process for the control policy and the Markov game between two aircraft. We present a two-stage training mechanism. For the control policy, we design an effective reward function to accurately track various macro behaviors. For the combat policy, we present a fictitious self-play mechanism to improve the combat performance by combating against the historical combat policies. Experiment results show that the control policy can achieve better tracking performance than conventional methods. The fictitious self-play mechanism can learn competitive combat policy, which can achieve high winning rates against conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) are essential in logistics. In the literature, many exact and heuristic optimization algorithms have been proposed to solve the VRPs. These traditional approaches, however, generally start the optimization from scratch and ignore the experiences of solving related VRPs, which may lead to unnecessary computational costs in searching repeated problems and reduce the efficiency of vehicle routing. Recently, transfer optimization (TO) has been presented to speed up vehicle routing by reusing the knowledge learned from similarly solved VRPs. However, existing TO methods build connections across VRPs in a low-dimensional Euclidean space, which has limited modeling ability in the cases of having nonlinear correlations. Keeping this in mind, this article presents a study of TO equipped with the kernel method for fast vehicle routing. In contrast to existing TO methods, in this work, the learning of connections across VRPs for knowledge transfer is conducted in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which thus has greater modeling capacity in nonlinear customer relationships between VPRs. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, comprehensive empirical studies have been conducted using well-known VRP benchmarks, against existing state-of-the-art TO methods for vehicle routing. Finally, a well-known real-world VRP application given by a routing company (Jingdong), namely, the package delivery problem (PDP), is investigated to further assess the efficacy of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a new output-feedback event-triggered (ET) tracking control strategy is investigated for discrete-time strict-feedback nonlinear systems based on the adaptive critic design (ACD). An effective state observer is designed to obtain current states information, which can remove the restriction that the system can be converted to the input–output model. Subsequently, dissimilar to the n-step forward predictor with multiple neural networks (NNs) and n-step delays, variable substitution technique is used to avoid time delays and calculation burden of multiple NNs. ACD structure is constructed to acquire the optimal control strategy by critic and action NNs. An effective iterative strategy is adopted to deal with the approximation error of action NN. In this way, the update law of the controller is constructed, which is more reasonable and easier to be implemented. Meanwhile, ET mechanism is placed between the senor and the controller. A novel ET condition is constructed to moderate the burden of network communications and realize the ideal control performance. All the state signals are guaranteed to be bounded. Numerical simulations are performed to display the feasibility of the presented approach.},

  abstract     = {For decades, researchers have been trying to understand how people form their opinions. This quest has become even more pressing with the widespread usage of online social networks and social media, which seem to amplify the already existing phenomenon of polarization. In this work, we study the problem of polarization assuming that opinions evolve according to the popular Friedkin–Johnsen (FJ) model. The FJ model is one of the few existing opinion dynamics models that has been validated on small/medium-sized social groups. First, we carry out a comprehensive survey of the FJ model in the literature (distinguishing its main variants) and of the many polarization metrics available, deriving an invariant relation among them. Second, we derive the conditions under which the FJ variants are able to induce opinion polarization in a social network, as a function of the social ties between the nodes and their individual susceptibility to the opinion of others. Third, we discuss a methodology for finding concrete opinion vectors that are able to bring the network to a polarized state. Finally, our analytical results are applied to two real social network graphs, showing how our theoretical findings can be used to identify polarizing conditions under various configurations.},

However, numerous real systems are featured with a dynamic evolution including network reduction in addition to network growth. In this article, we propose a novel mechanism for evolving networks from the perspective of vertex degree. We construct a queueing system to describe the increase and decrease of vertex degree, which drives the network evolution. In our mechanism, the degree increase rate is regarded as a function positively correlated to the degree of a vertex, ensuring the PA in a new way. Degree distributions are investigated under two expressions of the degree increase rate, one of which manifests a “long tail,” and another one varies with different values of parameters. In simulations, we compare our theoretical distributions with simulation results and also apply them to real networks, which presents the validity and applicability of our model.},

Afterward, it converts the diagonalized system into two subsystems (i.e., one-dimensional (1-D) cascaded systems). Moreover, the proposed transformation retains the symmetrical structure of the two decomposed subsystems. Likewise, the second transformation converts 1-D submodels to the balanced structure used for model reduction operations. The proposed model reduction approach efficiently performs the model reduction task on a given 2-D diagonalized model by utilizing optimal Hankel norm approximation. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed transformations efficiently convert the standard 2-D framework to a diagonalized model form and develop a stable reduced-order model.},

Besides, the $N$ -order canonical Bessel–Legendre integral inequality and the convex function property are utilized to give more relaxed criteria. On the other hand, for the first time, more flexible switching is employed with an admissible edge-dependent average dwell-time strategy for the switched time-varying delay systems (STDSs). Novel improved delay-dependent stability conditions are expressed by two theorems in the form of linear matrix inequalities which can be used to guarantee the exponential stability of the STDSs in the different delay conditions.

A refined ASDBETC mechanism is first proposed in a hierarchy structure, which differs from some conventional sampled-data-based event-triggering control mechanisms with preordained invariable threshold. The refined ASDBETC mechanism can adaptively adjust the orientation and frequency of event-triggered threshold parameters via the variational tendency of states and the corresponding Euclidean distance between states. Therefore, an intact bidirectional regulative mechanism that is sensitive to the changes of state is legitimately established to provide additional flexibility, which is conducive to better compromise between communication resources and control performance. Through considering the effect of uncertainties, the random TVDs belonging to two different intervals by a probabilistic form are introduced. Then, by leveraging a novel time-related Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) that contains the more realistic sampled behaviors on the entire sampled interval, new synchronization conditions and controller design method are derived for RDCVNNs. Finally, the advantages of the refined ASDBETC strategy, the availability, and practicability of the developed theories are corroborated via two simulation examples.},

Then, to improve the command tracking performance of the baseline controller, a data-driven auxiliary controller which can adaptively adjust the action–critic network weights over time along with the tracking deviation to obtain the optimal control signals in the sense of performance index is developed based on action-dependent heuristic dynamic programming technology. Finally, a comprehensive robust self-learning FTC law is constructed by synthesizing the baseline controller and the auxiliary controller, which leads to good robustness and tracking performance of the closed-loop HFV system.

Utilizing the observation outcomes, an elliptical guidance law with a time-varying enclosing radius and nonorthogonal tangential and axial vectors is established to yield the reference velocity and angular rate to be tracked. At the kinetic level, by constructing filtering operations and auxiliary variables to extract weight errors, a special finite-time composite neural learning driven by weight and tracking errors is devised to reinforce parameter convergences, then an anti-disturbance kinetic control rule is designed to achieve online precise disturbance compensation and finite-time error convergence. The distinct merit is that an elliptical surrounding concerning an unknown target can be fulfilled with the finite-time neural learning capability while eliminating the deployment of GPS, which is nontrivial and challenging than reported circumnavigation alternatives either relying on the accessibility of GPS or neglecting kinetic uncertainties. An input-to-state stable criterion is applied to demonstrate the boundedness of a closed-loop system. Simulations are provided to confirm the utility of the considered strategy.},

In view of the fact that the statistical characteristic of the SMK is difficult to fully obtain in practical engineering, the SMK is recognized to be partly known with less conservativeness than both semi-Markov jump models with completely known SMK and Markov jump models with partly known transition probabilities. On the basis of classical Lyapunov stability and fuzzy-model-based approach, novel convex mean-square stability is proposed for the underlying system by eliminating the nonlinear coupling terms with the aid of additional matrix variables.

  abstract     = {We address the problem of trajectory tracking control of a quadrotor-slung-load system. A novel control framework is proposed that relaxes the differentiability class order of the reference. In lieu of traditional approaches that primarily regard the position of either the quadrotor or the load in the design of tracking controllers, in this work, we consider a virtual point located along the cable between the vehicle and the payload. The resulting control framework, which draws parallels with a typical single quadrotor dynamic system, is characterized by an utmost simplicity since it relies only on three error variables, and requires only up to the third time derivative of the reference trajectory. The overall control scheme ensures almost global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system in the presence of constant external disturbances. Extensive experimental results featuring time-varying exogenous perturbations are presented to validate and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Quadratic programming (QP)-based controllers allow many robotic systems, such as humanoids, to successfully undertake complex motions and interactions. However, these approaches rely heavily on adequately capturing the underlying model of the environment and the robot’s dynamics. This assumption, nevertheless, is rarely satisfied, and we usually turn to well-tuned end-effector PD controllers to compensate for model mismatches. In this article, we propose to augment traditional QP-based controllers with a learned residual inverse dynamics (IDs) model and an adaptive control law that adjusts the QP online to account for model uncertainties and unforeseen disturbances. In particular, we propose: 1) learning a residual IDs model using the Gaussian Process and linearizing it so that it can be incorporated inside the QP-control optimization procedure and 2) a novel combination of adaptive control and QP-based methods to avoid the manual tuning of end-effector PID controllers and faster convergence in learning the residual dynamics model. In simulation, we extensively evaluate our method in several robotic scenarios ranging from a 7-degrees of freedom (DoFs) manipulator tracking a trajectory to a humanoid robot performing a waving motion for which the model used by the controller and the one used in the simulated world do not match (unmodeled dynamics). Finally, we also validate our approach in physical robotic scenarios where a 7-DoFs robotic arm performs tasks where the model of the environment (mass, friction coefficients, etc.) is not fully known.},

Most of the existing backstepping-based FTC techniques have been developed for strict-feedback systems, which may cause algebraic loop problems when applied directly to NSF systems. In this work, unknown nonlinear functions are approximated by neural networks (NNs). Based on the properties of NN basis functions and a barrier Lyapunov function, a novel adaptive FTC strategy for an NSF system is proposed to achieve tracking control without violating the output constraint. Adaptive fault accommodation terms are constructed to compensate for the faults without a priori information to achieve online fault tolerance. The designed controller guarantees the fault-tolerant tracking performance while ensuring that all signals are bounded in probability and that the output is within the specified constraint. The performance of the proposed FTC strategy is illustrated by simulation studies.},

  abstract     = {At Presently, it is still a great challenge to achieve online classification of traffic flows due to the highly varying network environments, e.g., unpredictable new traffic classes, network noise, and congestion. Traditional classification methods work well in stable network environments, but may not exhibit their performance in dynamic environments. To address online classification issues, a granular computing-based classification model (GCCM) is developed, where the spatial and temporal flow granules are defined to make GCCM robust against variations and less sensitive to noise, and the correlations among flow granules are explored to establish the granular relation matrix (GRM). The inherent burst features between packets indicated by GRM prompt GCCM to achieve fine classification in unstable network environments. GCCM analyzes the burst features of packets without inspecting the payload information, and thus can be used to classify encrypted traffic as well as unencrypted traffic at a fast speed. In addition, the GCCM model, depending on difference measurement $D(\cdot)$ , is a threshold-based classification, and therefore can be used to distinguish between time-varying classes. The validity of GCCM for online traffic classification is examined through theoretical results. The experimental evaluation of classification for fine and varied classes under dynamic network environments with noise and congestion also demonstrates its superiority in terms of classification accuracy and real-time performance with the state-of-the-art.},

This article proposes the concept of cyber restoration of power systems, and an optimal restoration scheme to recover the system observability swiftly after massive interruptions. The cyber restoration problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem considering PMU measurability, communication network connectivity, and PDC processability conditions, as well as cyber restoration resources as constraints. Results in the IEEE 57-bus system validate that the proposed optimization method can provide solutions that recover system observability much faster than heuristic methods, demonstrating the need for systematic cyber restoration planning research and implementation.},

Next, to weaken the influence of the nonlinearities, the SMC strategy is proposed for the specific system, which is established on the corresponding SMD to ensure that the FOS reach the SMS in a finite time. Moreover, it shows that the matrix of SMS can be described by the linear matrix inequality (LMI). Furthermore, the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bell man (HJB) equation can be approximated by a single NN method, and the Lyapunov stability principle proves that the weight errors are convergent, further guaranteeing the asymptotically stability of the fuzzy FOS.

For fixed-time control design of the differential algebraic equation systems, the main obstacle lies that the algebraic variables are hidden in the system and their dynamics are ambiguous. We propose an available and effective approach to overcome this obstacle. The system variables are decomposed into differential component and the algebraic component, and the explicit representation of the dynamics of algebraic component is obtained. Fist, we investigate the locally fixed-time stabilization control as well as globally attractive for PH-DAE. Second, we focus on solving the globally fixed-time stabilization and $H_{\infty }$ control problems by jointly taking advantage of the locally fixed-time stabilization control for the origin and the globally fixed-time attractivity control for a predeterminate region. Finally, in order to address fixed-time stabilization control and $H_{\infty }$ control for PH-DAE, new controllers are designed. Moreover, the convergence time of systems can be easily estimated after external disturbance vanishes.

However, most of these exoskeletons deal with walking in the scene that has been seen or has an external vision sensor, rather than in the unknown environment. It is a great challenge to understand the wear’s intention and plan the footstep sequence in an unknown scene. Moreover, the traditional visual footstep planning is dominated by the robot, which can lead to an awkward trajectory plan. Therefore, we construct a visual footstep planning system and propose an onboard vision planning algorithm based on the Bezier curve to address the previous two problems. Specially, our human–computer interaction system understands the environment and the wearer’s behavior intention by integrating Hololens and Realsense. Then, we apply the Bezier curve to plan footsteps for the first time in the field of the exoskeleton and define two parameters of the Bezier curve, which are more suitable for our exoskeleton system and could increase the planning speed. Finally, we add the tracking feature cost in the cost function, which could better fit the planned footprints to the planned path and make the gait smoother. Extended experimental results show that the average planning time is 67.46\% less than that of the traditional search algorithm. Moreover, the effectiveness of our system is also verified on the visual interaction platform.},

Meanwhile, the bumpless transfer constraints restrict the bump of the control input when switching between two adjacent modes. By incorporating the modification signals into the prescribed performance functions (PPFs), control-bump PPFs (CPPFs) are provided to proactively reduce the performance bounds to a reasonable level. The modification signals are associated with control bumps and generated by an auxiliary switched positive system. Furthermore, a model of control bump is developed to enhance the dynamic response, and switched disturbance observers are employed to estimate external disturbances. In the framework of dynamic surface control and multiple Lyapunov stability theory, a prescribed performance bumpless transfer control (PPBTC) approach is proposed to guarantee the prescribed performance and bumpless transfer performance.

First, we introduce a steady-state generator, which can reproduce the desired trajectory.

Then, an observer-based output-feedback controller is proposed for each agent such that the output of each agent can converge to its own generated signal within a finite time. Finally, it is shown that the output of each agent can converge to the desired trajectory within a finite time using the proposed control strategy, and hence the finite-time DAT problem is solved.

For the three-dimensional (3-D) rigid-link FJM, the image-based visual servoing (IBVS) approach with link-position output constraint and unknown camera parameters is investigated in this article. The controller is designed to deal with three problems. First, the visual servoing control law is divided into two domains based on the singular perturbation method, where the control input for the fast subsystem is developed to damp out the flexible joint’s vibration. Second, the adaptive updating law for estimating the unknown camera parameters is presented in the slow subsystem. Third, to guarantee that the rigid-link position keep in set constraints, the controller for the slow subsystem is designed by introducing a barrier Lyapunov function. According to the Lyapunov theorem of stability, the proposed controller for the FJM is theoretically proved to be asymptotically stable. Several numerical simulation experiments are provided to illustrate that the presented control scheme is effective.},

Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, polytopic representation approach, matrix inequality, and Schur complement, we analyze the robust stability of the considered system, overcoming the relevant difficulties from the parameter uncertainty, the discontinuity produced by impulsive effect and the input constraints on both the sampled-data control signal and the impulsive signal. Moreover, to make it easier to find the suitable control gains, the design of the hybrid control gains is investigated. And, some optimization problems are also established to obtain the larger estimation of the attraction domain. Simulation results for the system consisting of two neural network subsystems are presented to show the feasibility and effectiveness of our robust stabilization methods and the LMI optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have become a popular tool to solve expensive optimization problems and have been gradually used to deal with expensive constraints. To handle inequality expensive constraints, existing SAEAs need both the information of constraint violation and satisfaction to construct surrogate models for constraints. However, many problems only feedback whether the candidate solution is feasible or how much degree it violates constraints. There is no detailed information of how much degree the candidate satisfies constraints. The performance of most existing SAEAs decreases a lot in solving expensive constrained optimization problems (ECOPs) with such incomplete constraint information. To solve the problem, this article proposes a hybrid regressor and classifier-assisted evolutionary algorithm (HRCEA). HRCEA adopts a radial basis function regression model to approximate the degree of constraint violation. In order to make a more credible prediction, a logistic regression classifier (LRC) is constructed for the offspring rectification. The classifier works in cooperation with the $\alpha $ -cut strategy, in which the high confidence level can significantly improve the prediction reliability. Besides, the LRC is built based on the boundary training data selection strategy, which is devised to select samples around feasible boundaries. This strategy is helpful for the LRC to fit the local feasibility structure. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark functions in CEC2006 and CEC 2010 demonstrate that HRCEA has satisfactory performance in found results and execution efficiency when solving ECOPs with incomplete constraint information. Furthermore, HRCEA is utilized to solve ceramic formula design optimization problem, which shows its promising application in real-world optimization problems.},

Existing works often perform feature selection on a single overcomplete feature pool that is collected from various feature extraction approaches, such as signal processing and deep learning. However, simple concatenation of these “multiview” features may neglect the inherent properties and cross-feature correlations, often leading to ineffectiveness in feature selection for fault diagnosis. Therefore, a multiview feature selection with information complementarity and consensus (MFSICC) is proposed in this article to efficiently select relevant features for fault diagnosis. In particular, both complementary and consensus properties that are shared among the multiview features are incorporated based on a structured sparsity learning model. Besides, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the MFSICC problem with theoretically approved convergence. Experiments on bearing and gearbox fault diagnosis with real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of MFSICC. Important model parameters and empirical convergence are also discussed to facilitate practical use.},

Based on Bayesian inference and the principle of likelihood, a likelihood analysis method is proposed for acquisition of evidence from imperfect data to enable likelihood inference within the framework of the evidential reasoning (ER). The nature of this inference process is underpinned by the new necessary and sufficient conditions that when a piece of evidence is acquired from a data source it should be represented as a normalized likelihood distribution to capture the essential evidential meanings of data. While the explanation of sufficiency of the conditions is straightforward based on the principle of likelihood, their necessity needs to be established by following the principle of Bayesian inference. It is also revealed that the inference process enabled by the ER rule under the new conditions constitutes a likelihood inference process, which becomes equivalent to Bayesian inference when there is no ambiguity in data and a prior distribution can be obtained as a piece of independent evidence. Two examples in decision analysis under uncertainty and a case study about fault diagnosis for railway track maintenance management are examined to demonstrate the steps of implementation and potential applications of the likelihood inference process.},

  abstract     = {In group decision making (GDM), considering the individuals’ satisfaction (i.e., utilities) about the consensus result is important. However, this issue is ignored by the extant minimum cost consensus models (MCCMs). Altruism describes a way of behaving that the individuals unselfishly concern for the utilities of others. Inspired by this, in this article we discuss the minimum cost consensus problem in social network GDM (SNGDM), where the utility constraints based on altruism are first incorporated. In SNGDM, altruism is reflected as the individuals will take both their personal utility and the utilities of others who connected with them into account to form their total utility. Based on this, we first define the individuals’ altruistic utility functions in the consensus process of SNGDM, and we propose several interesting properties of the proposed utility function. Afterward, we present a novel MCCM in SNGDM with opinion dynamics and altruistic utility (MCCM-OD-AU). Notably, in the proposed model, the deviation of opinion adjustment in the consensus process is measured as a psychological distance perceived by the individuals. Furthermore, some simulation studies and comparative analysis are conducted to investigate the effects of the altruistic behavior and the psychological distance of opinion adjustment on the consensus reaching results. Finally, two numerical studies, including an illustrative example and an application in energy-saving target formulation with real-world social network data, are provided to justify the performance of our proposal.},

We assume the uncertainties affect the state-space parameters as well as the transition probability matrix. We formulate an optimization problem using the penalty function method and design a recursive solution, whereby we attain the robust state feedback gains. We impose no restrictions on how fast the uncertainties can change between two consecutive iterations. Conditions for convergence and mean-square stability are well defined in terms of Riccati recursive equations. We also set up a procedure for powertrain polytopic model identification based on CAN bus data of an autonomous heavy-duty ground vehicle. We provide two numerical examples to verify the effectiveness of the robust recursive regulator. Moreover, in a third example, we validate the obtained powertrain model on a trajectory tracking problem and compute acceleration and braking inputs using the robust regulator.},

After deriving performance indices to quantify the energy consumption of a mechanical system, we propose a method to determine both the optimal compliant actuation parameters, and link trajectories to minimize energy consumption. We show how this problem can be cast in a simpler one where the optimization regards only parameters that define the shape of periodic trajectories to be subsequently determined by using numerical optimization tools. Indeed, in our framework, the optimal stiffness and spring preload can be analytically obtained as a function of the desired link trajectories. We then provide simulations and experimental validations of the obtained results on a two-link compliant manipulator platform which performs a repetitive pick-and-place task. Our experiments show that the use of compliant actuators instead of rigid ones and the optimization of their compliant parameters give rise to an energy saving up to 62\% with respect to rigid actuation. Moreover, the simultaneous optimization of the compliant parameters and link trajectories provide an additional energy saving up to 20\%.},

In this article, we present an influence-based nano fuzzy swarm (INFS) for oxygen deficiency detection and therapy using a swarm of oxygen carrier nanomachines operating in three cognitive fields of control, influence, and interest. In particular, we propose a long short-term memory (LSTM) deep neural network for detecting apnea by analyzing the irregular peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) signal. Using the proposed sleep-in-the-loop strategy and the desaturated blood biomarkers, including oxygen and hydrogen ion concentrations, an in-silico multithreshold nano fuzzy swarm noninvasive therapeutic method is then performed. We also analytically prove the stability of the INFS using swarm control theory. We apply our strategy to sleep apnea, as one of the most common instances of oxygen deficiency. Furthermore, we compare the accuracy of INSF by using LSTM, bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and support vector machines (SVM). The detection and therapy results are then compared with other apnea detection methods. The input variables and structure of INSF, i.e., the number of rules and width of membership functions, are studied in terms of robustness to noise. As the results show, the proposed artificial intelligence (AI)-based noninvasive nano detection and therapy method could outperform the competing approaches in treating oxygen deficiency emergencies such as apnea.},

Time delays can greatly influence the stability and performance of the systems, especially for optimal control design. In this article, we propose a receding horizon actor–critic learning control approach for near-optimal control of nonlinear time-delay systems (RACL-TD) with unknown dynamics. In the proposed approach, a data-driven predictor for nonlinear time-delay systems is first learned based on the Koopman theory using precollected samples. Then, a receding horizon actor–critic architecture is designed to learn a near-optimal control policy. In RACL-TD, the terminal cost is determined by using the Lyapunov–Krasovskii approach so that the influences of the delayed states and control inputs can be well addressed. Furthermore, a relaxed terminal condition is present to reduce the computational cost. The convergence and optimality of RACL-TD in each prediction interval as well as the closed-loop property of the system are discussed and analyzed. Simulation results on a two-stage time-delayed chemical reactor illustrate that RACL-TD can achieve better control performance than nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) and infinite-horizon adaptive dynamic programming. Moreover, RACL-TD can have less computational cost than nonlinear MPC.},

When a state equation is used to determine the reachability of a marking, we need to judge whether there is a corresponding legal firing sequence (LFS) for a non-negative integer solution (NIS), i.e., a firing count vector, of the state equation. The search for an LFS is an NP-hard problem, and previous work cannot always find an LFS for any NISs. This article proposes that transition-dependent circuits or firing-dependent circuits are the root cause that a state equation has an NIS but the marking is nonreachable, i.e., there is no LFS corresponding to an NIS in PNs. Based on this, we propose a state-equation-based backward algorithm (SBA) to determine whether there is an LFS corresponding to an NIS of the state equation in a PN. The correctness and effectiveness of SBA are verified by a case study on a PN-based flexible manufacturing system and through simulation on an S 4 PR net. The experimental results show that the time required for SBA to determine the existence of an LFS increases linearly with the transition firing count in NISs. When the number of NISs of a state equation is finite, we can efficiently determine the reachability of a marking. This represents an important result in theory and applications of PNs.},

However, it is computationally challenging to find an optimal edge set since it is an NP-hard problem. To address this issue, we propose a self-adaptive evolutionary deception (SAEP) framework. In SAEP, a novel fitness function that is able to capture local and global community change is being proposed. SAEP also provides a well-designed initialization mechanism to reduce the size of the solution space. In addition, we assign an indicator to each gene to reflect its strength within the chromosome that it belongs to, thereby a set of self-adaptive operations can be defined to enhance the algorithm’s stability and efficacy. Furthermore, we define a new “edge distance” to conserve the limited modification resource on the graph. In the experiment, the proposed method is tested against different community detection methods using various real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that SAEP improves significantly over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of effectiveness.},

By employing an integral reinforcement learning strategy, the system drift dynamics can be avoided in the learning process. Meanwhile, a critic neural network is designed to obtain the approximated value function and tuned by using the gradient descent approach. Furthermore, a novel dynamic event-triggering condition is designed to determine the occurrence of an event by introducing a dynamic variable. By using the Lyapunov theory, all signals in the closed-loop system are proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, we present a nonlinear interconnected system and an interconnected power system to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This article discusses a control problem of underactuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) subject to internal/external uncertainties, input saturations, and actuator faults, and proposes a novel event-triggered adaptive PID fault-tolerant (ETAPID-FT) control solution. To resolve the design difficulty caused by the underactuated feature, a standard multivariate integral cascade form regarding the mathematical model of underactuated ASVs is established. And then, to facilitate the implementation of PID-based design framework, the nonsmooth actuator saturation nonlinearity caused by the saturation constraint is represented by a smooth saturation model. In the control design, considering full features of the actuator fault and smooth function, an indirect neural approximation with single-parameter-leaning technique is developed, which endows the function of self-tuning control gain for the control solution. To relieve the mechanical wear of actuator, an improved event-triggered protocol by implanting a decreasing function of ASV’s position error is proposed. Moreover, the theoretical results show that the proposed ETAPID-FT control solution can guarantee the boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop control system of underactuated ASVs. Finally, the validity of the developed control solution is confirmed by the simulation and comparative results},

To tackle these obstructions, a fuzzy observer is introduced to address the difficulties of the unmeasurable states involving nonstrict-feedback nonlinear systems by benefiting from the approximation property of fuzzy logic systems. Owing to the newly employed damping term in the intermediate control law being utilized to compensate for the possibly unlimited number of faults, the proposed FTC strategy is able to deal with actuator faults properly without imposing tighter requirements on the fault mechanism. To reach fast transient performance, stability of finite time is reached by exploiting the backstepping method. The investigated strategy ensures that all the responses of the systems are semiglobal practical finite-time stable. Meanwhile, the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin within finite time. In addition, to demonstrate its effectiveness, the provided approach is applied to the position tracking of a robotic system, which shows anticipated control performances in spite of various uncertainties.},

Then, a collision-risk dependent, time-varying, event-triggered heterogeneous communication network topology is developed, where the agent starts obtaining information of the neighboring agents only when collision risks occur among them. Third, an anti-collision control law, which is composed of a switch function, a control force direction function, and a control strength function, is designed to guarantee the collision avoidance formation of multiagents. Fourth, to ensure the formation quality and save control cost of the multiagent system, an optimal formation control scheme with feedforward compensation is designed. Simulation results illustrate that: 1) by using the collision risk information of mobile agents, the proposed control scheme is effective to realize the collision avoidance optimal formation task and 2) the anti-collision formation controller can be implemented with incomplete information of the agents.},

The favorable positivity enables us to adopt a linear co-positive function as the Lyapunov candidate, and we construct the essential conditions for the existence of fuzzy SOF controllers in the form of bilinear programming (BP) problem. To provide a direct and generic algorithm for solving the BP problem, we propose a vital approximation strategy by which the general bilinear constraints are replaced with a sequence of convex surrogate ones. Recognizing the fact that a fundamental promise of the proposed successive linear programming algorithm is a feasible initial solution, we also develop an iterative procedure to calculate an initial controller gain.

  abstract     = {Although many methods have been proposed to solve expensive optimization problems (EOPs), they often consume hundreds of function evaluations (FEs) to find the optimal solution, which is unacceptable when facing highly EOPs. To reduce the number of FEs, we incorporate the population distribution into the well-known expected improvement (EI); thus, a new infill criterion called evolutionary EI (EEI) is proposed. In EEI, the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy is used to provide the population distribution. Compared with the original EI, EEI focuses more on promising regions provided by the population distribution, thus, reducing the FEs wasted in unpromising regions. By employing EEI as the infill criterion of Bayesian optimization, a new algorithm called EEI-BO is designed. Moreover, we also introduce an extended version of EEI-BO, called EEI-BO + , to handle multitask EOPs. To verify the effectiveness of EEI-BO, it is used to solve 10−, 20−, and 30-D test problems by using only 40, 50, and 60 FEs, respectively. The results show that EEI-BO is able to obtain high-quality solutions by consuming limited FEs. In addition, we apply EEI-BO to deal with the lightweight and crashworthiness design of the side body of an automobile. The results demonstrate that EEI-BO performs well on solving it. Furthermore, the performance of EEI-BO + is investigated by nine test problems. The results show that it has the capability to solve multitask EOPs with fast convergence speed.},

To preventing the catastrophic losses resulting from degraded failures or shock incurred failures, a spare unit for replacement is ordered at some time between the system’s initial operation and its undesirable failure. The average cost rate with lower-limit constrained availability is minimized to seek the optimal spare unit ordering time, in which the Kuhn–Tucker necessary condition is satisfied. As a comparison strategy, the expected cost effectiveness defined as the ratio of system availability to average cost rate is maximized to dynamically adjust the optimum ordering time of the spare unit.

Subsequently, under the composite hierarchical anti-disturbance control frame, a peak filter and a disturbance observer addition improve the anti-disturbance capability of the PI-based gimbal system at the frequencies of 0 $\sim $ 5 and 128 Hz. Notably, the proposed method has a relatively low order, which is appropriate for the processing power limit. Finally, the experimental results reveal that compared to three effective control schemes (PI, extended state observer-based composite controller, and PI-resonant controller), the proposed method can strikingly enhance the anti-disturbance ability and velocity-tracking performance of the gimbal system.},

  abstract     = {This work reports an adaptive path-following controller for a multijoint snake robot (MSR) to improve the adaptability of the robot to the environment. The new strategy estimates the time-varying parameters of the system and the external interference to adjust the motion state of the robot in real time. Estimations are used to compensate for the joint torque of an MSR, thus reducing the fluctuation peak of path-following errors. In addition, this work designs an anti-sideslip line-of-sight (LOS) guidance strategy to avoid the deviation of the direction angle. The method can improve the tracking accuracy of an MSR, and the position errors enable the system to achieve uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB). The angle errors converge to the origin to achieve stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the novel method can accurately estimate the time-dependent parameters, sideslip, and interference, raise the convergent speed of errors, and reduce the fluctuation peak.},

  abstract     = {In past decades, much progress has been obtained in vision-based robot control theories with traditional image processing methods. With the advances in deep-learning-based methods, convolutional neural network (CNN) has now replaced the traditional image processing methods for object detection and recognition. However, it is not clear how the CNN-based methods can be integrated into robot control theories in a stable and predictable manner for object detection and tracking, especially when the aspect ratio of the object is unknown and also varies during manipulation. In this article, we develop a vision-based control method for robots with an eye-in-hand configuration, which can be directly integrated with existing CNN-based object detectors. The task variables are generated based on parameters of the bounding box from the output of any real-time CNN object detector such as you only look once (Yolo). To address the chattering problem of bounding box, long short-term memory (LSTM) is used to provide smoothed bounding box information. A vision-based controller is then proposed following task-space motion control design formulation in order to keep the object of unknown aspect ratio in the center of field of view of the camera. The stability of the overall closed-loop control system is analyzed rigorously using the Lyapunov-like approach. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed CNN-based robot controller.},

Specifically, data-driven concurrent learning extended state observers (CLESOs) based on fuzzy systems are presented to estimate the unknown kinetics of USVs. With the proposed CLESO, a model-free path-following control law is proposed for a leader USV to follow a parameterized path. Then, model-free flocking control laws based on potential functions are proposed for follower USVs to avoid collisions and maintain network links within available communication ranges. Through cascade stability analysis, the closed-loop system is proven to be globally asymptotically stable. Simulation results substantiate the proposed CLESO-based anti-disturbance control approach for path-guided flocking of a swarm of USVs.},

  abstract     = {In Industry 5.0 vision, machines are empowered with the interaction capability to autonomously make local decisions and coordinate with each other as well as humans. However, how to form a group consensus on the rapid self-organizing of the manufacturing process is critical for achieving manufacturing resilience under disturbances and disruptions. Based on our formerly developed system ManuChain (Leng et al., 2020), this article proposes a blockchained smart contract system (BSCS), named ManuChain II, as the digital twin of a decentralized autonomous manufacturing system for achieving resilience in Industry 5.0. A blockchain-secured multiagent system architecture together with a product data model is established to form the BSCS. The BSCS could prevent tampering with data and enhance the transparency of the product manufacturing process. In BSCS, two types of blockchained smart contracts (SCs) are established with a bi-level interplay computing architecture. The lower-level contracts perform the predefined and learned patterns of task coordination for achieving resilience under internal disruptions. The upper-level contracts are incorporated with communication-efficient decentralized deep-learning algorithms for the learning, updating, transferring, and sharing of coordination patterns used in the autonomous decision in lower-level SCs, thereby achieving the continuous improvement of the system’s decentralized autonomous intelligence. Via incorporating the decentralized deep learning algorithms into blockchained SCs, this study reveals a new way to realize the self-organizing intelligence of the manufacturing system for enhancing resilience toward Industry 5.0.},

The proposed DETM further reduces data transmissions and also guarantees the exclusion of Zeno behavior. By resorting to a piecewise Lyapunov functional (PLF), sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that the resulting filtering error system is globally stochastically exponentially stable with the $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance in the presence of both DoS and DAs.

The influence of unknown items in the system can be eliminated by the adaptive NN control method. Moreover, the improved FT command filter is introduced to relax the restriction on the input signal and solve the explosion of complexity (EOC) problem. Meanwhile, the FT error compensation mechanism is developed to eliminate the influence of filtering error.

The traditional approach is to use discontinuous controllers which may cause a chattering phenomenon. How to achieve zero error consensus tracking via a chattering-free controller is still open. We propose a class of adaptive continuous controllers to achieve zero error consensus tracking for Lipschitz nonlinear MASs with a nonautonomous leader and directed communication topology. Unlike existing works that use discontinuous functions to eliminate the impacts of leaders’ inputs, we use a continuous function by introducing an exponential decay function into the denominator. First, we design a continuous controller with fixed coupling strengths and prove that zero error consensus tracking can be achieved if the coupling strengths are greater than some positive constants. Second, we design a continuous controller with dynamic coupling strengths under which fully distributed zero error consensus tracking can be achieved. Moreover, the case with undirected communication topology is studied. Finally, three examples are given to verify the theoretical results. Specifically, convergence results between the continuous controller here and that is developed via the boundary layer technique are compared. Compared with existing works, the designed adaptive continuous controllers here can not only achieve zero error consensus tracking but also is chattering free.},

By taking the communication overhead into account, an event-triggered mechanism is employed to alleviate communication burdens. The solution of the optimal control problem related to event-triggered Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equations is obtained within a simplified adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) framework. The key point is that a single network is introduced to successfully avoid the problem of repeated approximations in traditional dual networks. Note that the weight vectors in the single critic network are adjusted through experience replay (ER), which helps to avoid the restrictive persistence of excitation (PE) conditions. It is strictly proven that all the signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded, and the critic network weight can converge to optimal values.

Existing works have attempted to learn the diagnostic representation by capturing the lead-specific morphological variation of a multilead ECG signal. In this work, we have developed an attentive spatio-temporal learning network (ASTLNet) that can learn better diagnostic representation by exploiting the concurrent spatio-temporal variation of a multilead ECG signal. The ASTLNet consists of two modules, i.e., spatio-temporal representation learning (STRL) module and attentive spatio-temporal aggregation (ASTA) module. The STRL module is designed to learn the multiscale spatio-temporal representation, and the ASTA module is designed to aggregate the learned representation. Experiments on the three publicly available datasets, i.e., PTB, PTB-XL, and CPSC-2018, demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively learn the spatio-temporal variation of the ECG signal and gives superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

If a product is processed in a factory with a small logistics cost of its raw material, the logistics cost of the product delivered to the distributor may be large. If managers prefer the pair of equipment unit and worker with a high production rate, operational error rate may be large. Meanwhile, it influences the labor cost, raw material cost, and completion time of each product. Managers can assign the products of a type to several cells for processing. If a cell receives fewer products of a type, it can complete their processing and becomes available to process the products of other types. However, some cells receiving more products of this type may be delayed to handle the products of other types. If a type of product in a cell has a priority to be processed, its backorder cost may be none or reduced, but this schedule may delay other product types with lower priority in the cell, and give rise to their backorder cost. For solving the intertwined optimization problem, an improved bacterial foraging algorithm with a priority rule-based heuristic (IBFAP) is developed to maximize profit. Experiments are conducted to show that IBFAP outperforms the improved bacterial foraging algorithm with no heuristic, the classical bacterial foraging algorithm, genetic algorithm, and simulated annealing.},

  abstract     = {Frequency control is one of the critical systems responsible for maintaining grid stability, making it a vulnerable and attractive choice for cyber-attacks. This article presents a multivariate singular spectrum analysis (MSSA) for extracting the system’s dynamics under normal operation and proposes a projection-based distance tracking and hypothesis testing method to detect multiarea load frequency control (MA-LFC) attacks. The proposed methodology is robust, adaptive, and computationally efficient, especially, when system and measurement noises are considered. The three main features of the proposed method are that: 1) it uses standard SCADA data and does not require attack data; 2) it can be integrated with the existing grid control system with minimal hardware; and 3) it is independent of system configuration and upgrades. The attack detection algorithm can successfully detect different types of false data injection attacks (FDIAs), including stealth attacks on multiple sensors. The algorithm is tested on an IEEE 39-bus New England test system, 300 bus test system, and 1888 bus RTE system. The attack detection algorithm was found to be reliable, fast, robust, and scalable under noisy measurements compared to the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {A chiller plant is an essential part of a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system. Chiller plant operation planning is to determine the throughput of active chillers, pumps, and fans in a chiller plant to meet cooling load demands with minimized power consumption. Existing planning methods are limited to chiller plant operation with homogeneous devices subject to constraints for the conservation of energy or with heterogeneous devices without considering the conservation of energy. In this article, a mixed-integer optimization problem is formulated for chiller plant operation planning with heterogeneous devices to minimize power consumption subject to various constraints, including the constraints for the conservation of energy. The formulated problem is reformulated as a global optimization problem and solved via collaborative neurodynamic optimization with multiple projection neural networks. Experimental results based on equipment manufacturers’ specifications are elaborated to demonstrate the significantly higher performance of the proposed approach than four mainstream methods in terms of power consumption wattage.},

Time instant optimization MPC is utilized to compute when the measurement and actuation actions are to take place to coordinate them with the network dynamics. The time instants also minimize the burden of human operators by tracking their energy levels and scheduling the necessary breaks. Fuel consumption related to the operators’ travel is also minimized. The results in a digital twin of the Dez Main Canal illustrate that the new algorithm outperforms previous methods in terms of meeting operational objectives and taking care of human well-being, but at the cost of higher computational requirements.},

Different from the recent criteria reported in the literature, a set of operating modes is produced by employing the weighted ranking information of the available normalized fuzzy weighting functions. With regard to each enabled operating mode, its proprietary boundary information constraint is fully considered by means of introducing a class of cascade-type free variables, and thus the conservatism can be reduced to a large extent than before. More importantly, the applied variable weights for adjusting the range of different operating modes play an important role in further enlarging the estimated attraction regions.

  abstract     = {In this article, we establish an experience-correction (E-C) framework to deal with sampled-data fractional-order systems in the manner of general integer-order discrete-time model at sampling instants by coping with the memory effect. The designed E-C controller can be partitioned into local input and history input, respectively. Generated by current sampling, the local input is in a sense analogous to the input of integer-order system. In particular, the history input can correct all previous experience via incorporating earlier local inputs. Emphasize that the weights of earlier local inputs, norm of E-C controller together with corresponding sampling error are proved to descend to origin no slower than the Pareto function, i.e., $\mathcal {O}(t^{-\alpha })$ , where $\alpha $ represents the derivative’s order. Similar to the well-known forgetting curve, we witness a rapid decline in the proportion of earlier past in E-C controller, which is with respect to one of the memory failures: transience, the deterioration of memory with the passage of time. The closer the order $\alpha $ is to 1, the faster the forgetting is. The above analysis accounts for a phenomenon not previously understood: well-performed simulation results could still be expected in existing research who ignored memory effect and only considered local input. This is owing to the fractional orders are usually hypothesized to be larger than 0.5 and thus the weight of earlier past decays sharply over time. Furthermore, both absolute and proportional decline of earlier past’s weight will slow down when time goes by, which is consistent with memory consolidation and Jost’s law in psychology. Overall, the E-C method keeps an elegant formulation which theoretically describes the evolution of hereditary effect. Meanwhile, it is also suitable for first-order systems. Thereafter, we address related applications in fractional-order multiagent systems (MASs) subject to intermittent sampled-data communication. Numerical simulations are provided finally to substantiate the effectiveness of theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Cement has been widely used in civil engineering directly and plays a critical role in cement-based materials, e.g., concrete. As the microstructural evolution of cement hydration predominates the final physical properties, an accurate simulation of hydration is highly required to enable scientists to evaluate the performance and help design new cementitious materials. However, despite significant effort and progress, a satisfactory model to realistically and accurately simulate the evolution of three-dimensional (3-D) microstructure has not yet to be constructed, mainly because cement hydration is one of the most complex phenomena in material science. In this work, a novel near-realistic microstructural model is proposed to simulate the cement hydration system using deep learning and cellular automata. It is designed to break through the bottleneck of fidelity to real microstructural evolution. The dynamical system is constructed based on a 3-D cellular automaton, in which behavior is controlled by deep neural networks distilled from microstructural images. In addition, a dynamic stratified sampling method with variable capacity is proposed to ensure the representativeness of samples for reducing the computation cost of training. Experiments manifest that the simulated hydration is in accordance with the actual development in different aspects, such as near-realistic microstructure and approximate process. Furthermore, the constructed system also demonstrates promising generalization capability even under various conditions.},

For this reason, an appropriate class of polynomial generalized inverses is investigated. Moreover, it can be stated that the nonunique right $\sigma $ -inverse, based on properly selected so-called degrees of freedom (DOFs), outperforms the well-known unique Moore–Penrose (MP) minimum-norm right $T$ -inverse in terms of the energy consumption of perfect control (PC) input signals. However, the analytical confirmation of such an intriguing statement has only been established for the special class of the single-delayed plants with a zero reference value. Moreover, because of the complexity of the IMC, the objects with a time delay $d&amp;gt;1$ having a nonzero setpoint have never been analytically explored in regard to the PC energy context until now. Thus, the newly introduced analytical methods defined in this article allow us to designate the proper forms of $\sigma $ -inverse-related DOFs that guarantee the minimum-energy PCD for the entire set of LTI multivariable nonsquare systems with the delay $d \geq 1$ . Moreover, the new original results, supported by numerical examples, strongly contest the well-established control and systems theory canons related to the optimal minimum-energy-originated peculiarity of the MP pseudoinverse.},

First, adaptive almost passification is achieved by the design of adaptive controllers and a switching law dependent on state for the systems whose subsystems have the relative degree one, even if each subsystem is not adaptive feedback almost passive. Second, for the system with any relative degree, the constructive design methods of adaptive controllers and switching law dependent on state are provided to achieve almost passivity by recursive feedback almost passification technique.

  abstract     = {Discovering interesting yet unvisited point-of-interests (POIs) is among the most practical applications but challenging problems in location-based social networks (LBSNs). Popular approaches face several issues, such as data sparsity and difficulties in modeling latent nonlinearity between users and POIs. Furthermore, the uncertainty in LBSNs poses additional obstacles to learning good representations of users’ general and current interests. To effectively address these issues, we postulate that fusing multiple sources of information is paramount. Toward that, we propose a novel deep generative recommender system—Wasserstein autoencoder for POI recommendation (WaPOIR). It unifies the information from users’ personal preference, social influence, and geographical data, and captures users’ general interests from historical check-ins, while modeling users’ current interests from recently visited POIs. Unlike previous methods, WaPOIR learns the latent distribution of data in the Wasserstein space as a potential representation for each POI and each user in LBSNs. This enables simultaneous maintenance of social and POI interactions and modeling the uncertainty of their relationships. WaPOIR is a stochastic recommendation approach that allows Bayesian inference and approximation of variational posterior distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world LBSN datasets demonstrate that WaPOIR achieves better performance over the state-of-the-art approaches.},

Compared with existing relative-measurement-based formation maneuver control, the advantages of the proposed method are that it is output (relative output) feedback based and shows how to realize different types of formation shape. In addition, it can be applied to nongeneric and nonconvex nominal configurations and the leaders are allowed to be maneuvered.

First, the property of the designed continuous-time rule is analyzed to ensure that all agents’ strategies can reach the Nash equilibrium (NE). Then, we propose, respectively, periodic and event-triggered communication schemes for the discrete-time interactions among agents. The rule in the periodic case is implemented synchronously. The rule in the event-triggered case is executed asynchronously without Zeno behaviors. All agents in both cases can reach the NE asymptotically by interacting with neighbors at discrete times. Simulations are performed in networks of Cournot competition to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel approach to analyzing quasiperiodically driven dynamical systems. It presents a holistic data-driven framework for reconstructing such a system and gaining insights into its dynamical behavior. A quasiperiodically driven dynamics has two components: 1) the quasiperiodic driving source with generating frequencies and 2) the driven nonlinear dynamics. The driving dynamics are reconstructed by accurately computing a large number of Koopman eigenfrequencies, using techniques based on the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and from ergodic theory. Unlike Fourier analysis and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), the proposed framework can analyze systems/signals with nondominant or absent periodic components. The driven system is next reconstructed by continuing to use the RKHS framework. As a case study, we investigate data collected from a corridor of nine consecutive signalized traffic intersections. The proposed framework provides insights into generating frequencies and associated modes, accurately reconstructs the queue lengths at the signalized intersections, and makes stable long-term forecasts. The unique contributions of this article are spread across multiple domains. It includes the novel modeling framework for quasiperiodically driven systems, a computationally efficient approach able to handle a large amount of data, utilization of true Koopman eigenfrequencies, and an illustration of the proposed approach on a corridor of signalized traffic intersections.},

  abstract     = {This literature is concerned with fast finite-time adaptive consensus control for nonlinear nontriangular structured (NTS) multiagent systems (MASs) with uncertainty. In contrast to the existing finite-time schemes, the consensus control for NTS MASs has two design difficulties, reflected in the nonaffine characteristics of the control input and the algebraic loop from the direct backstepping. Moreover, due to the repeated utilization of necessary inequalities, the traditional adaptive framework is incapable of achieving the desired finite-time asymptotic consensus and only rests on satisfying the practical finite-time stability. To tackle such obstacles, a novel adaptive neural algorithm is discussed via the modified tuning function as well as the projection operator in this work. Under the fast finite-time stabilizer constructed, the error of the NTS MASs converges asymptotically to a preset range within the finite time. The flexibility of the algorithm is demonstrated by the simulation example.},

Recent results integrate the properties associated with dynamic coupling driving and structural mechanics to compute optimal smooth arm motions; however, when accelerating the convergence speed of potential solutions, those approaches cannot avoid premature convergence. In this article, we propose an autonomous motion planning method at the torque level for a class of robots considering multiple conflicting performance metrics. Specifically, we focus on the hyper dynamic manipulation of a golf swing robot using a knee-guided multiobjective optimization algorithm. Compared with traditional planning methods in position or velocity level, it can study motor performance limitations with strong nonlinear dynamic coupling beyond the motion limits designed by the manufacturers. First, the robot’s joint torque is approximated by the B-spline method using the solution at each iteration. Then, we transform the motion planning problem into a multiobjective optimization problem with soft constraints of torque limits and hard constraints of joint stops, and develop a knee-guided evolutionary algorithm to find the optimization solution with the quality tradeoffs between the scale of parameters and metrics. Finally, we conduct the simulation to demonstrate the dynamics performance of the golf swing robot. The results indicate that our approach can generate superior dynamics performance beyond limits with low energy consumption and high precision.},

Then, to derive the sufficient criteria, a novel ILF is proposed, which includes the available information about the sampling pattern characteristics from $\mathbf {x}(t_{k})$ to $\mathbf {x}(t)$ and $\mathbf {x}(t)$ to $\mathbf {x}(t_{k+1})$ together with the signal transmission delay. In addition, the ILF introduces a fractional parameter $0 &amp;lt; \hat {\beta } &amp;lt; 1$ that gives more information of splited sampling intervals. Also, the external disturbances of the proposed system are attenuated by using the $H_{\infty }$ performance.

In contrast to learning from observation-action pairs, humans learn to imitate in a more flexible and efficient manner: learning behaviors by simply “watching.” In this article, we propose a “watch-and-act” imitation learning pipeline that endows a robot with the ability of learning diverse manipulations from visual demonstrations. Specifically, we address this problem by intuitively casting it as two subtasks: 1) understanding the demonstration video and 2) learning the demonstrated manipulations. First, a captioning module based on visual change is presented to understand the demonstration by translating the demonstration video into a command sentence. Then, to execute the captioning command, a manipulation module that learns the demonstrated manipulations is built upon an instance segmentation model and a manipulation affordance prediction model. We validate the superiority of the two modules over existing methods separately via extensive experiments and demonstrate the whole robotic imitation system developed based on the two modules in diverse scenarios using a real robotic arm.

  abstract     = {This article considers the $H_{\infty }$ control problem of nonlinear systems having unavailable dynamics and asymmetric saturating actuators. Initially, such an $H_{\infty }$ control problem is converted into the zero-sum game with a nonquadratic cost function being introduced. Then, in order to solve the Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equation arising in the zero-sum game, a simultaneous policy iteration (SPI) algorithm is developed under the adaptive dynamic programming framework. Meanwhile, it is proved that the convergence of the SPI algorithm in essence amounts to the convergence of the sequential PI algorithm. To implement the SPI algorithm, the critic, the actor, and the perturbation neural networks (NNs) are, respectively, constructed to estimate the cost function, the control policy, and the perturbation. The three NNs’ weights are simultaneously determined by using the least-squares method together with the Monte Carlo integration technique. A remarkable characteristic of such an SPI algorithm is that arbitrary control policies and perturbations are applicable in the learning process. This makes system’s information be able to be replaced by the data collected along system’s trajectories in advance. More importantly, the persistence of the excitation condition is not required. Finally, simulations of two nonlinear examples are given to validate the present SPI algorithm.},

Contrary to the conventional high-gain-based ELBC design, this approach employs a disturbance estimate augmented stimulus which is not prone to excitation of mechanical resonance. Furthermore, in contrast to the existing SISO-based methods of estimator design, this approach considers key attributes, such as disturbance rejection, noise sensitivity, control signal chattering, and loop interaction associated with multiple loops of an MIMO system in an integrated manner. The parameters of the estimator are realized by minimizing a performance index that is representative of the weighted sensitivity and complementary sensitivity functions of the MIMO system. The approach is illustrated with four popular disturbance estimators. Experimental results on a laboratory-scale helicopter under dynamic wind gusts demonstrate its efficacy with respect to nominal ELBC design.},

Besides, considering the inaccuracy and perturbation of controller, a nonfragile control method is also adopted to design the controller. Then, instead of the general quadratic type of the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, a delay-product-type quadratic is presented by taking full advantage of the information of TVCDs, and the positive definite constraint in the entire time domain is weakened to the sampled instants on account of adopting the two-sided looped-functional approach. Furthermore, less-conservative consensus criteria for MASs are developed. By solving linear matrix inequalities, the desired control gain matrices and larger sampled-data periods are achieved.

Nexus analyses form a unique multiagent decision-making arena that requires using a system engineering approach to simultaneously improve food and water security as well as energy efficiency. To tackle the complexity in decision making within a FEW nexus with respect to dynamic behaviors and interactive logics, we model the FEW nexus as a multiagent system (MAS) under a mixed competitive and cooperative environment from the perspective of a Markov game. Then, we propose a fingerprint networked reinforcement learning (FNRL) framework for the collective learning of a MAS by following the logic flows of human decision making. FNRL can alleviate the problems caused by stationary issues in a MAS environment by integrating a long short-term-memory-driven neural network model into the context of multiagent reinforcement learning (RL) to extract fingerprint information via historical data. Numerical simulations for an urban FEW nexus analysis in Florida (USA) demonstrate that applying the FNRL framework can drive agents in the MAS toward achieving optimality via RL in a dynamic environment.},

  abstract     = {Preference learning, especially pairwise preference learning, is an efficient method for modeling implicit feedback in item recommendation. However, it is insufficient and not always valid to work for a basic pairwise preference model, which assumes that users prefer interacted (i.e., bought or viewed) items to un-interacted (i.e., not bought or not viewed) items. Recently, the state-of-the-art approaches have emerged as two separate but powerful methods, namely, pairwise preferences over item-sets and asymmetric pairwise preference models, respectively, to address limitations of the basic models. In spite of the success achieved by these methods, the assumption that the horizontal pairwise preference is with respect to two items does not always hold in asymmetric pairwise preference. Hence, it is appealing to integrate them into a uniform approach. In this article, we propose a novel symmetric pairwise preference assumption. We use a weighted average through a softmax function and define the overall preferences that can better discover users’ preference patterns. With the new assumption and the weighted average method, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm to improve the recommendation quality. Extensive empirical studies show that our new algorithms can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art and baseline methods over a number of public datasets.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning-based algorithms have been very successful in skeleton-based human activity recognition. Skeleton data contains 2-D or 3-D coordinates of human body joints. The main focus of most of the existing skeleton-based activity recognition methods is on designing new deep architectures to learn discriminative features, where all body joints are considered equally important in recognition. However, the importance of joints varies as an activity proceeds within a video and across different activities. In this work, we hypothesize that selecting relevant joints, prior to recognition, can enhance performance of the existing deep learning-based recognition models. We propose a spatial hard attention finding method that aims to remove the uninformative and/or misleading joints at each frame. We formulate the joint selection problem as a Markov decision process and employ deep reinforcement learning to train the proposed spatial-attention-aware agent. No extra labels are needed for the agent’s training. The agent takes a sequence of features extracted from skeleton video as input and outputs a sequence of probabilities for joints. The proposed method can be considered as a general framework that can be integrated with the existing skeleton-based activity recognition methods for performance improvement purposes. We obtain very competitive activity recognition results on three commonly used human activity recognition datasets.},

The major advantage of our approach are: 1) different niching methods and mutation strategies are integrated into the DE algorithm to assist evolution; 2) the diversity is maintained by utilizing the search characteristics of different niching methods at population level; 3) additionally, each individual is regarded as an agent, and three classical mutation strategies are used as the agent’s alternative actions; and 4) different state settings and reward function can be easily integrated into this framework. To verify the performance of our approach, 30 problems and 18 new NEs are selected as the test suite. The experimental results demonstrate that RL can facilitate the algorithm and improve the problem-solving ability.

A saturation model based on the Gaussian error function is applied due to the appearance of input saturation. The unknown disturbance is considered which can be solved by a disturbance observer. Also, to handle the problem of an unknown coefficient for the controller, the Nussbaum function is employed. Moreover, the radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs) are utilized to estimate unknown nonlinear functions. On account of the Lyapunov stability method and backstepping technique, adaptive laws are created and the desired distributed controller is designed which guarantees that the consensus errors can converge to prescribed values.

  abstract     = {Carpooling, a transportation service that encourages employees to pick up and drop off co workers while driving to and from work, has the potential to decrease the number of private cars used to commute, eases commuter traffic congestion, and reduce CO2 emissions. Despite this potential situation of severe traffic congestion in Japan, little work has gone into developing carpooling specifically for commuting with co-workers scenarios. To build a carpooling system that accommodates Japanese unique culture and regulations, receptivity, safety, and profitability would be essential success factors. A carpooling problem (CPP) is proposed in this article with a focus on safety to discover a safe route for each driver that picks up and drops off co-workers and drives to and from their workspace while avoiding high accident-frequency locations. The CPP defines the subsets of employees sharing each car and the routes the drivers should take to optimize and minimize the total distance. Accident location data define the risk and driving competence determined by the classification of driver’s license and grade of automobile insurance; then, a driver’s optimal route minimizes risk while decreasing the total distance sought in deriving the CPP. The effectiveness of the proposed CPP was demonstrated by an experiment using actual accident data. This article also reports the small-scale proof-of-concept (PoC) study conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed CPP and highlight issues with its practical application. Ten employees with five drivers and five co-workers commuted via carpooling for two weeks using a mobile application with the CPP developed independently. Through the questionnaire survey conducted after the PoC, we validated the need for carpooling. We also identified some challenges: safe map navigation, incentives for the driver, and adaptation to Japanese culture when the carpooling system is in practical use.},

This approach allows for determining the best (but also robust and practically achievable) closed-loop performance based on very popular and intuitive closed-loop quality factors. Training set can be automatically derived off-line using a number of different, diverse control performance indices (CPIs) used as discriminative features of the assessed control system. The proposed extended set of CPIs is discussed with comprehensive performance assessment of different ML-based classification methods and practical application of the suggested solution. As a result, a general-purpose CPA system is derived that can be immediately applied in practice without any preliminary or additional learning stage during normal closed-loop operation.

Furthermore, the desired SWT suddenly varies and its sign also changes because the direction of the steering wheel angle (SWA) often changes according to the driver. In this article, a neural network (NN) approximation-based adaptive nonlinear control (ANC) using reinforced gain (RG) for an EPS system is proposed to resolve the above-mentioned problems using an SWT model. The proposed control method employs an NN approximator, ANC, and RG. The NN approximator is designed to estimate the unknown complex nonlinear function in EPS modeling. The ANC is designed via backstepping to compensate for parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. Further, the RG is designed as a positive nonlinear function of the error to sufficiently suppress the error according to variations in the desired SWT and external disturbance. The RG increases to suppress the error at a rapid transient response, owing to the sudden change in the sign of the desired SWT and the external disturbance. Thus, a high gain (increased RG) is used only when necessary so that an unnecessarily high gain can be avoided.},

Two typical methodologies for solving this problem are the conventional model-based paradigm and the data-driven paradigm, particularly the widely used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method. However, both the model-based and data-driven paradigms encounter inherent drawbacks. In this paper, we present two novel general schemes that combine these two paradigms together in an online mode. Specifically, the two paradigms are combined in a parallel and a serial structure in these two schemes, respectively. In the parallel scheme, the outputs of the model-based and DRL-based controllers are lumped together. In the serial scheme, the output of the model-based controller is fed as an input of the DRL-based controller. The interpretation of the two combined schemes is suggested from a control-oriented perspective, where the parallel DRL controller is viewed as a complementary uncertainty compensator and the serial DRL controller is taken as an inverse dynamics estimator. Finally, comprehensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes, and the effectiveness is further verified by deploying our schemes to a physical experiment platform based on a set of three-wheeled omnidirectional robots.},

  abstract     = {Networked systems widely exist in the modern society, and these systems are always operated in the presence of attacks and errors. The robustness of a network indicates its tolerance against potential damages, which is crucial for the network’s normal functionalities. Damage models including malicious attacks and cascading failures have been considered in previous studies. And the mitigation on these two destructive damages has attracted increasing attention, both single-objective and multiobjective optimization techniques are proposed to enhance the robustness of networks. The main weakness of these methods is that the obtained results can only handle one type of damages, either malicious attacks or cascading failures. In this way, multiple independent realizations are evitable to acquire robust candidates against different damages, which omits the inherent complementarities between the optimization of different objectives. Also, the design of networks with comprehensive robustness (CR) against both the two destructive damages is still pendent. For improving the efficiency in optimizing networks considering multiple damage models, in this article, evolutionary multitasking optimization is introduced into the optimization of network robustness. A multifactorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA) for enhancing the CR of networks, called MFEA textsubscript CR, has been proposed. The algorithm is equipped with several dedicated genetic operators to find networks with robust structures against malicious attacks and cascading failures; meanwhile, the synergy between the optimization of the two objectives is exploited to improve the computational efficiency. Empirical studies demonstrate the competitive performance of ${\mathrm{ MFEA}}_{\mathrm{ CR}}$ over existing methods; the efficiency enhancement is remarkable via the simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the resilient dynamic event-triggered control issue of interval type-2 T-S fuzzy systems (IT2 T-S FSs) under denial-of-service (DoS) and deception attacks. A novel resilient dynamic event-triggering mechanism (DETM) and the corresponding fuzzy dynamic event-triggered controller are proposed to solve the stochastically exponential stability (SES) problem of concerned IT2 T-S FSs in the presence of DoS and deception attacks. Meanwhile, an aperiodic-sampling-based piecewise loop Lyapunov functional is constructed. It is shown that the resulting closed-loop IT2 T-S FSs can achieve SES, and under the piecewise loop Lyapunov functional, some relaxed conditions are derived. In addition, the derived results can apply to IT2 T-S FSs subject to DoS attacks, static event-triggered control, or dynamic periodic-sampling-based event-triggered control. Finally, the effectiveness of the achieved results is verified by a numerical simulation on one-link manipulator.},

First, an ideal nonlinear virtual reference setting learning law is presented in the outer loop of the control system to tune the reference setting. Such an ideal nonlinear learning law exists theoretically and is transferred to a linear parametric DDVRSL via iterative dynamic linearization (IDL). Next, an iterative adaptation law is proposed for the estimation of the parameters in the DDVRSL law subject to the nonlinear system which is also transferred into a linear form by using the IDL method. The iterative adaptation algorithm tunes the learning gains of DDVRSL law using input and output measurements, therefore improving the robust ability against uncertainties. The proposed DDVRSL-based PD control method does not require any exact mechanistic model knowledge. The convergence is proved via the contraction mapping principle, mathematical induction, and time-weighted norm. Further, the theoretical results are verified through simulations.},

Specifically, an artificial potential function (APF) method is employed to guide a collision-free trajectory, and then the constraints are satisfied via limiting the states within the safe invariant set. Furthermore, a simplified method is proposed to obtain the maximum bound of the Lyapunov-based invariant sets, which ensures input bounded and collision avoidance.

The idea lies in that when directly calling the complete optimization solvers used in the CBF method, such as CBF-based quadratic programming (CBF-QP), is computationally inefficient for complex tasks, the suboptimal solutions obtained from online learning techniques can be an alternatively reliable choice for ensuring both efficiency and control performance. By using the barrier-based interior point method, the original optimization problem with CBF constraints is reduced to an unconstrained one with approximate optimality. Then, Newton- and gradient-based continuous dynamics are introduced to generate alternative cheap solutions while ensuring safety. By further considering the lag effect of online tracking, a prediction term is added to the dynamics. In this way, the online cheap solutions are proven to exponentially converge to the time-varying suboptimal solutions of the interior point method. Furthermore, the safety criteria are established, and the robustness of the designed algorithms is analyzed theoretically. Finally, the effectiveness is illustrated by conducting two experiments on obstacle avoidance and anti-swing tasks.},

Aiming at describing the nonlinearities with parameter uncertainties in the studied system, the idea of interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy method is employed in the system modeling. A disturbance observer is developed to acquire the unknown disturbance, and the estimated value is implemented into the controller for neutralizing the influence of the disturbance. To further reduce the occupation of network resources, an event-triggered communication protocol with a dynamic threshold parameter is adopted, where the triggered condition can be adjusted adaptively as the evolution of the system states. Then, an appropriate fuzzy integral sliding motion is constructed based on the constructed system model and disturbance estimation. It is worth noting that the constructed fuzzy controller follows the idea of nonparallel distribution compensation, which improves the designed flexibility. In terms of fuzzy processing, by introducing the membership functions dependent method into the stability analysis, a series of relaxed criteria are established to ensure the global asymptotic stability for the closed-loop systems with $H_{\infty }$ performance level. Finally, two classical examples of circuit model and inverted pendulum model are extended to IT2 fuzzy idea, showing the rationality of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Generative adversarial nets (GANs) have enjoyed considerable success in computer vision and attracted much attention from recommender systems. However, due to the discrete nature of items, it is infeasible to graft GANs directly onto recommendation models. Although several methods have taken steps forward, their training processes are slow-convergent, time-consuming, or even unstable. This article proposes a novel framework named attentive adversarial collaborative filtering (AACF) and an efficient training strategy to improve GANs in recommender systems. There are two distinct novelties over previous work. First, AACF is a differentiable generative adversarial framework that introduces an attention mechanism and “virtual items” to bridge the gap between the generator and the discriminator. Owing to the intrinsic differentiability, AACF can be stably optimized with gradient descent methods. Second, the efficient training strategy substantially reduces computational complexity. It is capable of efficiently training and scaling up the AACF model to large datasets. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, fast convergence, stability, and scalability of AACF. Since our ideas are general in nature, they will open a path to stably and efficiently train GANs in the research areas with discrete data.

  abstract     = {Cooperative heterogeneous multirobot systems have attracted increasing attention in recent years. They use multiple heterogeneous robots to execute complex tasks in a coordinated way. The allocation of heterogeneous robots to cooperative tasks is a significant and challenging optimization problem. However, little work has gone into scheduling large-scale cooperative tasks with precedence constraints and multiple conflicting optimization objectives. Existing methods are insufficient to address the issue. We propose a multiobjective model and develop strength learning particle swarm optimization (SLPSO) to optimize multiple objectives. In this article, the problem is converted into a two-step problem of task permutation construction and robot subset selection. In order to coordinate with the time-extended property of the problem, SLPSO utilizes a hybrid encode scheme: an element-based representation for task permutations and a binary representation for robot coalitions. A strength learning strategy with heuristic information guides particles to enhance their best-performing objectives for improving swarm convergence. In addition, an estimation-based local search is developed to improve spare solutions for enhancing swarm diversity, which determines the search direction by estimating fitness improvements. Experimental results on thirty problem instances are elaborated to demonstrate that the proposed SLPSO significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of inverted generational distance and hypervolume metrics. The proposed SLPSO can obtain a set of high-quality and diversified solutions.},

  abstract     = {A sequential recommendation has become a hot research topic, which seeks to predict the next interesting item for each user based on his action sequence. While previous methods have made many efforts to capture the dynamics of sequential patterns, we contend that they still suffer from two inherent limitations: 1) they fail to model item transition patterns in an efficient and time-sensitive manner and 2) they are unaware of the importance of dynamically capturing social influence, resulting in suboptimal performance. We introduce a new concept dubbed socio-sequential recommendation, where the challenge mainly lies in dynamically modeling social influences and capturing item-to-item transition patterns in a time-sensitive manner. In light of this, we contribute a novel solution named GCARec (short for graph-augmented co-attention model), which takes into account the joint effect of dynamic sequential patterns and dynamic social influences. GCARec decomposes socio-sequential recommendation workflow into two steps. First, we adopt a light graph embedding module to model long-term user preference. Then, we propose a time-sensitive attention mechanism and a social-aware attention mechanism to capture dynamic patterns at sequential-level and social-level, respectively. Extensive experiments have been conducted on eight real-world datasets from different scenarios, demonstrating the superiority of GCARec against several state-of-the-art methods.

On the basis of the positivity property of the investigated system, the definition of linear $(q,r) - \alpha $ -dissipativity, utilizing the linear copositive storage functionals with linear supply rates, is first introduced. The switching among subsystems is orchestrated by a state-dependent switching policy that obeys prespecified dwell-time constraints. Second, in order to reduce the conservatism brought by the identical summation term functional for all positive subsystems, we propose a dwell-time-dependent linear copositive storage functionals involving summation terms which are diverse appearing in the functional. Then, less conservative criteria are developed to guarantee the system is strict $(q,r) - \alpha $ -dissipativity by resorting to the switching policy or the joint implementation of the switching policy and time-varying controllers for subsystems. Finally, the validity of the proposed techniques is illustrated through two examples, and the relationship among the minimum dwell time, performance index, and time-varying delay is also revealed.},

  abstract     = {The consistency of intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations (IFPRs) is an important requirement in handling the decision-making problems modeled with IFPRs. Multiplicative consistency and additive consistency are two common types of consistency of IFPRs. These types of consistency of IFPRs are developed in the form of mathematical formulas to satisfy the perfect rationality of decision makers. In real decision-making, the decision makers are generally of bounded rationality rather than perfect rationality due to their own preferences. In consideration of the decision-makers’ preferences, this article proposes a new type of consistency of IFPRs, which is named spatial bounded consistency. A spatial framework is constructed to characterize the relations of three IFPRs among three alternatives. The spatial transitivity of IFPRs is defined based on the restricted max-max transitivity of IFPRs. By following the spatial transitivity of IFPRs, the preferences of decision makers contained in IFPRs are described in two situations. Under the assumption that the preferences of a decision maker are according in handling similar decision-making problems, the historical IFPRs satisfying spatial transitivity are collected to represent decision-makers’ preferences. On this basis, the spatial bounded consistency of IFPRs is then developed. A multicriteria group decision-making (MCGDM) method is designed based on the spatial bounded consistency. A problem of selecting the supplier of breast puncture needle is analyzed to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the developed MCGDM method.},

  abstract     = {The distributed fault-tolerant (FT) consensus control problem of linear multiagents with disturbances is considered in this article. For undirected graphs, first, by introducing adaptive control coefficients, multiagent reliable control can be carried out fully distributed, removing the assumption that global information should be known prior. Furthermore, different from existing consensus FT studies, the limitation of continuous communication among agents is removed by developing an open-loop estimation and event-triggering mechanism (ETM). Particularly, distinct from some dwell-time methods that enforce an interevent time greater than zero at the expense of asymptotic stability, by introducing timer variables, positive interevent time and asymptotic stability can be guaranteed simultaneously by the proposed ETM in the absence of disturbances. Furthermore, a minimum positive trigger interval can be maintained for each agent even in the presence of disturbances, indicating the robustness of the event-triggered strategy. It is demonstrated that the suggested event-triggered control method performs reliable disturbance suppression for all agents in a completely distributed way with intermittent communication while excluding the Zeno behavior. Moreover, we try to generalize our results to directed strong connectivity. Finally, simulation examples are carried out to illustrate the efficacy of the suggested scheme.},

In this article, we present a mathematical programming formulation based on integer linear programming (ILP) to minimize rumor spread by blocking a subset of nodes (called blockers) in complex social networks modeled as a linear threshold model. We also propose a modified approach which solves the top- $k$ blockers problem with a reduced computational effort and formally proves that its performance is still optimal. Then, the presented method is evaluated for its effectiveness of containing rumor spread in four different networks and its performance is compared with a greedy-based and two centrality-based approaches. The experimental analysis shows that the ILP-based method outperforms the other three approaches and is applicable to large-scale networks.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the Internet of Things (IoT), increasing computing tasks are sinking to mobile edge networks, such as distributed learning systems. These systems benefit from the massive amounts of data and computing power on mobile devices and can learn qualified models on the premise of protecting user privacy. In fact, coordinating mobile devices to participate in computing is challenging. On the one hand, the heterogeneous performance of devices makes it difficult to guarantee computing efficiency. On the other hand, there are unreliable factors in the mobile network, which will destroy the stability of the distributed learning. Therefore, we design a three-layer framework called an edge-intelligence-based distributed learning system (EIDLS). Specifically, a novel multilayer perceptron-based device availability evaluation model is proposed to select devices with good performance. The evaluation model performs online learning and optimization according to the resources (CPU, battery, etc.) of devices. Meanwhile, we propose a dynamic trust evaluation algorithm to reduce the side effects of unreliable devices. The experimental results of some commonly used datasets validate that the proposed EIDLS dramatically minimizes the energy consumption and communication cost and improves the calculation accuracy and the stability of the system.},

Second, a novel description of deception attacks called SDAs is established that contains multiple attack functions switching based on the currently activated subsystem, which considers the characteristics of NSSs and can cause the most severe damage to system control performance. Due to the networks and the event-triggered scheme, the switching of SDAs does not coincide with the switching of subsystems and controllers, which pose a challenge to system analysis. Third, MSBT controllers are designed to suppress the control bumps induced by multiple sources, including asynchronous controller switching, event-triggering mechanism, and SDAs.

By designing modern automation techniques, smart buildings can significantly reduce energy consumption, protect the environment, and consequently improve quality of life. This article focuses on the automation of elevator scheduling, which is an NP-Hard problem, to reduce energy usage in smart buildings and improve users’ quality of experience. We propose an optimal mathematical model for the elevator scheduling problem using integer programming. We then propose a novel game-theoretic approach that captures interactions within the elevator system to reduce energy consumption and enhance user experience. We propose a request coalition formation game, where nonoverlapping coalitions of user requests are served by elevators to minimize their movements and energy consumption while reducing service time and stops for users. We analyze the performance of our proposed approach using the optimal solution as a benchmark and Nearest Car and Fixed Sectoring algorithms as rivals. The experiments show that our approach is significantly efficient in terms of energy consumption and service time, making it suitable for smart buildings.},

As an alternative, we propose an internal knowledge-based end-to-end model, enhanced by an attentive memory network for both answer selection and answer generation tasks by considering the full advantages of the semantics and multifacts (i.e., timescales, topics, and context). In detail, we design a long-term memory to learn the top- $k$ fine-grained similarity representations, where two memory-aware mechanisms aggregate the series of semantic word-level and sentence-level similarities to support the coarse contextual information. Furthermore, we propose a novel memory refinement mechanism with the two-dimensional of writing heads that offer an efficient approach to multiview selection of the salient word pairs. In the training stage, we adopt the transformer-based transfer learning skill to effectively pretrain the model. Experimentally, we compare the state-of-the-art approaches on four public datasets, the experimental results show that the proposed model achieves competitive performance.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies estimate human anatomical key points through the single monocular image, in which multichannel heatmaps are the key factor in determining the quality of human pose estimation. Multichannel heatmaps can efficiently handle the image-to-coordinate mapping task and the processing of semantic features. Most methods ignore physical constraints and internal relationships of human body parts, which easily misclassify left and right symmetrical parts as similar features. Some studies use RNNs on the top to incorporate priors about the structure of pose components and body configuration. Therefore, a novel top-down convolutional network is proposed to consider these priors during training, which can improve the robustness under complex field conditions in the wild. In order to learn the prior knowledge of human pose configuration, the hierarchy of fully convolutional networks (discriminator) is used to distinguish real poses from fake ones. Consequently, the pose network is inclined to make a pose estimation that the discriminator misjudges as true, which is reasonable in complex situations. The performance of the method is experimentally validated by pose estimation on the MS COCO human key point detection task. The proposed approach outperforms the original method and generates robust pose predictions, demonstrating efficiency by using adversarial learning.},

To this end, extended state observer (ESO) and nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) are integrated to estimate unknown disturbances and unmeasurable states. Moreover, the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) and prescribed performance function (PPF) are associated to keep the tracking errors within specified ranges and constrain all system states at all times. Then, an output-feedback prescribed performance control (PPC) algorithm with state estimation and disturbance compensation is developed.

For about all clustering algorithms, finding the Nearest Neighbors of a point within a certain radius ${r}$ (NN- ${r}$ ), is a critical task. For a high-dimensional dataset, this task becomes too time consuming. This article proposes a simple dimensionality reduction (DR) technique. For point ${p}$ in ${d}$ -dimensional space, it produces point $p^{\prime }$ in $d^{\prime }$ -dimensional space, where $d^{\prime } &amp;lt; &amp;lt; {d}$ . In addition, for any pair of points ${p}$ and ${q}$ , and their maps $p^{\prime }$ and $q^{\prime }$ in the target space, it is proved that $|p, q| &amp;gt; |p^{\prime }, q^{\prime }|$ is preserved, where $|,|$ used to denote the Euclidean distance between a pair of points. This property can speed up finding NN- ${r}$ . For a certain radius ${r}$ , and a pair of points ${p}$ and ${q}$ , whenever $|p^{\prime }, q^{\prime }| &amp;gt; r$ , then ${q}$ can not be in NN- ${r}$ of ${p}$ . Using this trick, the task of finding the NN- ${r}$ is speeded up.

  abstract     = {Palmprint recognition provides a potential solution for noninvasive personal authentication due to its excellent contactless property and user-security, and it has attracted tremendous research interest in recent years. However, most existing methods focus on intraspectral palmprint recognition, which requires gallery and probe images to be captured under similar illumination, and thus significantly limit its practical applications in open environments with variant illuminations. In this study, we present a spectrum-invariant feature learning method for cross-spectral palmprint recognition to address the problem that gallery and probe samples are captured under different spectra. First, the blockwise direction-based ordinal measure vectors are formed to represent the intrinsic information of palmprint images. Then, a unified feature projection is jointly learned to map two different spectra of palmprint images into a common feature space, in which the different spectral features have enhanced discriminative power by enlarging their variances while the intraclass features learned from different spectral images are similar. The proposed method can be easily extended to seek the unified spectrum-invariant representation of multiple spectral palmprint images, making it feasible to perform palmprint recognition crossing one spectrum to multiple spectra. Experimental results on two multispectral palmprint image databases demonstrate the promising effectiveness of the proposed method on cross-spectral palmprint recognition.},

Due to mining areas are often affected by adverse weather and environmental conditions (sand, dust, extreme cold, heavy snow, etc.), the efficiency and security of mining are low. As a new, efficient, prospective mode, Metaverse has been studied and successfully applied in various industries. However, there is still no research about its usage in mines. In this article, we apply Metaverse to mining and propose MetaMining. We present its definition and analyze the functions it could perform. Furthermore, we propose its development phases and architecture. Specifically, MetaMining is a mode, which aims to achieve high-efficiency, high-security mining in the physical world through the interaction between the physical world and the virtual world. Its development phases involve three steps: 1) digital twins; 2) digital natives; and 3) surreality. Its architecture consists of three components: 1) human world; 2) virtual mining system; and 3) physical mining system. In addition, we analyze key technologies and possible challenges in the construction of MetaMining.},

This problem is investigated in a framework of games-of-games (GoG), in which the conflicts between each network policymaker and the attacker are captured by a series of the Stackelberg games, while all network policymakers together compose a Nash game. First, the tolerable maximum attack magnitude is investigated and given implicitly. Then, we prove the existence of the gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE) under mild attacks bounded by the above magnitude. A Heuristic algorithm based on iterative geometric programming is proposed to seek the GNE of the above GoG, whose asymptotical convergence is verified. Correspondingly, a greedy Heuristic strategy for the malicious attacker to compromise the NoN topology is developed. The practicability and validity of the above theoretical results and algorithms are illustrated via a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {Evidence theory provides an effective representation and handling framework for uncertain information. However, the quantification for the uncertainty of mass function in this theory is still an unsolved problem. For two types of uncertainty involved in evidence theory, conflict, and nonspecificity, many measurement methods have been proposed on the basis of requirements of axiomatic conditions. However, these existing methods proposed to measure the uncertainty of mass function are of deficiencies more or less, such as low sensitivity, counter-intuition, dispute on maximum entropy, and so on. In order to overcome the above defects, a total uncertainty measure based on the plausibility function, named as plausibility entropy, is proposed in this article, which provides a new solution to measure the uncertainty of the mass function. By embodying the plausibility function and plausibility transformation of every singleton in the frame of discernment, the new measure enlarges the Shannon’s entropy of equivalent probability mass function obtained using the plausibility transformation, and establishes a quantitative relationship between uncertainty measure and Dempster’s rule of combination. Compared with existing uncertainty measures, the proposed plausibility entropy is more sensitive to changes in a mass function. It also satisfies many desirable axiomatic properties, including non-negativity, maximum entropy, probability consistency, monotonicity, and so on. Moreover, the relationship among axiomatic properties of uncertainty measures is also discussed in this article. Numerical examples and comparison are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed plausibility entropy.},

  abstract     = {Imbalanced vibration is an urgent yet challenging problem in active magnetic bearings (AMBs) rotor manufacturing due to the rotor mass imbalance effect. The virtue of active control in AMB systems lies in enabling substantial online mitigation of imbalanced vibrations. However, in practice, due to the lack of speed sensors in most of the existing AMB-rotor systems, efficient rotational speed feedback is still on the way. As a remedy, this article proposes a rotational speed sensor-free synchronous signal processor (SSP) with the double inputs: $x$ - and $y$ -axes direction displacement measurements of radial AMBs. The proposed SSP is capable of estimating the rotational speed and accordingly generating synchronous signals of the imbalanced vibrations by filtering noise in both directions. Such signals are afterward implemented as a feedforward compensator for eliminating the periodical imbalance effects. With the assistance of the Lyapunov theory, the conditions of the proposed SSP method together with the feedforward imbalance compensator are derived to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop AMB-rotor system. Extensive experimental results substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SSP method in terms of imbalanced vibration suppression.},

Despite that, some classical control problems such as following a trajectory are still open. A typical solution is to compensate the system dynamics with feedback loops. However, this solution increases the effective robot stiffness and jeopardizes the safety property provided by the compliant design. On the other hand, purely feedforward approaches can achieve good tracking performance while preserving the robot intrinsic compliance. However, a feedforward control framework for robots with passive elastic joints is still missing. This article presents an iterative learning control algorithm for purely feedforward trajectory tracking for compliant underactuated arms. Each arm is composed of active elastic joints and a generic number of passive ones connected through rigid links. We prove the convergence of the iterative method, also in the presence of uncertainties and bounded disturbances. Different output functions are analyzed providing conditions, based on the system inertial properties that ensure the algorithm applicability. Additionally, an automatic selection of the learning gain is proposed. Finally, we extensively validate the theoretical results with simulations and experiments.},

In this work, we present a solution to this problem by using neural network (NN)-based adaptive control embedded with the robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) technique. Most existing prescribed performance control (PPC) can only ensure uniformly ultimately bounded stability, and the RISE-based control, although capable of achieving asymptotic stability, does not guarantee transient behavior (especially, when the system is in strict-feedback form with saturated input). Here, in this study, we make use of NNs to accommodate the unknown nonlinearities, where the NN approximation error, together with other uncertainties, is fully compensated by using a RISE unit. The constraints imposed on the inputs are addressed by the hyperbolic tangent function, resulting in a solution capable of guaranteeing asymptotic tracking with prescribed transient performance, in the presence of mismatched modeling uncertainties and actuation saturation. A numerical simulation is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Due to the limited transmission capacity and communication resources, a uniform quantizer and an event-triggered mechanism (ETM) are considered to economize energy consumption. An ETC protocol based on the quantized relative state is designed to resist malicious DoS attacks. Then, sufficient conditions to guarantee the practical consensus of MASs are derived with finite data transmission rates, and the tolerance of DoS attack frequency and duration are given.

Sensor resolution, which serves as an important index in determining measurement accuracy, is taken into account in the addressed filtering problem, and the sensor-resolution-induced uncertainty is tackled by using an upper-bounding technique. The RRP is employed to regulate the order of signal transmission in order to relieve communication overhead. In the case of measurement outliers, a tailored saturation function is dedicatedly introduced to the filter structure for the purpose of suppressing the outlier-corrupted innovations, thereby maintaining satisfactory filtering performance. By solving a matrix difference equation, an upper bound is first acquired on the error covariance of the devised filter, and the associated filter parameters are subsequently determined through minimizing the acquired bound. The validity of the developed variance-constrained filter design approach is thoroughly demonstrated via two simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {Timed continuous Petri nets (TCPNs) are continuous-state dynamical systems that were originally defined to approximate the behavior of timed discrete event systems. In particular, it has been shown in the literature that TCPNs approximate the average marking and throughput of a class of generalized stochastic Petri nets (GSPNs), a well-known model used for the performance evaluation analysis of manufacturing, communication, logistic and traffic systems, among others. In this work, the TCPN model is enriched with immediate transitions, which represent very fast events, resulting in a new model denoted as TCPN+I. Then, a fast simulation algorithm for TCPN+Is is introduced. Nevertheless, the introduction of continuous immediate transitions leads to ill-conditioned problems when analyzing the TCPN+I model. For such reason, a couple of procedures are, here, introduced to transform a TCPN+I model into a set of dynamically equivalent TCPNs, by removing the immediate transitions, allowing, thus, the application of analysis techniques and methods already proposed in the literature for TCPN systems. The application of the results introduced in this work for performance evaluation and model predictive control is illustrated through a manufacturing example.},

However, conventional deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) for collision-free navigation can only perceive a fixed number of dynamic obstacles, and thus it cannot adapt to the stochastic working scenario. To overcome the limitation, an improved DDPG algorithm is proposed in this study. It is an exploration to implement the DDPG with long short-term memory (LSTM) network-based encoder to achieve dynamic obstacle avoidance for the mobile robot in the stochastic working scenario, which can encode the variable number of obstacles into a fixed-length representation. Specifically, to facilitate the LSTM network-based encoder, one safe processing rule is designed to guarantee the entire information of the observable obstacles can be represented completely. The LSTM network-based encoder takes the latest environment information of observable obstacles by employing the safe processing rule and generates the fixed length state vector. In addition, continuous state space for mobile robot and obstacles, as well as reward function and action space are designed. Both simulations and experiments are conducted and the results verify that the improved DDPG algorithm can achieve collision-free trajectory with multiple dynamic obstacles well. It helps to reduce the path distance and motion time effectively.},

The dynamics of the agents in each topology are completely unknown and the desired trajectory information is only communicated to a subset of agents. First, the unknown nonlinear dynamic of each agent is transformed into an equivalent time-varying linearized model by utilizing the dynamic linearization method. Then, by considering the prescribed performance, a strictly increasing function is given to transform the constrained tracking error condition of the nonlinear MASs into an equivalent unconstrained error condition. Meanwhile, a new control protocol that only uses the input and output data of the agents is designed in the case of fixed or switched topologies. The proposed method can not only guarantee the bipartite consensus but also ensure the bipartite tracking error always converges to the prescribed region. Moreover, the designed control parameters can be adjusted appropriately to obtain better tracking performance. Finally, the convergence of bipartite consensus tracking error is guaranteed through rigorous theoretical analysis. The control scheme is further verified by two examples.},

This article aims to suppress the effects of estimation errors and improve disturbance-suppression performance. Taking the errors to be an artificial disturbance, several other EID compensators are connected to suppress the disturbance. Simplifying the connected EID compensators yields the design of a parameter, $p$ , in the conventional EID estimator. Based on such an idea, this article presents a parallel-EID (PEID) approach, which has many merits. The disturbance-suppression performance of this approach is better than that of previous related studies, while its configuration is simple and universal. The physical meaning of $p$ is clear and explains the reason why the disturbance-suppression performance improves. Furthermore, this article designs a novel virtual filter for transforming the PEID-based control system into an equivalent configuration that is easy to derive stability conditions. Finally, the PEID approach is applied in controlling the speed of a permanent magnet synchronous motor. Additionally, comparisons between the conventional EID, improved EID, PEID, and modified EID approaches show the validity and superiority of the PEID approach.},

In order to solve the full-state constraints problem, the state transformation technique is employed with avoiding “feasibility conditions.” For overcoming the “explosion of complexity” problem of the backstepping method, an FFTF is constructed, where the filter error can be ensured to achieve fixed-time stability. In the light of Lyapunov theory, it is proved that all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded, all states are kept in their constraints, and output error converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood around zero in fixed time.

The proposed observer is composed of a set of predictor-based observers connected in series, and each elementary observer is only responsible for compensating the effect of a fraction of the total delay. By using the disturbance compensation technique, we design a sampled-data composite controller to attenuate the influence of external disturbance. The proposed control method can handle the multirate case where the sensor and controller have different sampling and updating rates. It shows that under the proposed control method, the disturbance rejection ability of the control system can be effectively improved in the presence of arbitrary large input and output delays.

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) and especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have revolutionized the way we approach the analysis of large quantities of data. However, the largely ad hoc fashion of their development, albeit one reason for their rapid success, has also brought to light the intrinsic limitations of CNNs—in particular, those related to their black box nature. In addition, the ability to “explain” both the way such systems behave and the results they produce is increasingly becoming an imperative in many practical applications. Therefore, it would be particularly useful to establish physically meaningful mechanisms underpinning the operation of CNNs, thus helping to resolve the issue of interpretability of the processing steps and explain their input-output relationship. To this end, we revisit the operation of CNNs from first principles and show that their very backbone—the convolution operation—represents a matched filter which examines the input for the presence of characteristic patterns in data. Our treatment is based on temporal signals, naturally generated by physical sensors, which admit rigorous analysis through systems science. This serves as a vehicle for a unifying account on the overall functionality of CNNs, whereby both the convolution-activation-pooling chain and learning strategies are shown to admit a compact and elegant interpretation under the umbrella of matched filtering. In addition to helping reveal the physical principles underpinning CNNs and providing an intuitive understanding of their operation, the treatment of CNNs from a matched filtering perspective is also shown to offer a platform to support further developments in this area.},

The fading communication introduces multiplicative randomness to the transmitted signals, which leads to the biased available information. A direct correction mechanism is employed using statistics of the communication channel. A learning control scheme is then proposed with a decreasing gain sequence to ensure steady convergence in the presence of various types of randomness.

First, considering the coexistence of the attack sequence and triggering sequence, the actual affected period and actual safe period are analyzed and defined. It provides an analysis model for the subsequent algorithm design. Then, by designing switched system dynamics along with hybrid-triggering concept, a novel distributed secure dispatch strategy is presented. The proposed method can enable each distributed generator (DG) to reasonably use estimation values and switched rate of system evolution to mitigate the effect of the DoS attacks. Meanwhile, contributed by the designed hybrid-triggering communication strategy, the proposed method takes advantages of reduced communication costs, flexible execution, and fast and reliable communication recuperation among DGs. With those efforts, the proposed method is capable of high robustness to resist the DoS attacks well. Moreover, theoretically analytic results are proposed to verify the correctness of the proposed method.

Second, a stride reward function is proposed to improve the stability of the learning process by modeling the distance and movement distance of joint constraints. Finally, in order to further improve learning efficiency, we are inspired by the cognitive process of human behavior and propose a stage incentive mechanism, including a hard-stage incentive reward function and a soft-stage incentive reward function. Extensive experiments show that the soft-stage incentive reward function is able to improve the convergence rate, get higher mean reward and lower standard deviation after convergence.},

This is the first time a comprehensive analysis and synthesis method for the ADRC of NSSs has been proposed. The technical contribution is mainly divided into two categories. On the one hand, a novel parameter-dependent switching constraint is proposed, which solves the problem of ADRC-based switching law construction and settles the complex coupling between switching, event-triggering, and ADRC components. On the other hand, triggering the output of linear extended state observer (LESO) rather than its input can result in a more accurate estimation, while reasonably configuring network resources. Accordingly, a new tight bound of the high gain adjustment parameter of the observer was obtained. In addition, the stability analysis and state convergence region calculations for switched ADRC systems are given. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposal is demonstrated by simulation.},

  abstract     = {In this article, an event-triggered adaptive control strategy is proposed to achieve the leaderless-following consensus for a class of cyber–physical systems under the direct topology. Because the deception attacks, state time delay, and unknown external disturbance appear simultaneously, the existing method is hard to apply directly. The difficulty of this issue lies in that the actual system states are unavailable and control efficiencies are unknown, which caused by the deception attack. So as to tackle these knotty problems, the Nussbaum gain functions are employed to replace the control gains, and the available compromised system variables are applied in the controllers. In addition, the proposed disturbance observer based on the compromised state further improves the robustness of the system. To eliminate the influence of state time delays, the appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals are used in the backstepping design process. Moreover, the computation and communication burden is dramatically decreased than by adopting the event-triggered mechanism and less adaptive laws. The boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system is guaranteed via the Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, the simulation results are provided to demonstrate the availability of the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {For real-world automated manufacturing systems (AMSs), the failures of multiple unreliable resources are very common. Maximal permissiveness is a key aspect for evaluating the performance of robust control strategies of failure-prone AMSs. However, there exist fewer works in the existing literature that can achieve maximally permissive robustness analysis. This may impede the applicability of existing robust control strategies in realistic AMSs. This article tackles the issue in the paradigm of Petri nets (PNs). We present an innovative mechanism to formalize unreliable resource failures by preventing all ingoing transitions of unreliable resource places from firing. Both reachability graph-based and integer linear programming-based methods are proposed to analyze the robustness of AMSs with either single or multiple unreliable resources. Several examples are proposed to illustrate the approach.},

However, the lecturers’ sense of space immersion has been ignored in current virtual teaching systems. In this article, we explore the cyber–physical–social intelligence for Edu-Metaverse in cyber–physical–social space and specially design a lecturer-centered immersive teaching system, taking the social and lecturers’ factors into consideration. We call this system VirtualClassroom (V-Classroom). Specifically, we first introduce the cyber–physical–social system (CPSS) paradigm of V-Classroom so that the workflow is standardized and significantly simplified, and the systems can be constructed with off-the-shelf hardware. The key component of V-Classroom is a cyber-world representation of a physical-world classroom instrumented with sparse consumer-grade RGBD cameras for capturing the 3-D geometry and texture of the classrooms. We provide each V-Classroom lecturer with a physical device for sending 6DoF view-change messages and showing view-dependent content of the remote classroom. Following the above paradigm, we develop the V-Classroom algorithms, including V-Classroom depth algorithm (V-DA) and V-Classroom view algorithm (V-VA), to achieve the real-time rendering of remote classrooms. V-DA is dedicated to recovering accurate depth information of the classrooms while V-VA is devoted to real-time novel view synthesis. Finally, we illustrate our implemented CPSS-driven V-Classroom prototype, based on real-world classroom scenarios we collected, and discuss the main challenges and future direction.},

  abstract     = {Effective road maintenance can not only achieve a balance between limited resources and long-term high-efficiency performance of road but also reduce the loss of life and property caused by road damage to vehicles and pedestrians. Due to the lack of a multidimensional dynamic monitoring system and enough extremely special data, the existing road maintenance system cannot accurately assess the road surface condition and provide timely early warning of sudden road damage. In this article, the M-RM system is proposed, that is, a metaverse-enabled road maintenance system based on cyber–physical–social systems (CPSSs), which fully utilizes the social and artificial system information of CPSS, as well as the simulation, monitoring, diagnosis and prediction functions of road systems in the virtual world of the metaverse. Then, in the road damage detection of system model in the virtual world, for the virtual data of the core assets of the metaverse, we propose an adaptive and information-preserving data augmentation (AIDA) algorithm-based nonclassical receptive field suppression and enhancement, an algorithm developed from human visual cognition. This algorithm enables the generation of a large amount of scarce fidelity data and avoids the introduced noise from impairing the performance of nonaugmented data. Finally, a crack detection algorithm named pay attention twice (PAT) is proposed, which uses the generated virtual data for training, and achieves secondary attention to high-frequency targets by fusing frequency-division convolution and mixed-domain attention mechanism. The detection performance of small targets in uncertain environments is enhanced. The metaverse system built in the current research can not only be used for road maintenance but also empower the traffic metaverse by using the traffic flow prediction module embedded in the algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can be applied to the road damage detection task under different noise and weather conditions, and the performance outweighs other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

By constructing a sliding function with one-step-memorized state information, a fuzzy sliding mode resilient controller is designed, whose membership functions (MFs) dependent on the compromised triggered state do not require the same fuzzy rules as the fuzzy system. Furthermore, by employing the global bounds of mismatched MFs, the co-design conditions for the AETS and the fuzzy controller are derived for attaining both the reachability and the stability.

This article proposes an optimal ILC algorithm for linear time-invariant multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) systems with nonuniform trial lengths under input constraints. The optimal ILC framework is specifically modified for the nonuniform trial length problem, where the primal–dual interior point method is introduced to deal with the input constraints. Hence, the constraint handling capability are improved compared with the conventional counterparts for nonuniform trial lengths. Also, the monotonic convergence property of the proposed optimal ILC algorithm is obtained in the sense of mathematical expectation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified on the numerical simulation of a mobile robot.},

Existing work focuses on a dynamic evolution method for such groups in a highway scene only. Its outcomes cannot be directly used to an urban scene due to different environmental factors, incomplete dynamic evolution events, and lack of simulation evaluation with real road networks. In this work, we present a dynamic evolution method for such groups in an urban scene. First, we analyze their dynamic evolution reasons. Then, we abstract five dynamic evolution events, i.e., joining, leaving, merging, splitting, and disappearing, and introduce a dynamic evolution method to process them. Finally, we deduce the evolvability that can reflect dynamic evolution states of a vehicle group. The simulation results in synthetic and real urban scenes show that the connectivity, coupling, timeliness, and evolvability of vehicle groups using the proposed dynamic evolution method are higher than those of using a dynamic evolution method for a highway scene.},

  abstract     = {In most industrial processes, some measurements are sampled frequently while other measurements are available infrequently and often slow rate. To utilize the slow rate measurements better for improving the accuracy of estimation, this article proposes a powerful unifying estimation framework for Markovian jump linear systems with multirate measurements based on the transfer learning strategy. Specifically, the form of knowledge transferred is designated as the observation predictor derived using the slow rate measurements. We define the universal evaluation of relatedness between the distribution transferred knowledge and ideal posterior distribution from the perspective of Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence. A smoothing method is then proposed to compute one-step-behind posterior estimates of the state since the estimates obtained using the slow rate measurements are less than the fast ones. Based on this, an iterative transfer state estimator that includes the transferred observation predictor derived using the slow rate measurements is developed, whenever the slow rate measurements are available. Finally, a moving-target example and an experiment with GPS tracking for the ship-board echo sounder show that the proposed approach can be regarded as a competitive alternative of various existing fusion methods when slow rate measurements arrive.},

Therefore, a new scenario-based robust remanufacturing scheduling problem was investigated in this study, and a robust optimization model for this problem was established. In the proposed model, a discrete scenario set is used to describe the uncertain arrival time and uncertain processing time of end-of-life products, and the variable start-up batch size constraint is considered to improve the practicality and flexibility of the model. To solve this model, an improved biogeography-based optimization algorithm with a new three-dimensional unequal-length representation scheme is proposed, in which, new migration and mutation operators, a local search strategy, and a new batch promotion mechanism are designed to improve the algorithmic performance.

After that, we present several solutions to tackle the application challenges and fully exploit the superior characteristics of PVITS while attenuating their negative side effects.

  abstract     = {Exponential stability is often used to barricade stochastic disturbance in visual trajectory tracking of a robotic system. In this work, a nonlinear mathematical model to deal with the exponential stability of visual trajectory in the I-cub robot is developed. The main contributions of this article are: 1) exponential stability is studied for the first time in the literature for the neutral fractional stochastic differential equations (NFSDEs) driven by mixed Brownian motion (Bm) and subfractional Bm (sub-fBm); 2) existence and stability results are derived based on the Banach contraction principle, semi-group theory, and fractional calculus in stochastic settings; 3) stability results of mixed Bm and sub-fBm are established and applied to avoid dense environment stochastic disturbance in the visual trajectory of the I-cub robot; and 4) stability of sub-fBm is entrusted in the dense environment even in small particles from the shorter length. A weak solution of the proposed result ensures a sufficiently smooth solution of the considered robotic system. The obtained results are new and innovative in the sense that the proposed algorithms have several advantages for gaze shift framed to the I-cub robot, including helping to maintain the fixation of eye movement in the microscopic laboratory. Furthermore, the results are used to enhance the performance of decreasing rendering gaze shift to achieve high-quality visual tracking.},

  abstract     = {Due to demographic change, health and elderly care systems are facing a shortage of qualified caregivers. This issue can be addressed by introducing welfare robots into people’s homes, hospitals, and care institutions. To provide useful support, such robots must adapt to individual users and smoothly interact with them. From this perspective, we present advances on the development of proactive control for online individual user adaptation in a welfare robot guidance scenario, with the integration of three main modules: 1) navigation control; 2) visual human detection; and 3) temporal error correlation-based neural learning. The proposed control approach can drive a mobile robot to autonomously navigate in relevant indoor environments. At the same time, it can predict human walking speed based on visual information without prior knowledge of personality and preferences (i.e., walking speed). The robot then uses this prediction to continuously adapt its speed to individual users in a proactive online manner. We validate the performance of the proposed proactive robot control in different real-world environments with various users, including an elderly resident of a Danish elderly care center. The results show that the robot successfully and smoothly guided various users of different ages and average walking speeds (e.g., 0.2 m/s, 0.7 m/s, and 1.1 m/s) to target locations over distances of 25–60 m. All in all, this study captures a wide range of research from robot control technology development to technological validity in a relevant environment and system prototype demonstration in an operational environment (i.e., an elderly care center).},

In the present problem setting, not only the controlled ASM but also the corrective controller itself is vulnerable to transient faults. The fault outcome is aggravated when the transient fault occurs to the controller, since the adverse effect of the fault is propagated toward the controlled ASM. We first address a scheme of diagnosing transient faults by designing the state observer that induces the resultant faulty state based on the output burst. We then present the existence condition and design algorithm for a corrective controller that recovers the normal behavior of the closed-loop system against transient faults at the ASM, while achieving self-repair against those faults occurring to the controller. Hardware experiments on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) circuits are provided to validate the applicability of the proposed control methodology.},

Currently, the cost of making individual decisions and the similarity between experts’ decision behaviors are relatively less addressed in the social network decision process. Therefore, in this study, a consensus approach with the trust relationships and adjustment cost is proposed to fill in such a gap. The method is divided into three stages: 1) trust propagation; 2) weight allocation; and 3) consensus reaching. In the trust propagation phase, uninorm is extended to the uncertain theory and employed in the transmission and integration problems of trust relationships. In the weight allocation stage, the comprehensive weight is assigned based on network structure and strength of relationship. In the consensus-reaching process, two levels of consensus are considered: 1) consensus among individuals and 2) consensus between individuals and the collective group, and chance-constrained programming models are constructed to obtain collective decision opinions. Moreover, a comparative analysis is performed to clarify the effectiveness and advancement of the proposed consensus method.},

In the proposed approach, the general optimal control problem is formulated into the game-theoretic framework by treating the event-triggering threshold and the optimal control policy as players. A cost function is defined and a value functional, which includes the delayed system output, is considered. First, by using the value functional and applying stationarity conditions using the Hamiltonian function, the output game delay algebraic Riccati equation (OGDARE) and optimal control policy are derived when the internal system dynamics are available. Then to relax the knowledge of internal dynamics, a hybrid learning scheme using measured output is proposed for tuning the value function parameters, which in turn is employed to compute the estimated optimal control policy. The overall closed-loop system is shown to be asymptotically stable by selecting an appropriate event-triggering condition when the dynamics of the system are both known and partially uncertain. A simulation example is given to substantiate the efficacy of the theoretical claims.},

Indeed, dynamic-structure GSPNs still rely on old-fashioned techniques often causing the state-space explosion problem. In this article, we present a new technique for the quantitative analysis of a dynamic-structure formalism called reconfigurable GSPNs without computing the whole state space. This work describes new reconfiguration forms used to preserve desired quantitative properties of parts of interest after each reconfiguration. Therefore, it is only required to verify the examined properties at an initial configuration. The proposed technique is proven to effectively reduce the state space and shorten the computation time in such cases.

We propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) technique to provide the model information about instance segmentation uncertainty from overhead images. Our SSL approach improves object detection by employing a test-time data augmentation and a regression-based, rotation-invariant pseudo-label refinement technique. Our pseudo-label generation method provides multiple geometrically transformed images as inputs to a convolutional neural network (CNN), regresses the augmented detections generated by the network to reduce localization errors, and then clusters them using the mean-shift algorithm. The self-supervised detector model is used in a single-camera tracking algorithm to generate temporal identifiers for the targets. Our method also incorporates a multiview trajectory association mechanism to maintain consistent temporal identifiers as passengers travel across camera views. An evaluation of detection, tracking, and association performances on videos obtained from multiple overhead cameras in a realistic airport checkpoint environment demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our results show that self-supervision improves object detection accuracy by up to 42\% without increasing the inference time of the model. Our multicamera association method achieves up to 89\% multiobject tracking accuracy with an average computation time of less than 15 ms.},

However, these methods mainly allocate computational resources based on the convergence improvement under the decomposition-based framework, which may become ineffective with the increased number of optimization objectives. To address this problem, this article suggests an immune-inspired resource allocation strategy, which breaks through the decomposition-based framework and can better balance convergence and diversity for many-objective optimization. In our method, the diversity distances of solutions are defined by the Euclidean distances of their projected points on the unit hyperplane. Then, based on the diversity distances, resource allocation is realized by using an immune cloning operator to encourage exploring sparse regions of the search space. Moreover, to provide high-quality solutions in coordination with this immune cloning operator, a novel archive update mechanism is designed. When compared to most well-known resource allocation strategies, our method is advantageous for many-objective optimization. The experimental results also validate the superiority of our method over several state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms for solving two sets of complicated MOPs having 5 to 15 objectives.},

With different wafer processing parameters, MPMs may be set for processing multiple operations together or processing just a single operation to form different schedules so as to maximize the productivity. Thus, it is highly desired to find an efficient scheduling method to quickly adapt to wafer processing parameter changes for productivity maximization by taking the advantages of MPMs. To tackle this issue, a deadlock-free Petri net (PN) model is developed to describe the behavior of a single-arm cluster tool. Based on the evolving mechanism of the PN model, two algorithms are developed to calculate the makespan for completing a given number of wafers.

First, sufficient criteria for designing non parallel distribution compensation (non-PDC) fuzzy controller to improve driving comfort level and guarantee corresponding suspension constrained requirements are presented. Then, in the context of ensuring stability of studied systems, considering the feasible areas of membership functions (MFs) of non-PDC controller, a new MFs online optimization strategy is built for fuzzy suspension systems for the first time. By this proposed novel optimization algorithm, the values of controller MFs (CMFs) can be updated in real-time so as to obtain a better driving comfort level while improving suspension-constrained requirements. Sufficient criteria is obtained to guarantee the convergence of the designed cost function with the help of the Lyapunov stability theory.

Then, with the introduction of an event-triggered mechanism used for saving bandwidth, the formulated problem is transformed into solving an event-based Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation by recurring to the Bellman optimality theory. Based on the HJI equation, we demonstrate that the stability of the concerned system in the sense of uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) can be guaranteed with the envisioned optimal control and worst disturbance policies. Here, the disturbance policy can be varied periodically while the control policy can only be updated at event-triggering instants, which differs from the existed researches. Furthermore, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm to handle the constructed HJI equation and thus settle the studied tracking control problem. The effectiveness of the algorithm is finally validated by both theoretical analysis and simulations.},

The stability analysis is performed via a multiple-step Lyapunov-type method where the semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness of the tracking error is ensured. Comparative experiment results obtained from a planar robotic manipulator are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control methodology.},

A dynamic second-order system is established from a spring-mass-damper system by abstracting and analyzing the inertial reference unit. The adaptive TD is used to reduce overshoot and improve tracking speed for the inertial reference unit by designing adaptive parameters and hyperbolic tangent functions. An adaptive sliding-mode controller is designed to improve response rapidity via adaptive laws and adaptive gains based on an integral terminal sliding-mode function. Effectiveness analysis is shown on error convergence for the adaptive TD and the adaptive sliding-mode controller based on Lyapunov methods.

  abstract     = {Plant-wide multiunit processes generally contain numerous variables, complex relations, and strong nonlinearity, making the monitoring of such processes challenging. This work proposes a new Gaussian-process-based probabilistic latent variable (GPPLV) modeling framework for distributed monitoring of multiunit nonlinear processes. A Gaussian-process latent variable model is first established to extract the dominant features of a local unit. Using the extracted features, a correlation between the local unit and its neighboring units are then modeled through a Gaussian-process regression (GPR) model. The genetic algorithm is used to determine the ideal independent variables from the neighboring units and optimize the hyperparameters of the GPR model simultaneously. Residuals are generated and monitoring statistics are constructed using an established GPPLV model. Experimental studies on three processes: 1) a numerical example; 2) the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process; and 3) a laboratory distillation process show that compared to some common distributed process monitoring models, the proposed method performs better in showing the nature of different faults and shows higher fault detection rate for large-scale multiunit processes.},

The main contributions can be highlighted as follows: 1) a novel data-based distributed policy iteration method is presented to reduce the computational burden; 2) the fault-tolerant control method is presented via designing fault compensators; and 3) the developed data-based method only requires the partial system information.

To deal with the stochastic feature of network-induced delays, their probability density function is utilized to establish the distributed delay model, which is more practical than the traditional time-varying network delay model. Meanwhile, in order to enlarge the estimation of the domain of attraction, a polytopic strategy composed of a state vector and a distributed-delay-dependent vector is proposed to treat the saturation nonlinearity. By constructing a distributed-delay-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, new and less conservative conditions are achieved to guarantee the stability of the established closed-loop system.

Under the prescribed performance control framework, the nonlinear transformed function is constructed so as to ensure that the asymmetric time-varying full-state constraints free from feasibility conditions imposed on virtual control signals are not violated. Besides, the effect of infinite number of time-varying actuator faults is compensated with the aid of projection adaption design. Furthermore, based on the piecewise Lyapunov function analysis, it is rigorously testified that entire involved signals are bounded, desired constraints are not breached and tracking errors within the predefined domains.

Both the quantizer and the filter are mode dependent, and their modes are asynchronous with those of the physical plant, governed by two hidden Markov models. Based on the mode- and fuzzy-rule-dependent Lyapunov function method, a sufficient condition is derived such that the resultant filtering error system is stochastically stable in the mean-square sense and strictly dissipative. The slack-matrix approach and Finsler’s lemma are further exploited to design suitable dissipative filters if a set of linear matrix inequalities are feasible.

The unique organizational characteristics and functional structure empower them to become an effective tool for solving corporate governance issues, including contract risks, principal-agent dilemmas, etc. However, DAOs themselves also face a variety of governance issues. On one hand, as a new economic organization model, the existing corporate governance theories and methods are no longer fully applicable to DAOs. On the other hand, unpredictable logic vulnerabilities and code loopholes in the governance mechanism might cause devastating damage to DAOs. The parallel intelligence theory based on the ACP method (i.e., artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel execution) is an elegant research paradigm and a practical approach tailored to solving these challenges. As such, we propose a novel parallel governance framework for DAOs based on the parallel intelligence theory and further discuss its technical methodology and implementation model. Furthermore, we construct a parallel governance system for GnosisDAO and conduct computational experiments to validate the effectiveness of its governance mechanism. The experimental results not only confirm the defects of the GnosisDAO governance mechanism but also illustrate parallel governance as a useful research direction to solve existing governance problems of DAOs.},

Furthermore, the novel adaptive multivariable command filtering backstepping fault-tolerant controller is proposed for the coupled spacecraft, to achieve the finite-time attitude tracking to the optimized trajectory, despite the measurement errors and actuator faults. The merits lie in the modified auxiliary signals and virtual commands design, which can compensate the filter errors, caused by the applied filters to deal with the “explosion of terms” of conventional backstepping control, in finite time with better control performance.

However, since the MTD works by perturbing the branch parameters with the distributed flexible ac transmission system (D-FACTS), it might cause additional infrastructure and operation costs and affect the system dynamics. This is a complicated problem because it is closely related to which branches should be perturbed and how much they are changed. In this article, we analyze the essentials of MTD and construct an effective and low-cost MTD. To begin with, we provide a sufficient and necessary condition for MTD to protect a bus from being affected by the intended FDIA. Based on this result, we propose a new metric to quantify the protection level of MTD and an efficient algorithm to minimize the number of required D-FACTS devices for protecting a specific set of buses. To reduce the operation cost, we develop two strategies to make the increasing operation cost zero for activating the MTD. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of MTD on the system dynamics with a special emphasize on small signal stability. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to validate our findings with the test cases of power systems in MATPOWER.},

First, the DET mechanism is introduced to reduce the transmission burden in the communication network. Second, the DET-based observer is constructed to estimate the unavailable state variables. On this basis, the integral sliding variable is provided, and the observer dynamics can be obtained. A sufficient condition is then proposed to make sure that the whole closed-loop system composed of the observer dynamics and the estimation error system is admissible and passive by utilizing the sum-of-squares approach. Meanwhile, the sliding surface parameter matrix, the observer gain, and the trigger weighting matrix are co-designed. It should be emphasized that the common equality constraints, nonstrict and nonlinear inequality constraints are removed through equivalent sets and several inequality techniques in this design process. Moreover, the DET observer-based SMC law is derived to assure the reachability of the specified sliding surface. Finally, the theoretical results are verified by simulation results.},

An event-triggered scheme introducing the estimation error is designed, which is a tradeoff between state estimator performance and network communication bandwidth in accordance with the practical requirements. Moreover, the cyber attack model is established, which consists of randomly occurring deception attacks. The stochastic variable obeying the Bernoulli distribution is utilized to describe the attack condition. Through handling the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) with some slack matrices, the event-triggered finite-time filter is designed to guarantee that the resulting systems are finite-time bounded and strictly dissipative.

Different from the common intermittent control scheme, the intermittent control proposed is based on an event-triggered mechanism instead of a traditional time-triggered mechanism during the work intervals. As a result, it reduces unnecessary sampling times and resource waste to a great extent. Meanwhile, the minimum interexecution time is obtained for T–S fuzzy systems under the stochastic case. In addition, this article presents a novel Lyapunov function, which simplifies the proof compared to the traditional Lyapunov function for intermittent control. Based on the average control rate adopted and the Lyapunov method, a bounded stability criterion is established, which is less conservative. Then, a corollary is given under the fuzzy event-triggered control. Finally, an example is shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the results obtained.},

Concerned with the sampled-data stabilization problem for the nonlinear systems with complex dynamics and stochastic sampling, a data-driven model-predictive control (DDMPC) strategy is proposed to control the system at each sampling instant. The main merits of DDMPC are threefold. First, a data-driven method based on the fuzzy neural network (FNN) is used to establish the mathematical model for the complex nonlinear system. Especially, considering the stochastic sampling characteristics of the system, a multimodel structure is constructed to predict the future system outputs at possible sampling instants. Second, the objective function is designed to deal with the stochastic sampling control problem. The reasonable control laws are computed to stabilize the nonlinear system with stochastic sampling. Finally, the stability of DDMPC is proved in theory, and the numerical simulation results and industrial application for the wastewater treatment process (WWTP) reveal that the proposed DDMPC can achieve a satisfactory control performance for the stochastic sampling nonlinear system (SSNS).},

  abstract     = {The early and accurate detection of congestive heart failure (CHF) using an electrocardiogram (ECG) is of great significance for improving the survival rate of patients. Existing approaches show limited detection accuracy as they fail to capture the temporal ECG dynamics. Also, these methods lack model transparency and are often difficult to interpret. This article proposes a novel end-to-end diagnostic attention-based deep residual recurrent neural network (DA-DRRNet) that effectively captures the temporal dynamics and extracts high-level attentive representations for accurate CHF detection. Specifically, we first employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) layer to encode the temporal dynamics from the raw ECG beats. Then, multilayered RNNs with residual connections are incorporated to extract high-level feature representations hierarchically. The residual connections allow gradients in deep RNN to propagate effectively, thereby improving the network’s representation ability. Finally, an attention module identifies the hidden vectors corresponding to the diagnostically prominent ECG characteristics to form an attentive representation for improved CHF detection. Using ECG signals from the three publicly available datasets (BIDMC-CHF, PTBDB, and MIT-BIH NSRDB), the proposed method achieves an impressive accuracy of 98.57\% and nearly 100\% for beat-level and 24-h record-level diagnosis, respectively. Notably, the analysis of learned attention weights demonstrates that the proposed model focuses on the clinically relevant ECG features that characterize CHF. This model transparency and improved detection results advance research in this field and provide a reliable and transparent diagnostic system for CHF analysis.},

First, forward and backward utility functions are defined as criteria for robots to conduct two-way evaluation when they choose their targets to patrol. Then, three event types and a cooperative action considering energy consumption and visiting frequency comprehensively are proposed to improve coordination among robots during their execution processes. In simulation experiments, the proposed strategy shows significant advantages on decreasing the average and maximum unvisited time of moving objects compared with the state-of-the-art.

Though centralized algorithms are generally adopted, they are subjected to restrictive hypotheses on the learning systems. To overcome this challenging problem, we aim to propose some distributed learning algorithms that focus specifically on achieving the perfect tracking tasks for iterative learning control (ILC) systems. By noting the equivalent relation between the perfect tracking problem of ILC systems and the solving problem of linear algebraic equations (LAEs), we first present an observer-based distributed learning algorithm to solve LAEs, where a multiagent system is constructed with every agent being only required to access some partial information for LAEs. The distributed learning algorithm benefits from integrating both observer-based design and consensus-based design ideas such that for any solvable LAE, all agents can agree on a common solution of it under any initial conditions of agents, regardless of whether it has a unique solution or not. Then, with the distributed learning algorithm for LAEs, we further develop two classes of distributed learning control algorithms for ILC systems, which establish the perfect tracking objective in the presence of the trackable desired output even without using the basic relative degree condition that is generally imposed for conventional ILC.},

  abstract     = {Existing methods regarding the influential nodes identification in complex networks usually assume that the structures of the networks are fully known. However, in many cases, knowing the full structure of one network is hard or impossible, and each participant can only obtain the partial structure of the networks. Therefore, each participant can be viewed as a private network (PN) of the original network, and they form multiple PNs. Then, one question arises: how to collaboratively identify influential nodes in multiple PNs while protecting the privacy of each PN. To this end, a secure multiparty computation ranking (SMPC-ranking) method is proposed to solve such an all-new problem based on the secure multiparty computation (SMPC) protocol, in which the SMPC protocol jointly computes a centrality function to measure the comprehensive importance of nodes or their ranking results by integrating each PN’s inputs without disclosing their inputs (i.e., the nodes’ importance). Experimental results in different networks demonstrate that, no matter what type of the centrality index is, the SMPC-ranking method can better identify the influential nodes in networks than that of the baseline method only using the structural information of one PN. What is more, our SMPC-ranking method does not violate the privacy of each PN. Therefore, the proposed method provides new insights on collaboratively identifying influential nodes in multiple PNs and has potential applications in many fields.},

With the help of the backstepping method, a time-varying adaptive controller is designed for a high-order nonlinear systems subject to uncertain parameters. Through constructing appropriate dynamic gain-based Lyapunov functions and utilizing our proposed stability criterion, it is proved that all states of the uncertain system can be adjusted to the origin in a fixed-time interval. Moreover, the settling time is not depend on the initial conditions of system and can be preset according to the actual requirements.

Moreover, the resilient filter is exploited to regulate the possible gain perturbation. The objective of the addressed problem is to design a robust filter in a recursive structure such that, in the simultaneous presence of the uncertain-variance noises and the WTOD protocol, the minimal upper bounds (UBs) on the filtering error variances (EVs) are developed for the considered system.

Considering the advantages of a time-discontinuous controller, an intermittent BC and a criterion of synchronization are given. When the state information cannot be fully obtained, a boundary-output-based observer is provided for estimating the states. Then, an observer-based intermittent boundary controller is given to ensure the synchronization. From the given criteria, the effects of time delay and the control time length on synchronization are analyzed. This research involves two key challenges: 1) consideration of the BC and intermittent control parameters in the system performance analysis and 2) clarification of the influence of system parameters on synchronization. These challenges are addressed using Poincaré’s inequality, the fractional Razumikhin-type theorem, and several properties of the Mittag-Leffler function are used to deal with the above difficulties. Examples show that our results are valid.},

  abstract     = {Consensus reaching process (CRP), as an essential part of group decision making (GDM), can facilitate more effective consensus by taking human behaviors into account. Extending the established research on uncertain minimum cost consensus models (MCCMs), this article continues to adopt linear uncertainty distributions (LUDs) to represent decision-maker’s (DM’s) preference, but considers asymmetric costs into a new framework of CRP, where DM’s preference and weight are both adjusted according to democratic consensus. Moreover, in light of the uncertain distance measure, two novel optimization-based consensus models are built in this article: one is to obtain a minimum cost consensus by simultaneously considering asymmetric costs, aggregation function, and consensus measure; while the other provides a more flexible way to address GDM problems without presetting a specific consensus level (CL) threshold. Some 0–1 binary variables are further introduced to reduce the calculation complexity resulted from piecewise functions in the new multicoefficient goal programming models. Finally, an illustrative example and further discussion reveal the feasibility and superiority of our new method.},

  abstract     = {Agile satellites are the new generation of Earth observation satellites (EOSs) with stronger attitude maneuvering capability. Since optical remote sensing instruments cannot see through the cloud, the cloud coverage brings a significant influence on the satellite observation missions. The scheduling of multiple agile EOSs (AEOSs) is already complicated due to strong satellite maneuverability and onboard satellite energy constraints. Moreover, introducing cloud coverage uncertainty further increases scheduling complexity. Motivated by these challenges, we address the multiple AEOSs scheduling problem under cloud coverage uncertainty where the objective aims to maximize the entire observation profit. A chance constraint programming model is adopted to describe the uncertainty initially, and the observation profit under cloud coverage uncertainty is then calculated via a sample approximation method. To overcome the solving difficulty, an improved simulated annealing (ISA)-based heuristic including a fast insertion strategy is proposed for large-scale observation missions. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the ISA-based heuristic outperforms other algorithms for the multiple AEOSs scheduling problem under cloud coverage uncertainty, which validates the proposed algorithm.},

In this article, we discuss uncertainty measure of belief function from the perspective of information fractal dimension. An uncertainty quantity called evenness and its measure Eve are proposed, which can represent the belief propensity degree of belief function. We first propose the measures of diversity (normalized nonspecificity) and the element evenness (normalized discord), and then fuse them to calculate Eve.

However, the solution of HJBE is hard and even unavailable to obtain for nonlinear system and, thus, the optimal control method can not be developed. To address this problem, an adaptive neural inverse optimal control method is proposed for nonlinear systems with external disturbances and actuator failures in this article. The cost function in this article is defined based on the controller and, therefore, once the controller is obtained, the corresponding cost function is minimized. Accordingly, the directly solution of HJBE is avoided. In more detail, the auxiliary system is constructed to develop the auxiliary controller, based on which the actual optimal fault-tolerant controller can be further obtained. The uncertainties in system dynamics are compensated by neural networks, and the unknown actuator failures are handled by adaptive control gain. It is proved that nonlinear system is input-to-state stabilizable (ISS) and the proposed controller can minimize the cost function that puts penalty on tracking error and system input. Two simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

Toward this end, the system dynamics is represented in its Jordan canonical form, and the system states are sorted based on their time constants. Then, for any Jordan block, an event-triggered mechanism is designed to determine the execution times for sampling and sending its corresponding state variable(s) to the controller. In this way, each Jordan block has a mechanism to decide whether or not its data should be transmitted to the controller. Using the proposed technique, event-triggered policies can be designed such that the fast dynamics are sampled with short interevent intervals, while the slower dynamics are simultaneously permitted to send their data with relatively long interevent intervals. The proposed technique decreases both the number and the size of transmitted packets. The boundedness of the closed-loop system is guaranteed under the suggested event-triggered technique. Moreover, it is proved that the Zeno behavior is avoided. In comparison with ordinary event-triggered methods, the proposed decentralized event-triggered technique leads to better performance due to its extra degrees of freedom in sending the data from the system to the controller. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the promising features of the suggested event-triggered controller.},

Particularly, nonlinear control systems with partially unknown dynamics are investigated and the procedure to acquire the corresponding optimal control policy is presented. The stability for the closed-loop dynamics and the optimality of the obtained control policy are both proved.

  abstract     = {With the growing demands on green short life-cycle products, advanced energy-aware process planning (AEPP) becomes critical. A major limitation of the existing methods is the poor resistance to the perturbations encountered in advanced machining systems. Therefore, a graph convolutional reinforcement learning (GCRL) method is proposed to overcome such limitations. In this method, a graph convolutional policy network is trained to rapidly adapt the learned commonalities to specific tasks. Unlike algorithms that fix decision variables before optimization, this method employs graph generation to represent AEPP while taking into consideration the flexibilities of operations, machines, and cutting tools. The problem is reformulated as a novel Markov decision process (MDP) to describe the dynamic generation procedure of process plans. A graph convolutional network (GCN) is concurrently used to perform graph embedding to compress the topology of input graphs. Additionally, reinforcement learning (RL) is used to achieve robust and intuitive learning for process planning. To improve the adaption performance of the proposed GCRL, a two-phase multitask training strategy is adopted. Learning efficiency is improved because agents can incorporate both intertask similarities and task-specific rules. A comprehensive case study, including energy characteristics and algorithm performance analyses, is also performed to validate the developed method.},

Then, the critic neural network (NN) adjusts continuously, while actor NN updates the control strategy only at triggering instants. The event-triggered control (ETC) reduces the use of control resources and improves the anti-interference capability. However, it requires dedicated hardware to monitor whether triggering rules are violated, which is not feasible on most general-purpose devices. Hence, we propose a novel technique, which uses the current state of the device to determine the state measurement at the next moment, calculate the control law, and then abandon persistently monitoring of the plant.

The values of these subinformation are chosen randomly but with their mean value fixed to the original initial value. Then, based on multiple communication channels, agents share all their subinformation, but ensure that each neighbor can only obtain partial subinformation. We prove that the privacy can be protected under our method if each agent has at least two neighbors, and one of the neighbors is neutral. The generalization on the directed graph about this method is also considered.

Inspired by supervised learning, Stage 1 establishes the minimum decision error optimization model (MDEOM) to learn the optimal parameters of three-way decisions and calculate decision loss reference values. Then, we design an algorithm to solve MDEOM based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In Stage 2, we calculate adjusted decision losses with the minimum decision loss difference consensus model (MDLDCM), which can guide the consensus adjustment of loss functions and improve the decision quality of three-way group decision making. Finally, some implications of three-way group decision making with the two-stage group consensus method are discussed by a series of experiments which prove the improvement effectiveness of our proposed method.},

SAMFEO consists of a local surrogate-assisted multioperator evolutionary optimization (LSA-MoEO) and a model-free single-operator evolutionary optimization (MF-SoEO). Specifically, LSA-MoEO adopts multiple evolutionary operators to generate a set of offspring and prescreens the best one as the final offspring by using a lightweight local surrogate model trained by some newest evaluated solutions. MF-SoEO follows the traditional evolutionary optimization paradigm and is triggered based on the optimization utility of the LSA-MoEO. It plays a crucial role in preventing the population from getting stagnation.

Using a technical lemma and the stochastic Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that combined with the given constraint conditions on graphs switching the 2nd-moment asymptotic bipartite consensus for the MASs can be achieved. Different from existing results, the proposed compensator can not only save the network bandwidth but also compensate for the actuators’ faults. The proposed scheme also significantly relaxes the conditions on the communication network to directed switching graphs and even allows the graph to be disconnected over some time intervals. The common design parameters under any graphs can avoid the detection of graph switching, which will need global topology information. Finally, a numerical simulation is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Position and orientation of the end-effector of redundant manipulators perform a core role in various complex tasks. However, most quadratic programming (QP)-based robot control approaches merely take the position of the end-effector into account, which is relatively inadequate and impractical. Driven by this significant deficiency, this article develops a control method for end-effector orientation representations by analyzing a rotation matrix. Specifically, it is formulated as an equality constraint and applied to control issues of Euler angles and axis-angle representation. On this basis, a QP-based position and orientation control (POC) scheme is proposed for the kinematic control of redundant manipulators. To handle such a POC problem, a dynamic neural network (DNN) is designed with rigorous theoretical analyses. Simulation results show that the POC scheme can accurately control the orientation representations and position of the end-effector. Experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches highlight the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method.},

First, we present a PPT control for handling the limited communication angles and, thus, they are allowed to be limited, turnable, and controllable. Then, to achieve the asymptotic convergence of output tracking errors, the proposed adaptive controllers can effectively insure the trajectory tracking errors of AUVs asymptotically converge to zero under the influence of dynamic uncertainties. Furthermore, the derived asymptotically tracking command filter technique for AUVs not only deduce an acceleration-free strategy for followers but also achieve the asymptotic convergence of output tracking errors for the command filters themselves.

Both system delays and input delays are considered, and the delays and their derivatives may vary in intervals whose lower bounds are not restricted to be zero. The systems are further reduced to continuous-time neural networks (NNs) with interval matrix uncertainties, and a unified method is developed to solve the stability of delayed NNs and MNNs. Stability criteria are obtained for delayed MNNs by augmented Lyapunov functionals, Wirtinger-based integral inequality, reciprocally convex approach, and linear matrix inequalities.

A new event-triggered mechanism (ETM) considering both DoS attacks and limited network bandwidth is put forward to guarantee the secure performance of the filter. Under this mechanism, inherent periodical transmission attempts are generated during DoS active periods, by which the latest measurement output of the system can be successfully transmitted to the filter after the end of the DoS attack; while during DoS sleep periods, the ETM degenerates into a traditional one. Furthermore, a valid DoS attack model is proposed to further characterize the following two scenarios occurring between adjacent sampling instants: 1) the end of the DoS attack and 2) both the start of the DoS attack and the end of the DoS attack. Sufficient conditions for designing the secure filters of CPSs against DoS attacks are achieved by using the piecewise Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional approach. Finally, the validity of our designed approach is manifested by an illustration of quarter-vehicle suspension systems (SSs).},

  abstract     = {Model inversion attack (MIA) is a cyber threat with an increasing alert even for deep-learning-based recognition systems (DLRSs). By targeting a DLRS under a scenario of attacker access to the model structure and parameters, MIA generates a data clone for a certain targeted class label. To avoid the possible threats of such MIA-generated data clones, this research work proposes a social IoT approach to a collaborative cyber-defense among the online recognition systems (RSs) sharing the targeted class label. Since, the generation of an MIA-clone is by targeting an RS model and using its structure, parameters, and class labels output scores in an iterative optimization process, the generated clone is partially inherent to the targeted model. Thus, it is expected for an MIA-clone to show a different performance on a secondary RS wherein the same targeted class label is included. It is because, in the MIA generation of the clone, not only the targeted class label but also other class labels, and model parameters and structure affect the process, while the second model has just the targeted class label in common with the target model. Deploying the Social Internet of Recognition Systems (SIoRS), the proposed technique utilizes a collaborative recognition by SIoRC which plays the role of a complementary recognition besides the targeted RS. The recognition output by the targeted RS is further verified by the SIoRS complementary recognition result. To avoid the MIA-targeted data clones, the verification of recognition is by the log-likelihood ratio test between the targeted RS and the SIoRS complementary recognition confidence scores. The proposed technique is evaluated by statistical analysis on deep face RSs in 10000 Monte Carlo runs for each of the conventional, dc-generative adversarial network (GAN) and $\alpha $ -GAN integrated MIA techniques in targeting two different user identities. The $Z$ scores of the fitted normal distribution of the log-likelihood ratios indicate almost 100\% detection rate of clones generated by conventional MIA and 95.23\% and 86\% of clones, respectively, generated by DC-GAN and $\alpha $ -GAN integrated deep MIA techniques.},

Based on the imperfect premise matching, the T-S fuzzy observer is delineated for estimating the unmeasurable states of the proposed WECS. Unlike the traditional PDC control, a general non-PDC control strategy is designed via the T-S fuzzy observer. The designed control scheme indicates that it is not required to share the same membership functions as the observer and system. By constructing the Lyapunov functional with available information on the fuzzy membership function and introducing the slack variables, sufficient conditions are obtained to assure the asymptotic stability of error dynamic for the PMSG-based T-S fuzzy system and its observer.

  abstract     = {The value of demand response (DR) for improving the operational efficiency of smart grids has been widely recognized. To further explore the potential DR flexibility, this article presents a novel framework for DR resource trading between multiple service providers (SPs) and end customers, in which SPs are supposed to offer diversified incentives to a resource trading center (RTC) while anticipating responses from the demand side. Distinguished from previous studies, in this work each end customer is endowed the authority to simultaneously trade with multiple SPs with the intention of maximizing their net utilities. The trading process between SPs and customers is demonstrated by a multileader multifollower Stackelberg game, due to its superiority of modeling problems with hierarchical decision-making behaviors. To solve the formulated game, an exact potential function is proposed to help determine the unique Nash equilibrium (NE) among SPs, which serves as the cornerstone for further deriving the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE), i.e., the ultimate outcome of the resource trading process. Simulation results verified that the DR flexibility was significantly increased compared with the case when there is only one SP responsible for the entire trading on behalf of all the end customers. Moreover, the proposed approach is also able to bring extra benefits for both SPs and customers in terms of net profit and net utility value.},

  abstract     = {Advances in modeling and computation have resulted in high-fidelity digital twins capable of simulating the dynamics of a wide range of industrial systems. These simulation models often require calibration, or the estimation of an optimal set of parameters in some goodness-of-fit sense, to reflect a system’s observed behavior. While searching over the parameter space is an inevitable part of the calibration process, simulation models are rarely designed to be valid for arbitrarily large parameter spaces. The application of existing calibration methods, therefore, often results in repeated model evaluations using parameters that can cause the simulations to be impractically slow or even result in catastrophic failure. In general, the shape of subregions in the parameter space that could result in simulation failure is unknown. In this article, we propose a novel failure-robust Bayesian optimization (FR-BO) algorithm that learns these failure regions (FRs) from online simulations and informs a Bayesian optimization algorithm to avoid FRs while optimizing model parameters. This results in acceleration of the optimizer’s convergence and prevents wastage of time trying to simulate parameters with high failure probabilities. The effectiveness of the proposed FR-BO algorithm is demonstrated via a well-known benchmark example where we compare against state-of-the-art gradient matching techniques, and a practical example related to parameter estimation for digital twins of buildings.},

Such a supervised autonomy or cloud-based control of a robot poses high networking and computing capabilities requirements at both sites, which are not easy to achieve. This article introduces and analyzes a new analog twin (AT) framework by synchronizing mobility between two mobile robots, where one robot acts as an AT to the other robot. We devise a novel priority-based supervised bilateral teleoperation strategy for goal navigation tasks to validate the proposed framework. The practical implementation of a supervised control strategy on this framework entails a mobile robot system divided into a Master–Client scheme over a communication channel where the Client robot resides on the site of operation guided by the Master robot through an agent (human or AI) from a remote location. The Master robot controls the Client robot with its autonomous navigation algorithm, which reacts to the predictive force received from the Client robot. We analyze the proposed strategy in terms of network performance (throughput and delay), task performance (tracking error and goal reach accuracy), and computing efficiency (memory and CPU utilization). Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate the method’s novelty, flexibility, and versatility in realizing reactive planning applications with remote computational offloading capabilities compared to conventional offloading schemes.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by the ensemble strategy of machine learning, deep random vector functional link (dRVFL), and ensemble dRVFL (edRVFL) has shown state-of-the-art results on different datasets. Our present work first fills the gap of dRVFL and edRVFL work in the field of regression. We test and evaluate the performances of the dRVFLs on regression problems. Subsequently, we propose a novel regularization method [boosted factor (BF)], two dRVFLs variants [edRVFL with skip connection (edRVFL-SC) and edRVFL with random skip connections (edRVFL-RSC)] and one strategy [ensemble skip connection edRVFL (esc-edRVFL)] which show significant improvement over the original dRVFL. The BF is a newly introduced hyperparameter to scale the values of the activated hidden neurons to accommodate the diversity of the data, and it is also able to filter the neurons. edRVFL-SC and edRVFL-RSC are the edRVFL variants with skip connections. In edRVFL-SC, we apply dense skip connections to the edRVFL, which is inspired by the residual architecture in the deep learning area. However, due to the specificity of randomized networks, the simple skip connections are probably leading to the reuse of useless features. To address this problem, we propose a random skip connection-based edRVFL, which can keep the diversity in the latent space. esc-RVFL is an ensemble scheme that utilizes several edRVFL-RSC models trained on the different folds of the training dataset. The esc-edRVFL is identified as the best-performing algorithm through a comprehensive evaluation of 31 UCI datasets.},

The impulses are not directly related to events and two kinds of control schemes (static and dynamic ETC) are fully considered, respectively. Moreover, the stabilizing and destabilizing impulses can coexist (i.e., hybrid impulses). By employing properties of impulsive system theory and Lyapunov conditions, some theoretical conditions for GES and non-Zeno behavior are derived under static and dynamic event-triggered mechanism, respectively. And the results for stability are different but complementary to each other. Based on the linear matrix inequality, the design criteria of expected triggered mechanism and control gains are derived.

  abstract     = {Utilizing perception for feedback control in combination with dynamic movement primitive (DMP)-based motion generation for a robot’s end-effector control is a useful solution for many robotic manufacturing tasks. For instance, while performing an insertion task when the hole or the recipient part is not visible in the eye-in-hand camera, a learning-based movement primitive method can be used to generate the end-effector path. Once the recipient part is in the field of view (FOV), image-based visual servo (IBVS) can be used to control the motion of the robot. Inspired by such applications, this article presents a generalized control scheme that switches between motion generation using DMP and IBVS control. To facilitate the design, a common state-space representation for the DMP and the IBVS systems is first established. The stability analysis of the switched system using multiple Lyapunov functions shows that the state trajectories converge to a bound asymptotically. The developed method is validated by three real-world experiments using the eye-in-hand configuration of a Baxter research robot.},

The considered unknown bounded biasing attacks are produced from any dynamical system satisfying the error system between it and its equilibrium to be input-to-state stable, so that some reported biasing attacks are contained as a special case. In order to deal with potential compromised sensor output signals, an auxiliary filter is first introduced. Then, an augmented system, including the CPS and filter dynamics is constructed. Furthermore, with the aid of the system structure and input–output data, fictitious systems comprising the information of attack reconstruction errors are given. And then, by the cooperative interaction between the dynamics of observer’s estimation errors and virtual systems, an observer with a cooperative interaction structure is proposed, where the fictitious systems can be viewed as co-workers conducing to the accurate state estimation and attack reconstruction. By the Lyapunov approach, it is shown that state estimations and reconstructed attack signals, respectively, converge to the small set around system states and real attack signals, and the set bound can be reduced by adjusting the observer’s parameter. The applications of the observer to biasing attack detection and secure control are further given. Finally, an illustrative example validates the proposed methods.},

The proposed asynchronous integral-type event-triggered control (IT-ETC) scheme for two-fold signal transmissions can not only avoid the Zeno behavior strictly, but save more communication resources than the static event-triggered control (S-ETC) strategy. Moreover, a criterion is provided to guarantee that the hybrid system is ${\mathcal {L}}_{2}$ stable, and an improved co-design method is further synthesized to simultaneously obtain the design parameters of ETMs and feasible solutions of the dynamical controller. As a result, a tradeoff can be achieved between the robustness of the control system and the occupancy rate of communication resources.

The degenerate Lyapunov functional is more general than the traditional positive definitive Lyapunov functionals and ETC has a prominent advantage of reducing communication resources compared with periodic sampled-data feedback controls because time updating is based on a certain event. Also, a fixed positive lower bound on the stochastic interexecution times is guaranteed by this novel event-triggering mechanism. Together with ETC and the degenerate Lyapunov functional, the boundedness, mean square exponential stabilization, and globally asymptotical stabilization of SFDSs can be established for different choices of parameters.

Then, an off-policy RL algorithm is developed to learn the approximate solution to the risk-aware value function. During the learning process, the associated approximate optimal control policy is able to satisfy both input and state constraints under disturbances. By replaying experience data to the off-policy weight update law of the critic neural network, the weight convergence is guaranteed. Moreover, online and offline algorithms are developed to serve as principled ways to record informative experience data to achieve a sufficient excitation required for the weight convergence. The proofs of system stability and weight convergence are provided. The Simulation results reveal the validity of the proposed control framework.},

  abstract     = {The number of discussion rounds and harmony degree of decision makers are two crucial efficiency measures to be considered in the design of the consensus-reaching process for the group decision-making problems. Adjusting the feedback parameter and importance weights of the decision makers in the recommendation mechanism has a great impact on these efficiency measures. This work aims to propose novel and efficient reinforcement learning-based adjustment mechanisms to address the tradeoff between the aforementioned measures. To employ these adjustment mechanisms, we propose to extract the dynamics of state transition from consensus models based on the distributed trust functions and $Z$ -Numbers in order to convert the decision environment into a Markov decision process. Two independent reinforcement learning agents are then trained via a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to adjust the feedback parameter and importance weights of decision makers. The first agent is trained toward reducing the number of discussion rounds while ensuring the highest possible level of harmony degree among the decision makers. The second agent merely speeds up the consensus reaching process by adjusting the importance weights of the decision makers. Various experiments are designed to verify the applicability and scalability of the proposed feedback and weight-adjustment mechanisms in different decision environments.},

And a new defense strategy based on nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) is developed, which can not only effectively estimate the external compound disturbance in the presence of the attack, but also improve the robustness of the controlled system. Different from FDI attacks, it is a special case of ROFDI attacks, and the proposed method can deal with ROFDI attacks injected by attackers. Meanwhile, multiple Nussbaum functions are introduced, which overcomes the design difficulty of unknown control directions caused by ROFDI attacks. Furthermore, the approximation of the unknown nonlinear function and the exponential growth problem in the traditional backstepping calculation process are handled by radial basis function neural network and dynamic surface control, respectively. Finally, a new adaptive neural control method based on NDO is proposed to make all signals bounded. Meanwhile, tracking errors and disturbance estimation errors converge on the neighborhood of zero. Numerical and practical examples further illustrate the rationality of the method.},

  abstract     = {In the Kalman filter (KF), the estimated state is a linear combination of the one-step prediction and measurement. The two combination weights depend on the prediction mean-square error matrix and the covariances matrix of measurement noise (CMMN), respectively. When the measurement noise values are small (large), the corresponding measurement is close to (far from) the real value, and the weight should be large (small). If there is non-Gaussian measurement noise, especially heavy-tailed noise, most of the noise values are small, and a few of them are large. The occasional impulses cause the overall noise variance to be much greater than the noise without impulses. Since the overall CMMN is adopted in the KF, its performance will deteriorate. In this article, we divide the measurement noise into two parts: 1) the background noise with small variance and 2) the impulse noise with large variance. Then, we use the expectation–maximization algorithm to dynamically calculate the parameters and propose a new KF algorithm to process them separately, which is called background-impulse KF (BIKF). It can dynamically determine whether there is an impulse and eliminate its impact as much as possible. Compared with the recent maximum correntropy criterion and minimum error entropy criterion-based KFs, simulations show that the proposed BIKF works better than them with lower computational complexity.},

After that, by constructing appropriate feedback controllers and the Lyapunov functional method, we study the decay synchronization for multiple coupled dynamic networks. Moreover, for different coupling matrices, their zero eigenvalues are correspondingly denoted by different normalized left eigenvectors (NLEVec), so it is difficult to establish the functional based on these NLEVec. With the help of the weighted combination of NLEVec for multiple coupling matrices, under the assumption that the Chebyshev gap among NLEVec is less than an allowable deviation interval, some generalized decay (anti-) synchronization conditions are established. Furthermore, we discuss exponential synchronization and polynomial synchronization as special cases, and more relevant criteria are acquired.

  abstract     = {A cyber system may face to multiple attackers from diverse adversaries, who usually employ sophisticated techniques to both continuously steal sensitive data and avoid being detected by defense strategies. This continuous process is typically involved in an advanced persistent threat (APT). Since the game theory is an ideal mathematical model for investigating continuous decision making of competing players, it is broadly used to research the interaction between defenders and APT attackers. Although many researchers are now using the game theory to defend against APT attacks, most of the existing solutions are limited to single-defender, single-attacker scenarios. In the real world, threats by multiple attackers are not uncommon and multiple defenders can be put in place. Therefore, to overcome the limitation of the existing solutions, we develop a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) method with a novel sampling approach. The MADRL method allows defenders to create strategies on the fly and share their experience with other defenders. To develop this method, we create a multidefender, multiattacker game model and analyze the equilibrium of this model. The results of a series of experiments demonstrate that, with MADRL, defenders can quickly learn efficient strategies against attackers.},

However, this situation increases the risk of infection with HCMV. The proposed nonlinear control strategy balances the immune response and antiviral treatment to guarantee kidney transplantation success and prevent infection by tracking demanded values. The desired scenarios are designed by evaluating several Bezier curves and exponential functions and investigating the system behavior. Coupled nonlinear dynamics of the immune response and HCMV infection are studied in three modes, including immunosuppressive treatment, dual treatment, and antiviral cut-off modes. Asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is proven using the Lyapunov theorem and Barbalat’s lemma in all of the three modes in the presence of uncertainties on model parameters.

By introducing a barrier function-based state transformation technique into the outer loop controller design, the dynamic constraints covering different types of time-varying state constraints can be addressed without reconfiguring the controller structure. Meanwhile, a neural-network-based disturbance observer is constructed to estimate the external disturbances. Consequently, the applicability and robustness of controller are improved, such that the position tracking control can be implemented in severe environments. Moreover, the inner loop controller is established by virtue of a distributed sliding-mode estimator so as the consensus control for attitude systems of multiple MUAVs can be realized rapidly. Finally, a simulation example is presented to demonstrate the validity and superiority of the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {Decomposition methods play a critical role in cooperative co-evolutionary algorithms (CCEAs) for solving large-scale optimization problems. Although some well-performing decomposition methods have been designed based on the interactions among variables (IaV), their grouping accuracy is still limited due to the poor performance on the overlapping problems and the computational roundoff errors of IaV in the implementation. To deal with these limitations, a graph-based deep decomposition (GDD) method is proposed to obtain more accurate grouping results, especially for the overlapping problems. On the one hand, the GDD mines the IaV information and obtains the minimum vertex separator of the interaction graph of variables, so as to group variables deeply and recursively. On the other hand, the GDD has the ability of fault tolerance to deal with the computational roundoff errors of IaV and can improve the grouping accuracy. For better experimental studies of overlapping problems, a novel overlapping function generator is designed with the random and complicate overlap type, and two new metrics are proposed to evaluate the grouping accuracy. Comprehensive experiments show that GDD can greatly improve the grouping accuracy and help CCEAs perform better than other existing algorithms, especially on the overlapping problems. In addition, the GDD is highly fault tolerant and can divide problems accurately even on the inaccurate IaV.},

In the lower-level model, a distributed optimization with switching topology is developed to minimize power generation cost under the above switching mechanisms, and the convergence ability of the proposed distributed optimization method is well proved with a uniformly globally exponentially stable condition.

That is, we proved the NSDSs with the intermittent discrete observation controller is $p$ th $(p\geq 2)$ -moment exponentially stable if the auxiliary system is $p$ th $(p\geq 2)$ -moment exponentially stable. We call this method the auxiliary system method (ASM). In fact, different from mainstream techniques, the ASM used in this article can handle the case of $0 &amp;lt; \underline {T}\leq \overline {T} &amp;lt; \delta $ even if $\delta $ is small enough. Besides, this article reveals one interesting phenomenon: classic methods may lead to error accumulation, which cannot be avoided in APIC or periodically intermittent control (PIC) for NSDSs. Finally, one numerical example, one application, and one comparison are given to show the usefulness and correctness of the proposed results.},

First, the null reachability and controllability geometric conditions are studied. Specifically, the null reachable set and controllable set for every impulsive and switching sequence are obtained by the properties of the invariant subspace. Besides, a new subspace sequence is constructed to analyze the null reachability and controllability of DIHSID. Second, the complete controllability of DIHSID is investigated by algebraic methods. In the form of Gramian matrices, several sufficient complete controllability conditions for DIHSID are established without assuming the nonsingularity of all impulsive matrices. Furthermore, a less conservative complete controllability criterion that is necessary and sufficient is developed by introducing a row matrix of some Gramian matrices. Finally, two illustrating examples show the effectiveness of the developed controllability theory.},

  abstract     = {Multisource information fusion (MSIF) technologies play an important role in various fields and practical applications. As a useful methodology to represent and handle uncertain information, the Dempster–Shafer evidence theory has been broadly used in many fields of MSIF. In evidence theory, however, Dempster’s combination rule (DCR) may result in counterintuitive results when fusing highly conflicting evidence. To address this issue, in this article, a novel MSIF method based on a newly defined generalized evidential divergence measure among multiple sources of evidence is proposed for decision making. Specifically, we first design a new generalized evidential Jensen–Shannon (GEJS) divergence to measure the conflict and discrepancy among multiple sources of evidence. The proposed GEJS divergence has three main characteristics, which are beneficial for evidential divergence measurement: 1) it measures the divergence among multiple sources of evidence, not just two, and thus provides a more generalized framework; 2) it considers different weights of multiple sources of evidence to measure divergence among them, which is desirable for application requirements; and 3) it considers the cardinality of propositions of multiple sources of evidence to measure divergence by considering features of evidential subsets. Given these advantages of GEJS, an appropriate weight for each source of evidence can be obtained. Next, according to the corresponding weights, we amend the bodies of evidence to generate a weighted average evidence. DCR is then used to fuse the weighted average evidence, and the final result is used to support decision making. Finally, we present a case study of fault diagnosis and a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate that the proposed MSIF is effective and robust for addressing conflicting situations compared to related works. Additionally, an application of classification validates the practicability of the proposed MSIF with a good decision level.},

  abstract     = {The supervisor simplification problem for automated manufacturing systems (AMSs) has been receiving increasing attention in recent years. This article uses a well-known class of Petri nets, namely, systems of sequential systems with shared resources (S4Rs) to model general AMSs. We aim to simplify the liveness-enforcing supervisor for S4R by using the concept of transition cover (TC). Deadlocks in S4R can be characterized by a kind of special structural object called perfect activity circuits (PACs). First, a set of special PACs are defined as a TC and its effectness is also verified. Then, by adding a monitor with a control variable to each PAC in an effective TC (ETC), we establish a liveness-enforcing supervisor for S4R. The control variables are determined by solving an integer linear programming problem so as to increase the supervisor’s permissiveness as much as possible. Under the proposed control methodology, it is analyzed that the upper bound of the number of monitors equates to that of transitions in S4R. Especially for the system with a few transitions, since not many monitors are added, the proposed supervisor has relatively small-scaled structures or a small number of control places. In addition, we present algorithms to get an ETC from any nonlive S4R. Based on this ETC, we can design one liveness-enforcing supervisor of small size for the underlying S4R. Finally, some examples are used to illustrate the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {With the development of IoT, virtual reality, cloud computing, and digital twin technologies, the advent of metaverse has attracted increasing world attention. Metaverse integrates and applies multiple emerging technologies to cloud education, smart health, digital government, and emergency evacuation. Evacuation systems are of great importance to ensure life safety. Due to panic, people in a building may not be able to make the right judgment to choose an optimal path to leave the building in case of an emergency event such as a fire. As a branch of machine learning, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can model an evacuation scene, collect real-time information, such as crowd distribution and disaster location, find the optimal escape path with a path-planning algorithm, induce the movement state of the crowd through dynamic guidance signs, and improve the evacuation efficiency. In this article, we apply DRL technology to solve the efficient emergency evacuation problem with the help of metaverse and show a training system built upon metaverse that would enable evacuees to choose the most efficient route and leave the building in the least amount of time. The information collected by various sensors, such as video cameras and smoke detectors, can give a whole picture of the status of the building in a real-time manner. The collected data are processed by cloud servers in which a DRL model is trained to dynamically guide evacuees. Experiments in different simulation scenes demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the traditional static guidance method in saving evacuation time. It can effectively avoid major crowding along the evacuation route and improve evacuation efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Given the differences of command and control (C2) activities between the field command center and the emergency operations center (EOC), this article combined the edge C2 theory with the parallel C2 theory, and proposed a parallel incident C2 mode based on the observe–orient–decide–act (OODA) loop and planning–readiness–execution–assessment (PREA) loop. The aim is to build up a PREA loop-based parallel incident C2 mode and its related operating mechanism of edge empowerment and energy release in parallel incident C2 mode. The parallel incident C2 mode based on the PREA loop and OODA loop supports the co-existence and connection of the two roles of the incident C2 agent at the emergency scene. The two roles are the executive role of emergency response and operation and the command and organization role of the edge emergency system. This article initiates a deep integration of two different C2 process mechanisms in the emergency response and operation process, taking into account the local emergency scene and the global emergency system. Taken together, a key issue has been well addressed regarding the contradiction that the traditional emergency response cannot be reconciled in terms of rapidity and thoroughness.},

  abstract     = {Foundation models are used to train a broad system of general data to build adaptations to new bottlenecks. Typically, they contain hundreds of billions of hyperparameters that have been trained with hundreds of gigabytes of data. However, this type of black-box vulnerability places foundation models at risk of data poisoning attacks that are designed to pass on misinformation or purposely introduce machine bias. Moreover, ordinary researchers have not been able to completely participate due to the rise in deployment standards. This study introduces the theoretical framework of scenarios engineering (SE) for building accessible and reliable foundation models in metaverse, namely, “SE-enabled foundation models in metaverse.” Particularly, the research framework comprises a six-layer architecture (infrastructure layer, operation layer, knowledge layer, intelligence layer, management layer, and interaction layer), which can provide controllability, trustworthiness, and interactivity for the foundation models in metaverse. This creates closed-loop, virtual–real, and human–machine environments that provides the best indices and goals for the foundation models, which allows us to fully validate and calibrate the corresponding models. Then, examples of use cases from the automotive industry are listed to provide transparency on the possible use and benefits of our approach. Finally, the open research topics of related frameworks are discussed.},

In the proposed parallel oil fields, there are three kinds of workers (human workers, digital workers, and robotic workers) coordinating to construct a more reliable and intelligent oil field. Furthermore, the framework and methodology of parallel oil fields are illustrated by parallel systems and the artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel executions (ACP) approach. Based on the proposed framework, parallel oil fields are capable of generating a more trustworthy artificial system and guaranteeing the realization of the 6S (safety, security, sustainability, sensitivity, service, and smartness) goal. Finally, based on dynamometer cards, fault diagnosis of sucker rod pumping systems (SRPS) is investigated in parallel oil fields.},

  abstract     = {Metaverses have caused significant changes in the industry and their academic foundation can be traced back to the term cyber–physical–social systems (CPSS), which was proposed in 2010. Radar is an important sensor in sensing systems that are widely applied in many fields, especially, in autonomous driving. To deal with the complex environment, smart radars with real-time information processing capabilities are required. Human factors play a critical role in the operation and management of radar systems, thus, digital twins’ radars in cyber–physical systems (CPS) are unable to achieve intelligence in CPSS due to an incomplete consideration of human involvement. For this consideration, we propose a novel framework of RadarVerses for smart radars in metaverses based on ACP-based parallel intelligence, which is also known as cyber–physical–social intelligence (CPSI). RadarVerses consist of five main parts which are physical radars, descriptive radars, predictive radars, prescriptive radars, and deep radars. To construct RadarVerses at the technical level, we introduce four main technical foundations: 1) communication technology; 2) scenarios engineering; 3) foundation models; and 4) digital workers. In addition, we also provide a case study about LiDARs’ predictive maintenance of accumulated snow in RadarVerses.},

However, compared with the extensive attention received by the metaverse, solutions defending against the threats have not kept pace. A major obstacle to such solutions is virtuality–reality-synthesized threats. Therefore, it is imperative to design new paradigms to defend the metaverse effectively. In this article, we advance a parallel system, dubbed ParaDefender, to defend the metaverse against emerging new threats effectively. Inspired by parallel intelligence, ParaDefender comprises artificial cyberspace, computational experiments, and parallel execution. The basic idea is to make artificial and real cyberspaces executed in parallel to mutually guide each other for enhanced security, wherein the parallel execution is scenario driven in the sense that the scenarios originate from all possible spatial–temporal combinations of security threats in the metaverse. We also demonstrate how to land ParaDefender onto real-world applications, including the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) security operation application in the industrial metaverse, and the social governance application.},

Powered by deep learning, metaverse is inevitably becoming more intelligent in the interactions between reality and virtuality. However, it is confronted with a nontrivial problem known as sim2real transfer when deep learning techniques try to bridge the reality gap between the physical world and simulations. In this article, we use multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) to implement collective intelligence for digital entities as well as their physical counterparts. To model the immersive environments in metaverse, we define a nonstationary variant of Markov games and propose a recurrent MARL solution to it. Based on the solution, MARL sim2real transfer that bridges real and virtual multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) systems is successfully conducted by employing recurrent multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (R-MADDPG) with the domain randomization technique. Additionally, we use perception-control modularization to improve the generalization performance of MARL policies and make training more efficient.},

In this article, we propose an artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel execution-based integrated inspection method in cyber–physical–social systems (CPSS) to realize smart manufacturing. In this inspection system, rather than simply performing modeling, analysis, and control, we perform descriptive intelligence to construct production processes with limited multimodal information, perform predictive intelligence to conduct defect detection and defect prediction, and perform prescriptive intelligence to achieve defect diagnosis and defect management. In this way, our inspection system could offer a learning and training platform for workers to master professional inspection skills, provide an experimentation and evaluation platform for product defect monitoring and early warnings, and supply guidance about defect management and control to improve manufacturing processes. For technical implementation, we leverage a Transformer-based foundation model to achieve knowledge reasoning and human–computer interaction. As a result, we provide an innovative solution to cope with the challenges of quality inspection in current smart manufacturing, and expect its further applications in the PCB industry.},

  abstract     = {Metaverse allows the physical reality to tightly integrate with the digital universe. As one typical metaverse application, platooning control of vehicular cyber–physical systems has attracted extensive attention as it is beneficial to improve traffic efficiency, driving safety, and emission reduction. However, due to the open nature of wireless communication networks, the transmitted vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) data packets become exposed to the public and concomitant data leakage can lead to unintended consequences to vehicular platoons. This article is concerned with the privacy-preserving platooning control issue of vehicular cyber–physical systems with input saturations. First, a novel distributed proportional-integral observer is proposed to estimate the full state of each vehicle, where the integral terms with a forgetting factor facilitate to realize the tradeoff between transient performance and steady-state performance for the platoon. Second, sampled-data-based dynamic encryption and decryption schemes, featuring a dynamic private key, are developed such that the encrypted and decrypted V2V data can be kept private to each platoon vehicle. It is then shown that the platooning control problem over a generic communication topology can be cast into the stability issue of an auxiliary dynamic system. Furthermore, sufficient conditions on the existence of the desired observer and controller gains as well as the private key parameter selection are derived to guarantee the desired platoon stability and privacy preservation requirements. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

Traditional industries heavily rely on human labor and neglect the development of collection–utilization–transmission integrated information loops, thereby leading to high costs and low efficiency in operational procedures. To facilitate the natural interactions and smart operations for humans and machines, industrial foundation models (IFMs) based on metaverses are proposed in this article, serving as the operating systems of industrial parallel machines that provide sustainable data resources and scenarios for management and control experiments. On this basis, IFM comprised of vision foundation models, language foundation models, as well as operational foundation models, are constructed to manage resources in industrial parallel machines and provides comprehensive services for industrial procedures. On the one hand, IFM can efficiently manage various resources including computing power, digital assets, enterprise resources, and platform I/O via the proposed CPSS-based competing, sharing, scheduling, monitoring, allocating, and recovering mechanisms. On the other hand, imaginative intelligence, linguistic intelligence, and algorithmic intelligence can be achieved through vivid visualization of vision foundation models, natural conversations of language foundation models, and smart manipulation of operational foundation models. With the proposed IFM, cyber–physical–social intelligence (CPSI) can be achieved to enhance the efficient management and control of industrial processes.},

  abstract     = {Replacing traffic signals with roadside vehicle-to-infrastructure systems in the era of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is promising. Managing CAVs in a signal-free intersection, known as autonomous intersection management (AIM), controls the driving behavior of each intersection-traverse CAV to maximize the throughput. Although AIM improves the gross throughput, the fairness of each individual vehicle in its right of way is not seriously considered. This study sets up an AIM system in the cyber–physical–social space to trade traverse priorities quantitatively and fairly. To that end, one needs an AIM method that is optimal and stable, otherwise no convincing trades of traverse priorities could be made. This study proposes a near-optimal lane-free AIM method based on numerical optimal control, wherein log-exp functions are deployed to convexify nondifferentiable collision-avoidance constraints. Besides that, a parameterized social force model (SFM) is proposed to provide a tunable initial guess for numerical optimal control. By tuning the urgency weights in SFM, one may get cooperative trajectories in different homotopy classes, which are further utilized to decide the amount of virtual currency to reward those CAVs who tend to share their traverse priorities. The overall method improves the traverse throughput with individual fairness respected. In experiencing this system, passengers learn how to behave with politeness when they drive manually. Experiments show the efficiency and robustness of the AIM method and also show the efficacy of the overall priority-sharing system.},

By combining the adding a power integrator technique with the common Lyapunov function method, a novel adaptive controller is proposed and a dynamic controller parameter is introduced to cope with the unknown system parameters. Besides, an effective common regulate rule is designed based on the improved fixed-time stability framework. Furthermore, it is shown that the controller parameter can be regulated online by the switching mechanism to compensate the unknown system parameters and the system states can converge to zero in fixed time under arbitrary switchings.

Considering randomly occurring DoS attacks, a sliding mode function related to the attack probability is constructed to analyze the impact of malicious attacks. Then, sufficient conditions under the equivalent DTSMC law are derived in view of the $\sigma $ -error mean square stability criterion. Furthermore, the synthesis problem of the proposed DTSMC law ensures that the resulting closed-loop system dynamics can be driven onto the prespecified sliding region within a limited time.

Second, a time-varying event-triggered control protocol with a dynamic triggering mechanism is adopted to save the communication resources with the satisfaction of state synchronization among agents at an exponential convergence rate. Additionally, a novel dynamic triggering mechanism that does not require continuous communication information among agents is further generated with more trigger times than before. Both dynamic triggering mechanisms show better superiority in excluding Zeno behavior and saving communication resources due to the embedding of a positive dynamic parameter in the triggering mechanisms.

  abstract     = {Broad learning system (BLS), a novel incremental learning algorithm, has attracted more and more attention and application. BLS achieves a perfect balance between learning performance and modeling efficiency based on the mean square error (MSE) criterion. However, MSE assumes that a random error between an observed value and real value is a Gaussian distribution, which may be inconsistent to the real-world situation. Moreover, the distributional assumptions may cast doubt on the generalization and validity of the built BLS model. In this article, we propose a novel distribution-free BLS for regression analysis, called broad minimax probability learning system (BMPLS). Learning from the idea of minimax probability machine regression, BMPLS builds a regression model by maximizing the worst probability of the regression function being within the allowed error range. It adequately utilizes the mean and covariance information of the hidden-space feature without making any distributional assumptions of the random error. In order to further improve the learning performance of the model, a regularized BMPLS (RBMPLS) is proposed by applying elastic-net regularization term to BMPLS. The corresponding optimization algorithm is also designed for calculating the output weights of the model. Multiple experiments based on public datasets were carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithms.},

This accelerates transfer learning and unsupervised intelligent creatures while eliminating the domain-specific knowledge constraint. Most previously developed approaches are demonstrated to suffer from collapsing into the situation where one subpolicy dominates the whole task, since they cannot ensure the diversity of different subpolicies. In contrast, this article proposes a task-agnostic regularizer (TAR) for learning diverse subpolicies in HRL. Specifically, we first formulate the discovery of diverse subpolicies as a trajectory inference problem and then propose a corresponding information-theoretic objective to encourage diversity. Subsequently, considering computability, we instantiate the objective as two simplifications for discrete and continuous action spaces. We extensively evaluate the proposed diversity-driven regularizer on three HRL task domains: 1) meta reinforcement learning; 2) hierarchical policy learning in the option framework; and 3) unsupervised subpolicy discovery. The extensive results obtained show that our TAR approach can improve upon the state-of-the-art performance on all three HRL domains without modifying any existing hyperparameters, indicating the wide applicability and robustness of our approach.},

There are two reasons for presenting this issue: 1) most of the existing event-trigger schemes do not take the historical state information into account and, therefore, may have some conservatism in reducing the number of triggering times and 2) the existing Lyapunov functionals cannot be directly utilized in the stability analysis of the resulting closed-loop system in this article. Motivated by the above-mentioned considerations, an MBET scheme, in which a time-memory term and an exponential decaying term are incorporated into the threshold function, is newly designed. It is beneficial to enlarging the intertrigger intervals and, thus, can further reduce the transmission of sampled data packets. Taking the features of MBET into consideration, a novel piecewise but continuous functional is constructed. On this basis, Lyapunov stability theory and some inequality estimation techniques are used to develop three linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)-based synchronization criteria and, meanwhile, a co-design for the control gain and the triggering matrix is carried out. Finally, some comparative analyses are provided to demonstrate the advantages of the MBET through an example of Chua’s circuit. Also, the application to information safety is given to verify the effectiveness of the synchronization results by using a 3-neuron neural network.},

In this article, we propose a safe screening rule (SSR) for RSVM to improve its training speed. This is the first attempt to construct SSR for multilabel learning problems. SSR for RSVM can screen and delete most of the instances based on their relevant–irrelevant label pairs, which is the biggest difference in the existing SSR. After this process, the scale of RSVM can be substantially reduced before solving it. The sequential version of SSR for RSVM is further introduced to accelerate the whole parameter tuning process. One important advantage of SSR is that it is safe, which means we can obtain the same optimal solution as the original problem by utilizing it. Extensive experiments with five benchmark datasets, three large-scale datasets, and one type 2 diabetes dataset show that our approach is efficient and safe.},

In the proposed algorithm, a preprocessing phase is adopted that includes segmented fields splitting and merging, to shrink the operation field number (i.e., multi-UASs total sorties) and ensure that each generated field area remains smaller than (but close to) the unmanned aerial system (UAS) maximum single-sortie operation area. An improved one-sortie coverage path generation model is established, avoiding power waste in the case when UAS needs to operate on more than one subfield in one sortie. The integer PSO is then used to optimize the initial assignment for UASs on multibases, with the purpose of reducing total operation time and nonoperation flight distance of overall coverage path planning. The proposed algorithm solves the problems of how to design pesticide spraying coverage path on segmented agricultural fields with several bases, and allocate to multiple plant protection UASs with constrained loading capacity. Computer simulations are provided to validate the effectiveness of our algorithms and the performance compared with other algorithms. The test results show that the total number of flight sorties using nested GA (53) is smaller than that using some representative metaheuristic algorithms (57), density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (60), and traditional planning methods (83). Both nonoperation distance and total operation time obtained by nest GA and integer PSO are smaller than those using other planning methods. The appearance of multibases loading pesticide and power, would reduce the nonspraying flight energy and operation time wastage of UASs.},

In this article, a constructive method of control scheme is proposed such that any given MJBNS is controllable, which covers some existing results as special cases. The design of controllers here includes presenting the control sequence as well as the construction of the logical relationship between the control nodes and system nodes. In addition, the design of controllers is based on the local neighbors’ information at the initial time instant without calculating the original transition matrix, which will dramatically reduce the computational complexity when steering MJBNs from the given initial value to the given desired state. Compared with the existing results, the proposed control protocol has some advantages since we do not need to know which subsystem the MJBN switched to in the previous time step, which is necessary for some previous literature.

Among them, the well-known relationship-related (RR) method makes use of the sum rule and the product rule from the perspective of the network explosive percolation. However, the RR method needs to carefully consider all nodes within a network, leading to high computational time. To close this gap, we propose the fringe node set: it is applied to an immunization strategy such as RR to remove noncritical nodes before optimizing the node sequence. Besides adapting this algorithm for strategies, such as RR and degree centrality strategy, we further propose a novel reconstruction method (RM) under the percolation perspective, which ranks critical nodes by measuring their contribution to the giant component in the network reconstruction or node reoccupying process. Experimental results based on our proposed identification method have demonstrated the feasibility of using the fringe node set. The competitive advantage of our proposed RM is also demonstrated in comparison with other existing methods.},

The discrete event-triggered fault-tolerant controller compensates for the influence of system faults by using state estimators and fault estimators.

Both partial loss-of-effectiveness (LOE) and lock-in-place (LIP) faults of actuators are investigated. An adaptive control strategy based on a Nussbaum-type function and neural networks is presented by introducing a backstepping approach to make the system output track a desired reference output signal with bounded tracking error in the case of faulty actuators. The effect of the limited resolution is decoupled from the nonlinear system and is approximated using a neural network. The impact of disturbances is effectively compensated by utilizing adaptive parameter estimation terms in the backstepping procedure. It is proven that the proposed FTTC strategy can ensure the boundedness of all signals and guarantee that the output tracking error can converge into a small neighborhood of the origin. Two simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed FTTC strategy.},

  abstract     = {Featured with high power density, excellent flexibility, shock absorption capacity, etc., pneumatic muscles (PMs) promote the development of exoskeleton robots and rehabilitation equipment. However, the complex nonlinearities of PMs limit efficiency optimization in closed-loop control, while the force-displacement coupling, soft materials, deficient workspace, etc., make it more difficult to simultaneously increase motion speeds and ensure the safety of multiple PM-actuated (PMA) robots. Although force sensors can currently be replaced by applying state estimation techniques, the amplification effects of measurement noises still compromise control accuracy and stability in practice. To this end, this article proposes a reinforcement learning-based robust motion control method with the prescribed performance, which achieves efficient and satisfactory tracking control for PMA robotic arms. In particular, by elaborately incorporating an integral term, a robust generalized proportional integral observer is used to eliminate measurement noises. Meanwhile, by using an actor–critic network to optimize control performance, an error-transformation-based continuous controller is designed to guarantee the uniformly ultimately boundedness of tracking errors. Compared with most existing methods, this article provides the first solution to restrict the entire transient and steady-state performance of PMA robotic arms, improve the noise suppression capability, and optimize the control efficiency simultaneously. Finally, complete stability analysis based on Lyapunov techniques is provided, and several groups of hardware experiments demonstrate the practicability and robustness of the proposed method.},

Specifically, based on robust exact differentiators, a finite-time state observer (FTSO) is first developed to recover the unavailable velocities while estimating the total disturbances containing model uncertainties and environmental disturbances. Next, with the aid of estimated velocities from FTSO, a nominal finite-time guidance law is designed for achieving the distributed formation of MSVs at the kinematic level. By the forward invariance principle, finite-time control barrier functions (FTCBFs) are used to construct the collision-free velocity sets for the multi-MSV system. To unify the control and safety objectives, quadratic optimization problems are formulated under collision-free velocity sets and velocity constraints. To facilitate real-time implementations, one-layer recurrent neural networks are employed to solve the quadratic optimization problem. Then, a nominal finite-time control law based on FTSO is presented at the kinetic level. The optimal control laws are solved within the input constraints. All error signals of the closed-loop system are proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded, and the distributed formation of multiple MSVs is ensured to be safe.

In order to solve such a problem, we propose a belief shift clustering (BSC) method for dealing with object data. The BSC method is considered as the evidential version of mean shift or mode seeking under the theory of belief functions. First, a new notion, called belief shift, is provided to preliminarily assign each query object as the noise, precise, or imprecise one. Second, a new evidential clustering rule is designed to partial credal redistribution for each imprecise object. To avoid the “uniform effect” and useless calculations, a specific dynamic framework with simulated cluster centers is established to reassign each imprecise object to a singleton cluster or related meta-cluster. Once an object is assigned to a meta-cluster, this object may be in the overlapping or intermediate areas of different singleton clusters. Consequently, the BSC can reasonably characterize the uncertainty and imprecision between singleton clusters. The effectiveness has been verified on several artificial, natural, and image segmentation/classification datasets by comparison with other related methods.},

This article deals with the cooperation behavior, especially interval bipartite synchronization (IBS) of delayed nonlinear neural networks (NNs) with signed graphs. A generalized matrix is proposed for the construction of the Lyapunov functionals, establishing sufficient conditions in a linear matrix inequality related to the coupling strength, the delays, and the network structure. It suggests that the negative rooted cycles and the negative nonrooted cycles take an important part in stabilizing delayed nonlinear NNs and leading to their diversity, and time delays, especially communication delays, significantly impact cooperation performance.

First, a novel integral barrier Lyapunov functions (IBLFs)-based neural backstepping control approach is designed, which circumvents the trouble of conversion in the traditional used BLFs. And then, the sliding-mode disturbance observers (SMDOs) are established to deal with the immeasurable disturbances in each order of the state-constrained uncertain nonlinear systems. Besides, the dynamic threshold-based event-sampling mechanism is constructed to deal with the sparsity of resources and system controlling burden. Finally, according to the given design approach, an event-triggered adaptive controller is developed and ensures disturbance observation errors uniformly converge to the origin in finite time, and all the signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded. A developed numerical simulation case verifies the validity of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) transform a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) into a set of subproblems and then optimize them collaboratively. When two adjacent objective vectors are similar but the difference in the corresponding decision vectors is large, it is difficult to transfer from a solution of one subproblem to solutions of its neighboring subproblems. In this article, we argue that the key to overcoming this difficulty is the evaluation assignment for different subproblems based on local density and global utility. We propose a local-density measurement model to estimate the solution density around each subproblem. Based on the model, a local-diversity evaluation assignment strategy for the decomposition-based MOEA is designed to assign fitness evaluations among different subproblems. Two discrete MOPs are selected as test instances for experiments because they satisfy the premise that the difference in the corresponding decision vectors of adjacent objective vectors is large. Experimental results indicate that the proposed strategy enhances the population diversity. Besides, the combination of the proposed strategy and the evaluation assignment for high global utility subproblems can overcome the difficulty in transferring from a solution of one subproblem to solutions of its neighboring subproblems. The results also verify that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art evaluation assignment MOEAs regarding the inverted generational distance and the hypervolume metrics.},

  abstract     = {Objective value estimation based on computationally efficient surrogate models is widely used to reduce the computational cost in solving expensive multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). However, due to the scarcity of training data and the lack of data sharing between training tasks in a surrogate-based system, the estimation effectiveness of the surrogate models might not be satisfactory. In this study, we present a novel surrogate methodology based on information transfer to deal with this problem. Particularly, in the proposed framework, the objectives of an MOP that may have little apparent similarity or correlation are linearly mapped to a number of related tasks. Afterward, the related tasks are used to train a multitask Gaussian process (MTGP). MTGP expands the training data leading to more confident learning of the parameters of the model. The predicted values of the objective functions can be obtained by a reverse mapping from the learned MTGP model. In this way, the computational burden of the expensive objective functions of an MOP can be substantially reduced while maintaining good estimation accuracy. MTGP facilitates mutual information transfer across tasks, avoids learning from scratch for new tasks, and captures the underlying structural information between tasks. The proposed surrogate approach is merged into MOEA/D to address MOPs. Experimental tests under various scenarios indicate that the resultant algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art surrogate-based multiobjective optimization algorithms.},

This article investigates the problem of containment for a weighted multiagent network with continuous-time agents under state constraints. The network is composed of uninformed and informed agents, where the latter receive external inputs. A new general class of distributed nonlinear controllers is designed for accomplishing both containment and consensus tracking, where the state of each agent is required to stay in its desired convex constraint set. We show that, by using matrix analysis, convex analysis, and Lyapunov theory, all agents eventually converge to the convex hull formed by the external inputs while they obey their constraints during the transience. No relationship is assumed between the convex hull and the intersection of all constraint sets. The consensus tracking problem with a single external input is also solved under this framework. As a generalization, we tackle the multiscaled constrained containment problem, where agents can specify their desired buffer zones by either zooming in or zooming out the convex hull. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.},

To this end, an adaptive control scheme is first proposed with a robust sliding mode-like term to handle the unknown bounded external disturbances. In addition, an auxiliary system is designed by using the sampled neighboring information to achieve resilience to DoS attacks. Sufficient conditions are presented by using Lyapunov and small-gain approaches.

Aiming at the above problem, this article presents two dual-level model predictive control (MPC) algorithms for multitimescale dynamical systems with unknown bounded disturbances and input constraints. The proposed algorithms, each one composed of two regulators working in slow and fast time scales, are designed to generate closed-loop separable dynamics at high and low levels. As a prominent feature, the proposed algorithms are not only suitable for singularly perturbed systems but also capable of imposing separable closed-loop performance for dynamics that are nonseparable and strongly coupled. The recursive feasibility and convergence properties are proven under suitable assumptions. The simulation results on controlling a boiler turbine (BT) system, including the comparisons with other classic controllers, are demonstrated, which show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

Generally, it is very difficult to identify the faults of systems under the influence of the closed-loop feedback link. The existence of redundancy improves the reliability of the system. Meanwhile, it also poses new challenges to the fault diagnosis of multiple redundant systems. In this regard, a causality-based method is proposed for the fault diagnosis of closed-loop feedback control system with multiple modular redundancy. The dynamic Bayesian networks for fault diagnosis are established based on sensor data and system parameters. The networks consist of four layers, which are sensors, performances, monitors, and faults, respectively. Furthermore, the conditional probabilities of the fault nodes are calculated by Noisy-OR and Noisy-MAX models. The proposed method can dynamically evaluate system performance and integrate other monitoring information as evidence to assist faults diagnosis and location. A double modular redundant control system for a subsea blowout preventer is used as a case to demonstrate the proposed method, and the results show that the proposed method has high accuracy. The influence of sampling frequency, noise, and redundancy mode on diagnosis results is studied and discussed in the case study.},

It is shown that the proposed control scheme can always ensure safety in the identification process with injected excitation noise. Besides, the elementwise identification process using DREM can minimize the theoretical conservatism of the safe adaptation law compared to other existing adaptive CBF (aCBF) algorithms. The stability of the proposed safe control scheme is proven, where the safety is guaranteed by constructing appropriate forward invariant aCBF. Furthermore, the robustness of our algorithms under bounded disturbances is analyzed. Finally, the proposed framework is tested on two simulation-based examples, including the adaptive cruise control problem where the slope resistance of the following vehicle is robustly estimated in finite time against small disturbances, and the potential crash risk is avoided by our safe control scheme.

Different from general switching BN, the structure matrices of all subsystems are independent with each other, structure matrices of all subsystems for the high dimensional switching BN depend on the original BN structure matrix. Pinning control is designed to guarantee the global stochastic stability of the considered system. Furthermore, the global stochastic stability of BN with time delay parameter is proved to be equivalent to the stability of BN without time delay parameter, which greatly reduces the computational complexity and simplifies the control design. For the considered BN with finite cycles, constrained pinning control is applied with limitation that only one state of each undesired cycle is under control. With this constraint, the minimal number of pinning control nodes is further investigated.

  abstract     = {With the advent of the big data era and the timeliness requirements of data processing, a large amount of streaming industrial big data is continuously obtained in real time. Facing this kind of flowing and time-varying knowledge information form, incremental learning is necessary. Lifelong learning (LL), as a typical incremental learning method, can continuously retain and accumulate old knowledge while learning new knowledge, which is very suitable for streaming industrial big data scenarios. At the same time, Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models can adjust the complexity of the model based on observation data. Motivated by ideas of BNP and LL, a lifelong Bayesian learning machines framework is proposed in this article, which includes model expansion and model optimization. In general, this framework not only learns new effective knowledge and accumulates knowledge through incremental variational Bayesian under model expansion but also uses optimization steps to avoid model degradation caused by unnecessary component information. As an example, Dirichlet processes Gaussian mixture regression (DPGMR) is utilized for process modeling under this framework. To evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of the developed method, a synthetic and a real industrial case are demonstrated.},

Utilizing the notion of generalized common Lyapunov strictly positive realness (CL-SPRness), the equivalence between strictly positive realness (SPRness) and strictly bounded realness (SBRness) is established; and then, the specifications on robust stability and performance are transformed into the SPRness of newly constructed systems and further characterized in the framework of linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions. The proposed methodology avoids the tedious yet mandatory evaluations of the specifications on all vertices of the uncertain polytopic system in an explicit form. Instead, solving five LMIs exclusively suffices for ensuring the robust stability and performance regardless of the number of vertices, and thus, the typically heavy computational burden is considerably alleviated. It is also noteworthy that the proposed methodology additionally provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for this robust controller design with the consideration of a prescribed finite frequency range, and therefore, significantly less conservatism is attained in the system performance.},

In the outer loop, the adaptive $\varepsilon $ -constraint method adaptively adjusts the choice of the parameters $\varepsilon $ , which transfers MODOP into a sequence of single-objective dynamic optimization problems (SODOPs) with extra inequality constraints. In the inner loop, two different algorithms are used to solve the single-objective optimization problems. The first algorithm guarantees that the path constraints can be satisfied with any finite prescribed tolerance by replacing path constraints with a finite number of point constraints. Furthermore, the second algorithm guarantees that the path constraints are rigorously satisfied by enforcing the path constraints at a limited number of time points and by restricting the right-hand side of the path constraints. The proposed algorithms are proven to converge within finite iterations. The effectiveness of the algorithms is verified via numerical studies, along with a comparison to a state-of-the-art algorithm.},

In this article, a novel nonlinear single-master–multislave (SMMS) teleoperation control framework is proposed for multiple mobile agents to achieve obstacles avoidance under delays, nonlinearities, various uncertainties, and nonholonomic constraints. Namely, the slave trajectory planner is designed to cope with the nonholonomic constraints caused by underactuated characteristics of slave agents, while the slave obstacle avoidance planner is designed to cope with obstacles in the environment, which can avoid the obstacles by artificial potential function (APF)-based obstacle avoidance algorithm. Particularly, considering that the APF usually encounters the local-minima problem, a leader selection algorithm is designed for the slave obstacle avoidance planner and a virtual force feedback is designed for the master subsystem, where the slave agents can get rid of local-minima points while teleoperated by human operator with confident force feedback. The global stability of the overall system can be guaranteed under the proposed radial basis function neural network (RBFNN)-based adaptive sliding mode master controller and slave formation controller under delays, nonlinearities and various uncertainties. The comparative experiment is implemented, and the results show the effectiveness of proposed control framework in the achievement of good performance including position tracking, force feedback, and formation and obstacles avoidance while the stability is guaranteed.},

If the time intervals between impulses are bounded, the ISS of time-delay systems can be ensured even though hybrid impulses exist in each subsystem, which determines the robustness of stable time-delay systems with respect to hybrid impulses. The unstable time-delay systems with different subdynamics can be stabilized in input-to-state-stability sense by involving hybrid impulses. In addition, several extended criteria are presented to bridge the results derived via vector Lyapunov function, scalar Lyapunov function, and comparison principle.

  abstract     = {The no-wait flow-shop scheduling problem (NFSSP) with sequence-dependent setup times (SDSTs) and release times (RTs) is applicable in many areas, such as steel production, food processing, and chemical processing. Estimation of the distribution algorithm (EDA) has recently been recognized as a prominent metaheuristic methodology in the field of evolutionary computation due to its excellent performance of global exploration. In this article, an innovative matrix-cube-based (i.e., 3-D) EDA (MCEDA) is first proposed to minimize the total earliness and tardiness (TET) of the NFSSP with SDSTs and RTs. This problem is NP-hard in the strong sense. First, a 3-D matrix cube is devised to learn the valuable information from promising solutions or excellent individuals. Second, an EDA model or probabilistic model based on the matrix cube and a special sampling method is presented to perform effective exploration in solution space and find promising regions. Third, based on a series of newly defined subneighborhoods, a new local search with both a speed-up scanning method and one search strategy is developed to execute exploitation from promising regions. Fourth, a speed-up evaluation method based on the problem’s property is designed to reduce the computational complexity for calculating criterion and accelerate the search process. Owing to the reasonable hybridization of exploration and exploitation, MCEDA can perform very efficient search in solution space. Extensive test results on instances of such a just-in-time problem first show that MCEDA can achieve better solution than state-of-the-art algorithms in obviously less computation time. Additional experiments on instances of various NFSSPs further confirm the efficiency and robustness of MCEDA.},

In this model, cloud-enabled vehicles bid for resources at a high level, inducing a multiplayer game; at a low level, each vehicle performs an onboard resource optimization to allocate its obtained resources to its cloud-based applications. The Nash equilibrium of the induced game is defined, and we show the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium. A constrained optimization problem is solved for onboard resource allocation. A distributed update mechanism is considered: asynchronized update where only a subset of vehicles updates their bid at each iteration. This mechanism shares desired features of requiring little communication and being secure. Convergence to Nash equilibrium is proved for the proposed update mechanism. Furthermore, the robustness to stochastic task arrival rate is characterized in terms of total variance distance. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.},

First, considering the decay of trust through its propagation process, a discount-factor-based 2-tuple linguistic trust propagation operator is proposed to estimate the unknown trust relationships among experts. Then, the harmony degrees are measured based on opinion discrepancies and 2-tuple linguistic trust values, and experts’ weights could be obtained. To improve the consensus levels of the inconsistent experts, a minimum adjustment cost consensus model considering harmony degrees is explored to generate interval recommendations. The existence of optimal solutions and the convergence of the proposed consensus model are also proved. Finally, the validity of the proposed consensus framework is verified by the case of base station selection. With the higher overall harmony degree and individual consensus level, we extend the classical minimum cost consensus model and incorporate the harmony degrees among experts into the consensus reaching process.},

  abstract     = {It is inevitable that resource failures occur in real production processes, and sometimes many different types of unreliable resource failures may occur. Once there are resource failures, the stagnation states of production caused by these failures, called as failure blockings (FBs), tend to appear. Hence, both deadlocks and FBs can arise to reduce production efficiency sharply. Designing robust control policies for such an automated system is thus very important. Our work focuses on a novel robust Petri net controller of flexible manufacturing systems with multitype and multiunit of unreliable resources. First, under the assumption that all resources are reliable, these systems are modeled by a class of Petri nets called systems of simple sequential processes with resources (S3PRs). For each operation place that is a holder of an unreliable resource, the corresponding repair place and related transitions are added to the net and an S3PR with unreliable resources (S3PRu) is developed. For an S3PRu, the formal definition of FBs is then proposed. Such an FB is characterized by a maximal perfect resource-transition circuit (MPC). Next, the concept of a critical set of MPCs is introduced. For any two adjacent MPCs in such a critical set, one input transition of the former and one output transition of the latter are connected by passing through resource places. A $\xi $ -resource is a one-unit resource shared by two or more MPCs that do not contain each other. For an S3PRu without $\xi $ -resources and critical sets of MPCs, a control place corresponding to an MPC is added to the net with its output arcs to the input transitions of the MPC. However, for an S3PRu with $\xi $ -resources or critical sets of MPCs, the output arcs of each control place are added to the source transitions of the original net. Thus, a novel robust controller of an S3PRu is synthesized. Such a robust controller can guarantee that as long as at least one unit of each type of unreliable resources can work normally, all kinds of parts can be processed to complete smoothly their tasks through any one of their process routes. Finally, three examples are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed robust controller.},

However, due to some reasons, there exist communication delays while agents receive information from other agents, and we are going to seek the optimal value of the sum of agents’ loss functions in this case. We desire to handle this problem with the push-sum distributed dual averaging (PS-DDA) algorithm. We study the effects of communication delays on the convergence results of the PS-DDA algorithm and propose an explicit bound on the convergence rate. It is proved that this algorithm converges, and the convergence result of the PS-DDA algorithm will be worse as the maximum delay value on one edge becomes larger. Our analysis indicates that the PS-DDA algorithm can converge at a rate of ${\mathcal {O}}(T^{-0.5})$ with proper step size, where $T$ is iteration span. We finally apply the theoretical results to numerical simulations to show the PS-DDA algorithm’s performance.},

  abstract     = {This article develops a distributed economic model predictive control (EMPC) method which is applied in a group of interconnected linear subsystems subject to unknown bounded disturbances. Multiple subsystems are coupled through the dynamics, and the control objective is to optimize some general performance criteria of the whole system which may take economic considerations into account. First, a two operation modes EMPC optimization problem is formulated, which incorporates the constraints derived from the Lyapunov technique. In the first mode, each subsystem focuses on the optimization of the economic performance while maintaining the state in a certain region. In the second mode, the system states are steered to a neighborhood of a steady state by making use of the Lyapunov-based constraints. Furthermore, a consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is adopted to solve the model predictive control optimization problems with a coupled predicted model constraint in a distributed way. By introducing consensus constraints, the resulting local optimization problem does not depend on real-time optimal solutions from neighboring subsystems and allows subsystems to solve it in parallel. Moreover, the closed-loop system is ensured to be input-to-state stable (ISS) with respect to the disturbances. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, we conduct numerical simulations on a thermal power interconnected system.},

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimizer (PSO) is an optimization technique that has been applied to solve various problems. In its variants, hierarchical learning and variable population are two commonly used learning strategies. The former is used to employ more potentially good particles to lead the swarm, which is very effective in the early search phase. However, in the later search phase, such mechanism impedes PSO’s convergence. This work proposes an adaptive particle swarm optimizer combining hierarchical learning with variable population (PSO-HV), in which a heap-based hierarchy is first proposed to organize particles to hierarchically learn from the ones with better fitness in the same and upper levels. The levels of particles are determined and updated according to their current fitness in each iteration. Meanwhile, an adaptive variable population strategy is introduced and eliminates redundant particles based on the population’s evolution state. In this way, the swarm is more explorative upon the hierarchical structure and improves its exploitation capability due to the variable population mechanism. Ten state-of-the-art PSO contenders, including two hierarchical ones and two variable population-based ones, are compared with the proposed method on 57 benchmark functions and the experimental results verify its effectiveness and efficiency.},

To address this problem, we propose a new class of efficient nonlinear models for online applications. The proposed algorithms are based on linear-in-the-parameters (LIPs) nonlinear filters using functional link expansions. In order to make this class of functional link adaptive filters (FLAFs) efficient, we propose low-complexity expansions and frequency-domain adaptation of the parameters. Among this family of algorithms, we also define the partitioned-block frequency-domain FLAF (FD-FLAF), whose implementation is particularly suitable for online nonlinear modeling problems. We assess and compare FD-FLAFs with different expansions providing the best possible tradeoff between performance and computational complexity. Experimental results prove that the proposed algorithms can be considered as an efficient and effective solution for online applications, such as the acoustic echo cancellation, even in the presence of adverse nonlinear conditions and with limited availability of computational resources.},

Products from manufacturers could be temporarily stored at the supply hub in industrial park (SHIP), and consolidated into one or more vehicles to be delivered to their retail distribution centers. This article discusses how SHIP and heterogeneous manufacturers interact to optimize their decisions on consolidated transportation service pricing and consolidation schedules. An all-unit multiple-breakpoint quantity discount pricing scheme is adopted. This problem is modeled as a bilevel program where the SHIP is treated as the leader and manufacturers as followers. Optimal properties of the proposed model are analyzed and the global optimal solution is derived. Numerical studies are conducted to examine the effectiveness of this pricing scheme through comparing with the regular transportation price under various circumstances. The results show that the SHIP operator could always increase profit by using this pricing scheme, while manufacturers’ performances are not affected. Among heterogeneous manufacturers with various production capabilities and resources, the SHIP could gain the largest profit increase through adopting quantity discount pricing from medium-sized manufacturers.},

A multivariable finite-time prescribed performance control scheme is proposed, where the norm of the tracking error vector is constrained with a prescribed bound. Due to the positiveness of the norm of the error vector, a novel error transformation is given to transform the “constrained” problem into an equivalent “unconstrained” problem. Meanwhile, the composite neural adaptive law is established to attenuate the effect of multisource uncertainties. The parametric perturbations are counteracted by neural adaptive terms. Time-varying uncertain control gains and external disturbances in the multivariable systems are compensated by adaptively estimating their bounds and applying the Lyapunov control design. To tackle the practical tracking problem, the aforementioned method is integrated into a dynamic-surface-based backstepping framework. Additionally, the practical quaternion-based attitude tracking problem is addressed, in which a quaternion-based form of error-norm constraint is constructed to express the generality and scalability of our proposed.},

In order to suppress the measurement outliers and estimate the disturbances, a stubborn extended-state observer (ESO) is developed by utilizing a saturation-type gain function.

Two AFD schemes are developed via the deterministic learning method (DLM). In the first scheme, knowledge of the system dynamics and actuator fault dynamics is extracted from state signals by using DLM. The learned knowledge is utilized to construct a bank of estimators. When the residual norm of a fault estimator becomes smaller than that of the nominal estimator, the occurrence of the actuator fault is deduced. In the second scheme, a learning controller is constructed to identify the feedback control dynamics under normal and fault conditions. The knowledge of the feedback control dynamics is utilized to construct a bank of controllers, which are embedded in a bank of estimators. When the residual norm of the estimator embedded with the matched controller becomes smaller than that of the estimator embedded with the nominal controller, the actuator fault can be detected. Finally, the properties of constant neural networks and the persistent excitation condition are exploited to derive the detectability conditions for diagnosis schemes. The attraction of this article is that two knowledge-bank-based AFD schemes are developed, in which the knowledge extracted from state and controller signals will enhance the sensitivity to actuator faults. Simulation results are also included to illustrate the effectiveness of these schemes.},

Owing to the leader–follower mechanism, the proposed LFPSO algorithm not only maintains the diversity of the particle population but also improves the possibility of escaping from the locally optimal solution. It is demonstrated via experimental results that the proposed LFPSO algorithm significantly improves the accuracy and convergence rate of conventional particle swarm optimization algorithms.

A distributed FC control scheme under the DET mechanism is proposed for all the leaders and followers based on the available relative outputs. The purpose of the addressed problem is to design the FC controller such that all the leaders achieve a formation shape and all the followers converge into such a convex hull. To this end, the considered DT-MASs are first decoupled into a diagonal form by resorting to the property of the Laplacian matrix as well as the inequality technique. Then, two sufficient conditions are established to ensure the desired FC performance. Furthermore, the corresponding FC controller parameters are obtained in terms of the solutions to two matrix inequalities which only depend on the maximum and minimum nonzero eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix.

  abstract     = {A large number of real-world systems generate graphs that are structured data aligned with nodes and edges. Graphs are usually dynamic in many scenarios, where nodes or edges keep evolving over time. Recently, graph representation learning (GRL) has received great success in network analysis, which aims to produce informative and representative features or low-dimensional embeddings by exploring node attributes and network topology. Most state-of-the-art models for dynamic GRL are composed of a static representation learning model and a recurrent neural network (RNN). The former generates the representations of a graph or nodes from one static graph at a discrete time step, while the latter captures the temporal correlation between adjacent graphs. However, the two-stage design ignores the temporal dynamics between contiguous graphs during the learning processing of graph representations. To alleviate this problem, this article proposes a representation learning model for dynamic graphs, called DynGNN. Differently, it is a single-stage model that embeds an RNN into a graph neural network to produce better representations in a compact form. This takes the fusion of temporal and topology correlations into account from low-level to high-level feature learning, enabling the model to capture more fine-grained evolving patterns. From the experimental results on both synthetic and real-world networks, the proposed DynGNN yields significant improvements in multiple tasks compared to the state-of-the-art counterparts.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we analyze the adverse effects of cyber–physical attacks as well as mitigate their impacts on the event-triggered distributed Kalman filter (DKF). We first show that although event-triggered mechanisms are highly desirable, the attacker can leverage the event-triggered mechanism to cause nontriggering misbehavior, which significantly harms the network connectivity and its collective observability. We also show that an attacker can mislead the event-triggered mechanism to achieve continuous-triggering misbehavior, which not only drains the communication resources but also harms the network’s performance. An information-theoretic approach is presented next to detect attacks on both sensors and communication channels. In contrast to the existing results, the restrictive Gaussian assumption on the attack signal’s probability distribution is not required. To mitigate attacks, a meta-Bayesian approach is presented that incorporates the outcome of the attack detection mechanism to perform second-order inference. The proposed second-order inference forms confidence and trust values about the truthfulness or legitimacy of sensors’ own estimates and those of their neighbors, respectively. Each sensor communicates its confidence to its neighbors. Sensors then incorporate the confidence they receive from their neighbors and the trust they formed about their neighbors into their posterior update laws to successfully discard corrupted information. Finally, the simulation result validates the effectiveness of the presented resilient event-triggered DKF.},

  abstract     = {This article discusses the fault estimation (FE) problem of nonlinear fractional-order (FO) systems subject to faults and unknown inputs through the T–S fuzzy approach. A novel fuzzy FO unknown input observer is well synthesized to not only achieve the desired FE but also decouple the unknown input in contrast to the traditional integer-order observer design technique. It is worth pointing out that the provided FE scheme can reconstruct the fault signal appearing in both input and output equations simultaneously. Furthermore, by resorting to linear matrix inequalities, the stability criteria of observation error dynamics are first formulated based on general quadratic Lyapunov functions, which are further extended via fuzzy Lyapunov functions containing the information of membership functions. Finally, the performance of theoretical results is verified through two elaborate examples.},

  abstract     = {In group decision making (GDM), consensus level is regarded as a critical criterion to measure the effectiveness and availability of the final group decision solution. Consensus model is aimed at conducting the decision group to reach agreement through the process of group negotiation, advice feedback, and opinion modification, which is time-consuming and rests with the willingness and behavior of individual decision makers. Thus, to guide the shift in the opinions of decision makers within a limited time, it is essential to design an effective, interpretable, and fair consensus mechanism in GDM, which is particularly vital when a mass of decision makers (e.g., more than 30) are involved in the decision process, viz., we encounter a large-scale GDM (LSGDM). With the involvement of information granulation, this study presents a rule-based consensus model in LSGDM by optimally allocating the level of information granularity to each decision maker. The opinions of decision makers in LSGDM are divided into different clusters by engaging the fuzzy $C$ -means method. Inspired by a generic fuzzy rule-based model, the radius of the individual preference granule (PG) is calculated by a weighted linear combination of the granularity levels allocated to the clusters. Then, a consensus model with the optimal allocation of information granularity (CMOIG) is built to determine the granularity level for each cluster by minimizing the sum of radii of individual PG. An interactive consensus reaching process is proposed with the proposed CMOIG and fuzzy modification rules. The CMOIG and fuzzy modification rules simultaneously guarantees high efficiency and interpretability, and the generation method of PGs leads to high fairness due to low discrepancy among the decision group. Finally, numerical and comparative experiments are conducted in detail to verify the validity and superiority of the presented models in terms of the efficiency, interpretability, and fairness.},

Since the covariance of the Lévy noise is unknown and infinite, the standard Kalman filter fails to estimate system states. By exploiting saturation functions, a modified Kalman filter is proposed, where the extremely large values of the measurement outputs caused by the Lévy noises can be clipped. In the presence of Lévy noise and cyber attacks, an upper bound for the error covariance is guaranteed and can be minimized via designing the filter parameter. Besides, a sufficient condition is provided to guarantee the boundedness of the upper bound, and the convergence analysis of the filtering error is presented. Finally, the simulation results are given to verify the algorithm.},

In addition, the perturbation can affect the sample data and cause unstable inference results. As such, in this article, a new ER rule with likelihood analysis and perturbation analysis (PA) is proposed based on the maximum likelihood ER (MAKER). The likelihood analysis is used to acquire probabilistic evidence from the sample data. The interdependence index of evidence is defined on the marginal probability and joint probability. A parameter optimization model is established based on the maximum likelihood (ML). The PA is conducted on the proposed ER rule to study its robustness, and a generalized PA method is explored to facilitate its potential applications.

  abstract     = {Domain adaptation (DA) aims to accomplish tasks on unlabeled target data by learning and transferring knowledge from related source domains. In order to learn a discriminative and domain-invariant model, a critical step is to align source and target data well and thus reduce their distribution divergence. But existing DA methods mainly align the global feature distributions in distorted original space, which neglects their fine-grained local information and intrinsic geometrical structures. Moreover, some methods rely heavily on pseudo-labels to align features, which may undermine adaptation performance and lead to negative transfer. We propose an efficient discriminative manifold distribution alignment (DMDA) approach, which improves feature transferability by aligning both global and local distributions and refines a discriminative model by learning geometrical structures in manifold space. In addition, when learning geometrical structures, DMDA is exempt from the uncertainty and error brought by pseudo-labels of a target domain. It is very concise and efficient to be implemented by integrating learning steps and obtaining solutions directly. Extensive experiments on 68 DA tasks from seven benchmarks and subsequent analyses show that DMDA outperforms the compared methods in both classification accuracy and time efficiency, thus representing a significant advance in the DA field.},

Most camera placement algorithms are developed for surveillance regions with predefined camera locations, where optimal orientation for every given camera location is determined to maximize coverage. The existing approaches to optimizing the number of cameras, locations, and orientations focus on specific scenarios and are neither generic nor scalable across diverse surveillance scenarios. This article proposes a generic and scalable reward penalty score (RPS) algorithm for optimal camera placement in diverse indoor and outdoor scenarios to efficiently attain a specified coverage requirement. The camera placement decision is driven by maximizing total coverage over the surveillance region with a minimum number of cameras at optimal locations and orientations. Based on the RPS algorithm, we extend the existing Greedy grid voting (GGV) algorithm that was limited to optimizing camera orientations for predefined locations. The extended GGV (EGGV) algorithm is broader in scope and optimizes the number of cameras, their locations, and orientations. Overall, the RPS algorithm produces superior coverage results over indoor and outdoor scenarios compared to the existing camera placement algorithms on map images of diverse surveillance scenarios ranging from small to large.},

Such a strategy is composed of manifold coefficients, which are adjusted by employing gradient descent method. It is also composed of continuous controllers that are designed by utilizing the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) to approximate the total disturbances, where the approximation errors of RBFNN are estimated by using the adaptive control method. Moreover, the developed SMC strategy allows tuning the adaptive coefficients of the constructed manifolds, eliminating the inherent chattering phenomenon, and addressing the robust and adaptive tracking control problems for an uncertain COUAV.

To this end, a hybrid sampling-based particle filter (HSPF) with temporal constraints is proposed by integrating the acceptance–rejection sampling, the repeat sampling, and the sample-to-sample sampling via online optimization, where a decision criterion of improving sampling efficiency is designed to determine whether or not the repeat sampling is activated and a simple sequential quadratic programming (SSQP) is derived to mitigate the computational burden of particle optimizations. Next, compared with filters without introducing temporal constraints, we find that the number of effective particles increases, and the differential entropy of the probability density function as a measure of uncertainty is small, implying that fusing more extra information will help to improve the accuracy of estimates. Finally, two simulation scenarios verify the performance of the proposed filter with temporal constraints.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 crisis has led to an unusually large number of commercial aircraft being currently parked or stored. For airlines, airports, and civil aviation authorities around the world, monitoring, and protecting these parked aircraft to prevent them from causing human-made damage are becoming urgent problems that are receiving increasing attention. In this study, we use thermal infrared monitoring videos to establish a framework for individual surveillance around parked aircraft by proposing a human action recognition (HAR) algorithm. As the focus of this article, the proposed HAR algorithm seamlessly integrates a preprocessing module in which a novel data structure is constructed to introduce spatiotemporal information of the action; a convolutional neural network-based module for spatial feature extraction; a triple-layer convolutional long short-term memory network for temporal feature extraction; and two fully connected layers for classification. Moreover, because no infrared dataset is available for the HAR task on airport grounds at nighttime, we present a dataset called IIAR-30, which consists of eight action categories that frequently occur on airport grounds and 2000 video clips. The experimental results on the IIAR-30 dataset demonstrated that the recognition accuracy of the proposed method was higher than 96\%. We also further evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with five baselines and four other methods.},

To solve this problem, a novel filter-based adaptive control method is designed for the underactuated crane systems. First, since the backstepping control scheme cannot be directly applied to the crane systems, a group of filters is designed such that the crane systems become a class of strict-feedback nonlinear systems in each step of backstepping. Then, in order to ensure that the swing angle and position error converge to the origin, the variable transformation method is adopted. The result demonstrates that the tracking errors of the underactuated crane systems could be guaranteed to converge to a ball of origin with an arbitrarily small radius. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed scheme is effective.},

  abstract     = {Preserving projection learning has been widely used in feature extraction and selection for unsupervised image classification. Generally, some related methods constructed a graph to represent the nearest neighbor relationships of the data based on the Euclidean distances among different samples, which used 0 or 1 to predefine whether two samples are from the same class. Since a simple Euclidean distance is sensitive to noise, the predefined graph cannot produce exact correlations between the two samples. What is more, the predefined graph cannot reflect the structure of the projected data on a latent subspace when the projection matrix is learned. To solve these problems, in this article a novel adaptive graph embedded preserving projection learning (AGE_PPL) method is proposed, first combining the sparsity-based graph learning and the projection learning as an integral framework for feature extraction and feature selection. In particular, a sparse representation term with $l_{1}$ -norm is exploited in AGE_PPL to achieve the adaptive graph of the data to preserve the local structures among different samples while the projection matrix is learned. Meanwhile, a global-scale constraint is imposed to preserve the global structure of the data on a latent subspace. Therefore, the transformed samples will be more discriminative, allowing margins of the same class to be reduced, and margins among different classes to be enlarged. Experimental results proved the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by obtaining competitive performances over other baseline and state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the proposed method is very flexible for feature selection and dimensionality reduction.},

We propose a new low-computation full-state constrained robust control algorithm, that removes the feasibility conditions of virtual controllers and solves the unknown control direction problem without using the Nussbaum gain technique. By introducing nonlinear transformation functions, the original constrained systems are converted into new unconstrained tracking error systems, and the new systems eliminate the limitation of the initial conditions. Then, to seek the correct control directions, an orientation function with error conversion is constructed, which avoids introducing Nussbaum-type functions and logic switching rules. The proposed method possesses inherent robustness against model uncertainties and disturbances, and guarantees that the full-state constraints and the tracking error of systems enter into a prescribed set in a fixed time. Finally, simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the developed control algorithm.},

Management Science. 66(9), 4193–4206] to an even more general case in which the government offers a subsidy to firms. For the purpose of investigating the interplay between subsidies (rewarding positive externalities) and regulation (punishing negative externalities) under competition, we propose a game-theoretic model to formulate the problem. By Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions and backward induction, we obtain the following results. They are unique in our new scenario compared to Anand and Giraud-Carrier (2020). First, in terms of abatement, the effects of regulation and subsidy offset when the abatement efficiency is relatively high, and reinforce when abatement is inefficient. From the perspective of social welfare (SW), the effects of regulation are often offset by the effects of subsidy, and vice versa. Second, the relationship between the optimal subsidy rate and regulation depends heavily on the degree of competition and marginal cost of public funds. Third, in product and abatement subsidy schemes, cap-and-trade and taxes remain equivalent under competition. Finally, under certain conditions, a higher product subsidy rate will not necessarily give rise to higher SW at certain regulatory levels. Our research can provide a rationale for social planners who aim to achieve peak of CO2 emissions and carbon neutrality.},

  abstract     = {This article involves the innovative development of a symmetric Gauss–Seidel ADMM algorithm to solve the $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ guaranteed cost control problem. In the presence of parametric uncertainties, the $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ guaranteed cost control problem generally leads to the large-scale optimization. This is due to the exponential growth of the number of the extreme systems involved with respect to the number of parametric uncertainties. In this work, through a variant of the Youla–Kucera parameterization, the stabilizing controllers are parameterized in a convex set; yielding the outcome that the $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ guaranteed cost control problem is converted to a convex optimization problem. Based on an appropriate reformulation using the Schur complement, it then renders possible the use of the ADMM algorithm with symmetric Gauss–Seidel backward and forward sweeps. Significantly, this approach alleviates the often-times prohibitively heavy computational burden typical in many $\mathcal H_{\infty }$ optimization problems while exhibiting good convergence guarantees, which is particularly essential for the related large-scale optimization procedures involved. With this approach, the desired robust stability is ensured, and the disturbance attenuation is maintained at the minimum level in the presence of parametric uncertainties. Rather importantly too, with the attained effectiveness, the methodology thus evidently possesses extensive applicability in various important controller synthesis problems, such as decentralized control, sparse control, and output feedback control problems.},

To fill the gap, this article first defines the concept of hierarchical Petri nets (HPNs), which can support the formal modeling and correctness verification of processes with subprocesses. Followed by that, we propose an approach which can effectively discover HPNs from event logs with lifecycle information. Moreover, to quantify the quality of discovered HPNs, details on how to transform an HPN to a classical Petri net are given such that existing metrics can be applied. All proposed approaches have been fully implemented in ProM, and experiments over both synthetic and real-life event logs demonstrate that our approach can effectively discover hierarchical process models. Specifically, compared to exiting approaches on processes discovery, our approach can generally perform better in terms of model quality.},

This article proposes a Petri nets (PNs)-based modeling solution that employs hybrid PNs (HPNs) for physics and system of sequential systems with shared resources (S4R) nets for logic in building a hierarchical control model. We also present PNs technologies for implementing a smooth transition and bidirectional mapping from the virtual prototype to the real machine. These technologies involve a PNs integration of a reinforcement learning (RL) method for generating a workflow scheduling agent in design, an extension of PNs definitions that is compatible with the microcontroller for easy deployment in manufacturing, and an architecture of PNs execution recording for data-driven monitoring in service. A software kit is provided for the solution that includes an integrated development environment of PNs, tools for quickly building a virtual prototype, and a monitor server for remote data-driven monitoring.

Meanwhile, different from traditional prescribed-time approaches, where continuous flows of the system are generally required to be globally stable, it shows in this article that even systems involving unstable flows can be prescribed-time stabilized via the proposed impulsive regulation, but as a tradeoff, a constrained initial condition is needed for controller design. Thus, the main functions of impulsive regulation in this article are balancing unstable dynamics of the system, and regulating the settling time to fit the prescribed terminal time. As an application, the proposed impulsive regulation scheme is exploited in prescribed-time stabilization of affine dynamical systems involving uncertain input noises. Two examples, including the one focusing on the spin stabilization of spacecrafts, are given to verify the results.},

A sufficient condition only dependent on the local system dynamics as well as the local interconnected matrices is derived in the framework of the input-to-state stability (ISS) theory, and the desired gains of both the controller and the observer are obtained by the cone complementarity linearization (CCL) algorithm. Benefiting from the element matrix inequality, the developed design scheme satisfies the scalability requirement.

However, OFD platforms are encountering enormous challenges, such as massive demand, inevitable uncertainty and short delivery time. This article addresses an OFD problem with stochastic food preparation time. It is a complex NP-hard problem with uncertainty, large search space, strongly coupled subproblems, and high timeliness requirements. To solve the problem, we design an iterated greedy algorithm with a decomposition-based strategy. Concretely speaking, to cope with the large search space due to massive demands, a filtration mechanism is designed by preliminarily selecting suitable riders. To reduce the risk affected by the uncertainty, we introduce a risk-measuring criterion into the objective function and employ a scenario-sampling method. For timeliness requirements caused by short delivery time, we design two time-saving strategies via mathematical analysis, i.e., an adaptive selection mechanism to choose the method with less computational effort and a fast evaluation mechanism based on the small-scale sampling and machine learning model to speed up evaluation. We also prove an upper bound of the stochastic time cost under risk measurement as one of the baseline features to improve the prediction accuracy. The experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

In this article, we propose several notions of stability with variable horizon that vary in whether the focal DM and her opponents are allowed to make moves that are immediately disadvantageous, called unilateral disimprovements. Credible maximin stability reflects the assumption that opponents will attempt to deter a focal DM from a move by imposing the strongest possible sanction. We analyze the effects of varying the horizon on this form of stability, and on the relationships among the solution concepts that result. Requiring the focal DM to make only unilateral improvements does not influence the stability of states, but restricting opponents’ responses to unilateral improvements reduces the set of stable states. An application to a water-pricing conflict illustrates the analysis of a graph model using credible maximin stabilities.},

The sampling controller corresponding switching transition rate matrix mode is not synchronized with the system corresponding switching transition rate matrix mode due to the possible switching of the transfer rate matrix in the sampling interval. With the help of T–S fuzzy models, the state-space representation of the system is turned into a fuzzy Itô stochastic switched Markov jump systems. By constructing novel Lyapunov functionals, mean square exponential stability criteria, and dissipativity criteria are presented. Furthermore, an asynchronous aperiodic sampled-data controller is designed for fuzzy Itô stochastic Markov jump systems. At last, by fuzzing the nonlinear tunnel diode circuit model and nonlinear mass-spring-damper mechanical model, the effectiveness and lower conservativeness of the proposed method are illustrated.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the active fault-tolerant control (FTC) issue is addressed for switched linear parameter varying (LPV) systems in the discrete-time domain. A general dwell-time property is considered in the system setup to govern the switching dynamics between subsystems, and the parameter variations within each subsystem are subjected to the polytopic uncertainties. The main innovation of the developed active FTC approach is to effectively cope with switched LPV models where both input and output matrices can be of parameter-dependent form. By virtue of a novel Lyapunov function approach depending on both dwell time and parameter variations, the joint task for fault detection, estimation, and compensation is fulfilled via an integrated design scheme. The input-to-state stability (ISS) conditions are obtained for the augmented faulty system satisfying a given ISS-gain performance requirement. The desired effect of active FTC is achieved in three critical steps: 1) construct a fault detection filter in terms of the $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ norm; 2) design an observer-based estimator to estimate the system states and faults simultaneously; and 3) synthesize a fault-tolerant controller with the LPV structure using the estimated states and faults for fault compensation. Finally, an application example is utilized to illustrate the efficiency and availability of the proposed control approach.},

More precisely, the predictive implicit user preference is first constructed from the initial top- $k$ items. The implicit user preference is then aggregated with the explicit user embedding to enrich the user intent representation. Moreover, the traditional listwise loss functions for reranking optimization are suboptimal, due to the fact that they neglect the relative ranking information (ReinRank) between the unobserved and positive items. To address this issue, a novel listwise loss function that leverages relative ranking information, referred to as ReinRank, is proposed for reranking optimization. ReinRank assigns different values to the unobserved items, according to their relative ranking distances between the positive items. Extensive experiments are performed on three public benchmarks and different CF models, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of NRCF and ReinRank.},

Besides, the desired angle profiles as well as the desired impedance model can be iteration varying, which is an important consideration when the team needs to execute different tasks in different iterations. With rigorous mathematical analysis, we show that each manipulator’s impedance error can uniformly converge to zero as the iteration index increases to infinity.

We propose a distributed model predictive control (MPC) approach for a team of NMMs to transport a target object while satisfying significant constraints and limitations, such as the feasible state and control input constraints, parameter synchronization constraints, and obstacles within the workspace. First, under the framework of the decoupling dynamics, an auxiliary dynamics model for task-space end-effectors and null-space mobile bases is obtained by the nonlinear feedback technique based on the Euler–Lagrange description of the NMMs. Using the modified virtual structure method, the cooperation and coordination transportation problem for NMMs is simplified as two independent synchronization tracking control problems for task-space end-effectors and null-space mobile bases. A distributed constrained optimization problem is established by taking the parameter synchronization and system constraints into the cost function. A general projection neural network (GPNN) approach is employed to solve the optimization problem and obtain the optimal control input. Moreover, a sufficient condition that guarantees the stability of the closed-loop system is further developed. Simulation results show that the proposed cooperation and coordination transportation strategy is feasible and effective.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic texture (DT) exhibits statistical stationarity in the spatial domain and stochastic repetitiveness in the temporal dimension, indicating that different frames of DT possess a high similarity correlation that is critical prior knowledge. However, existing methods cannot effectively learn a synthesis model for high-dimensional DT from a small number of training samples. In this article, we propose a novel DT synthesis method, which makes full use of similarity as prior knowledge to address this issue. Our method is based on the proposed kernel similarity embedding, which can not only mitigate the high dimensionality and small sample issues, but also has the advantage of modeling nonlinear feature relationships. Specifically, we first put forward two hypotheses that are essential for the DT model to generate new frames using similarity correlations. Then, we integrate kernel learning and the extreme learning machine into a unified synthesis model to learn kernel similarity embeddings for representing DTs. Extensive experiments on DT videos collected from the Internet and two benchmark datasets, i.e., Gatech Graphcut Textures and Dyntex, demonstrate that the learned kernel similarity embeddings can provide discriminative representations for DTs. Further, our method can preserve the long-term temporal continuity of the synthesized DT sequences with excellent sustainability and generalization. Meanwhile, it effectively generates realistic DT videos with higher speed and lower computation than the current state-of-the-art methods. The code and more synthesis videos are available at our project page https://shiming-chen.github.io/Similarity-page/Similarit.html .},

In this scheme, a local PI feedback controller is applied to stabilize the closed-loop nominal HOFA-NMASs, then a Diophantine equation is presented to establish an incremental HOFA prediction model rather than a reduced-order one, so that the optimization of cost function considered cooperative performance and the compensation of communication delays are completed via multistep output predictions, thus the optimal cooperative controllers are constructed. The further discussion provides a simple condition of simultaneous stability and output consensus of closed-loop HOFA-NMASs, which is easy to verify and extend in practice and is independent on communication delays.

  abstract     = {This article addresses the dynamic task allocation problem with limited communication and velocity. The main challenge lie in the selection of $k$ fittest winner participants and the participant contention that one winner participant may be selected by multiple targets simultaneously. Existing methods take the distance between the targets and participants as the evaluation index to select winners, which may lead to futile selection since the winner participant locating at the opposite direction of the target cannot intercept the target with limited velocity. By carefully considering both the distance between the targets and participants and the motion direction of the targets, an improved evaluation index for each target is proposed and employed such that the futile selection can be avoided in the executing process of the algorithm. Moreover, an extra evaluation index for each winner participant is presented to select one winner target to overcome the participant contention. Based on these, the control protocols are developed for targets interception, and their stability is proven by the Lyapunov theory under some suitable conditions. Finally, simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {It is highly desirable to adapt the reference vectors to unknown Pareto fronts (PFs) in decomposition-based evolutionary many-objective optimization. While adapting the reference vectors enhances the diversity of the achieved solutions, it often decelerates the convergence performance. To address this dilemma, we propose to adapt the reference vectors and the scalarizing functions in a coordinated way. On the one hand, the adaptation of the reference vectors is based on a local angle threshold, making the adaptation better tuned to the distribution of the solutions. On the other hand, the weights of the scalarizing functions are adjusted according to the local angle thresholds and the reference vectors’ age, which is calculated by counting the number of generations in which one reference vector has at least one solution assigned to it. Such coordinated adaptation enables the algorithm to achieve a better balance between diversity and convergence, regardless of the shape of the PFs. Experimental studies on MaF, DTLZ, and DPF test suites demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving problems with both regular and irregular PFs.},

The model proposed, known as memory recurrent ENN (MRENN), consists of an additional number of weighted self-feedback loops, an extra output context layer, and weighted connections of input signals (through adjustable weights) to the output-layer neuron. The model is proposed to be given only two signals as its inputs: plant unit-delayed value and the present value of the externally applied signal irrespective of the actual order of the plant (which most of the time may not be known). To guarantee stability, the parameters of the MRENN model are updated using the equations that are obtained by applying Lyapunov-stability criteria. Furthermore, the recursive learning rate scheme is constructed for speeding up the learning process. From the simulation results, MRENN model appears to have produced comparably superior outcomes when the performance of the suggested model is compared with that of other well-known models.},

  abstract     = {Many fuzzy subspace clustering methods have been proposed for high-dimensional image data with rich structural information. However, since these methods do not fully exploit the subspace information in each cluster, their performance on image clustering is still not promising. In this work, we propose to find soft partitions directly based on the construction of subspaces. For each cluster, we use a bilinear orthogonal subspace to represent it. Then, through the reconstruction error of a sample in the subspace corresponding to a cluster, a new membership measure for the sample to the cluster is established. Furthermore, the graph regularization is imposed on these bilinear subspaces to preserve the local relational or manifold information of the image data in the original space. Altogether, we get a clustering model considering not only the subspace information but also the manifold information in image data. An efficient optimization algorithm is proposed to our model, and its theoretical convergence and time complexity are presented correspondingly. The proposed method is a one-stage clustering model that does not require vectorized image data, thereby reducing the computational burden while maintaining the structural relationship between pixels in the image. Competitive experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our model can converge quickly with strong clustering performance, which confirms the efficiency and superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art fuzzy clustering methods.},

Second, combining the soft constraint requirement of the output tracking error contained in the performance index function, a fusion filter is constructed to estimate the system co-state and its information weight under system state and input delays. Finally, the obtained co-state and its information weight, the soft constraint requirement of the control input contained in the performance function, as well as the system delay dynamics, are all transformed into the information equations about the control input, and then the information fusion delay controller (IFDC) is directly obtained by fusing these information equations. As a result, the negative effects caused by disturbance and time delays can be effectively compensated at the same time. The convergence of the tracking errors of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by the Lyapunov stability theory.

This research mainly focuses on how to effectively exploit the existing fuzzy model, which has been constructed on extensive previously acquired experimental evidence and could be regarded as source of knowledge, in a new environment where only very limited experimental evidence is available. Rather than constructing a new model from scratch, knowledge conveyed by the existing model could be retained and reused in the target domain. The originality and innovation of this study lies in the adaption of the existing model to the new environment through optimal allocation of information granularity to produce granular fuzzy models, which are more abstract and general than the original numeric constructs.

By selecting a most-relevant-feature vector using joint mutual information, we design a Gaussian mixture model- hidden Markov model and employ the model as a node in the DBN to identify the driver’s intention. Then, a reference path is generated using the road information. The uncertainties of drivers are captured in steering- and longitudinal-control using a stochastic driver model and a Markov chain, respectively. A vehicle dynamic model ensures that the predicted vehicle trajectory adheres to the vehicle dynamics, which improves the prediction accuracy. A particle filter is used to recursively estimate the vehicle trajectory, including position coordinates and the lateral distance from the vehicle center of gravity to the road edge. We evaluate the proposed DBN trajectory prediction method in both lane-keeping and lane-changing scenarios based on a dataset collected from a real-time dynamic driving simulator. Results show that the proposed method can achieve accurate long-term trajectory prediction.},

It is also a well-known NP-hard problem, when the number of jobs increases, the difficulty of solving the problem exponentially increases. However, most of the reported algorithms have not analyzed the solution space and may search many useless solution spaces, which impedes these algorithms from effectively optimizing the large-scale PFSPs in reasonable computation time. To address large-scale PFSPs with more than 100 jobs, this article proposes a solution space clipping-based improved simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. First, inspired by Johnson’s rule, this article explores its essential principle and generalizes it to the general situation. Before the optimization algorithm is used to find the optimal solution, a preordering combination is performed on the processed jobs according to this extended rule to considerably clip the solution space. Second, a hybrid release strategy based on the Palmer algorithm is developed for the proposed algorithm. Then, some key operators of the SA algorithm are also improved. Finally, to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, this work performs a set of comparative experiments with the-state-of-art methods on the part of the TA benchmark and VRF benchmark with more than 100 jobs. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve superior results compared to other algorithms.

  abstract     = {The Pareto front (PF) estimation has become an emerging strategy for solving multiobjective optimization problems in recent studies. By approximating the geometrical structure of the PF during the evolutionary procedure, some PF estimation approaches have been suggested and shown effectiveness in guiding the search direction of evolutionary algorithms. However, these approaches encounter difficulties in handling irregular PFs, whose geometrical structures are too complex to be properly approximated. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel PF estimation approach based on local models. In contrast to existing approaches estimating the PF via a reference point set or a single model, the proposed approach automatically divides the population into several groups and builds a local model for each group of solutions. In spite of the simplicity of each local model, the combination of all the local models can approximate the PFs with complex geometrical structures. An evolutionary algorithm is then developed based on the local model-based PF estimation approach and a novel fitness function and is compared with four evolutionary algorithms on 39 problems. Statistical results indicate that the proposed algorithm exhibits better performance than the compared algorithms, especially on problems with highly irregular PFs.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a space-and-time synchronized control method for target-tracking problems under input saturation in the three-dimensional (3-D) framework of polar coordinates. We first utilize the prescribed-distance controller to design a reference relative trajectory, aiming to formulate a synchronization of space and time. By doing this, the specified position can be approached at its predetermined instant and the relative trajectory in space is independent of time. Next, through correlating and decoupling the reference/actual kinematics between the self vehicle and the target, time and space are separated, controlled independently. To further address the existing closed-loop system errors, we propose a dynamic velocity assignment of the relative reference trajectory, which is an independent extra degree of freedom, to alleviate the negative effects caused by input saturation. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme.},

To this end, a coordination algorithm, involving an external variable that enables us to circumvent the velocity information, is proposed, of which nonzero scaling parameters are used to characterize whether the underlying interactions are antagonistic or not. A distinctive feature of the devised coordination algorithm, apart from the interest of its own, is that there does not necessitate the signed graph and structurally balanced theories that are commonly adopted in the literature. We show that the proposed setup is amenable for coordination of the agents, with the help of some newly introduced transformation relaxing the dependence of the weighted states of agents or some reference signals that are global information, and are commonly used in most of the existing studies where consensus problems are recast into the stability counterparts of the corresponded error systems. We also show that weighted gains used to assure the underlying Laplacian “like” matrix acting a normal Laplacian matrix, scaling parameters, and communication topology are of great importance for the investigated coordination problem, giving rise to that there does not enjoy any trivial equivalence between the devised setup and these in the literature. Finally, two numerical examples, including a multirobot system, are carried out to support the developed method.},

In these interactions, there is a risk that a feedback loop causes unstable force interaction, in which force escalation exposes a human to danger. Previous studies have analyzed the stability of voluntary interaction but have neglected involuntary behavior in the interaction. In contrast to the previous studies, this study considered the involuntary behavior: a human’s force reproduction bias for discrete-event human–robot force interaction. We derived an asymptotic stability condition based on a mathematical bias model and found that the bias asymptotically stabilizes a human’s implicit equilibrium point far from the implicit equilibrium point and destabilizes the point near the point. The bias model, convergence of the interaction toward the implicit equilibrium point, and divergence around the point were consistently verified via behavioral experiments under three kinds of interactions using three different body parts: 1) a hand finger; 2) wrist; and 3) foot. Our results imply that humans implicitly secure a stable and close relationship between themselves and robots with their involuntary behavior.},

The ASVs are subject to physical constraints, in addition to stationary and moving obstacles. A barrier-certified distributed model predictive control method is proposed with the capability of avoiding collision with stationary and moving obstacles and neighboring ASVs. Specifically, a data-driven neural predictor is used to learn unknown functions in ASV kinetics. A nominal distributed receding-horizon position control law is developed based on the learned unknown function to achieve the desired formation within physical constraints. To ensure the safety requirement, a barrier-certified control law is designed based on control barrier functions to generate the signals of optimal surge force and heading angle within the safety constraints. A receding-horizon heading control law is designed based on the data-driven neural predictor to track the desired heading signals. Constrained quadratic programming problems are formulated based on barrier functions for barrier-certified distributed formation control and solved via neurodynamic optimization using one-layer recurrent neural networks. Thus, the proposed control method is able to ensure obstacle avoidance in the formation control of multiple ASVs in the presence of stationary and moving obstacles. Simulation results are elaborated to validate the efficacy of the proposed barrier-certified distributed model predictive control method for ASV formation.},

By choosing two discontinuous piecewise linear functions and employing the convex combination method, several algebraic criteria are demonstrated to achieve globally asymptotic stabilization of NTNNs with constant and unbounded time-varying delays. First, the asymptotic stability theorem for timescale-type systems is constructed by utilizing the timescale theory. Based on this asymptotic stability theorem, an impulsive control scheme is designed to guarantee global asymptotic stabilization of NTNNs with constant delay. Second, we propose several impulsive control schemes to achieve globally asymptotic stabilization of NTNNs with unbounded delay by virtue of the comparison strategy. Globally asymptotic stabilization criteria for NTNNs include the theoretical results of continuous-time neural networks (NNs), their discrete-time forms and NNs on continuous-discrete hybrid time scales. Especially, impulsive control for globally asymptotic stabilization of NTNNs with proportional delay is demonstrated without any variable transformation.

  abstract     = {Wafer probing is a critical process employed to measure the yield of wafer fabrication. The primary object of wafer probing is to find the defect grain on the wafer. After a full coverage check, there are always some suspected grains existing for further inspection. However, this second probing result could be affected by the shape of the probe card and the setting actions (path planning) of operators for grains randomly scattering on the wafer. Good grains can be damaged by reprobe actions, which decrease production performance and customer trust. In general, it also requires manpower to perform reprobing, which dramatically deteriorates the throughput of production. This article has studied this problem, and an adaptive coverage path planning (CPP) method for randomly scattering grains using an attention interface is proposed. The proposed randomly scattering waypoints method uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for automatic real-time path planning of the second detection. A soft attention interface accelerates the process with a less overlapped check. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in terms of less overlapping and steps, and this method learns a better CPP strategy for wafer probing than programmed paths and other RL-based methods.},

Then, with the light of the proposed observer, a specific relationship between two sets of constructed filtered signals is satisfied after a finite time, which lays the foundation for a concurrent learning strategy. Furthermore, a cooperative controller with the cooperative adaptive law is successfully constructed, which overcomes the difficulty of controller design caused by estimations of the leader system matrix not satisfying regulator equation. Compared with the existing studies, the cooperative finite-time excitation (cFTE) condition is successfully applied to the COR of MASs for the first time.

  abstract     = {Deep learning has become a promising tool for processing the massive data and attracted an increasing attention in the fields of degradation modeling and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. The existing deep-learning-based methods are generally faced with the two aspects of problems. On the one hand, the prediction results are represented by the point estimates instead of the probabilistic distribution and, thus, the prognostic uncertainty in RUL prediction cannot be characterized. On the other hand, there exist plenty of the engineering assets without the label data related to lifetime, posing a great challenge for training the deep learning network. Toward this end, we propose a prognostic model under the framework of Bayesian deep learning for equipment lacking the label data related to lifetime. First, the monitoring data of the historical equipment and the historical data of field equipment in the database are preprocessed to generate the samples regarding degradation information as a label. Second, the bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN) is employed as the candidate network for the advantages in handling the sequential monitoring data. On the basis of this, the idea of Bayesian deep learning is incorporated into the bidirectional RNN; thus, we can characterize the uncertainty of the predicted degradation level at any future time via utilizing the variational inference technique in the Bayesian neural networks. Furthermore, the failure probability for the concerned equipment at any time can be determined, by which the degradation uncertainty can be converted into the RUL uncertainty from the point of the reliability theory. Finally, we provide the case study associated with lithium-ion batteries to verify the proposed prognostic model.},

In the existing research, the suspension system tracking control methods are only aimed at a single part of the mass, respectively. But this article adopts a novel tracking method for the vertical displacement difference, which can track the ideal reference model more accurately. For the sake of alleviating the problem of limited resources in the process of vehicle communication, a control method combined with the events triggering of the relative threshold is proposed. The design of the controller makes the vertical displacement and vertical moving speed of the bionic suspension system close to zero. It can effectively improve the communication efficiency between the actuator and the controller. In the design of this system, all the signals involved are bounded. The Zeno behavior is successfully avoided among the event-triggered control mechanism.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the fixed-time fault-tolerant formation control problem of a leader–follower heterogeneous multiagent system (HMAS), including multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and multiple unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) under loss of effectiveness actuator faults and disturbances. Different from the existing fixed-time formation results, to realize the special application, a finite-time performance function (FTPF) is considered, which can guarantee that formation error converges to a prescribed arbitrarily small region within a known time. Then, based on sliding mode control and bi-limit homogeneity, distributed and decentralized fixed-time formation control algorithms are constructed for the HMAS in the $x$ – $y$ axis and $z$ axis, respectively, which can steer the whole system achieving target formation configuration within a scheduled time. In addition, based on local state information, adaptive online updating strategies for unknown actuator efficiency factors and lumped uncertainties are proposed. Then, under the online updating parameters, two novel distributed and decentralized adaptive fault-tolerant formation control laws are presented using practical fixed-time stability theory, which not only achieves stable formation tracking with finite-time prescribed behavioral metrics but also ensures that the formation errors are uniformly bounded within a settling time. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed control schemes is verified by simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the refactoring problem of smart sensors whose energy supply is limited. Refactoring helps smart sensors to wipe out code bugs (CBs) while consuming its limited energy. A smart sensor may need more than one refactoring. The more energy consumed by a refactoring, the more CBs may be removed by this refactoring, while the less energy will be left for the other refactorings (subsequently, less CBs may be reduced by the other refactorings). Therefore, how to make the optimal tradeoff for smart sensors between CB ratio (CBR) and energy consumption arises as an interesting problem. To address this problem, this article first establishes a constrained optimization-theoretical framework that can allocate the limited energy for refactorings, second explores out the optimal amount of energy supply for each refactoring that can minimize the CBR, third discovers the theoretical value, lower bound, upper bound, infimum, supremum, and convergence properties of the minimum CBR, and finally proposes an effective algorithm to minimize the CBR within the given energy level. To our best knowledge, this is the initial work toward this issue. Simulation and field experiments both document the performance.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a disassembly task planning algorithm considering human–robot collaboration (HRC) and human behavior prediction (HBP). Unlike assembly procedures, the disassembly of end-of-life (EOL) products has been a labor-intensive process with uncertainties difficult to cope with. Meanwhile, it is usually challenging to obtain an optimal sequence efficiently without excessive computational cost. Also, the conventional human-centered task planning, in which the robot has to halt frequently due to unsafe interruptions by human motions, may decrease the efficiency of the disassembly process. In this article, a sequence planner is proposed to assign tasks in real time between a human operator and a robot to overcome the aforementioned challenges. The cost function includes the effort of the human and the robot in terms of both movement distance and time spent on the tasks. The constraints include the disassembly rules and the safety of the human operation. The optimal sequence is generated by solving an optimization problem in a receding-horizon way. In particular, at each step, the proposed disassembly sequence planner locates the workers (a human operator and a robot) and the to-be-disassembled components, predicts human movement for the next several steps, and obtains the optimal disassembly sequence for the next several steps following disassembly rules and safety constraints. Experiments have been extensively conducted on the disassembly of a wooden toybox and a used hard disk drive (HDD) to validate the proposed disassembly sequence planner. The planner has successfully generated the disassembly sequence in an HRC setting explicitly considering real-time human motion prediction and assigned the human operator and the robot to collaboratively complete disassembly tasks without violating disassembly rules and safety constraints.},

First, a new form of nonlinear MAS is presented by linear state transformation. Second, a state observer based on adaptive radial basis function neural networks is developed to estimate the unmeasured states. A command filter control scheme is deployed to address the problem of increased sharply complexity derived from the conventional backstepping design with the increase of the system order, and the filtered error is compensated by the error compensation mechanism. Third, by taking advantage of the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals, a compensation control strategy is intended to exclude the impact of input delays. In addition, a Nussbaum-gain function is used to deal with the problem of uncertain control direction. An adaptive output feedback control approach is raised to construct the scaled consensus tracking control protocol, error compensating signals, and adaptive laws. It is proved that the tracking errors are driven to a small residual set, and all the signal variables are bounded in the closed-loop system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by two numerical simulations.},

For data representation, we consider misclassification cost, label query cost, and attribute query cost. For the cost/benefit estimation, we design a unified assessment of attribute values and labels with softmax regression. For the selection of attribute value and label, we propose an optimal acquisition scheme with permutation and greedy strategies. We perform experiments with synthetic, benchmark, and domain datasets.

In practice, it is implemented by closely monitoring the daily and accumulated settlements, which are dependent outputs. To accurately predict such outputs, a new approach using two features is proposed. First, a new concept of data credibility is proposed to represent the different levels of consistency among the multiple dependent outputs. Second, the training dataset is developed using data gathered from multiple phases based on the fuzzy number. The new approach is named credibility-based fuzzy incremental learning approach using the belief rule base (BRB), CI-BRB. The key contributions of the proposed CI-BRB approach are: 1) data credibility is defined and calculated rather than blindly assuming all data are accurate by default and 2) the training dataset is more representative as it includes both the current phase and more prior phases. Subsequently, a numerical case with three dependent outputs is designed to provide a detailed illustration, and a practical case is studied in a more comprehensive fashion. The case study results show that the proposed approach can produce superior results for modeling that adopts a none strategy. Additionally, further investigations validate the effectiveness of the strategy over incremental learning.},

Social network platforms are a source of evaluations in the natural language of any topic, which may be considered as the evaluations of a nonexpert crowd. Decision-making (DM) models are constrained by their inability of processing large amounts of evaluations in natural language, as those ones from social networks. We claim that evaluations from social networks can enhance the quality of multiperson multicriteria DM models. Accordingly, we propose a crowd DM model guided by sentiment analysis (SA), which solves decision situations leveraging the wisdom of the crowd available in social networks. The model uses several deep-learning SA classification models through opinion triplets to incorporate all the evaluation shades in the DM model. Likewise, the likely lack of information stemmed from the consideration of a large set of users is tackled with a sparse representation of the evaluations. We annotate and release the TripR-2020Large dataset, and we use it to evaluate the model in the use case of restaurant choice. The results show that the integration of the wisdom of the crowd and the different shades of the evaluations enhances the quality of the decision.},

  abstract     = {Existing adaptive neural control methods for nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) are only applicable under a fixed topology or are applicable under switching topologies but require some linear growth conditions on the nonlinear functions. Motivated by these limitations, a state-dependent adaptive neural design method is proposed in this article. Technically, our method is developed from a state-dependent Lyapunov function candidate, a switched control law, and a projection-based adaptation mechanism. To overcome the stability analysis difficulty caused by the new design of the Lyapunov function, a nonswitched compensation approach and a modified multiple Lyapunov functions method are proposed to derive a dwell-time condition, under which stability can be preserved. It is proved that in addition to stability, synchronization errors converge to a tunable residual around zero. Besides, the proposed scheme achieves the improvement of transient performance in terms of $L_{2}$ norm and moreover, once there are no more topology switchings, asymptotic convergence of synchronization errors to a prescribed interval recovers automatically.},

  abstract     = {Most existing opinion formation processes apply one opinion dynamics model. However, this article combines opinion formation and complex networks to innovatively develop two new opinion dynamics models to more realistically describe the opinion evolution process: 1) an opinion similarity mixed (OSM) model and 2) a structural similarity mixed (SSM) model, both of which include characteristics from the DeGroot model and the Hegselmann–Krause bounded confidence model. In addition, the strong and weak relations between individuals are considered. The network dynamically changes by two developed network updating algorithms based on opinion similarity and structural similarity. Simulations are then conducted using artificial and real-world networks, which are Erdös-Rényi random networks, random regular networks, scale-free networks, and the Twitter network. It is found that compared with static networks, the opinion evolution in dynamic networks produces fewer opinion clusters and smaller opinion variances. The dynamic network mechanism reduces the weak relations between agents and improves the global clustering coefficient in the ER random networks but not in the Twitter network, which means that the network topology has an impact on results. Therefore, it is concluded that agents’ subjective behaviors significantly influence the outcome of opinion evolution and networks, which is consistent with real life.},

  abstract     = {Hydraulic manipulators are extremely complicated systems due to the highly nonlinear characteristics, strong coupling among multiple joints, and heavy modeling uncertainties, which greatly complicate the high-performance tracking controller development compared with conventional manipulators driven by electrical motors. To overcome the above obstacles, this article proposes a novel radial basis function neural network (RBFNN)-based adaptive asymptotic prescribed performance controller for $n$ -degrees of freedom (DOF) hydraulic manipulators. First, the entire manipulator system model containing actuator dynamics is derived. Then, the adaptive asymptotic prescribed performance controller is synthesized based on the backstepping framework, in which the RBFNN is employed to estimate the unknown joint coupling dynamics, while the RBFNN reconstruction error and uncertainties of the actuator dynamics are handled by the robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) feedbacks. Meanwhile, a prescribed performance function (PPF), which characterizes both the certain transient and steady-state performance, is innovatively incorporated into the control design to restrict the joint tracking errors. The theoretical analysis proves that the proposed control strategy can achieve a prescribed tracking performance and the asymptotic stability of the whole closed-loop system can also be ensured. Finally, comparative simulations are conducted to verify the validity of the proposed controller.},

A malicious attacker injects false data into agents’ actuators and sensors so that agents’ strategies deviate from the NE of the game with the compromised control inputs and interactive information. First, the robustness of the seeking algorithm against the FDI attacks is analyzed. Then, to mitigate the effect of the attacks on agents’ strategies, the false data injected in the actuators and sensors are regarded as extended states which can be observed by extended state observers (ESOs). Thus, a resilient NE seeking algorithm is proposed based on ESOs. The resilient algorithm can drive the system to converge to the NE without requiring any information about the nature of the attacks. An explicit criterion is given to ensure the effectiveness of the designed algorithms. An example is given to illustrate the results.},

The distributed nonlinear fixed-time tracking protocol is constructed by virtue of the recursive algorithm, and the design process is simplified by a tracking differentiator. In particular, the upper bound of the settling time has nothing to do with initial conditions. Further, the disturbances are tackled via robust $H_{\infty }$ control theory.

  abstract     = {Extended belief-rule-based (EBRB) system is a representative rule-based system and has attracted much attention due to its capability of solving the problems of combinatorial explosion and time-consuming optimization incurred by belief-rule-based system. Despite their advantages, the development of EBRB suffers from some shortcomings, such as the unreasonable calculation of similarity between input and antecedent belief distributions (BDs), inaccurate calculation of individual matching degrees and rule weights, and inefficient determination of activation rules. To address these shortcomings, this article proposes a new EBRB system, in which an existing similarity measure between two BDs is adopted to accurately calculate the individual matching degrees and rule weights. Furthermore, the activation weight of a rule is efficiently calculated within an activation group generated using the affinity propagation algorithm, which is utilized to determine whether the rule is activated. The activation rules are then integrated using their weights and the evidential reasoning algorithm to generate the inference result. To demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency, the proposed EBRB system is employed to help diagnose thyroid nodules based on the historical examination reports collected from a tertiary hospital located in Hefei, Anhui, China. The findings are highlighted by the comparison of the proposed EBRB system with existing EBRB systems based on the historical reports and datasets derived from the University of California at Irvine.},

There exists an important application in the edge computing environment is to outsource the computationally intensive problems to nearby edge servers, which has become a research hotspot in the area of industry and academia. In this article, we propose a distributed and secure system DSOS for seeking the least squares solution to the overdetermined system of linear equations (OSLE) with the assistance of multiple nearby noncolluding edge servers. Solving this type of linear equations is one of the most common problems for statistics and data mining in IoT. In our system, the coefficient matrix is divided into multiple blocks according to rows. The different blocks are distributed to the different edge servers. All edge servers can help the user to obtain the correct solution to the OSLE by the interactive computation. Our system can ensure the private information about input parameters and final results is not leaked to the participating edge servers. In addition, the mutual verification between the edge servers can ensure the validity of the final results. The experimental evaluations show that the designed system outperforms the existing ones in terms of fast response between the edge server and the user, low computation overload on the edge server side, and high efficiency on the user side.},

First, the control algorithm performance is evaluated offline and compared with a commercial lap-time minimizer, then experimental implementation of the assistance system with the human driver (HD) in the loop has been accomplished on a professional dynamic driving simulator, where an evaluation of the specific features has been performed: 1) a gg-bound is exploited to adapt the controller’s behavior to different driver abilities; 2) the controller’s adaptability to unexpected HD behavior is tested; and 3) the controller’s ability to handle the vehicle at the limit of maneuverability is established. The obtained strategy, then, demonstrates to be suitable as an underlying vehicle controller for a driver-assistance system on a racing track.},

The adaptive step size ensures that the integral-action produced by the ESC control law does not destabilize the closed-loop system. To quantify the quality of the gradient estimate, we present a batch least-squares (BLS) estimator with a novel weighting term and guarantee that the gradient estimation error is bounded. The adaptive step size then maximizes the decrease of the combined plant and controller Lyapunov function for the worst-case estimation error. We also ensure that our ESC controller is input-to-state stable with respect to a class of dither signals. Finally, we demonstrate our ESC controller through benchmark examples and a practical application: leak detection with drones.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a dual-mode multiobjective Lyapunov-based economic model-predictive control (MOLEMPC) for constrained nonlinear time-delay systems with external disturbances. First, considering the conflicting objectives, the Pareto compromise approach is used to calculate the compromised economic stability point and the multiobjective optimization function. To compensate for the impact of input delay, a model-based estimator is designed by using the actual state, historical inputs, and nominal models of the system. By the proposed dual-mode Lyapunov-based economic model-predictive control (LEMPC) scheme, the feasible domain of the initial point of a closed-loop system is increased, in the meantime, the stability of the closed-loop system with disturbances and delay is guaranteed. The recursive feasibility and stability analysis of the MOLEMPC controller is given in detail. We illustrate that the closed-loop system state converges in a robust invariant set after a finite time. Finally, simulations demonstrate the reliability and advantages of the proposed strategy.},

For this kind of problem, this article puts forward an online dual event-triggered (ET) adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) optimal control algorithm for a class of nonlinear systems with constrained state and input. First, the original system is transformed into another system through the barrier function, after that, a suitable value function with a nonquadratic utility function is designed to obtain the optimal control pair. In addition, on the premise of the asymptotic stability of the system, the trigger condition is devised, and the intersampling time analysis is proved that the algorithm can avoid the Zeno phenomenon. What is more, the critic, action, and disturbance neural networks (NNs) are trained to approximate value function and control sequences, subsequently, the approximation error is proved to be uniformly ultimately boundedness (UUB). Finally, two comparative experiments based on the robot arm model are simulated to verify that the algorithm can make control policies update only when the system has the requirement and keep satisfactory control effect, which can effectively decrease the number of data transfers and reduce the calculation burden.},

The main novelty of such a strategy is that some valuable information of finite future references can be adequately scheduled to optimize the robust tracking performance and significantly enlarge the fault-tolerant admissible region. In order to better describe the wide applicability of the proposed strategy, the robust FTTC problem for a class of LPV systems with state/input constraints is considered. Overall, the involved key designs consist of three parts. First, an unconstrained FTTC component is constructed by combining tracking error feedback, reference input regulation, and fault signal compensation. It is used to guarantee the robust tracking stability of closed-loop systems when the constraints are not activated. Second, a tube-based predictive FTTC policy with an embedded optimal preview regulator is designed to achieve the robust constraint satisfaction and transient response improvement. Third, an embedded reference governor is additionally integrated to significantly enlarge the size of the fault-tolerant admissible region. This design further reinforces the feasibility of constrained FTTC optimization. The effectiveness of these results is finally validated by a case study of a single transistor dc/dc Forward converter.},

For the first time, a memory SD control design involving a known signal transmission delay is adapted to address the stabilization problem for IT2 fuzzy systems. New polynomial-type Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals (LKFs) associated with the state of constant signal transmission delay are introduced to achieve less conservative stability results. To bound the derivative of such LKFs, the Jacobi–Bessel inequality is introduced. Due to this, improved delay-dependent sufficient conditions can be obtained relating to set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Thus, by solving LMIs using the LMI solver in MATLAB, the closed-loop system can be stabilized. The proposed method is verified in the simulation results with a nonlinear permanent-magnet vernier generator (PMVG)-based wind energy model and a Rossler model. Also, the applicability and superiority of the derived sufficient conditions are proved when compared with the existing results.},

To adapt the intelligent system to the varying previewing characteristics of a human, a time-varying previewing driver model is constructed, and a penalty factor for human–machine intervention is designed based on fuzzy rules to assign driving control rights by assessing the driver’s state. Consequently, a human–vehicle–road model with driver preview time and penalty factor as varying parameters is established. Based on gain-scheduling control, a human–machine cooperative steering torque controller is designed to adapt to the varying previewing characteristics of a human and the change in human–machine intervention. The stability and robustness of the entire parameter space are guaranteed by constraining the poles in a certain region.

  abstract     = {With the increasing complexity and scale of modern industrial processes, there widely exist two-valued variables (TVs), such as status monitoring and numerical range variables. However, the traditional process monitoring approaches (such as principal component analysis and partial least square) are strongly based on continuous variables (CVs), thus they totally ignore the useful merit inherent in TVs. Recently, both CVs and TVs are used in combination for monitoring industrial processes for the first time. The mixed hidden naive Bayesian model (MHNBM) and feature-weighted mixed naive Bayes model (FWMNBM) have been proposed to enhance the monitoring performance by simultaneously and efficiently exploiting the valuable information of TVs and CVs. Nevertheless, both models are not suitable for nonstationary processes, which are consistent with the real property of many practical cases. Therefore, this article mainly proposes a novel self-learning FWMNBM (SL-FWMNBM) for nonstationary process monitoring. SL-FWMNBM constantly updates the model parameters in real time at the online detection stage to overcome the changes in the statistical characteristics of monitoring variables. It has the ability to mine process information carried by newly sampled data through self-learning, which is the main difference between SL-FWMNBM and the above two methods. The effectiveness of SL-FWMNBM is demonstrated through a simulation and an actual vibration case of the Zhoushan thermal power plant, China.},

Differing from the conventional performance indices (e.g., the quadratic value function), it detects the performance variation information from symmetric positive-definite (SPD) kernel matrices. As a carrier of performance variation information, the SPD kernel matrix is identified online. Furthermore, the performance variation is given a fresh insight in the sense that it drives the sliding of the SPD kernel matrix on a Riemannian manifold. Thus, performance variation monitoring is achieved by quantizing the geodesic between SPD kernel matrices directly on the Riemannian manifold. At last, the performance variation is visualized on the Riemannian manifold and the proposed schemes are verified via a simulation study.},

The proposed functions also consider the tendency to exxaggerate/downplay the ambiguity. More specifically, the proposed entropy functions take as argument the perceived ambiguity value, rather than the actual membership grade. Besides, the relationship between the perceived membership grade and ambiguity is closely modeled to compute the overall entropy.
