  abstract     = {Received signal strength (RSS)-based localization techniques are widely used to estimate the location of wireless sensor nodes as they utilize minimum bandwidth and do not require additional hardware.However, these techniques typically assume that the nodes&#39; transmit power is known, despite the fact that changes in transmit power, influenced by factors such as antenna orientation and battery level, can significantly impact localization performance. To address this issue, we propose an RSS-based cooperative localization technique that jointly estimates the location and transmit power of the nodes and will refer to it as FCUP (Fast Cooperative localization technique with Unknown transmit Power). The maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for joint estimation of location and transmit power is non-convex, discontinuous, and computationally challenging to solve. So, we reformulate the optimization problem into a mixed semidefinite second-order cone program (SDP-SOCP) using the Taylor expansion, epigraph method, and semidefinite relaxation. FCUP takes advantage of the high accuracy of SDP and the low complexity of SOCP. FCUP is compared to the existing techniques to demonstrate its superior performance based on localization accuracy, computational complexity, and execution time.},

  abstract     = {Cloud Radio Access Network (CRAN) is the most preferred cellular architecture to support milli-meter wave (mm-Wave) transmission. It fulfills the requisites of mm-Wave communication by enabling Coordinated Multi Point (CoMP) framework. However, the potential of CRAN is not exploited to its maximum, especially from the perspective of high mobility scenarios, e.g., vehicular transmission. This is because; a) CoMP-enabled framework requires exceptional pre-transmission processing, which may soon outdate for high mobility scenarios, b) the network is usually designed to support peak hour traffic and hence mostly remains under-utilized during sparse traffic conditions. To mitigate such issues, this work proposes a modified RAN with Traffic Aware Hybrid CRAN Scheme (TRASH) aiming two-fold advantages; a) micro-Wave and mm-Wave are jointly utilized to enhance reliability of fast moving scenario, b) a sub-RAN architecture is introduced to support traffic fluctuations. Moreover, through simulation results, it is shown that TRASH provides significant performance enhancement against traditional CRAN based transmission.},

In our derivation, we first introduce the stochastic peak function whose limiting average is related to the average PAoI. Next, we utilize a new SHS that includes the stochastic peak function to find the average PAoI.

In particular, the UE offloads a task to its nearby UAV, and this UAV can execute a part of the received task and offload the remaining part to its neighboring UAV. The offloading process continues until the task execution is finished. The benefit of this multihop offloading is that the task execution can be finished faster, and the computing load can be shared among multiple UAVs, thus avoiding overloading and congestion. Each node, i.e., the UE or the UAV, needs to determine the task size for offloading to minimize the cumulative energy consumption and latency over the nodes. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem under the dynamics and uncertainty of the UAV-assisted MEC system. Then, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to solve this problem. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRL algorithm.},

Then, according to pre-trained network with best similarity match, a similarity score map of CSI with unknown coordinates is constructed to predict position precisely.

In this work, an LEO relay-aided GEO satellite-terrestrial system, including a GEO satellite transmitter (G), a randomly deployed terrestrial receiver (U), and a randomly distributed LEO satellite (L), is considered. Specifically, regarding the decode-and-forward relay scheme adopted at the LEO satellite and adopting geometric probability theory, we investigate the end-to-end outage performance of the G-L-U relay link. Moreover, we also derive the analytical expression for the outage performance of the direct G-U link. Then, the performance of the two links is compared to explore suitable angle ranges to exploit the benefit of introducing the LEO satellite relay.

However, studies have shown the potential of taking advantage of nonlinear distortion as additional useful information, provided that optimum maximum likelihood (ML) receivers are employed. In fact, the optimum ML performance can potentially be better than those of linear transmitters. In that sense, one might ask what NL characteristics can maximize those performance gains. In this work, we study optimum Cartesian NL characteristics for Gaussian-like signals such as the ones associated with OFDM modulations.

Specifically, the active sensing process is characterized as a virtual lossy data transmission through non-cooperative joint source-channel coding. The bounds of SER are analyzed based on the data processing inequality, followed by a detailed derivation of achievable bounds under the special cases of the Gaussian linear model (GLM) and semi-controllable GLM. As for the intractable non-linear model, a computable upper bound is also given in terms of the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound (BCRB).

Since the optimization problem is non-convex and difficult to solve directly, it is decomposed into three sub-problems, user pairing, power allocation, and CS deployment. First, users are served by CSs in a hybrid NOMA manner and paired according to the power demand coefficient. Secondly, we derive the closed-form solution of the power allocation factor in the Rayleigh fading channels. Thirdly, the simulated annealing algorithm is used to optimize the deployment of CSs.

  abstract     = {In this paper, physical layer security (PLS) in an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted multiple-input multiple-output multiple-antenna eavesdropper (MIMOME) system is studied. In particular, we consider a practical scenario without instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropper and assume that the eavesdropping channel is a Rayleigh channel. To deal with the complexity of currently available IRS-assisted PLS schemes, we propose a low-complexity deep learning (DL) based approach to design transmitter beamforming and IRS jointly, where precoding vector and phase shift matrix are used to minimize the secrecy outage probability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DL-based approach can achieve a similar performance of that with conventional alternating optimization (AO) algorithms with a significantly low computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Specific emitter identification (SEI) is a potential physical layer authentication technology, which is one of the most critical complements of upper layer authentication. Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF)-based SEI is to distinguish one emitter from each other by immutable RF characteristics from electronic components. Due to the powerful ability of deep learning (DL) to extract hidden features and perform classification, it can extract highly separative features from massive signal samples, thus enabling SEI. Considering the condition of limited training samples, we propose a novel few-shot SEI (FS-SEI) method based on interpolative metric learning (InterML) which gets rid of the dependence on auxiliary dataset. Specifically, InterML is designed to mine more implicit samples in the sample space to improve generalization, and constrain the feature distance in the feature space to improve discriminability. The proposed InterML-based FS-SEI method is evaluated on a real-world Wi-Fi dataset. The simulation results show that the proposed method achieves better identification performance, higher feature discriminability and more stable performance than five latest FS-SEI methods. In the 10 shot scenario, the identification accuracy of InterML is 91.48%, compared to the comparison methods, the accuracy is improved by 0.62%–31.29%.},

UAV clusters are regarded as an excellent solution for the rapid and flexible construction of wireless communication networks in emergency scenarios. The direct position determination (DPD) algorithms have been proved to outperform the two-step algorithms, but they introduce significant computational and communication overhead, which is intolerable for resource-constrained UAV clusters. To address the challenging problem of high-quality passive emitter localization with limited communication and computational overhead, we propose a deep neural network (DNN)-aided distributed DPD method for UAV cluster. Different from most existing DPD algorithms, a novel distributed computing strategy, cost function and corresponding iterative algorithm are proposed to avoid expensive global search in the region of interest. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method considerably reduces communication and computational overhead, while maintaining similar positioning performance to the traditional DPD in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.},

However, for any number of receive and transmit antennas, when and how an active RIS can help to improve the sum-DoF are still unclear. This paper studies the sum-DoF of an active RIS-assisted two-user MIMO IC with arbitrary antenna configurations. In particular, RIS beamforming, transmit zero-forcing, and interference decoding are integrated together to combat the interference problem. In order to maximize the achievable sum-DoF, an integer optimization problem is formulated to optimize the number of eliminating interference links by RIS beamforming. As a result, the derived achievable sum-DoF can be higher than the sum-DoF of two-user MIMO IC, leading to a RIS gain. Furthermore, a sufficient condition of the RIS gain is given as the relationship between the number of RIS elements and the antenna configuration.},

In practice, various linear precoding schemes, such as zero-forcing (ZF) and regularized ZF (RZF) precoding, are sufficient to achieve near-optimal performance in traditional massive MIMO (mMIMO) systems. It is critical to note that in large-scale antenna arrays the operation of channel matrix inversion poses a significant computational challenge for these precoders. Therefore, we explore several iterative methods for determining the precoding matrix for XL-MIMO systems instead of direct matrix inversion. Taking into account small- and large-scale fading as well as spatial correlation between antennas, we study their computational complexity and convergence rate. Furthermore, we propose the Jacobi-Preconditioning Conjugate Gradient (Jac-PCG) iterative inversion method, which enjoys a faster convergence speed than the CG method.

Specifically, we aim to maximize secrecy rate of the multicast system by jointly optimizing the beamforming at base station and the phase shift at RIS. To solve the non-convexity optimization problem, we first introduce slack variables to equivalently transform the problem. Then, an alternative algorithm consisting of two subproblems is designed to deal with the joint optimization problem. Besides, general sign-definiteness transformation is tailored to address the CSI uncertainty and successive convex approximation methods are proposed to transform non-convex constraints. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared with existing approaches, and reveal the impact of key parameters on the security performance.},

In this paper, we present an investigation on beamforming in an IRS-aided directional modulation (DM) network. To fully explore the advantages of IRS, two beamforming methods with enhanced secrecy rate (SR) performance are proposed. The first method of maximizing secrecy rate (Max-SR) alternately optimizes confidential message (CM) beamforming vector, artificial noise (AN) beamforming vector and phase shift matrix. The first optimization vector is directly computed by the Rayleigh ratio and the last two are solved with generalized power iteration (GPI). This method is called Max-SR-GPI. To reduce the computational complexity, a new method of maximizing receive power with zero-forcing constraint (Max-RP-ZFC) of only reflecting CM and no AN is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed two methods harvest about 30 percent rate gains over the cases of random-phase IRS and no IRS, and the proposed Max-SR-GPI performs slightly better than the Max-RP-ZFC in terms of SR, particularly in the small-large IRS.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we exploit a novel model-driven deep learning (MDDL)-based scheme for efficient wideband millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation where the neural networks for sparse channel representation and recovery are respectively designed. For the former, we propose an angular-resampling network to determine the sampling intervals of grids adaptive to the true angles of arrival (AoAs) of paths, based on which an effective dictionary for sparse channel representation in angle-domain can be constructed. To this end, the neural network consisting of three modules trained with a newly-designed angular Gaussian-mixture distribution loss function is developed. For the latter, we propose an inverse-free variational Bayesian learning (IF-VBL) driven deep-unfolding network for sparse channel recovery. Specifically, the IF-VBL method by maximizing a general relaxed evidence lower bound (ELBO) is first developed, which is then unfolded into a layer-wise architecture where some a-priori parameters are learned. Simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed MDDL-based channel estimation scheme with significantly improved convergence and performance over counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligence surface (RIS) can be deployed to assist the communications in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. Employing the sparsity of the mmWave channel, the compressive sensing (CS) techniques can be leveraged to reduce the pilot overhead of the channel estimation (CE). However, conventional CS-based algorithms are based on the discrete grids and the difference between the real continuous angle and its nearest grid point is called off-grid error. Off-grid errors seriously deteriorate the CE performance. In this article, we propose the orthogonal matching pursuit with discrete-continuous optimization (DC-OMP) method for RIS assisted mmWave systems to mitigate the impact of the off-grid errors. Simulation results show that compared with existing works, the proposed DC-OMP can efficiently mitigate the impact of the off-grid errors without adding much complexity.},

  abstract     = {As an enabling technique of cognitive radio (CR), compressive spectrum sensing (CSS) based on compressive sensing (CS) can detect the spectrum opportunities from wide frequency bands efficiently and accurately by using sub-Nyquist sampling rate. However, the sensing performance of most existing CSS excessively relies on the prior information such as spectrum sparsity or noise variance. Thus, a key challenge in practical CSS is how to work effectively even in the absence of such information. In this paper, we propose a blind orthogonal least squares based CSS algorithm (B-OLS-CSS), which functions properly without the requirement of prior information. Specifically, we develop a novel blind stopping rule for the OLS algorithm based on its probabilistic recovery condition. This innovative rule gets rid of the need of the spectrum sparsity or noise information, but only requires the computational-feasible mutual incoherence property of the given measurement matrix. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the signal-to-noise ratio required by the proposed B-OLS-CSS for achieving a certain sensing accuracy is relaxed than that by the benchmark CSS using the OMP algorithm, which is verified by extensive simulation results.},

To maximize the real-time secrecy rate, we propose an extended Kalman filtering (EKF)-based method for tracking and predicting Bob&#39;s location at the UAV based on the delay measurements extracted from the sensing echoes. We then formulate a non-convex real-time trajectory design problem and develop an efficient iterative algorithm for finding a near optimal solution.

  abstract     = {Coordinated beamforming holds tremendous potential to maximize network capacity, whose effect largely depends on the period sounding reference signal (SRS)-based channel sounding. However, the huge discrepancy between the sounding channel and the real-time channel is inevitable and nonnegligible with channel aging, which results in severe degradation of coordinated beamforming gain. In this paper, the discrepancy is modeled as a random error term with the effect of channel aging included, and a robust coordinated beamforming design with channel aging is further proposed, exploiting the potential capacity gain through the channel statistical information, which provides the potential for tuning the SRS period. Specifically, the joint correlation properties of channels are modeled in the random error matrix with the static statistical information collected from practical channel samples. To cope with multiple random terms, the deterministic equivalent method is adopted to obtain the approximate closed-form expression of the ergodic capacity, aiming at deriving a robust beamformer that can achieve a stationary point of the expected weighted sum-rate maximization problem. In addition, by adopting the proposed beamforming design, the tuning guidance for the SRS period is provided for practical networks satisfying different capacity requirements and mobile scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed design can extend the SRS period more than 1× at 10% capacity loss when user speed &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$v=30\;\rm {km/h}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , compared with the traditional beamforming design.},

  abstract     = {Communication technologies have grown fast over the previous decade, resulting in substantial breakthroughs in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications and services. ITS is distinguished by high node mobility and instability, making confidentiality, security, and privacy a difficult challenge to address in its implementation. Even though several researchers have suggested authenticated key agreement protocols for secure transmission, significant flaws can still be observed. Moreover, this research presents a unique blockchain-based group key agreement protocol to address these complex challenges. The proposed protocol can minimize processing latency, deployment costs, and queuing delay by utilizing RSU as a semi-trusted entity. Moreover, blockchain characteristics accomplish inter-regional authentication. We show that the proposed protocol is secure against known security threats, which we proved formally. In addition, the performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol has considerably less communication and computational overhead than other existing protocols. Furthermore, the simulations are performed on NS-3 to demonstrate the practical aspects of the proposed protocol.},

  abstract     = {In event or disaster scenarios where network communication is jammed, it is important to provide stable network service to users within a reasonable amount of time. We propose a path planning algorithm for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to serve network traffic in hotspot areas using spatio-temporal information about requests among the region of interest (RoI). The main task of a UAV is to provide communication services to users, while preparing for future hotspots. We propose a simple yet efficient trajectory design consisting of two phases: 1) targeting traffic for a single UAV, and 2) cooperative targeting for multiple UAVs. First, each UAV selects a long-term target considering future traffic and then a short-term target considering the present traffic. When UAVs encounter other UAVs, a cooperative targeting phase ensures UAVs serve traffic in different locations or with different statuses. Our trajectory design enables a UAV to construct its own path for a continuous UAV-enabled network. Simulation and real-world dataset-based experiments confirmed that our targeting scheme provides sufficient network service in a reasonable time, with an average service rate factor of up to 0.85, and an average service completion time relative to the deadline of up to 0.23. The experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed algorithm provides more stable performance compared to other existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In wireless networks, scheduling becomes a necessity to dynamically match user selection and resource allocation with traffic needs and wireless channel conditions. Plenty of previous works focus on scheduling in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. They implicitly assume that the number of users is fixed and traffic sources keep on injecting traffic into the system. Then the optimization problems related to the energy efficiency (EE) and the spectral efficiency (SE), are investigated. However, long-lived flows and short-lived flows exist simultaneously in complex actual environments. We, for the first time, investigate a downlink NOMA system with flow-level dynamics and formulate an optimization problem of scheduling in this article. We aim to maximize the short-term EE at each time slot and simultaneously guarantee the long-term network queue stability (throughput-optimality), under the quality of service (QoS) constraints of each achievable data rate and the total of transmission powers at each time slot. Based on the Lyapunov optimization theory, the original problem is transformed into an optimization problem that independent of time, and then the optimal algorithm is proposed. Moreover, we analyze the complexity of proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the optimal algorithm is throughput-optimal, and its performance is better than that of the benchmark algorithm in terms of EE and the scheduling delay.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing provides the opportunity for edge systems to underpin a variety of computation-intensive yet delay-sensitive applications. We acknowledge that the limited computing and storage resource of an individual edge server allows only a subset of services to be placed at a time. This raises the question of service placement, which refers to where to place each type of service. Moreover, which service to place allows which type of tasks to be processed, and thereby affects task scheduling performance, which refers to where/whether to schedule each task and task splitting among edge and cloud. Respect of the interactions between service placement and task scheduling (SPTS), a joint optimized design of SPTS is investigated in this article. Our main contribution is a novel spatial-temporal collaboration of SPTS to minimize the overall cost of edge systems. Spatial collaboration is explored to enable edge servers within specific geographic regions collaboratively serve users&#39; demands, while temporal collaboration is explored to optimize the SPTS in multiple time slots and pursue a long-term performance. We first propose an online and decentralized algorithm for spatial-temporal collaborative of SPTS. We then extend the proposed single-timescale of the proposed algorithm into multiple timescales to have service (re)placed at a larger timescale and hence alleviate service interruption. While proved to preserve the asymptotic optimality, the larger timescale slow down the optimal service placement decision. A learn-and-adapt strategy is further designed to speed up the service placement. Theoretical analysis and simulations are performed to validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

In this article we propose the dynamic deployment of anchor point network functions at edge locations and the assignment of terminals to these anchor points with the joint objective of minimizing communications latency and reducing network overhead. We formally define the problem as a multi-objective optimization and also propose a novel heuristic greedy algorithm for approximating the solution.

And the lightweight CanNet image classification network is constructed to detect the abnormalities in the generated CAN images. In order to exploit the maximum correlation of data attributes among the acquired CAN traffic data, copula entropy, the equivalent form of mutual information, is introduced into the CAN image generation scheme. In addition, an extended CAN image color coding scheme is also designed to cope with the secure detection of traffic data beyond the 12-bit CAN ID. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed detection mechanism is validated by the comparative experiments employing the CAN traffic data from YF Sonata (the type of car).},

  abstract     = {The increasing demands of remote sensing (RS) have put a strain on computation and transmission resources. Traditional ground-offloading techniques, which involve sending large amounts of raw data to the ground, suffer from poor satellite-to-ground link quality. Additionally, current satellite-offloading methods, which involve using low earth orbit (LEO) satellites within the visible range of RS satellites for processing, fail to fully utilize the computing capability of the network due to limited computation resources of visible LEO satellites, particularly in hotspot areas. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel computing-aware routing scheme for efficient offloading via LEO satellite networks. This scheme integrates transmission and computation processes and optimizes overall delay. By modeling the LEO satellite network as a snapshot-free dynamic network model, cross-time pathfinding with low memory consumption is enabled. Instead of shielding the dynamics, the proposed model converts the topology dynamics into the association dynamics between satellites and virtual nodes, which represents self-loops, special edge and node weights. The proposed computing-aware routing scheme processes tasks during routing instead of offloading raw data to ground stations, reducing overall delay and preventing network congestion. The routing problem is formulated as a combination of multiple dynamic single source shortest path problems and a genetic algorithm-based method is proposed to approximate solutions in a reasonable amount of time. Simulation results indicate that the proposed computing-aware routing scheme decreases overall delay by 78.31% compared to offloading raw data to the ground for processing when computing capability is 100 Giga floating-point operations per second, which is a commonly supported capability by most LEO satellites.},

Resource-constrained vehicles outsource data to vehicular cloud platforms for timely traffic safety services, e.g., navigation, accident alarms, etc. Auditing the authenticity of data has become a critical issue in outsourcing data to untrusted servers. Existing data audit methods encode all data with error correction codes (ECC) techniques that retrieve corrupted data by downloading all data. The communication overhead of such methods is &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$O(n)$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$n$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is the number of data blocks) which is unbearable for vehicles with limited resources. In addition, these schemes employ an inaccurate privacy-preserving model. This will lead to data leakage in the third-party audit process. Although they use randomness to confuse parts of the proof that is used to prove the data state, a small amount of information is still distinguishable. For such, in this paper, we propose a practical data audit scheme with retrievability and indistinguishable privacy-preserving to efficiently audit the state of outsourced data. We improve the Invertible Bloom Filter (IBF) to compress redundancy locally, which can retrieve corrupted data without prior context. Furthermore, we define an indistinguishable privacy-preserving model to capture the complete semantics of repeated audit attacks and achieve indistinguishability in the audit. We prove that our scheme is secure against adaptive chosen message attacks and is indistinguishable privacy-preserving against repeated audit attacks.

  abstract     = {Clock synchronization is a crucial technique for vehicle networks, which provides the basis for collaborative operations among devices. Accurate synchronization can be achieved by exchanging synchronization packets, but with the expansion of the device scale, frequent interaction of synchronization packets will generate a lot of communication overhead. Recently, an interesting synchronization mechanism, timestamp-free synchronization, has been investigated, which can effectively eliminate the synchronization packets and avoid additional overhead. However, existing research on timestamp-free synchronization is based on the assumption of Gaussian random delays, and the case that random delay following exponential distribution is not considered. Therefore, this article explores the problem of clock parameter estimation with exponential delays based on timestamp-free synchronization. First, the best linear unbiased estimator using order statistics (BLUE-OS) of clock skew for the active node is derived. Then, in the scenario of embedding timestamp-free synchronization into receiver-only synchronization, the BLUE-OS of clock skew for inactive nodes under exponential delays is developed. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and estimators.},

In this article, by employing overlay and underlay spectrum access modes, we investigate a covert cooperative cognitive radio (CCCR) system, where primary transmitter (PT) and secondary transmitter (ST) cooperate with each other to secretly transmit their own confidential information. Specifically, PT can initiate the transmission directly or transmit information with the aid of ST. In return, ST is able to transmit information by exploiting PT&#39;s spectrum. In our system, we assume that both PT and ST send artificial noise (AN) to confuse eavesdropper (Eve). That is to say, ST sends AN to Eve when PT initiates the transmission and PT sends AN to Eve when ST transmits information. Then, we explore Eve&#39;s detection scheme and obtain the closed-form expression of the minimum detection error probability at Eve in the two modes. We further analyze covert rate and covert outage probability (COP) of primary receiver (PR) and secondary receiver (SR) in different modes. Numerical results show that the interference power dominates the covert transmission, while the self-interference has little impact on the covert performance. Furthermore, it is observed that PR can obtain better covert performance in underlay mode, while SR can obtain better covert performance in overlay mode.},

  abstract     = {The deployment of millimeter-wave (mmWave) 5G New Radio (NR) networks is hampered by the properties of the mmWave band, such as severe signal attenuation and dynamic link blockage, which together limit the cell range. To provide a cost-efficient and flexible solution for network densification, 3GPP has recently proposed integrated access and backhaul (IAB) technology. As an alternative approach to terrestrial deployments, the utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as IAB-nodes may provide additional flexibility for topology configuration. The aims of this study are to (i) propose efficient optimization methods for airborne and conventional IAB systems and (ii) numerically quantify and compare their optimized performance. First, by assuming fixed locations of IAB-nodes, we formulate and solve the joint path selection and resource allocation problem as a network flow problem. Then, to better benefit from the utilization of UAVs, we relax this constraint for the airborne IAB system. To efficiently optimize the performance for this case, we propose to leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for specifying airborne IAB-node locations. Our numerical results show that the capacity gains of airborne IAB systems are notable even in non-optimized conditions but can be improved by up to 30 % under joint path selection and resource allocation and, even further, when considering aerial IAB-node locations as an additional optimization criterion.},

However, it is challenging to protect the privacy of vehicles while simultaneously maintaining the quality of service of location-based services. In this article, we present a new context-based mix strategy that provides a higher privacy level and reduces information loss during the pseudonym-changing process. A global passive adversary model is developed to evaluate its performance and the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism is demonstrated. Finally, a uniform framework to evaluate different strategies for vehicular privacy is developed and used to compare their strengths and weaknesses in different scenarios.},

  abstract     = {This article deals with the problem of joint detection and localization of multiple targets in a distributed multiple-input multiple-output radar system where the emitted waveforms present imperfect auto- and cross-correlation functions. In this context, the sidelobe masking effects can considerably degrade the detection and localization performance of correlation-based detectors. To address this issue, we first derive a convenient discrete-time signal model, wherein the echoes generated by a target towards each receive antenna are regarded as a subspace signal. Then, we formulate the joint detection and localization problem as a composite multiple hypothesis test and derive the optimal solution according to a generalized information criterion, whose complexity scales exponentially with the number of prospective targets. To reduce the computational burden, we derive two iterative approximate solutions which detect and localize one target at a time from the noisy data, upon mitigating the sidelobe masking caused by the previously-detected ones. Finally, we provide an extensive numerical analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions, even in the challenging case where an unknown number of strong and weak targets is present in the covered area.},

However, developing efficient resource management mechanisms to meet the heterogeneous user traffic demands remains an open challenge for satellite operators. Furthermore, the spectrum shortage and the ever-increasing demands claim for more aggressive frequency reuse. In this article, we combine the time-flexible payload capabilities known as beam hopping (BH) with precoding techniques in order to satisfy user traffic requests in areas of high demand (i.e. hot-spot areas). The proposed framework considers a flexible beam-cluster hopping where adjacent beams can be activated if needed, forming clusters with various shapes and sizes. In this context, we present three strategies to design the beam illumination patterns. First, a max-min user demand fairness satisfaction problem; second, a penalty-based optimization is considered to penalize the occurrence of adjacent beams in an attempt to avoid precoding whenever possible. Third, seeking a low-complexity design, we propose a queuing-based approach to solve the problem in a time-slot-by-time-slot basis trying to provide service to users based on the requested demands. The three methods are discussed in detail and evaluated via numerical simulations, confirming their effectiveness versus benchmark schemes and identifying the pros and cons of each proposed design.},

However, data security and authentication are still challenging as sensitive data is collected and shared in RCAV using an open channel, i.e., the Internet. The existing security of Internet-of-Drones (IoD) communication mainly depends on the hardness of discrete logarithms and factorization problems. However, due to Shor&#39;s algorithm, both authorized and secure transmissions are challenging in the presence of highly scalable quantum computers. To mitigate the aforementioned issues and challenges, in this article, we propose an authorized and secure communication scheme for IoD based on Ring Learning With Error (RLWE) problem on lattices, which have the potential to sustain low computation and quantum attacks. The proposed scheme supports mutual authentication and has an efficient session establishment.

  abstract     = {In a marine underwater object detecting system, sonobuoys collect underwater acoustic data and then wirelessly transmit it to an agile and controllable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which, in turn, relays the raw data to the terrestrial computing center for further processing. However, constrained by the limitations in communication bandwidth and vehicle maneuverability, the UAV cannot fly over each sonobuoy to gather all the raw data within the prescribed period. In addition, to effectively detect the underwater object, we should also exploit diverse acoustical measurements of different sonobuoys (e.g., triangulation scheme) and maintain a certain level of throughput fairness among sonobuoys. Consequently, for efficient detection, both the bandwidth allocation and flight trajectory must be jointly optimized according to the importance of each sonobuoy. To this end, based on the α-fairness utility function, we design a bandwidth allocation strategy that assigns radio resource to a sonobuoy according to its weight. Similarly, in each searching round, the flying trajectory is also repeatedly optimized thus reducing the communication distances of those important sonobuoys. Moreover, in the proposed strategies, the weight of each sonobuoy and the α value are iteratively updated, which can progressively allow the UAV to fly more closely to those important sonobuoys to collect more effective data, thus significantly expediting the detecting process. Extensive simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed strategy, in that, compared with the benchmark strategies, it can detect underwater objects faster and more accurately.},

That is, the inputs given to the Bayesian filter are the received baseband signals instead of pre-computed ranges or angles. We first propose to use the Rao-Blackwellized Point Mass Filter (RBPMF) to solve such a tracking problem. As such, the resulting tracking solution is still computationally expensive. Therefore, we propose an approach for reducing the computational cost of the RBPMF. More precisely, we replace the prediction step by the one of the Linear Kalman Filter (LKF). This combination helps to avoid expensive operations such as the weight convolution in the prediction step. In addition, it also allows complexity reductions in the correction step. As a result, the complexity is reduced by one order of magnitude compared to the original RBPMF. We compare our approach to representative direct-tracking methods, based on Iterative Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) and Particle Filter (PF). The proposed solution has lower and comparable localization error compared to IEKF and PF, respectively. In addition, the proposed solution is of slightly less complexity than PF. However, the complexity reduction is significant compared to the conventional RBPMF.},

In this regard, the capability of cell-free massive MIMO to provide reliable access links by guaranteeing uniform quality of service without cell edge can be exploited for a seamless parallel computing. Taking this into account, we formulate a joint communication and computing resource allocation (JCCRA) problem for a cell-free massive MIMO-enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) network with the objective of minimizing the total energy consumption of the users while meeting the ultra-low delay constraints. To derive efficient and adaptive JCCRA scheme robust to network dynamics, we present a distributed solution approach based on cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed distributed approach can achieve comparable performance to a centralized deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based target benchmark, without incurring additional overhead and time cost. It is also shown that our approach significantly outperforms heuristic baselines in terms of energy efficiency, roughly up to 5 times less total energy consumption. Furthermore, we demonstrate substantial performance improvement compared to cellular MEC systems.},

Amid prevalence artificial intelligence applications in various industries, the offloading of semantic extraction tasks which are mainly composed of convolutional neural networks of computer vision is a great challenge for communication bandwidth and computing capacity allocation in MEC systems. Considering the stochastic nature of the semantic extraction tasks, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem by modeling it as the dynamic arrival of tasks in the temporal domain. We jointly optimize the system revenue and cost which are represented as user admission in the long term and resource allocation in the short term respectively. To handle the proposed stochastic optimization problem, we decompose it into short-time-scale subproblems and a long-time-scale subproblem by using the Lyapunov optimization technique. After that, the short-time-scale optimization variables of resource allocation, including user association, bandwidth allocation, and computing capacity allocation are obtained in closed form. The user admission optimization on long-time scales is solved by a heuristic iteration method. Then, the multi-time scale user admission and resource allocation algorithm is proposed for dynamic semantic extraction task computing in MEC systems. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with the benchmarks, the proposed algorithm improves the performance of user admission and resource allocation efficiently and achieves a flexible trade-off between system revenue and cost at multi-time scales and considering semantic extraction tasks.},

  abstract     = {With the explosive increase of intelligent applications and smart terminals, the high-speed transmission is the fundamental requirement for the future network. As a powerful deployment strategy, the heterogeneous network (HetNet) is of great significance for improving network throughput. This article investigates the resource allocation problem in the HetNet with device-to-device (D2D) communication, where sub-channel allocation and power allocation are jointly optimized to maximize the network throughput under the constraints of sub-channel allocation, transmitting power and throughput. The formulated optimization problem is a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, which is difficult to be solved directly, due to the coupling of discrete sub-channel allocation variables and continuous power optimization variables. To deal with this issue, the time sharing factor (TSF) method is exploited to transform the original MINLP problem into a tractable continuous problem. Since the traditional centralized schemes necessarily aggravates computational burden on the central node and reduces network reliability, an integrated cooperative distributed resource allocation algorithm (CDRAA) is proposed in this article, where all the small base stations (SBSs) and macro base stations (MBSs) cooperatively participate in resource allocation instead of the unique manipulation by the central node. Simulation results demonstrate the performance gap and the running time comparison between the proposed algorithms and the centralized algorithm. In addition, the convergence of the proposed algorithms is verified in several different network settings. The network throughput achieved by the proposed CDRAA is higher than that obtained by the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm and the centralized algorithm based on the TSF method when a great number of sub-channels is provided.},

In this paper, we study a data compression scheme in the multi-user UAV-enabled edge computing process to reduce energy consumption of WDs. The offloading of compressed tasks is further investigated for the overall improved computing performance. Specifically, we formulate a problem to minimize the sum energy consumption of WDs by optimizing WD power control, task compression ratio, communication resource allocation, and UAV trajectory, under the constraints of computation task deadline, communication resource budget, WD transmission power budget, UAV onboard energy budget, and trajectory limitations. Numerical results are shown to evaluate the performance of this edge computing and data compression collaboration scheme, which validates the feasibility of the proposed energy efficient edge computing and data compression algorithm and presents that our proposed scheme can save at least 28.2% energy consumption compared with other baseline schemes when the raw task size is 4 Mbits.},

However, the high dynamics of network topology and the time-varying distribution of link resources would deteriorate the quality of service (QoS) for LEO satellite networks. In order to reduce communication delay and ensure end-to-end (E2E) data transmissions, a joint minimum hop and earliest arrival (MHEA) routing algorithm for LEO satellite networks is proposed in this article. Firstly, based on the networking mode of Walker constellations, a coordinate graph (CG) model is proposed to accurately characterize both the topological structure and link resource distribution of time-varying networks in the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. Afterwards, a CG-based minimum hop (MH) routing model is leveraged to calculate the minimum E2E hop count and determine the region of the minimum hop path. Finally, an earliest arrival (EA) strategy is proposed to determine the next hop node with the shortest delay. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MHEA routing algorithm not only reduces the route count, the hop count and the delay of E2E path, but also improves the file delivery ratio.},

Based on this model, our goal is to solve a mixed-integer non-linear optimization problem (MINLP) whose objective function is the weighted sum of the task-specific loss functions. To address this optimization problem, we split it into two sub-problems, referred to as resource allocation and offloading strategy. We develop a method based on Block Coordinate Descent technique combining convex optimization and Gray Wolf algorithm (BCD-CONGW) that alternatively solves the two sub-problems, until convergence. The former sub-problem is convex and can be solved in polynomial time, whereas the latter is non-convex and hence NP-hard. For the latter, we relax discrete variables and employ Gray Wolf algorithm with elite strategy to approximate its optimal point. By numerical evaluations, we show that our method outperforms existent methods in terms of latency and energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) allow controlling the propagation environment in wireless networks through reconfigurable elements. Recently, beyond diagonal RISs (BD-RISs) have been proposed as novel RIS architectures whose scattering matrix is not limited to being diagonal. However, BD-RISs have been studied assuming continuous-value scattering matrices, which are hard to implement in practice. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing two solutions to realize discrete-value group and fully connected RISs. First, we propose scalar-discrete RISs, in which each entry of the RIS impedance matrix is independently discretized. Second, we propose vector-discrete RISs, where the entries in each group of the RIS impedance matrix are jointly discretized. In both solutions, the codebook is designed offline such as to minimize the distortion caused in the RIS impedance matrix by the discretization operation. Numerical results show that vector-discrete RISs achieve higher performance than scalar-discrete RISs at the cost of increased optimization complexity. Furthermore, fewer resolution bits per impedance are necessary to achieve the performance upper bound as the group size of the group connected architecture increases. In particular, only a single resolution bit is sufficient in fully connected RISs to approximately achieve the performance upper bound.},

  abstract     = {In Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, the high mobility of vehicles generates the Doppler shift which leads to channel uncertainties. Moreover, the reasons for channel uncertainties also include the finite channel feedback, channel state information (CSI) loss and latency. With this concern, we formulate a joint spectrum and power allocation problem for V2X communication with imperfect CSI. Specifically, the sum capacity of cellular user equipments (CUEs) is maximized subject to the minimum Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio (SINR) requirements of CUEs and the outage probability constraints of vehicular user equipments (VUEs). Then, two different robust resource allocation approaches are designed to solve the problem. One is Bernstein Approximation-based Robust Resource Allocation approach. More specifically, Bernstein approximations are employed to convert the chance constraint into a calculable constraint, and Bisection search method is proposed to obtain the optimal allocation solution with low complexity. Then, for further reducing the computational complexity, Self-learning Robust Resource Allocation approach, which includes a learning method and an analytical mapping method, is proposed as the second approach. The learning method is devised to learn the uncertainty set which transforms the chance constraint into calculable constraints, and the analytical mapping method is proposed to obtain closed-form solutions of the resource allocation problem. Finally, the simulation results prove that the proposed approaches can improve the capacity of all CUEs effectively whilst ensuring the reliability of the channel.},

  abstract     = {Relay-enabled backscatter communication (BC) is an intriguing paradigm to alleviate energy shortage and improve throughput of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Most of the existing works focus on the resource allocation that considered the unequal and continuous time allocation for both source-relay and relay-destination links. However, the continuous time allocation may be infeasible since in practice, the time allocation shall be carried out in integral multiple of the subframe duration unit. In this article, we study a discrete time scheme from the perspective of frame structure, where one transmission block is divided into two phases and the linear mapping is employed as a re-encoding method to determine the number of subframes for both phases and the power allocation for each subframe in a relay-enabled BC system. Based on this, we derive an accurate system-throughput expression and formulate a mixed-integral non-convex optimization problem to maximize the system throughput by jointly optimizing the power reflection coefficient (PRC) of the IoT node, the power allocation of the hybrid access point (HAP) and the linear mapping matrix, and solve it via a three-step approach. First, we derive the optimal eigenvalues of the linear mapping matrix via introducing auxiliary variables and exploiting Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Second, we employ the time-sharing technology to convert the discrete optimization problem to a continuous non-convex problem and solve it by leveraging successive convex approximation (SCA) and monotonicity or bisection method. Finally, an integer conversion strategy is designed to find a suboptimal number of subframes for both phases, based on which the continuous variables are further optimized. According to the above approaches, we propose a low complexity iterative algorithm to obtain the throughput maximization-based resource allocation solution. Numerical results analyze the performance of our proposed algorithm, verify the superiority of our proposed scheme, and evaluate the impacts of network parameters on the system throughput.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate the physical layer security for a wireless communication system consisting of a base station (BS) and a user (U) in the face of an eavesdropper (E). A friendly jammer is opportunistically selected from multiple jammers to create intentional interference upon E. However, the legitimate user U is not aware of the information transmitted by the jammer and thus cannot remove the interfering signal. In this context, we propose interference-limited opportunistic jammer selection (IL-OJS) scheme and interference-canceled opportunistic jammer selection (IC-OJS) scheme to reduce the damage of interference to U for improving physical layer security. Specifically, in the IL-OJS scheme, the selected jammer sets an interference threshold. When the interference to U is less than the threshold value, the selected jammer will work (i.e., emit artificial noise), and vice versa, it will stop jamming. By contrast, IC-OJS scheme utilizes a specially designed signal to eliminate interference received by U from the selected jammer. For comparison, we also present the conventional non-jammer (NJ) scheme as a benchmark. Exact and asymptotic closed-form secrecy outage probability expressions for NJ, IL-OJS, and IC-OJS schemes are derived over Nakagami- &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; fading channels.

To solve the problem that the grid mismatch impacts DOA estimation accuracy, this article presents a new method for off-grid DOA estimation using weighted Sinc interpolation, referred to as OGWSISBL. Specifically, the off-grid error is represented as the parameter to be estimated in the observation model. Then, under the sparse Bayes learning (SBL) framework, the off-grid error is calculated using the variational Bayesian expectation maximization (VBEM) method and eliminated by updating the grids with weighted Sinc interpolation. The proposed method can work well in both single and multiple snapshots.

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning (ML). Distributed clients train locally and exclusively need to upload the model parameters to learn the global model collaboratively under the coordination of the aggregation server. Although the privacy of the clients is protected, which requires multiple rounds of data upload between the clients and the server to ensure the accuracy of the global model. Inevitably, this results in latency and energy consumption issues due to limited communication resources. Therefore, mobile edge computing (MEC) has been proposed to solve communication delays and energy consumption in federated learning. In this paper, we first analyze how to select the gradient values that help the global model converge quickly and establish theoretical analysis about the relationship between the convergence rate and the gradient direction. To efficiently reduce the energy consumption of clients during training, on the premise of ensuring the local training accuracy and the convergence rate of the global model, we adopt the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, which adaptively allocates resources according to different clients&#39; requests to minimize the energy consumption. To improve flexibility and scalability, we propose a new the semi-asynchronous federated update model, which allows clients to aggregate asynchronously on the server, and accelerates the convergence rate of the global model. Empirical results show that the proposed Algorithm &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathbf {1}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; not only accelerates the convergence speed of the global model, but also reduces the size of parameters that need to be uploaded.

In this article, we study a novel location-aware task offloading mechanism in a VEC-based single-vehicle multi-cell (SVMC) scenario, where the task can be equally partitioned into multiple subtasks. Different from existing work, task uploading and computing are taken into account in a parallel way. Taking the impact of the uncertainty of vehicle location on task uploading time into account, single-cell offloading and multi-cell offloading are investigated, respectively. Hence, the scheduling problem is studied with the objective of minimization task processing delay by jointly designing the amount of offloaded subtasks for multiple cells, where the task offloading decision over the small timescale is investigated due to small-scale fading. The problem turns out to be a min-max optimization problem, which can be transformed into a minimum problem of the absolute value function. For single-cell offloading, a low-complexity multi-time slot offloading (MTSO) algorithm is proposed by jointly optimizing the amount of offloaded subtasks for multiple time slots. For multi-cell offloading, a multi-cell and multi-time slots offloading (MCMTSO) algorithm is proposed by jointly optimizing the amount of offloaded subtasks for multiple time slots in multiple cells with low complexity. Simulation results review that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the task processing delay. For single-cell offloading, the task processing delay of MTSO is reduced by 40.5% compared to partial offloading (PO), while for multi-cell case, the MCMTSO scheme can reduce the task processing delay by 24.3% compared to PO.},

  abstract     = {Wireless data aggregation (WDA) is a pivotal enabling technique in the era of Internet of Things (IoT). Recently, an emerging WDA method, over-the-air computation (AirComp), has been proposed to perform fast data aggregation, with improved spectrum utilization and shortened transmission delay. In this article, we consider a multi-cell AirComp system with single-input multiple-output (SIMO) communications. All users in the system share the same wireless spectrum. The mean squared error (MSE) is used as the metric to quantify the computation accuracy of each cell. To achieve the fairness of data aggregation among different cells, we formulate a unified optimization problem to minimize the MSE-based objective function, from the perspective of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\alpha$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -fairness.

Thereafter, an efficient solution based on the block coordinate descent (BCD) method is proposed for each case. Specifically, in the first case, the optimal solutions are obtained for the beamforming at the AP and the power allocation at the user. In the second and third cases, a tractable solution to determine the power allocation is devised by adopting the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. In the last case, the majorization minimization (MM) method is applied to tackle the power allocation problem. Furthermore, by analyzing the MSE performance, we arrive at an in-depth insight. Namely, the impact of the inter-cell interference disappears when the number of antennas at the AP is sufficiently large. The effectiveness of our proposed schemes is validated by the numerical results.},

We propose a strategy against both energy-based and correlation-based interception techniques by jointly optimizing power allocation (PA) and spreading factor assignment (SA) of the WIN-T. This non-convex problem is then solved by advanced optimization techniques such as decomposition and difference of convex functions (DC). We also propose a communication mode selection strategy to improve the throughput performance in the context of LPI conservation. To obtain the optimized solution in near real-time, we design a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) algorithm. Our numerical results show the performance of the proposed MADRL algorithm is close to the optimal solution, making it applicable for practical systems.},

For the MIMO-NOMA scheme with group-wise successive interference cancellation (SIC), closed-form expressions for the estimated individual user-transmit-powers are derived for given signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements. Two metrics of average transmit-power are obtained to predict how the user-transmit-powers are distributed within the cell coverage. Numerical experiments show that the analyzed and simulated results are well matched and the gap is smaller than 2 dB for most cases, thus validating the conducted performance analysis. The analysis is further extended to imperfect SIC case. For this case, sufficient and necessary condition for the feasibility of the SINR-constrained user-precoder-design problem is obtained. Using the condition, bounds on system parameters such as scheduled user number and SINR target are derived for feasible MIMO-NOMA implementation.},

  abstract     = {Compared with the original instantly decodable network coding (IDNC), buffering IDNC (B-IDNC) can exploit non-instantly decodable packets (NIDPs) containing two unreceiving packets for subsequent network decoding. In this article, we employ B-IDNC in a fully connected D2D networks (FC-D2D) or a partially connected D2D networks (PC-D2D) aided HetNet, where the devices may simultaneously receive two IDNC packets, one from the cellular interface and the other from the device-to-device (D2D) interface. We establish the dual interface B-IDNC graph which can indicate all feasible coding opportunities, conflict-free transmissions, and instant decoding opportunities by exploiting buffered NIDPs. By employing the dual interface B-IDNC graph, a dual interface B-IDNC decoding scheme is developed, in which the IDNC packet which is instantly decodable is preferentially employed to perform network decoding, so as to increase the instant decoding opportunities of the other IDNC packet and the buffered NIDPs. According to the dual interface B-IDNC graph and the dual interface B-IDNC decoding scheme, a heuristic approach named as dual interface maximum decoding clique based maximum weight vertex (D-MDC-MWV) search is proposed to search the transmitting devices and the IDNC packets sent via the dual interfaces. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes over the existing network coding schemes.},

  abstract     = {With the proliferation of mobile devices (e.g., vehicles and smartphones), rich media content services from massive users lead to high network resource consumption and energy usage. How to effectively allocate heterogeneous network resources and achieve green content delivery is a major challenge to be addressed in urgency, especially when vehicular users are involved and the spatiotemporal distribution of the content requests can change drastically. In this article, we propose a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-aided task offloading and resource allocation scheme, named TORA-DRL, to minimize power consumption in cloud-edge cooperation environments, where in-network caching and request aggregation are incorporated to reduce replicated transmissions of network contents. Based on the history of content requests and available network resources in the system, TORA-DRL jointly optimizes the decisions about task offloading, as well as computing, caching and communication resource allocation, adapting to the changes in network states and user requirements. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TORA-DRL solution converges fast and has much higher energy efficiency than the existing popular cloud-edge cooperation schemes under different network environments.},

  abstract     = {The future sixth generation (6G) of communication systems is envisioned to provide numerous applications in safety-critical contexts, e.g., driverless traffic, modular industry, and smart cities, which require outstanding performance, high reliability and fault tolerance, as well as autonomy. Ensuring criticality awareness for diverse functional safety applications and providing fault tolerance in an autonomous manner are essential for future 6G systems. Therefore, this paper proposes jointly employing the concepts of resilience and mixed criticality. In this work, we conduct physical layer resource management in cloud-based networks under the rate-splitting paradigm, which is a promising factor towards achieving high resilience. We recapitulate the concepts individually, outline a joint metric to measure the criticality-aware resilience, and verify its merits in a case study. We, thereby, formulate a non-convex optimization problem, derive an efficient iterative algorithm, propose four resilience mechanisms differing in quality and time of adaption, and conduct extensive numerical simulations. Towards this end, we propose a highly autonomous rate-splitting-enabled physical layer resource management algorithm for future 6G networks respecting mixed-critical quality of service (QoS) levels and providing high levels of resilience. Results emphasize the considerable improvements of incorporating a mixed criticality-aware resilience strategy under channel outages and strict QoS demands. The rate-splitting paradigm is particularly shown to overcome state-of-the-art interference management techniques, and the resilience and throughput adaption over consecutive outage events reveals the proposed schemes contribution towards enabling future 6G networks.},

Based on the derived closed-form expressions, we propose a power allocation strategy by solving a multi-objective optimization problem between maximizing the average SE of UAVs and GUEs simultaneously with intelligent algorithm——Deep Q-Network (DQN). Numerical results verify the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions and the effectiveness of the proposed power allocation schemes for low altitude 3-D coverage with coexisted UAVs and GUEs.

The increasing entertainment needs of passengers, safety control information exchanges of trains, etc., make train-to-train (T2T) communications face the challenge of achieving high-capacity and high-quality data transmissions. In order to greatly increase the communication capacity, it is urgent to introduce millimeter wave (mmWave) technology. Faced with the problem that mmWave link is easy to be blocked, this article leverages the existing equipment to assist relay, and proposes an effective transmission scheduling scheme to improve the robustness of T2T communication systems. First of all, we formulate a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) optimization problem the transmission scheduling in T2T communication systems where mobile relays (MRs) are all working in the full-duplex (FD) mode. Then we propose a low complexity heuristic algorithm to solve the optimization problem, which consists of three components: relay selection, transmission mode selection, and transmission scheduling. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can greatly improve the number of completed flows and system throughput. Finally, we analyze the influence of different design parameters on the system performance. The results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve more data flows and system throughput within a reasonable communication distance threshold in T2T communication with obstacles in different orbits. It can balance the computational complexity and system performance to achieve an efficient and robust data transmission.},

Designing a reliable and robust routing protocol for FANET is essential and challenging. This article proposes a robust and reliable geographical routing protocol, named best-link and three-dimensional (3D) perimeter forwarding routing protocol (BLPR). Different from the existing studies based on a constant transmission range assumption, we propose a more practical metric of time-varying effective transmission range (ER). Considering the wireless channel propagation and the interference from other UAVs, the expression for ER is derived. Then, we propose a new best-link forwarding strategy, which selects the next-hop relay to forward data from a relay selection region specified by the ER being the radius. Furthermore, a routing recovery model, named 3D perimeter forwarding strategy, is designed to avoid local optima. Numerical experiments on the NS-3.29 platform demonstrate that the BLPR achieves significant performance gains over traditional 3D geographical routing algorithms and a state-of-the-art centralized routing protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio and throughput.},

In this article, a phase modulation array (PMA) based hybrid precoding framework in IRS-aided system is proposed, in which the PMA-based analog precoder is employed to enhance energy efficiency. To design hybrid precoding and determine phase shift of IRS, a three-matrix-variable optimization problem is formulated, which cannot be directly dealt with for both single-user and multi-user systems. Thus, it is divided into two individual sub-problems. Then, a maximizing array gain (MAG) based algorithm is proposed to seek the IRS reflection matrix. Furthermore, in order to reduce the computational complexity, a deep neural network (DNN) based algorithm is also proposed to acquire better IRS design. In addition, to deal with the IRS aided multi-user system, an equivalent channel gain maximization method and another DNN-based algorithm are also designed to obtain the IRS reflection matrix. Simulation results verify that, the proposed joint hybrid precoder-IRS design scheme outperforms other existing schemes both in spectral efficiency and energy efficiency.},

This article, by taking relay-assisted cooperate D2D communications into account, studied the mode switching and power allocation problems to maximize the joint channel capacity while meeting the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio requirements of D2D UEs (DUEs) and cellular UEs (CUEs). In particular, the proposed mode switching scheme included two phases. In the first phase, the optimal power allocation problems of two relay-assisted modes (i.e., relay and cooperative modes) were formulated and solved, respectively. In the second phase, we presented an optimal relay selection algorithm to find the relay UE that maximizes the joint channel capacity together with a mode selection algorithm among direct D2D, relay D2D, and cooperative D2D modes. The simulation results demonstrated the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of joint channel capacity, energy efficiency, and success probability compared with other benchmark approaches in three typical D2D deployment scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) are attracting increasing attention for extending wireless communication coverage. Furthermore, high-altitude platform stations (HAPSs) can provide low-latency internet access to areas where terrestrial networks do not operate as unmanned flying base stations. However, as more frequency bands are used by wireless communication systems in terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks, it is necessary to make effective use of the finite frequency bands for multiple systems. Therefore, this study focuses on frequency sharing between the uplink from HAPS to satellite and the downlink from HAPS to ground users for efficient use of finite frequency bands in a SAGIN. In such frequency sharing, the back lobe toward the rear of the HAPS antenna for uplink communication causes interference when receiving the downlink signal from HAPS. Therefore, the zero-forcing (ZF) method is applied to the directivity control of the HAPS-mounted uplink antenna, which helps direct the nulls with significantly low antenna gain toward ground users. However, the coverage of the nulls due to the above control alone is extremely insignificant, which cannot sufficiently guarantee interference suppression for diverse user distributions. Therefore, this study proposes a HAPS-based null broadening approach with directivity control according to the user distribution for interference suppression in a SAGIN. The effectiveness of our proposal is evaluated by comparing it with the existing covariance matrix tapper(CMT)-based null broadening, ZF-based nulling, and no nulling for the HAPS-mounted uplink antenna using numerical analysis.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we introduce dual-mode (DM) time domain multiplexed (TDM) chirp spread spectrum (CSS), which offers improved spectral and energy efficiency for low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs). Previous work on LPWANs has proposed DM-CSS modulation using even and odd frequency shifts (FSs) to enhance performance over classical approaches. However, its spectral efficiency is only half that of the in-phase and quadrature (IQ)-TDM-CSS scheme, which employs IQ components with both up and down chirps, resulting in a four times higher SE of Long Range (LoRa). IQ-TDM-CSS only supports coherent detection and is sensitive to the carrier frequency and phase offsets. It makes it less practical for low-cost battery-powered LPWANs in Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. In contrast, DM-CSS utilizes either an up-chirp or a down-chirp and consists of two chirped symbols that are multiplexed in the time domain. One of these symbols is chirped using an up-chirp and comprises even and odd FSs. The second chirped symbol is also composed of even and odd FSs, which are chirped using a down-chirp. We demonstrate that DM-TDM-CSS achieves a maximum achievable SE close to IQ-TDM-CSS while supporting both coherent and non-coherent detection. Moreover, unlike IQ-TDM-CSS, DM-TDM-CSS is robust against carrier frequency and phase offsets, making it more suitable for low-cost, battery-powered LPWANs in IoT applications.},

Secondly, for high-dimensional MIMO-PDMA with high-order modulation systems, a factor graph-based real-valued expectation-propagation (FGREP) algorithm is proposed as the low-complexity front-end detector. Then, non-binary low-density parity-check (LDPC) instead of its binary counterpart is employed as error correcting code to enhance the receiver performance. As a result, it is combined with the FGREP-detector to develop an iterative detection and decoding receiver, named FGREP-IDD. In addition, in order to further improve the iterative detection performance of this kind of three-stage receiver, a symbol-wise extrinsic information transfer (SEXIT)-based optimization algorithm is employed to search for a near-optimal degree distribution for the concatenated non-binary LDPC. To calculate the SEXIT of the component decoder for optimization, it is critical to calculate the average mutual information of the FGREP-detector which is time consuming by means of the traditional method. In this work, a modified interpolation method that employs vector-valued increment instead of scalar-valued one is proposed to accelerate the calculation. The SEXIT obtained by the proposed method is almost coincide with the one obtained by numerical simulation. At last, SEXIT chart based analysis and simulation results verified the above idea.},

One digital scheme and one hybrid digital/analog (HDA) scheme are proposed. Both schemes combine layered coding and dirty paper coding (DPC) at the transmitter. The digital scheme uses layered coding where the common layer information is intended for both receivers while the refinement layer is destined only for the receiver with better quality. Instead of just superimposing the two layers, we propose a bit-filling procedure based DPC to transmit these two layers. A modified log-likelihood ratio based belief propagation algorithm improves the successive canceling procedure with the help of side information. If the refinement-layer decoding decision fails, a typical set-based decoding algorithm is introduced. The proposed HDA scheme superimposes not only the digital information, but also the analog information, quantization error, at the encoder with DPC. Accordingly, we present a scoring-typical set-based decoding algorithm that includes the minimum mean square error estimator for the analog component. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes exhibit performance improvements, and the distortion is shown to be reasonably low for very short block length. Finally we extend the proposed schemes to the three-users case to validate their superiority in the general case.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid beamforming (HBF) has been considered as a key technology in millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, since it can significantly reduce the number of radio frequency chains, and in turn the hardware cost and power consumption, while providing performance comparable to that of a fully-digital beamforming architecture. Conventional HBF designs mostly focused on the spectral efficiency maximization for a certain HBF connection architecture such as fully-connected or partially-connected one. In this article, we investigate HBF optimization with the objective of sum-utility maximization (SUM) for multi-user broadband mmWave MIMO systems with arbitrarily connected architectures. In particular, we show that the SUM HBF optimization can be equivalently converted to a specific weighted mean square error minimization (WMMSE) problem, which leads to a convenient algorithmic approach to directly tackle the difficulty of the SUM problem. Furthermore, by utilizing the alternating minimization and manifold optimization methods, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm to solve the non-convex WMMSE problem and prove its convergence. Simulation results demonstrate the fast convergence as well as the significant performance improvement of the proposed algorithm over the conventional ones.},

However, previous studies only focus on additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, which is not sufficient for actual communication environments. In this article, we propose a novel autoencoder aided error correction coding scheme for low-resolution reception under time-varying channels. Based on the symbol extension of the proposed autoencoder and the faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) technology, pilot-free transmission can be realized without adding additional bandwidth. The transformer block is introduced to lighten and improve the decoder. Additionally, two kinds of preamplification techniques are applied for further performance boosting. Simulations show that the proposed method can achieve better performance compared with the traditional methods at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under different time-varying channels without quantization. Moreover, it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art ECCNet and can achieve remarkable transmission performance even under time-varying low-resolution reception scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Most existing near-field (NF) source localization algorithms are developed based on the Fresnel approximation model, and assume that the spatial amplitudes of the target at the sensors are equal. Unlike these algorithms, an NF source parameter estimation algorithm is proposed, based on the exact spatial propagation geometry model, for bistatic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar deployed with a linear concentered orthogonal loop and dipole (COLD) array at both the transmitter and receiver. The proposed method first compresses the output signal of the matched filter at the receiver into a third-order parallel factor (PARAFAC) data model, on which a trilinear decomposition is performed, and subsequently three factor matrices can be obtained. Then, multiple parameters of interest, including direction-of-departure (DOD), direction-of-arrival (DOA), range from transmitter to target (RFTT), range from target to receiver (RFTR), two-dimensional (2-D) transmit polarization angle (TPA) and 2-D receive polarization angle (RPA), are estimated from the spatial amplitude ratio exploiting the rotation invariant property and the Khatri-Rao product. Finally, the phase uncertainties of transmit and receive arrays can be extracted from additional phase items. The proposed algorithm avoids spectrum peak search, and the estimated parameters in closed forms can be automatically matched unambiguously. In addition, it is suitable for non-uniform linear arrays (NLA) with arbitrary array element spacing and phase uncertainty. Advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated by simulation results.},

There are also spurious results during the angle estimation. This article extends the one-dimensional sensor position errors to the case of two-dimensional errors generated by the array motion and considers the gain-phase perturbation of the sparse moving array, which is inevitable on the moving platform. We first use a dedicated calibration source to estimate the gain-phase errors and compensate for the received data to obtain accurate angle estimates. We get the angle estimates by two approaches: one relies on the calibration source, and the other resorts to self-calibration processing. We also introduce an unfolded coprime linear array at the receiver part, which avoids spurious results and increases the array aperture. The ambiguous solutions of the proposed methods are theoretically analyzed, and the Cramér-Rao bound of angle estimate errors in the presence of sensor position errors is derived.

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) technology has attracted increasing attention to enable various emerging applications in the future wireless networks. However, uncontrollable electromagnetic environments still restrict the performance of both radar sensing and wireless communication in ISAC networks. For the above issue, this paper leverages a novel simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) to provide extensive and reliable coverage for ISAC networks. Thereinto, the STAR-RIS can not only elevate the flexibility of the network deployment relying on its full-space coverage, but also reconfigure signal propagation toward both sensing targets and communication users with more degrees-of-freedom over conventional RISs. More specifically, we consider an energy splitting-STAR-RIS-empowered ISAC network in which a multi-antenna base station (BS) broadcasts the combined information-bearing and dedicated sensing waveforms to simultaneously perform single-target detection and multi-user communication. Our objective is to maximize the sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming at the BS and the transmission&amp;reflection beamforming at the STAR-RIS, subject to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio constraint per user. To solve the formulated non-convex problem, an efficient overall iterative algorithm is developed by invoking the semidefinite relaxation, majorization-minimization, and sequential rank-one constraint relaxation methods. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that whether the STAR-RIS is deployed or not, the dedicated sensing waveforms are always not required from the sensing SNR perspective, which can greatly reduce the implementation complexity of the studied network. Simulations verify our finds, and manifest that the studied STAR-RIS-empowered ISAC scheme significantly outperforms other benchmark schemes in terms of the sensing SNR.},

  abstract     = {In a denoise-and-forward (DNNF) two-way relay system, since the relay is at different distances with the end users, the signals are combined with asynchronous phases and delays, leading to severe performance loss. For most denoising and decoding methods, precise estimation of the delay is required by the relay and end users, which is usually unavailable when strong noise is present. Using the ergodic property of chaotic signals and the fact that the sum of two signals over a given period is invariant with respect to their temporal alignment, we propose to address the asynchronous problem using chaos modulation. In particular, we use ergodic chaotic parameter modulation (ECPM) and guarding intervals (GIs) to remove the requirement for precise time synchronization and complex iterative decoding. The theoretical bit-error-rate (BER) performance is analyzed and verified by simulations. A relay selection method is also proposed for two-way relay systems with multiple relays to use part of the relays to achieve improved performance compared to using all relays. It is shown that the relay selection method can increase the normalized throughput in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios.},

Specifically, the energy efficient hybrid precoding is firstly formulated as an energy efficiency (EE) maximizing problem, where the number of active phase shifters, the connection relationship between radio frequency chains and antennas, and precoding matrix are jointly optimized. Then, utilizing the diagonal characteristic of digital precoding in a partially-connected structure, we propose a decomposition-based low-complexity approach to tackle the large-scale mix-integer non-convex EE optimization problem in the fully adaptive hybrid precoding scheme. Besides, to provide further insights on how the EE-oriented design affects the system performance, a partially adaptive scheme is also introduced.

The frequency-flat constraint on the analog part of the hybrid precoder and the non-convex nature of the rank constraint are circumvented by transforming the original problem into a more suitable one, where a convenient structure for the transmit covariance matrix is imposed. Such structure makes the resulting full-digital precoder particularly adequate for its posterior analog-digital factorization.

To derive our algorithm, we first employ some approximation techniques to obtain a lower bound of the expected sum-rate, then transform it into the problem of minimizing the expected mean square error (MSE). The RFSP is obtained by applying the block coordinate descent (BCD) method over the precoding matrix, weighted matrix, and the hypothetical decoder matrix alternately. Furthermore, we propose unfolding the RFSP into a deep neural network (dubbed U-RFSP) to reduce its computational complexity. Experimental results show that the sum-rate achieved by the proposed RFSP is higher than other non-robust precoders and the computational complexity of the U-RFSP is substantially reduced compared with the RFSP while maintaining nearly the same performance.},

In addition, the algorithm will update the number of access transmission slots allocated to users and the access scheduling results after the backhaul scheduling phase.

  abstract     = {Multipath fading is a major hindrance to the performance of wireless communication systems. For various blends of common propagation aspects—wave clustering, medium nonlinearity, correlation, scattering, and specular components—, the resulting fading model or the corresponding performance analysis is unavailable in a closed form, a drawback that becomes more prominent when source and destination are connected via multiple links. In those cases, little, if any, insight is gained into the overall system behavior. Herein, we shed light on this subject by providing a novel asymptotic framework at high signal-to-noise ratio that yields simple, general, and unified closed-form expressions for the diversity and coding gains in the symbol error rate and outage probability over a broad Gaussian class of fading channels. The proposed framework reveals how each physical aspect of fading and the number of diversity links primarily affect wireless communications. The analysis also resolves the long-standing problem of how each physical element of generalized Gaussian-class fading channels impacts multibranch diversity receivers. The strength and generality of our approach are illustrated by assessing the performance of emerging millimeter-wave systems. Finally, representative numerical results are presented and discussed to demonstrate that all the addressed fading aspects and system parameters affect the coding gain, whereas only the clustering, nonlinearity, and number of links affect the diversity gain.},

  abstract     = {Next-generation wireless applications are envisaged to cater extended ultra-reliability low-latency communication (URLLC) services involving high data rates and improved user fairness for massive users by synergizing multiple driving technologies. Nevertheless, effective resource management with this heterogeneous quality of services (QoS) requirements under limited spectral resources becomes extremely imminent and challenging which is beyond the capabilities of existing architectures. In this article, we investigate a grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access-based uplink transmission to prompt a new service called massive URLLC (mURLLC) for high rate-reliability fairness for massive users under strict latency constraints. To enable spectral-efficient and reliable resource allocation policy, we formulate distinct resource optimization problems for the considered GF-NOMA scheme which involves worst-case rate and reliability maximization and latency minimization under joint power and channel allocation. To tackle the NP-hardness and mixed integer non-linear programming of formulated problems, we propose a general low-cost differential evolution-based meta-heuristic framework which jointly allocates the available resources among multiple URLLC users. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the considered GF-NOMA-based mURLLC system over state-of-art approaches. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed DE algorithm exhibits efficient channel utilization and a high degree of user fairness when compared to random channel contention.},

  abstract     = {Satellite network is a resource-limited system. How to fully explore the transmission capacity of a satellite network by integrating advanced communication technologies is a hot research topic. This article focuses on network coding based single-source to multi-destination transmission problem in satellite networks and attempts to design a joint link adaption and resource allocation scheme to maximize the entire network&#39;s transmission capacity. We first apply time expanded graph (TEG) to depict the satellite network&#39;s dynamic and formulate the network coding involved joint data flow allocation, inter-satellite link (ISL) establishment, and power allocation issue into a non-convex mixed integer programming problem. To efficiently solve the problem, we then use Lagrange method to decouple it into two sub-problems: network coding based data flow routing problem and joint ISL establishment and power allocation problem. The former is proved to be a convex problem which is solved by solving a minimum-cost routing problem and designing a trisection method, while the latter is solved by Lagrange dual method. Considering the relaxation solution is not necessarily optimal or even feasible, we finally propose an alternating optimization method to further improve the network capacity on the basis of the obtained relaxation solution. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and indicate the significance of designing network coding based transmission schemes for satellite networks.},

For generating candidate signals, the proposed PTS method combines two operations of phase rotations and frequency-domain permutations by implementing circular shifting and factor multiplications in time domain, where the phase rotation factors are determined by the frozen bits of polar codes. Additionally, according to the transmitting and polar-coded structures, an SI-free decoder based on successive cancellation lists (SCL) algorithm is developed at the receiving end. Compared with conventional PTS and existing PAPR reduction schemes, the proposed PTS scheme exhibits significantly higher PAPR reduction performance with less complexity. Based on stimulation results, the proposed SI-free receiver is able to achieve error performance similar to that with the receiver utilizing perfect side information in both Additive White Gaussian noise (AWGN) and frequency selective channels.},

By leveraging both time and frequency selectivity of doubly-dispersive radio channels, it has shown a better performance compared to traditional schemes. OTFS offers different options for accommodating multiple users on a given resource block. This article introduces a novel OTFS based uplink multiple access scheme by means of index modulation (IM) in delay-Doppler domain. IM based OTFS multiple access (OTFS-IMMA) proposes the coexistence of multiple users over the same delay-Doppler resources. Unlike conventional OTFS multiple access schemes, OTFS-IMMA allows users to employ IM to activate a subset of the available delay-Doppler resources without a coordination by the base station. Although data collision may occur between the users, our analysis shows that the achievable performance is still better than other schemes. Moreover, the proposed OTFS-IMMA scheme paves the way for flexible resource utilization in OTFS-MA to satisfy various users&#39; demands in beyond 5G systems. It has been shown via both mathematical analysis and simulations that the proposed OTFS-IMMA scheme offers significant enhancement not only on bit error rate performance but also on the overall system efficiency. In addition, the achieved performance gain through OTFS-IMMA further increases as the number of channel taps and/or the number of delay-Doppler bins increase.},

Further elaboration of the systematic performance metrics is undertaken by developing analytical expressions for area spectral efficiency and sum-rate in the RSMA-enhanced multi-cell dense networks. Based on the tractable expressions, we then offer an optimization framework for energy efficiency in terms of the number of antennas. Additionally, simulation results are shown to verify the accuracy of our analytical results and provide some insightful insights into system design.

  abstract     = {Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) systems are investigated in order to develop approaches to achieve power, multiplexing, and diversity gains. These results can be utilized to motivate the development of MIMO AmBC by providing performance bounds on the MIMO AmBC gains. Our approach to the investigation is to reformulate the MIMO AmBC channel model as an accurate linear MIMO channel model. Using this model, we show that the MIMO AmBC received signal is real-valued, hence the dimension of the received signal is halved. In addition, we show that MIMO AmBC has a per antenna constant modulus transmit signal constraint. Therefore, increases in antennas at the Tag provide a power gain in contrast to conventional MIMO systems. Under these constraints, when channel state information at the Reader (CSIR) is available, we provide estimates of channel capacity. Assuming channel state information at the Tag (CSIT) is also available, we use a fixed-point iteration algorithm to maximize channel capacity. With CSIT, beamforming design and the corresponding majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm are proposed to find the optimal transmit and receive beamformers so that diversity gain can be leveraged. It is also shown that in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) operating region, beamforming design maximizes channel capacity. In addition, we provide numerical results for the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). Utilizing comparisons between AmBC and conventional MIMO, we highlight the unique characteristics of MIMO AmBC. These approaches to maximize power, capacity, and diversity gains demonstrate the potential of MIMO AmBC.},

The performance evaluation of the CSA scheme in wireless multi-access system is of great significance and challenge due to various channel characteristics and physical layer technologies. This work investigates the performance of CSA scheme when the access point (AP) is capable of retrieving multiple packets in collided signals and the transmission experiences packet and slot erasures. Specifically, an implicit expression of the decoding failure probability is derived for the general CSA scheme in packet erasure channel by appropriately parameterizing the multi-packet reception capability and channel erasure probability. The implicit expression analysis on the decoding failure probability of the CSA scheme is further extended to slot erasure channels. Based on the obtained results, the packet loss ratio, the throughput, and the energy efficiency of the repetition coding-based and maximal distance separate (MDS) coding-based CSA systems are derived in detail. The optimal transmit power that achieves the maximal energy efficiency is presented in closed-form. Simulation results validate the correctness of the theoretical analyses. It shows that the MDS coding can achieve a higher throughput than the repetition coding. With optimized transmit power, the energy efficiency of the system can be improved significantly.},

An iterative closed-form solution has been presented while deriving the optimum solution in a closed form for a digital precoder subject to a fixed analog beam, serving as a key implementation block for low-complexity implementation. Furthermore, a mathematical framework is developed for employing the different number of radio frequency chains dynamically for the analog precoder as an efficient means of achieving a tradeoff between the power consumption and the performance in practice. It is shown that the performance of our proposed algorithm is similar to that of the fully-digital precoder within approximately 1 dB, suggesting that its implementation complexity can be overcome, even for numerous antenna elements, in practice.},

In this article, we consider the angle estimation problem for bistatic MIMO radar under element failure. To exploit the multidimensional structure, a covariance tensor of the uniform linear array (ULA)-based MIMO radar is constructed, where some slices are entirely missing due to faults in the array elements. Then, recovering failed-element signals can be formulated as a low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) problem with structurally missing entries. To address this problem, we propose a novel tensor completion approach via CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition with factor priors. The essence of the proposed method is to fully exploit not only the Vandermonde structure of factor matrices but also their correlations. To enforce these factor priors, we formulate an optimization problem that consists of an objective function penalizing the nuclear norm of block Hankel matrices formed by the factor matrices and the constraints to reveal the relationship among the factor matrices. To solve the optimization problem, we develop an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), thereby recovering the signals of failed elements. Finally, conventional algorithms yield robust angle estimation. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for dealing with element failure.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the age of information (AoI) of relay-assisted cooperative communication systems. For time-slotted systems without relaying, prior works have shown that the source should generate and send a new packet to the destination every time slot to minimize the average AoI, regardless of whether the destination has successfully decoded the packet in the previous slot. However, when a dedicated relay is involved, whether the relay can improve the AoI performance requires an in-depth study. Depending on whether the source and the relay are allowed to transmit simultaneously, two relay-assisted schemes are investigated: time division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes. In TDMA, the source generates and sends a new packet every other time slot to avoid possible simultaneous transmission with the relay. In NOMA, the source generates and sends a new packet every time slot , thus possibly forming simultaneous transmission from the relay and the source. A key challenge in deriving their theoretical average AoI is that the destination has different probabilities of successfully receiving an update packet in different time slots. We model each scheme using a Markov chain to derive the corresponding closed-form average AoI. Interestingly, our theoretical analysis indicates that the relay-assisted schemes can only outperform the non-relay scheme in average AoI when the signal-to-noise ratio of the source-destination link is below &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$-2\,\text{dB}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; dB. Furthermore, comparing the merits of relay-assisted schemes, simulation results show that the TDMA scheme has a lower energy consumption, while the NOMA counterpart typically achieves a lower average AoI.},

  abstract     = {Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) dual-func- tional radar communication (DFRC) provides a solution to the severe spectrum scarcity challenge. MIMO systems may be prone to the hardware impairments (HWI). Considering I/Q-imbalance (IQI), the most common type of HWI, we study the optimal transmit beamforming design for MIMO DFRC. Both radar-centric and communication-centric scenarios are investigated. For the radar-centric design, the radar beampattern and communciations user signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) with IQI are derived. Then, the radar beampattern is optimized by using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method. For the communication-centric design, the achievable rate with IQI is derived. Then, the transmit beamforming is optimized with the constraint on the MIMO radar receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Moreover, the computational complexity is analyzed. Numerical results verify that IQI amplitude mismatch, IQI phase mismatch and the IQI mitigation error can significantly degrade the system&#39;s overall performance. Also, for the communication-centric scenario, IQI phase mismatch at the CUs is much more important than that at the BS.},

Specifically, FCB is designed on the basis of the federated computational architecture, to increase the computational parallelism and accelerate the convergence. The algorithm design is realized by integrating accelerated projection-based consensus (APC) with greedy techniques. Then, the conditions of exact support recovery and an upper bound of signal recovery error are derived for FCB in the noisy case. From the explicit expression of the signal recovery error bound, it is confirmed that FCB can stably recover sparse signals under appropriate conditions using the coherence statistic of the measurement matrix and the minimum magnitude of nonzero elements of the signal. Experimental results illustrate the performance of FCB, validating our derived conditions of exact support recovery and upper bound of signal recovery error. In summary, FCB utilizes the federated computational architecture, enabling high parallelism and fast convergence, and uses greedy techniques to guarantee stable recovery performance.},

The proposed algorithm first decomposes the receiving spatial-temporal data into temporal dynamic modes and corresponding spatial spectrum that yields the DOA information. Then the decomposed temporal dynamic modes are analyzed via the augmented DMD to retrieve the frequency information. The estimated DOAs and frequencies are automatically paired without the extra computational cost with such a temporal-spectral correlated decomposition scheme. Also, the obtained spatial spectrum distribution implies the actual number of the sources, which enables the proposed method to be used for the unknown number of sources case in wireless communication. Simulations demonstrate that the TSDMD accurately and effectively retrieves the sources&#39; DOA and frequency information. It is found that the new approach can provide comparable performance but with less execution time compared with previous works.

  abstract     = {High signal directivity and sensitivity to blockages make the mmWave base-station (BS) discovery a challenging problem in emerging networks. Existing solutions that rely on the exhaustive periodic-beam-sweeping have high latency and low mmWave cell discovery rate. Recent AI-based solutions address the above problems but rely on impractical assumption of having complete minimization of drive test (MDT) reports traces. This paper is the first to present an AI-based framework that can utilize very sparse MDT style data to enable NLoSaware low latency mmWave cell discovery, hereafter referred to as AI -enabled S parse Data based M mWave cell disc O very and EN-DC activation framework (AISMO). We first gather MDT traces of mmWave users containing signal-strength and Radio-Link-Failure (RLF) indicators. We then augment this highly sparse MDT data using a variety of interpolation, domain knowledge, and AI-based techniques to create augmented mmWave coverage maps (mW-Amaps) while incorporating the NLoS conditions through the RLF traces that are inherently embedded in the data. The mW-Amaps are then used by the macro-BS to determine the optimal mmWave cell for a given user location. Results show that our proposed Weighted Nearest Neighbor Count (WNNC) approach outperforms other data sparsity alleviation techniques for mW-Amap creation with accuracy of 96%. Second best in terms of accuracy is a deep learning-based solution, that has almost 30 &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$x$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; faster training time than the WNNC.

Specifically, a common signal is generated at the base station (BS) and transmitted with the users&#39; private signals. By utilizing successive interference cancellation (SIC), the common signal is decoded and removed at each user, and then the private signals can be decoded based on NOMA schemes. By jointly design power allocation and user pairing, a weighted sum rate maximization problem is formulated with quality of service (QoS) constraints, where the priority of different signals is presented. By analyzing the monotonicity, the optimal power allocation is expressed in several cases, and then the strategy of each user to achieve the QoS threshold is obtained in all cases. To solve the user pairing problem, a matching based algorithm is developed, where the property is analyzed. Simulation results indicate that: i) the proposed RS-NOMA system outperforms the conventional RS and NOMA systems in general; ii) the developed power allocation strategy and user pairing algorithm can improve the RS-NOMA system in terms of the weighted sum rate and outage probability.},

In this paper, we present an adaptive beamformer (called polarimetric Sparse-Reconstruction beamformer) based on cascaded sparse diversely polarized planar array. The cascaded sparse array consists of multiple parallel sparse linear subarrays, whose difference co-array has no holes. The beamformer is operated in the joint spatial and polarization domain; thus, can potentially suppress the interferences that are close to the desired signal with different polarization states. Two key building blocks of our proposed beamformer are polynomial rooting-based closed-form two-dimensional direction-of-arrival and polarization joint estimation procedures, where the involved polynomial coefficients are also derived. Then, the closed-form power distribution estimation is presented to reconstruct the interference-plus-noise covariance matrix by leveraging the sparsity of the desired signal and interferences in the joint spatial and polarization domain. Thus, the proposed adaptive beamformer is computationally efficient, since all the procedures involved are formatted by closed-form expressions. Finally, a set of simulation examples are given to evaluate the characteristics of the proposed cascaded sparse array as well as the performance and robustness of the proposed beamformer in different scenarios, and compared against several existing approaches.},

In this study, methods for optimizing and distributing active steering control quantities under constrained conditions are investigated. First, the wear number of the wheelset is set as the objective function. A controller is developed in the control layer based on a linearized bogie model with the wear number as the cost function using the model predictive control method. Then, the system state is observed using a Kalman filter with actuator feedback; the wheelset force state is also estimated using the actuator feedback. Subsequently, the optimum wheelset yaw angle under the constraints is solved. In the distribution layer, the spread of actuator displacements under traction and braking conditions is achieved by combining the longitudinal force coordination equations for the wheelset. The simulation results showed that the full utilization of the overdrive characteristics of the two coaxial actuators enabled the redistribution of actuator displacement commands under traction and braking conditions without reducing steering efficiency. Moreover, the maximum load on the actuators was effectively reduced. Finally, the parametric robustness of the controller was examined. The results showed that the controller and observer had good parametric robustness owing to the attitude stability of the bogie after active steering control was implemented.},

  abstract     = {Due to the ignorance of dynamic characteristics of powertrains, existing frameworks for co-optimizing component sizing and energy management of hybrid powertrains may lead to unsatisfactory performance. To design an alternative framework and provide a promising solution, this article proposes a novel co-optimization methodology that incorporates the high-fidelity model (HFM) of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The present methodology employs the maps of engines and electric motors during the optimization process. In addition, based on the Pareto optimization method, an adaptive non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) with chaos sequence (NSGA-CS) is proposed. By setting an objective function that concerns the fuel consumption, battery state of health (SOH), and manufacturing cost, the co-optimization effect of NSGA-CS with HFM (NSGA-CS &amp; HFM) is compared with that of NSGA-III with Willans model (NSGA-CS &amp; WM) using the real-time control strategy. Under the NEDC-WLTC driving cycle, compared with the original vehicle, the NSGA-CS &amp; HFM approach can reduce fuel consumption, battery SOH loss, and system costs by 7.4%, 8.0%, and 6.3%, respectively. The effectiveness of the optimized parameters is verified in the hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiment. These results suggest that the novel co-optimization methodology proposed in this article is effective in optimizing the powertrain parameters and control strategies and can further promote the energy-saving potential of HEV/PHEVs.},

  abstract     = {Decision-making and motion planning are two core functionalities of intelligent vehicles. A novel integrated decision-making and planning framework is presented for real-time and safe driving on highway under complex scenarios. This integrated framework decomposes the complicated coupling between the environment and controlled vehicle by a dynamic safety domain composed of two layers. The outer layer is designed to integrate multiple driving objectives and subtasks as a safety boundary. It describes the interactions between the ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles, lane lines, and speed limit as potential fields, to ensure good real-time and safety performances simultaneously. The inner layer is designed by using the dynamics of the safety boundary to obtain the planning solution analytically for better computation efficiency. With this framework, a two-dimensional risk model is set up to solve the safe driving trajectory directly without the time-consuming interactive process. The proposed approach was tested and compared with other methods to validate its feasibility and effectiveness. The results show that it can make decision and planning safely, efficiently and comfortably under the dynamic traffic scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is an important research in the area of array signal processing, and has been studied for decades. High resolution DOA estimation requires large array aperture, which leads to the increase of hardware cost. Besides, high accuracy DOA estimation methods usually have high computational complexity. In this article, the problem of decreasing the hardware cost and algorithm complexity is addressed. First, considering the ability of flexible controlling the electromagnetic waves and low-cost, an intelligent reconfigurable surface (IRS)-aided low-cost passive direction finding (LPDF) system is developed, where only one fully functional receiving channel is adopted. Then, the sparsity of targets direction in the spatial domain is exploited by formulating an atomic norm minimization (ANM) problem to estimate the DOA. Traditionally, solving ANM problem is complex and cannot be realized efficiently. Hence, a novel nonconvex-based ANM (NC-ANM) method is proposed by gradient threshold iteration, where a perturbation is introduced to avoid falling into saddle points. The theoretical analysis for the convergence of the NC-ANM method is also given. Moreover, the corresponding Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) in the LPDF system is derived, and taken as the referred bound of the DOA estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the compared methods in the DOA estimation with lower computational complexity in the LPDF system.},

A lumped thermal model is developed to predict the transient temperature variation of the IMs. The thermal model is validated using the Motor-CAD transient thermal analysis. The fast speed and accuracy of the applied SDM allows to select twelve variables in a large search space for the optimization purpose. Initially, an optimization procedure is proposed to design three IMs over three different driving cycles. The optimal designs are validated from the electromagnetic and thermal aspects by the finite element analysis. IMs are then designed optimally with consideration of the OL capability. A transient thermal analysis is carried out to validate the designs. The optimal designs with and without consideration of OL are compared in terms of the machine parameters and geometry to understand how dimensions and equivalent circuit parameters of the IMs vary according to the driving cycles.

Nevertheless, few previous studies on sideslip angle estimation have dealt with the impact of road inclinations and parameter uncertainty, such as the sprung mass of commercial vehicles. Therefore, this article proposes a novel sideslip angle estimation scheme based on the strong tracking square-root cubature Kalman filter (ST-SCKF) considering mass uncertainty and road inclinations including road slope and bank. The influences of road inclinations on the estimation algorithm and real sideslip angle are first analyzed. The vehicle dynamic and kinematic models are then integrated to consider road inclinations and mitigate the effects of the sprung mass, where the magic formula (MF) tire model is integrated with the vertical force estimation based on suspension dynamics to provide the necessary tire forces. Subsequently, the comprehensive sideslip angle estimation scheme based on ST-SCKF is introduced, whose observability under normal driving conditions is also proved. The simulation and hardware-in-loop (HiL) test results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has satisfying performances. Compared with the existing kinematic methods, the proposed method can deal with road inclinations and ensure observability. Compared with the existing dynamic methods, the proposed method is robust to mass uncertainty and road conditions.},

A group of more complex relative measurement models involving uncertainties, that is, the means and variances of the multiplicative noises being unknown, are considered. By introducing the Normal-inverse-Gamma distribution to model the unknown means and variances, a distributed algorithm is designed based on the variational Bayesian technique. Within the distributed framework, the proposed algorithm ensures that each robot can jointly infer its state and all targets&#39; states, as well as the unknown noise statistics, by using only the local relative measurements and intermittent absolute measurements. Moreover, the covariance intersection fusion strategy is employed, which guarantees consensus among all robots on their inferred posterior distributions of each target&#39;s state. As a result, the proposed algorithm is independent on the true statistical characteristics of the multiplicative noises, which thereby gets rid of the limitation of the existing results requiring the means and variances to be precisely known. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated by simulation results.},

However, the current driving condition recognition methods suffer from severe time delay, which is not conducive to real-time control. In this study, a fusion algorithm-based driving condition recognition method is proposed to solve this problem, and efforts are made in two aspects. Firstly, a driving condition recognition model combining Markov chain prediction model and learning vector quantization neural network recognition model is established. Secondly, the key parameters affecting recognition accuracy and real-time performance are analyzed and optimized to further improve the recognition performance. Simulation and experimental results show that the real-time performance of the proposed method is significantly improved compared with the method based on historical condition data under the premise of ensuring recognition accuracy and stability. Moreover, the proposed method is applied to the energy management of a medium fuel cell truck, and simulation results highlight that the proposed method can effectively improve the adaptability of the energy management strategy. Compared with the energy management strategy without condition recognition, the fluctuation of fuel cell output power is reduced by 30.4%, and the equivalent hydrogen consumption is reduced by 1.2%, which contributes to the improvement of fuel cell lifetime and economy.},

This article proposes a gain adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC) with a modified phase-shift algorithm to facilitate EV fast charging at various levels of non-linear battery dynamics. The ASMC improves the front-end AC-DC charging performance with additional robustness by eliminating the conventional fixed gain control architecture and incorporating dynamic parameter updation at various levels of active or reactive power transmission. In order to support EV fast charging, a modified phase estimation technique is also proposed with an objective to minimize power-mismatch and phase-shift error during bi-directional charging phenomenon. In most of the existing phase-estimation techniques, voltage based PI-controller is used to determine the power transfer limit in bi-directional EV chargers without considering different charging modes and battery SOC. However, the presented control technique is entirely gain adaptive and includes the battery dynamics based upon constant current (CC) or constant voltage (CV) charging phenomenon. The control algorithm is simulated in both grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) modes of operation to comprehensively analyze the active power exchange without affecting the utility power quality. A laboratory prototype is also developed with a 3.3 kW bi-directional charging topology to validate the controller performances.},

An eight-element array with 0.5λ spacing is constructed based on the proposed dual-port phased antenna which can scan in two modes too. It can achieve a wide-angle scanning up to ±82° with a measured gain range of 12.6-9.6 dBi in the single-port excitation mode. Moreover, in the dual-port excitation mode, the internal phase difference between the two ports in one element and the phase shift between adjacent elements both can influence the array scanning performance. By adjusting the internal phase difference, the array gain is improved in the whole scanning angle range especially at the large scanning angle. The array can scan to ±81° with a measured gain range of 13.9-10.7 dBi in the dual-port excitation mode.

  abstract     = {Intelligent vehicles, including autonomous vehicles and vehicles equipped with ADAS systems, are single-agent systems that navigate solely on the information collected by themselves. However, despite rapid advancements in hardware and algorithms, many accidents still occur due to the limited sensing coverage from a single-agent perception angle. These tragedies raise a critical question of whether single-agent autonomous driving is safe. Preliminary investigations on this safety issue led us to create a C-V2X-enabled collaborative autonomous driving framework (CCAD) to observe the driving circumstance from multiple perception angles. Our framework uses C-V2X technology to connect infrastructure with vehicles and vehicles with vehicles to transmit safety-critical information and to add safety redundancies. By enabling these communication channels, we connect previously independent single-agent vehicles and existing infrastructure. This paper presents a prototype of our CCAD framework with RSU and OBU as communication devices and an edge-computing device for data processing. We also present a case study of successfully implementing an infrastructure-based collaborative lane-keeping with the CCAD framework. Our case study evaluations demonstrate that the CCAD framework can transmit, in real-time, personalized lane-keeping guidance information when the vehicle cannot find the lanes. The evaluations also indicate that the CCAD framework can drastically improve the safety of single-agent intelligent vehicles and open the doors to many more collaborative autonomous driving applications.},

  abstract     = {This article develops an autonomous cooperative interception method with angle constraints, allowing a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to simultaneously intercept an incoming maneuvering target from predesigned encirclement angles. To this end, a decision-making framework based on the State-Event-Condition-Action (SECA) model is proposed to drive the UAV&#39;s autonomous behavior, and a series of SECA rules are defined to support the state transition. Additionally, a waypoint-following control method is derived for the UAV swarm to satisfy the encirclement angle constraints. The encirclement angles and desired waypoints are well-designed to implement interception tactics in different states. The coordinated interception time does not need to be predetermined and is replaced by defined distance variables under the virtual leader-based scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the UAV swarm tracking the desired waypoint can satisfy the angle constraints for intercepting the incoming maneuvering target.},

To lessen the impacts of poor weather conditions, we propose a dual attention and dual frequency-guided dehazing network for enhancing visibility in real-time. In particular, the proposed model adopts an attention mechanism and a novel frequency information fusion strategy to extract global and local features and adequately recover sharp high-frequency structures and low-frequency details.

  abstract     = {With the wide application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), performing search and rescue missions autonomously in unknown environment has become an increasingly concerning issue. In this article, we propose an adaptive conversion speed Q-Learning algorithm (ACSQL). Performing UAV missions autonomously is divided into two stages: rescue mission search stage and optimal path search stage. In the first stage, a UAV can find task points as soon as possible, and the efficiency of exploration is increased by adaptively adjusting the speed of the UAV. In the second stage, to get a secure and short path, we propose a subdomain search algorithm. Based on the above two stages, we improve state space and action space in reinforcement learning, and design a composite reward function, finally obtain the path of UAV to perform multiple search and rescue missions through this algorithm. In order to solve the problems of slow training convergence and high uncertainty, we initialize the Q-table by combining detection information of UAV sensors in first stage. Simulation results show that ACSQL algorithm can realize autonomous navigation and path planning of UAV in an unknown environment. Compared with traditional action space, the learning process of UAV converges faster and more stable, and it can converge in about 30 episodes. Compared with DDPG algorithm and IDWA algorithm in different scenarios, ACSQL algorithm has the shortest path length. Finally, ACSQL algorithm is verified by UAV simulator Airsim.},

However, the scalability issue of such communication technologies, especially in congested urban areas, requires the employment of information dissemination strategies that avoid wasting network resources. Piggybacking compressed information over periodic Basic Safety Messages (BSM) and Model-Based Communication (MBC) are amongst such strategies to enhance situational awareness while addressing the scalability issue. Leveraging these notions, we propose a network-aware error-driven content selection technique to piggyback the information that is of more importance to the receiving vehicles. In addition, two different modeling schemes, i.e. a deterministic constant acceleration and yaw rate, and a probabilistic Bayesian inference modeling scheme have been introduced and their prediction performances under such content selection technique are compared to an existing distance-dependent piggybacking algorithm. Through simulations based on realistic traffic data, we show that our proposed Bayesian modeling scheme combined with the proposed content selection algorithm can improve the overall tracking accuracy by 53% compared to existing distance-dependent content selection approaches.},

In this paper, a novel workflow-based MPC approach is proposed to accelerate the traditional MPC algorithm. First, a trajectory tracking method using MPC based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is developed for online optimization. Then, we seperate the algorithm into multiple smaller computational tasks and provide an approach on establishing the workflow of MPC.

  abstract     = {Recently, the scenario-based test method has become essential for the safety verification of automated vehicles (AVs). However, with the increased functionality of automated driving systems (ADSs) and the expansion of the operational designed domain (ODD), the number of scenario elements that need to be tested has rapidly increased, leading to an explosion of concrete scenarios to be tested. Accordingly, the accelerated test methods targeting the enhanced generation of hazardous concrete scenarios have become the main trend of AV tests. However, existing methods mainly adopt serial processing, which cannot provide multi-threaded parallelism. This paper proposes a distributed accelerated concurrency testing (ACT) method for ADS, which combines an accelerated test method with traditional concurrent testing. The test frame is divided into three layers: a top-layer manager, middle-layer scheduler, and bottom-layer executor. Then, the specific tasks of roles at different layers are determined; for instance, the coverage of a middle-layer scheduler and the test parameters of a bottom-layer executor. In addition, the modified Ackley function is used for preliminary verification of the effectiveness of the proposed test method. Finally, a black-box AV algorithm is tested in the front vehicle cut-in scenario in a virtual environment using the proposed ACT method, traversal concurrency testing method, accelerated serial testing method, and traversal serial testing method. The test results show that the proposed ACT method can effectively find dangerous concrete scenarios in the logical scenario parameter space and reduce the testing time significantly compared to the other three methods.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle lateral stability is of great importance for maintaining vehicle safety. Active front-wheel steering (AFS) is the typical actuator to realize lateral control. However, if a fault occurs on AFS, direct yaw rate control (DYC) can also be used to control lateral stability through differential braking, guaranteeing actuation redundancy. The paper proposes a practical active fault tolerant method for controlling the AFS to DYC process in case of a complete failure of AFS, whereby DYC is expected to take over the control after a certain duration. The proposed method has a distinctive feature in that it can keep the yaw rate tracking error within a predetermined boundary before the failure occurrence and recover the error back to the preset boundary within a desired time period after the DYC takes over. Specifically, the proposed method can guarantee a strict constraint of yaw rate tracking error before the fault occurs on AFS. Furthermore, the method can recover the error back to the desired error boundary in a finite time once the DYC starts to operate. The key points of the method are as follows: First, a tangent barrier Lyapunov function (TBLF) is used with a backstepping mechanism to strictly constrain the yaw rate tracking error in a desired error boundary. Second, the delayed switch from AFS to DYC, which may cause a violation of the preset error boundary, is considered. And a set of functions named reconfigurable transform functions (RTF) are carefully designed, using which the tracking error can recover to the preset boundary within the desired time. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated and compared with two comparative methods through co-simulation between the High-fidelity vehicle simulation software CarSim &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\circledR$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; and Matlab/Simulink.},

We formulate the lane lines into a series of endpoints of differential line segments. A convolutional neural network is then presented to simultaneously predict the heatmap and the embedding vectors, whose loss function is designed to detect the semantic lane lines instead of focusing only on the visible lane lines. The heatmap is used to represent the endpoints in lane differentiation while the embedding vectors are used to group the endpoints into different lane lines. Finally we utilize a non-maximum suppression algorithm to combine the heatmap with the embedding vectors to obtain the final results of multiple lane lines. We conduct extensive experiments on TuSimple and CULane datasets to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, which can achieve the highest accuracy with 46.0 times speedup compared with eight state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a real-time decision generation mechanism, termed as Dec-Safe, is proposed for delivering adaptive safety-linked decisions dynamically to the customers/users. None of the existing models on road transportation addressed the problems associated with the dispatch of customized and safety-based information to the users. We introduce an adaptive decision-generation mechanism for the Safety-as-a-Service (Safe-aaS) platform. The safety services are provided to the users in the form of safety decisions, depending upon their requirement. The users may select either a static or a dynamic approach to avail these services. We consider that the values of these static parameters do not change regularly with time. However, based on their necessity, the users may request additional decision variables and pay extra charges. We introduce relationship mapping of the generated decisions with the decision/safety-related parameters demanded by the users, to minimize the complexity in computation and reduce the memory space required at server end. On the other hand, in case of dynamic approach, the value of decision variables dynamically vary from their origin to destination. We introduce the concept of decision clustering for the decision variables chosen by the users, and apply maximum likelihood estimation to group the similar decision variables. We analyze the cost incurred by the users for choosing the static and the dynamic approaches. Further, we perform a detailed analysis of the proposed scheme, Dec-Safe, which demonstrates that as the number of iterations is incremented, the average memory space decreases by 20–30%, in case of static approach. On the other hand, in dynamic approach, the effective residual energy decreases by 2–3%, response time delay per user is mostly constant with increasing number of iteration for different user range &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$50\!-\!250$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; .},

  abstract     = {The use of edge computing for 3D perception has garnered interest in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) due to its potential to enhance Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) orchestration through real-time traffic monitoring. The ability to accurately measure depth information in the environment using LiDAR has led to a growing emphasis on 3D detection based on this technology, which has significantly advanced the field of 3D perception. However, the computationally-intensive nature of these operations has made it challenging to meet the real-time deployment requirements using existing methods. The object detection task in the pointcloud domain is hindered by a substantial inconsistency problem caused by its high sparsity, which remains unaddressed. This article conducts an in-depth analysis of the issue, which has been brought to light by recent research on detecting inconsistency problems in image specialization. To address this problem, we propose a solution in the form of a 3D harmonic loss function, which aims to alleviate the inconsistent predictions based on pointcloud data. In addition, we showcase the viability of optimizing 3D harmonic loss mathematically. Our simulations employ the KITTI dataset and DAIR-V2X-I dataset, and our proposed approach significantly surpasses the performance of benchmark models. Additionally, we validate the efficiency of our proposed model through its deployment on an edge device (Jetson Xavier TX) in a simulated environment.},

Uncertainty about the surrounding target vehicles is an important consideration for decision-making and motion planning for autonomous driving. An interactive Multiple Model (IMM) filter is used to estimate the maneuver probability of target vehicles by using the measurement of environment sensors. An intelligent driver model is utilized to reflect the asymmetry of the longitudinal acceleration to a local model of the IMM filter. Estimates of the drivers&#39; intentions are used to estimate the probability of the possible driving scenes. A game theory-based supervisor is configured based on the probability of the driving scene and uncontrolled intersection theory to determine the driving mode. A payoff for each driving scene is designed to consider the risk and traffic efficiency based on the prediction of the targets. Local filters of IMM are used to predict the future motion of the targets for evaluation of the payoff function. A stochastic model predictive controller is utilized to determine the desired longitudinal acceleration. Chance constraints are defined to reflect the uncertainty of the target prediction in motion planning. The proposed algorithm is evaluated via case studies and Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation results show the probabilistic game theory-based motion planner achieves the safety and efficiency of autonomous intersection passing.},

  abstract     = {Emerging compute-intensive and latency-sensitive vehicular applications are expected to be deployed at the edge instead of the cloud to shorten the network latency. Mobile fog nodes carried by moving vehicles, namely vehicular fog nodes (VFNs), have been proposed to complement the stationary fog nodes co-located with base stations to handle the spatio-temporal variations of demand in a cost-efficient way. Existing works on capacity planning for such vehicular fog computing (VFC) scenarios are built on the assumption of certain spatio-temporal patterns of vehicular traffic. They consider long-term capacity planning (e.g., updated every season) but leave the adaptation to temporary changes or unexpected variations out of scope. These solutions typically result in high computational costs and thus are not suitable for short-term capacity planning, which requires low-latency responses. To reduce time complexity, we propose an integer linear programming (ILP)-based framework called on-demand capacity planning (ODCP) to implement two-phase planning through optimizing the routing strategies of VFNs, with the aim of maximizing the profit and quality of service (QoS). More specifically, ODCP first predicts the traffic flow and resource demand using seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and estimates the revenue using an economic model defined by service level agreement (SLA). With the estimated workload and revenue, the first phase (i.e., global planning) decides the ratio of tasks that can be served at the city scale and assigns VFNs to each region. The second phase (i.e., regional planning) assigns the VFNs to users within the same region and schedules the routes of VFNs based on the mobility of users. Experimental results show that the proposed solution achieves a higher performance in terms of profit and QoS than the existing single-phase capacity planning solutions. We also find that a large number of VFNs, a small region size, high penalty costs, and low travel and rental costs lead to high service rates, whereas a large region size and low travel, rental, and penalty costs lead to high profits.},

Inspired by the fact that the signal subspace spanned by the received signals is dominated by the target echoes, a two-dimensional (2D) low-rank filter is already able to reduce the noise significantly, at the cost of a huge computational burden caused by the 2D eigen-value decomposition (EVD). To reduce the computational burden, a low-complexity approach is proposed in this article. In the low-complexity approach, the 2D low-rank filter is replaced by two separated one-dimensional (1D) low-rank filters so that the high-complexity EVD can be avoided. Although that replacement may cause performance degradation, theoretical analysis show that the performance degradation is small and thus can be ignored. In addition, both simulation results and field measurements are also introduced in this article to show that the proposed approach can be well suited for noise reduction in practical FMCW radar applications.},

  abstract     = {Safety is the foremost concern for autonomous platooning. The vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication delays and the sudden appearance of obstacles will trigger the safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF) issues for autonomous platooning. This research proposes a holistic robust motion controller framework (MCF) for an intelligent and connected vehicle platoon system. The MCF utilizes a hierarchical structure to resolve the longitudinal string stability and the lateral control problem under the complex driving environment and time-varying communication delays. Firstly, the H-infinity feedback controller is developed to ensure the robustness of the platoon under time-varying communication delay in the upper-level coordination layer (UCL). The output from UCL will be delivered to the lower-level motion-planning layer (LML) as reference signals. Secondly, the model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is implemented in the LML to achieve multi-objective control, which comprehensively considers the reference signals, the artificial potential field, and multiple vehicle dynamics constraints. Furthermore, three critical scenarios are co-simulated for case studies, including platooning under time-varying communication delay, merging, and obstacle avoidance scenarios. The simulation results indicate that, compared with single-structure MPC, the proposed MCF can offer a better suppression on position error propagation, and get improvements on maximum position error in the three scenarios by 19.2%, 59.8%, and 15.3%, respectively. Lastly, the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed MCF are verified via the hardware-in-the-loop experiment. The average conducting time of the proposed method on the Speedgoat real-time target machine is 1.1 milliseconds, which meets the real-time requirements.},

In order to ensure the safety of VANETs and improve the communication efficiency between moving vehicles and different Roadside Units (RSUs), some handover authentication protocols for VANETs have been proposed. However, the existing protocols have some problems such as excessive computation overhead, untraceable malicious messages, and the inability to resist RSU captured attacks. To solve the above problems, we propose a blockchain-based protocol to achieve Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) authentication, V2I handover authentication, and Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) broadcasting authentication. The advantages of our protocol are: (1) It achieves lightweight V2I handover authentication and V2V broadcast authentication, dynamic anonymity strategy and embedding strategy of pseudo-identity and vehicle feature are used to guarantee anonymity and traceability simultaneously; (2) The announcement can be broadcasted verifiably without the help of transportation infrastructure (e.g., RSU) or the Trusted Authority (TA); and (3) The Physically Unclonable Functions (PUF) technology is used to resist RSU captured attacks. We use formal security proof under random oracle model to prove the security of the proposed protocol. Compared with related V2I handover authentication protocols, our protocol can resist RSU captured attacks and other various known attacks. The sum of first and handover authentication efficiency of our protocol is 37.93% higher than the previous most effective protocol, while maintaining the same level of communication and storage costs.},

The error-correction performance of PAC codes under sequential decoding can reach the dispersion approximation bound in certain rate cases. However, due to the serial exploration of the codeword, the time and computational complexity caused by sequential decoding, e.g., Fano decoding, are required to be further reduced. In this article, we propose a low-complexity Fano decoding algorithm for PAC codes, called fast Fano decoding, to reduce the decoding complexity. The decoding algorithm considers four types of special nodes, i.e., constitute codes with special bit distribution patterns, to improve the parallelism degree of inner code decoding by immediately returning the messages from these nodes. Moreover, a node-level rewinding scheme including stage-located and partial memory recovery (SL-PM) is proposed to backtrack the intermediate messages efficiently. The results show that for a PAC code with length 128 and half rate, the proposed fast Fano decoding with the SL-PM rewinding scheme achieves more than 90% time and computational complexity reduction without performance degradation compared to the original Fano decoding.},

  abstract     = {The vulnerabilities of controller area network (CAN) are often targeted by various types of vehicle hacking. To this end, conventional cyber attacks have used a frame injection and a dominant bit injection. However, these two techniques cannot modify data frames sent from an electronic control unit (ECU) in real time. Thus, the frame injection cannot perfectly control the target system. The dominant bit injection can only perform denial of service (DoS) attacks, which means that it cannot perfectly control the ECU. In this article, we propose a new attack technique for modifying either dominant or recessive bits represented in a CAN bus as the attacker intends. This technique is called perfect bit modification (PBM). We introduce two attack models using the PBM technique, the bus possession attack (BPA) and the target ID attack (TIA). The BPA can perform an attack without breaking the communication pattern of the CAN bus, and the TIA can perfectly seize control of a specific ECU. In addition, we produce an attack tool with the PBM functionality using the SN65HVD230 (CAN transceiver) and the FDS8949 (MOSFET). Both SN65HVD230 and FDS8949 are components that are commonly used to build ECUs, which cost less than two dollars. This means that our attack models are likely to be utilized for supply chain attacks. To demonstrate the feasibility of BPA and TIA, we conduct attack experiments using two real vehicles. Finally, we analyze the characteristics of existing attack techniques including PBM and suggest countermeasures to construct a secure CAN environment.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes an improved channel reconstruction method to increase the accuracy of Doppler emulations when measuring directional multi-antenna devices in over-the-air (OTA) testing at millimeter wave (mmWave) bands. In real radio channels, the Doppler spectrum depends on incoming ray angles. In OTA testing, the target Doppler spectrum is accurately created when assessing omni-directional antenna terminals using the conventional prefaded signal synthesis (PFS) method. However, the devices under test (DUTs) may consist of directional antennas that produce different gains in impinging angles. Since the PFS method ignores the dependence of the Doppler spectrum on the DUT antenna element pattern, it will lead to inaccurate channel emulation, thus affecting the link performance of the DUT. Therefore, an improved PFS method is proposed by considering the impact of the DUT antenna element pattern. Specifically, the rays within a cluster mapped to active probes are divided into multiple subsets, each of which is weighted to synthesize the cluster. The objective function with constraints between the target temporal covariance and emulated one is established to obtain all subset weights. Simulation results verify that the proposed channel emulation method is superior to the existing PFS technique for Doppler emulation while not degrading the emulated spatial characteristics using the proposed optimization strategy.},

This method can help understand semantic network performance from the macroscopic view rather than the connection-oriented perspective. Firstly, through the semantic mapping operation, the context space is transformed into the semantic space in the semantic sensing process. Secondly, given the text data with different statement styles, e.g., literary and scientific texts, two typical semantic reflection models are established with the help of stochastic geometry theory, where the keyword coverage expressions are derived. Thirdly, under various parameter settings, the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed models have been evaluated through the simulation results and analysis.},

To make the most of THz UM-MIMO systems, acquisition of accurate channel information is crucial. However, the THz channel acquisition is not easy due to the humongous pilot overhead that scales linearly with the number of antennas. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning (DL)-based channel acquisition technique called Transformer-based parametric THz channel acquisition (T-PCA) for the THz UM-MIMO systems. By learning the complicated mapping function between the received pilot signal and the sparse channel parameters (e.g., angles, distances, path gains) using Transformer, T-PCA can make a fast yet accurate channel estimation with a relatively small amount of pilot resources. Moreover, using the attention mechanism of Transformer, we can promote the correlation structure of the received pilot signals in the feature extraction, thereby improving the channel parameter estimation quality significantly. From the simulation results, we demonstrate that T-PCA is effective in acquiring the THz channel information and reducing the pilot overhead.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless communications system with multi-user scheduling, where a pilot-embedded data transmission is carried out from a selected user to an access point (AP) with the aid of an RIS. Specifically, by taking into account a transmit energy constraint, we propose a joint passive beamforming and power allocation optimization (JPB-PAO) scheme for the RIS-assisted wireless system, in which a problem of joint optimization on the pilot power, data power, and RIS&#39;s phase shifts is formulated for maximizing the achievable rate of the user-AP transmission. To this end, we propose a Dinkelbach and majorization-minimization (DMM) aided JPB-PAO (termed as DMM-JPB-PAO) scheme for the sake of obtaining a semi-closed form expression of the optimal RIS phase shifts, based on which a closed-form solution of power allocation is derived. Moreover, we adopt the widely used semidefinite relaxation (SDR) algorithm as a baseline to solve the JPB-PAO problem, which is referred to as the SDR-JPB-PAO. Numerical results show that our proposed DMM-JPB-PAO achieves almost the same achievable rate as the SDR-JPB-PAO at a much lower computational complexity. Meanwhile, DMM-JPB-PAO scheme yields a higher achievable rate than the passive beamforming optimization with fixed power allocation (PBO-FPA) scheme and the random passive beamforming with fixed power allocation (RPB-FPA) scheme.},

The RIS does not need any control lines connected to the unit cells or precise synchronization with the base station, leading to reduced complexity of the RIS system yet allowing automated beamforming characteristics in accordance with the incident pulse width. To verify this scheme, an RIS system model using binary phase shift keying is considered, in which the RIS wireless link is connected to a single transmitter at the input and two receivers at the output. Numerical demonstrations show that modulated signals are received with contrasting bit-error rates in the two receivers, consistent with the aforementioned pulse-width-based beam control.},

On the other hand, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has received considerable attention, which can be deployed on the walls and objects to strengthen the positioning performance. However, RIS is usually not equipped with a perception module, which results in the tremendous challenge for RIS-assisted positioning.

  abstract     = {The use of antenna arrays is pivotal in array signal processing, with the different antenna arrays having their own structural advantages. The uniform linear arrays (ULAs) are more robust against antenna failures, but their degrees of freedom (DOFs) and array aperture, which are crucial for the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, are limited. On the other hand, the sparse arrays can offer more DOFs and a larger array aperture but may not necessarily be as robust as ULAs. Hence depending on the given requirement, the properties of certain antenna arrays need to be exploited for direction finding. However, most of the existing antenna array configurations are deprived of a universal design approach. This manuscript introduces a universal array designing framework (UADF), which can employ different antenna arrays and exhibit multiple desirable properties. The UADF is based on effectively cascading three identical levels that can be nested to another M -times, with only its initial level to be configured by the antenna array. Thus, it inherits the characteristics of configuration used in the initial level and simultaneously embeds a good balance between key features in terms of low cost, easier construction and extension, reliability, robustness, more DOFs, larger continuous virtual aperture, and higher spatial efficiency. Moreover, the UADF enjoys closed-form expressions for the array configuration and DOFs. We employed different antenna arrays to demonstrate the usefulness of UDAF, which is also confirmed via numerical experiments.},

To address the aforementioned challenges, we exploit the synergy of supervised learning and super-resolution technology to enable low-overhead beam- and power allocation. In the first step, we propose a method for beam-quality prediction. It is based on deep learning and explores the relationship between high- and low-resolution beam images (energy).

In this paper, a joint communication and delay sensitive control (JCDSC) system with URLLC is studied, where the control intervals are much shorter than the transmission latency. The control performance, known as the mean square error (MSE) of the plant states, are analysed in theory. The optimal blocklength of the control codewords, the data rate, as well as the minimum required control periods are then obtained, in order to minimize the control latency.

Based on the zero-padded OTFS structure, the traditional pilot pattern with guard symbols is adopted. The received pilots in the OTFS domain are used as the inputs of the network to estimate the channel parameters which are used in the MRC algorithm to demodulate the signal. In our proposed method, it can achieve the similar performance with 14 dB boost of pilot energy comparing with the ideal channel estimation case, while the conventional method requires 30 dB higher. Both the accuracy and generalization ability of the DNN network are validated.},

To fully exploit the amplifying gain achieved by active IRS, two high-rate methods, maximum-ratio-reflecting (MRR) and selective-ratio-reflecting (SRR), are presented, which are motivated by maximum ratio combining and selective ratio combining. Moreover, both MRR and SRR are in closed-form expressions. To further improve the rate, a maximum approximate-signal-to-noise ratio (Max-ASNR) is first proposed with an alternately iterative infrastructure between adjusting the norm of beamforming vector and its normalized vector. This may make a substantial rate enhancement over existing equal-gain reflecting (EGR). Simulation results show that the proposed three methods perform much better than existing method EGR in terms of rate. They are in decreasing order of rate performance: Max-ASNR, MRR, SRR, and EGR.},

  abstract     = {Power amplifiers (PAs) lead to nonlinear distortion in index modulation assisted OFDM (OFDM-IM) systems when the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is high. But PAPR reduction in OFDM-IM is more complicated than that in traditional OFDM owing to the frequent switch of subcarrier states between active and idle. When implementing OFDM-IM on resource-limited platforms like battery-powered Internet of Things (IoT) devices, PAPR cannot always be ideally eliminated due to the complexity of the reduction algorithm and the limitation of computation resources. Hence, performance optimization under non-negligible PAPR becomes an important issue. This paper performs symbol error rate (SER) optimization in OFDM-IM systems with high PAPR. First, we derive a low complexity expression of receiver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in nonlinear OFDM-IM systems. Second, we find that SER in OFDM-IM is affected by the nonlinear distortion in both constellation mapping and index estimation. With this observation, we derive a closed-form expression of SER and prove that there is a lower bound. Third, we do SER optimization and identify the optimal system operating point with respect to the minimum SER. Finally, we validate our analysis through simulations.},

To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Triple Parametric Decomposition (TPD) framework to facilitate compressed channel estimation in the XL-MIMO system. Specifically, we examine the case of a uniform planar array (UPA) with the geometry parameters involving a pair of azimuth-elevation angles and distances in an attempt to achieve independent decomposition by constructing their own covariance matrices. Then, by utilizing the on- and off-grid techniques, we obtain the sparse recovery of angles and distances information in the absence of energy leakage effect at reduced gridding complexity.

To address this issue, this research work proposes an efficient conditional privacy-preserving scheme. In this scheme, firstly, a certificateless aggregation signature has been performed on board to avoid channel conflicts, and to our best knowledge, this scheme is the first one to propose aggregation on board. Also an elliptic curve point multiplicative operation has been utilized to decrease the cost consumed in computation. Secondly, this article gives the security proof of the proposed scheme against the existence of unforgeability under adaptively chosen message attack for Type-I and Type-II adversaries in the random oracle model. Lastly, comprehensive performance comparisons covering the computation, communication and storage costs have been done to state that the proposed scheme is more efficient than the existing solutions. Significantly, this scheme saves at least 86% in communication overhead than compared schemes.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle time-sensitive communication (VTSC) is an emerging paradigm where the Time-Sensitive Networking together with V2X provides connected vehicle with deterministic and low communication latency. Scheduling is a critical step to realize the determinism. Recently, as the scale and variety of VTSCs increase, the requirements of simultaneously achieve multicast supportment, short runtime, dynamic schduling ability and low resource overhead challenge the traditional TSN scheduling algorithms. This article proposes a scheduling scheme with multiple stages to achieve both efficient and rapid scheduling. This article first formulates the joint routing and scheduling problems by proposing a cluster-Integer Linear Programming (CILP). It aims to accelerate the static scheduling and realize real-time response for dynamic incremental scheduling. An improved topology pruning method and a clustering-aggregation ILP procedure are presented. Then, since the dynamic scheduling will gradually reduce the resource utilization, this article proposes an adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) to rapidly perform the resource optimization. The crossover operator, mutation operator, adaptive probability and fitness function are designed, supporting multicast TSN flows. Finally, this article conducts extensive simulations to validate the proposed algorithms. The results show that, comparing with traditional methods, the proposed CILP method can reduce the average runtime by up to 86.7% for static scheduling and realize real-time dynamic scheduling. The proposed AGA method can reduce the resource optimization runtime by up to 70% while improving the schedulability. The overall multi-stage scheduling mechanism could satisfy the VTSC scheduling requirements.},

Since the open nature of wireless channels, it is necessary to encrypt sensitive data before sharing to ensure data security. However, existing efforts for secure data sharing still encounter efficiency and security bottle-neck because of the following issues: 1) absence of an effective policy to cross-system dynamically assign ciphertexts to multiple recipients. 2) Difficulty in hindering data disclosure resulting from malicious behaviors of a malicious data publisher. With the motivation to address the above issues simultaneously, in this article, we propose a sanitizable cross-system ciphertext authorization scheme (SI-APRE) for secure communication in ICVs. Our SI-APRE enables the conversion of the ciphertext generated with the original recipient&#39;s identity into a new ciphertext bound to the access policy, so that other new authorized recipients can also access the raw data. Meanwhile, our SI-APRE can check and sanitize the original ciphertext to prevent malicious publishers from encrypting data in a harmful way. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate that our SI-APRE solution enjoys impressive performance regarding efficiency, which makes it more feasible and practical in reality.},

  abstract     = {The development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has been advancing rapidly and is widely applied in various domains. Compared to a single UAV, the multi-UAV system, known as the UAV Ad Hoc Network (UANET), can collaborate to accomplish complex tasks more efficiently. Due to the UAVs communicating through open wireless channels, they are vulnerable to various attacks. Group key agreement protocols are often used to guarantee the security of UANET communication. However, the high dynamics of UAVs and the instability of the wireless links often result in certain UAVs temporarily losing connection with the group, rendering them incapable of participating in the group key agreement process. Regrettably, existing literature on group key agreement does not consider this issue, which makes them not applicable to UANET. To address this issue, we propose a threshold authenticated group key agreement protocol (TAGKA) that can resist the disconnection of group members. Then, considering that the temporarily disconnected UAVs need to obtain the latest group key after the communication links are recovered, we design a group key recovery protocol. The security of the scheme is proved under the random oracle model. Moreover, formal security verification using the Tamarin and rigorous informal security analysis is also performed. Finally, we use NS-3 to simulate the protocol, and the experimental results show that our protocol can be effectively applied to UANET.},

The exchange of information in VANET is public which leads to severe security threats. Generally, one of the most crucial tasks in VANET is the security of data. So it becomes one of the urgent tasks of researchers. We have reviewed several authentication schemes for VANETs. Still, most schemes are not secure due to several attacks such as replay, denial of services, impersonation attacks, etc. Furthermore, the existing schemes used higher communication and computational costs, and they are also incompatible with VANET applications that are resource-constrained. This article presents the lightweight and secure multi-factor authenticated key agreement scheme for VANETs to ensure efficient and secure transmission of data via an open channel. Our presented scheme is secure, scalable, and lightweight compared to existing schemes due to its low computation and communication cost. The formal and informal security analysis proved that our scheme is more reliable, practical, and secure against several unknown adversarial attacks in VANETs.},

  abstract     = {Timely and reliable environment perception is fundamental to safe and efficient automated driving. However, the perception of standalone intelligence inevitably suffers from occlusions. A new paradigm, Cooperative Perception (CP), comes to the rescue by sharing sensor data from another perspective, i.e., from a cooperative vehicle (CoV). Due to the limited communication bandwidth, it is essential to schedule the most beneficial CoV, considering both the viewpoints and communication quality. Existing methods rely on the exchange of meta-information, such as visibility maps, to predict the perception gains from nearby vehicles, which induces extra communication and processing overhead. In this article, we propose a new approach, learning while scheduling, for distributed scheduling of CP. The solution enables CoVs to predict the perception gains using past observations, leveraging the temporal continuity of perception gains. Specifically, we design a mobility-aware sensor scheduling (MASS) algorithm based on the restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) theory to maximize the expected average perception gain. An upper bound on the expected average learning regret is proved, which matches the lower bound of any online algorithm up to a logarithmic factor. Extensive simulations are carried out on realistic traffic traces. The results show that the proposed MASS algorithm achieves the best average perception gain and improves recall by up to 3.1 percentage points compared to other learning-based algorithms. Finally, a case study on a trace of LiDAR frames qualitatively demonstrates the superiority of adaptive exploration, the key element of the MASS algorithm.},

This article proposes a novel R2V Deadline-Constrained Task Offload (R2V-DCTO) scheduling scheme with the objective of improving the RSU&#39;s performance in terms of the above-mentioned metrics; hence, filling an important literature gap. For this purpose, a stochastic modelling framework is established to capture the RSU&#39;s functional dynamics and assess its performance as it operates under R2V-DCTO. Extensive simulations are conducted to confirm the model&#39;s validity and accuracy and then compare R2V-DCTO&#39;s performance to that of the often adopted FIFO scheme. Results indicate that, on average, R2V-DCTO outperforms FIFO by 33.4% in terms of the probability of deadline mismatch and by 83.3% in terms of mean system response time; those being critical QoS performance metrics.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has attracted global research interests across extensive applications. Due to the significant increase in the number of vehicles accessing the Internet, there are several challenges in designing efficient task offloading and data caching strategies to improve the utilization of the network resource and provide the users with high-quality services. To this end, this study proposes the task offloading and resource allocation schemes, including the selection of execution mode, data transmission path, the assignment of the sub-channels, the strategies of caching and caching updating in a Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) enabled IoV system with multiple mobile vehicles equipped with the capacity of energy harvesting. Specifically, the downlink relevant data or the uplink offloaded data can be transmitted through either the Macro Base Station(MBS) or the Road Side Unit(RSU). Also, we consider two different situations: off-peak hours and peak hours, in which the execution mode is different. In off-peak hours, the tasks can directly offload to the MEC server, and the average execution delay minimization problem is modelled as an integer programming problem, which is solved by Simulated Annealing Genetic Algorithm (SAGA). In peak hours, the tasks can be either executed locally or offloaded to the MEC server, and the formulated problem are more complicated, which are solved by Deep Q Network (DQN). Finally, a series of simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed schemes.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) technology, the computationally intensive requests of end devices can be offloaded to MEC servers directly, which equipped at the edge of wireless networks. Through offloading, the performances such as the execution delay as well as the energy consumption can be effectively improved, which can significantly enhance the quality of user experience. Given the dynamics and randomness of computation requests arrival, the energy in the battery, the radio network environment, and the computation resource in the MEC server, it is a challenge to perform efficient offloading. Based on these problems, this article proposes dynamic optimization schemes with queuing theory for the cases of the static subchannel and dynamic subchannel during a time slot separately in 5G MEC heterogeneous networks with multiple MDs equipped with the function of energy harvesting. In the schemes, offloading decisions and radio allocation strategies will be dynamically coordinated. They are also jointly allocated along with changing wireless communication resources and computation demands aiming to minimize the system average execution delay. Specifically, it is assumed that the offloading requests can be transmitted through either macro base stations or small base stations. In the case of the static subchannel, a joint resource allocation and computation offloading scheme based on Lyapunov optimization and Simulated Annealing Genetic Algorithm (SAGA) is put forward. As for the dynamic subchannel, the leader-and-follower model is adopted and solved by SAGA and Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) method. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed schemes is verified through several simulations.},

  abstract     = {Multi-vehicle perception fusion is an emerging advanced vehicular application providing Vehicle Users (VUs) with comprehensive driving assistance. This involves each VU&#39;s individual vehicular perception tasks and additional fusion tasks at the end. However, performing these perception fusion applications on some VUs may not be feasible due to the applications&#39; high computing complexity. Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) server, which is collocated with a Road-side Unit, together with VUs&#39; Vehicular Local Computing (VLC) units can be used to support these perception fusion applications through task offloading. Achieving this edge-collaborated perception fusion with task offloading involves multiple challenges: (i) frequently varying uplink channel conditions, (ii) sequential and parallel task dependencies, and (iii) uncertain task composition induced by unknown object detection outputs in the dynamic driving environment. In this article, a real-time mechanism is proposed to minimize the end-to-end delay of an edge-collaborated multi-vehicle perception fusion application by addressing these challenges. Based on the real-time channel conditions, VEC and VLC server capacities, and number of detected objects, this algorithm jointly determines the bandwidth allocation, task partitioning, offloading, and execution scheduling for all the involved tasks of the multi-vehicle perception fusion application. Numerical results show that the proposed approach can significantly reduce the end-to-end fusion application latency compared to existing techniques.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a two-stage novel algorithm for intelligent edge-assisted multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) surveillance services. In the first stage, multiple UAVs determine their optimal positions to detect as many target faces as possible for efficient surveillance using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL). Multi-UAVs must be coordinated and optimally positioned for effective surveillance depending on the target person&#39;s location. It is also significantly important to consider the battery performance of the UAVs. In the second stage, every single UAV performs face identification in monitored areas, where two sequential scheduling methods make decisions: (i) edge selection for remote computing via max-weight scheduling and (ii) transmit power allocation scheduling to deliver the images to scheduled edges for time-average energy consumption minimization subject to stability. The identification execution requires computing power, and its complexity and time depend on the number of faces in the captured image. Consequently, the task cannot be fully executed by an individual UAV in high image arrival regimes or images with a high density of faces. In those conditions, UAVs can leverage computing support from nearby edges capable of AI-based face identification tasks. Importantly, computing task distribution should be energy-efficient and delay-minimal due to constraints imposed by the UAV system&#39;s characteristics and applications. We remark that selected edges should complete their computing tasks with similar delay to minimize idle time among the edges, which is why we chose min-max scheduling. To summarize, our proposed novel two-stage algorithm accomplishes efficient multi-UAV positioning corresponding to user-defined weight (overlapped threshold) and minimizes UAVs&#39; transmission power while preserving stability constraints.},

  abstract     = {Unleashing the potential of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to play the role of caching devices for furnishing layered video services to ground users (GUs) holds tremendous promise. However, it is crucial to strike a balance between the quality and the diversity of video content when deciding the placement strategies of video caching. In this study, we examine the feasibility of implementing a layered caching scheme utilizing scalable video coding (SVC) in three-dimensional (3D) multi-UAV networks with cache capabilities. The objective is to investigate the minimization of the cumulative video access delay experienced by all GUs through the joint design of layered scalable video caching, user-UAV association, and 3D UAV deployment. This approach enables the network to offer video services across a range of quality levels. We have formulated an intricate mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem which poses a significant challenge to solve directly. Then we decompose the formulated problem into three interrelated sub-problems and put forth specific algorithms designed to address each component, i.e., layered caching strategy and UAV&#39;s two-dimensional (2D) deployment optimization with penalty based difference-of-convex (penalty-DC) framework, user-UAV association optimization with bipartite graph based linear programming (LP) relaxation, as well as UAV altitude optimization with successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Then we introduce a highly efficient iterative algorithm that employs an alternate optimization approach for three sub-problems until convergence. Our simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm surpasses other benchmark schemes significantly in terms of mitigating video access delay.},

  abstract     = {Various subcarrier modulations bring wider Gabor bandwidths and higher-precision ranging and positioning potential to the new generation of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals. However, they may also introduce intolerable ambiguity problems for signal tracking, ranging, and positioning. In order to take advantage of high-precision subcarriers in subcarrier modulated signals for unambiguous ranging and positioning, we propose a Carrier Assisted Robust Unambiguous Positioning Technique (CARUPT), which consists of a Carrier Assisted Kalman filter (CA-Kalman) module and an Observation Cycle-slip Detection (OCD) module. The CA-Kalman module utilizes the undifferenced code and subcarrier observations and time-differenced carrier observations derived from two-dimensional tracking to resolve subcarrier ambiguities in the position domain. The OCD module includes a carrier-involved Subcarrier Cycle-slip Detector (SCD) and a high-order difference-based Carrier Cycle-slip Detector (CCD) so as to avoid the impact of subcarrier and carrier cycle slips on the robust resolution of subcarrier ambiguities. In this paper, performances in theory, simulation, and real data experiments comprehensively demonstrate that compared with existing techniques, the CARUPT can resolve subcarrier ambiguities with faster convergence speed, higher accuracy, and robustness, deriving the most reliable unambiguous positioning results.},

In particular, we propose a node activation strategy to select the backbone agents that minimize the information loss caused by malformed topology, and then the listener agents localize themselves based on the backbone topology. The scheme also incorporates a back calibration step that utilizes the position estimates of the listener agents to further improve the localization accuracy of the backbone topology. Moreover, a multi-sensory information fusion scheme is developed for dynamic scenes, where a coordinate transformation method is proposed to reduce the accumulated error caused by the coordinate misalignment. Finally, the system is implemented on a low-cost hardware platform with the ultra-wideband radios, and extensive simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed system can achieve decimeter-level relative localization accuracy.},

Especially, in the Vehicle Sharing System (VSS), the data authority is hard to be guaranteed based on the current technology. VSS provides the users with a convenient way to access vehicles nearby. However, the driving data security which can be used to record the driving conditions cannot be guaranteed by either cloud server or the vehicle. The camera in the cab is also not accepted because it will leak the user&#39;s privacy. This article solves this problem based on the cryptography with the public auditing technology. We design a multi-signature scheme so that the OBU and the PDA equipment of the vehicle renter can jointly sign a signature as a meta data for the driving information and upload it to the cloud server together with the raw data. In the event of a dispute, such as a vehicle accident, anyone can conduct an integrity checking with batch jobs on the stored data in the cloud server, so that the cloud and the vehicle renter cannot deny these information. We think that our scheme can be used to prevent some obvious data modification in cloud or as a part of the reference for accident identification. We also use the provable security technology to prove that our protocol is secure, and we realize its core algorithms. The experimental result shows that our scheme is efficient.},

Correspondingly, we derive performance models for investigating the impacts of the BS cooperation level, UAV altitude, and GBS density on the coverage probability, meta distribution, and local delay of a UAV, taking account of the line-of-sight (LoS) probability of the downlink between a GBS and a UAV, and the small-scale fading of a channel following a Nakagami-m distribution.

The use of DIDs empowers users by helping them to have complete control over their identities. The charging station and the user verify that the other party is legitimate by verifying the VC before proceeding with the charging services. Key recovery is another issue we address in this article. A method to recover lost keys is incorporated into the proposed protocol. The proposed protocol also incorporates an effective user revocation policy.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of autonomous vehicles (AVs), vehicle safety has attracted attention. Controller area network (CAN) bus without authentication and encryption mechanisms is a weakness of the in-vehicle network (IVN), and attackers always primarily target the CAN bus. Attacks on the AVs&#39; CAN bus are more frequent because AVs have more external interfaces and sensors than ordinary vehicles. To address the abovementioned issues, this paper proposes a lightweight encryption and authentication scheme for the CAN bus of AVs using message authentication codes and Grain stream cipher. The scheme realizes efficient authentication between electronic control units and a counter re-synchronization protocol is used to ensure that authentication failure owing to counter inconsistency is prevented. Blom key management scheme is employed to rapidly distribute and update session keys, avoiding the complicated process of updating pairwise keys. In addition, considering the scalability of the IVN, a key distribution protocol for new nodes was provided. The security proof using Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic and security analysis prove that the proposed scheme can satisfy the security requirements of the IVN. In addition, performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme can meet real-time requirements and has little impact on the busload.},

To address this problem, we propose a novel Model-Assisted Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MAD-MARL) algorithm, which incorporates the following three designs: 1) a model-based prediction approach, which can improve the policy learning speed greatly and also predict each agent&#39;s potential future so as to alleviate the impact of delayed information sharing in a networked system, 2) an attentional prediction sharing approach, which is to effectively reduce the non-stationarity of the environment by combining the proposed model-based prediction and self-attention strategy for reaching global consensus and cooperative inter-agent coordination in a distributed manner, and 3) a decentralized model-free learning approach, which trains the agents with the assistance of model-based predictions. Extensive simulations are conducted and the numerical results demonstrate that MAD-MARL can significantly increase the learning speed and also greatly improve the overall performance compared with existing work.},

To simplify the analysis, the continuous time horizon is discretized into several time slots. The duration of each time slot is set to be less than the pre-defined threshold such that the UAV&#39;s location can be considered as unchanged during each time slot. In our work, we aim to minimize the completion time of the UAV by optimizing the association scheme of the IoT devices, the location (i.e., the trajectory) and velocity of the UAV at each time slot. However, the formulated problem is challenging to solve by traditional optimization methods considering the unknown number of time slots (which leads to the unknown number of decision variables) and non-convex functions. We thus reformulate it as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based method to efficiently solve it. The DDPG-based algorithm uses deep function approximators instead of finding the action that maximizes the state-action value, and is therefore well suited to solve high-dimensional, continuous control problems. Extensive numerical results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {As one of the key technologies for the 6G system, network slicing can enable the concurrent provisioning of heterogeneous quality of services (QoS) on various types of services under one Fog-RAN architecture. However, effective slicing of Fog-RAN is very challenging due to the diversification of QoS requirements and demand fluctuation. In this article, we propose a demand-oriented two-tier Fog-RAN slicing trading framework to facilitate the slice generation between the mobile network operator (MNO) and service providers (SPs), and also the slice adaptation among SPs with the consideration of three service types, including data transmission, computation offloading and content caching. In Tier-I, a slice generation mechanism is developed to enable the MNO to provide customized slices for SPs by jointly scheduling 3D resources (communication, computing and caching resources) in a large time scale. In Tier-II, a slice adaptation mechanism is designed based on the deep reinforcement learning approach to facilitate SPs to perform effective resource adjustment on their own slices by purchasing/selling resources from/to other SPs in a small time scale. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can satisfy the various QoS requirements through the 3D resource scheduling, and also improve the resource utilization owing to the proactive slice adaptation. Comparing with the traditional semi-dynamic slicing manner, the adaptive adjustment could improve the resource utilization about &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$30\%$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; .},

  abstract     = {Underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) has received widespread attention recently due to its distinct advantages in terms of high bandwidth, low power consumption, low delay and confidentiality. However, unlike underwater acoustic communication systems, it suffers from constraints, such as limited communication range and misalignment in oceanic extreme environments. To perform long-distance high bandwidth transmission such as real-time video streaming, it requires relaying technology to perform reliable and robust transmission. Although pre-deploying a large number of sensor nodes is one of the possible solutions, this is impractical in response to emergency events, such as oil pipeline leakage and maritime search and rescue. To this end, in this article, we propose to leverage a swarm of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to establish reliable underwater optical communication links in a rapidly changing marine environment for real-time video transmission. We first model the optical transmission channel, and then calculate both the optical angle and the reliable communicating range that satisfy a pre-defined bit error rate (BER). We then formulate the optimization problem based on two aligned solutions while targeting on minimizing both deployment energy consumption and time latency, in which the AUV&#39;s uncertainty issue caused by localization error and hovering instability is considered. Finally, we design an adaptive optical beam and power adjustment algorithm to enhance the robustness of the optical link further. Through extensive simulations, the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is efficient and achieves reliable and robust communication.},

  abstract     = {We consider a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-based communication and radar coexistence (CRC) system. The proposed system allows an RSMA-based communication system to share spectrum with multiple radars, which significantly improves spectral efficiency, energy efficiency and quality of service (QoS) of communication users (CUs). Due to the spectrum sharing, the communication network and the radars cause interference to each other, which reduces the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the radars as well as the data rate of the CUs. Therefore, a major problem is to maximize the sum rate of the CUs while guaranteeing their QoS requirements of data transmissions and the SINR requirements of multiple radars. To achieve the objective, we formulate a new problem that optimizes i) common rates of the CUs, ii) transmit power of the common message of the CUs, iii) transmit power of the private messages for the intended CUs, and iv) transmit power of the radar systems. The problem is non-convex, and thus we propose two algorithms. The first sequential quadratic programming (SQP) as the state-of-the-art in nonlinear programming method can quickly return a local optimal solution. The second is an additive approximation scheme (AAS) which solves the problem globally in a reasonable amount of time. Simulation results show the significant improvement of the AAS compared with the SQP in terms of sum rate. Furthermore, with the AAS, the sum rate of the CUs only slightly decreases when the radars&#39; SINR is significantly increased. This implies that the AAS supports the RSMA-based communication system which allows to well coexist with the radars.},

  abstract     = {Emerging wireless applications are requiring ever more accurate location-positioning from sensor measurements. In this article, we develop sensor selection strategies for 3D wireless positioning based on time of arrival (TOA) and received signal strength (RSS) measurements to handle two distinct scenarios: (i) known approximated target location, for which we conduct dynamic sensor selection to minimize the positioning error; and (ii) unknown approximated target location, in which the worst-case positioning error is minimized via robust sensor selection. We derive expressions for the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) as a performance metric to quantify the positioning accuracy resulted from selected sensors. For dynamic sensor selection, two greedy selection strategies are proposed, each of which exploits properties revealed in the derived CRLB expressions. These selection strategies are shown to strike an efficient balance between computational complexity and performance suboptimality. For robust sensor selection, we show that the conventional convex relaxation approach leads to instability, and then develop three algorithms based on (i) iterative convex optimization (ICO), (ii) difference of convex functions programming (DCP), and (iii) discrete monotonic optimization (DMO). Each of these strategies exhibits a different tradeoff between computational complexity and optimality guarantee. Simulation results show that the proposed sensor selection strategies provide significant improvements in terms of accuracy and/or complexity compared to existing sensor selection methods.},

To improve the success rate, an efficient GNSS spoofing attack method for a vehicle-mounted Multi Sensors Fusion (MSF) system is proposed based on the scenario classification models with a spatial database. Firstly, the influence of the two typical urban scenarios, which are 1) the road with buildings on both sides and 2) tunnels, on the GNSS spoofing attack is analyzed. Then a dynamic Bayesian network model considering the sky visibility generated with the 3D building models and tunnel models inside the spatial database is established to quantify the difficulty of the attack. Furthermore, the scenarios of the victim can be classified into high-risk and low-risk scenarios. When the vehicle is just out of the tunnel or in open scenarios, attackers can select these high-risk scenarios and implement aggressive spoofing attacks. Then the efficiency of the GNSS spoofing attack can be significantly improved. Finally, the proposed attack scheme is demonstrated by actual world data with simulated spoofing attacks in urban areas.},

  abstract     = {Regional satellite networks are capable of supporting denser coverage and more reliable communications in the target area and hence have been viewed as an essential part of the sixth generation (6G) communication system. Since satellite networks are time-varying and have limited resources, efficient resource management schemes are needed to accommodate massive and ubiquitous service requests. As a remedy, virtual network embedding (VNE) can enable diverse virtual network requests (VNRs) to share the same substrate network resources to improve resource utilization. However, existing works are few and mainly rely on heuristic methods, whose static embedding strategies cannot be optimized according to the resource state. In this article, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) aided load-balanced VNE algorithm (DRL-LBVNE) for the regional satellite networks, where we first build a low-cost regional satellite network scenario and derive its multi-fold coverage constraints. Besides, we design a novel preprocessing scheme to reduce mapping failure, where the satellite network is divided into multiple mapping regions, and VNRs are only deployed in the mapping region with the lowest load. In the node mapping stage, the DRL agent can calculate the embedding probabilities of each physical node based on the environment state. Moreover, a comprehensive metric for path selection is presented in the link mapping stage. Simulation results show that the DRL-LBVNE algorithm outperforms the other five state-of-art algorithms in acceptance rate, resource utilization, and average delay, reflecting better adaptability to dynamic satellite networks.},

The received power from LBDs is harvested at UAVs using the power-splitting energy harvesting (EH) architecture to improve its lifespan. Moreover, the received power at the UAV is modeled using the free-space optical (FSO) range equation, and is randomly affected by atmospheric turbulence and misalignment errors . With multi-user diversity scenario, we provide the mathematical framework for three user scheduling schemes, namely, random (RND) scheduling, absolute (ABS) signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) based scheduling and normalized (NRM) SINR scheduling schemes, wherein the UAV communicates with a single scheduled user in a given slot due to its limited abilities. The expressions for the outage probability, coverage probability and the block error rate (BLER) are derived for all the scheduling schemes under consideration.

  abstract     = {In this work, a Hybrid Hierarchical Federated Edge Learning (HHFEL) architecture that consists of a device layer, an edge layer, and a cloud layer over heterogeneous networks, is investigated for large-scale model training. In such systems, learning efficiency is severely degraded by limited communication resources and device heterogeneity in terms of local data distribution and computation capability, especially for synchronous FL mechanisms where the training of each round should wait for the slowest device. To tackle this issue, asynchronous FL is proposed, which allows the devices with powerful computation and communication capabilities exchanging information with the server more frequently. However, this asynchronous FL framework faces a new challenge of low accuracy caused by the imbalanced local model updating. To overcome the shortage of both synchronous and asynchronous FLs, we propose an enhanced online semi-asynchronous FL mechanism between the edge-device layers, where each device trains its local model with the newly generated data and each edge server aggregates a number of local models based on their arrival order in each round. Particularly, devices with faster training speeds would fully utilize the idle time by training their local models repetitively. Meanwhile, synchronous FL with an edge elastic update strategy is adopted to the cloud-edge layers for personalized information exchange. Considering the continuous data generation feature, we formulate the objective problem as an online Markov Decision Process (MDP) to realize efficient communication-and-computing HHFEL via joint device selection and resource allocation. Due to the non-convex and combinatorial problem structure, we develop a hybrid Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) approach with low computational complexity to adapt the device selection and resource allocation strategies. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism compared with existing benchmarks.},

In particular, we derive general and novel analytical expressions for the probability density function and the cumulative distribution function of the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under generalized fading channels subject to generalized geometric loss. Consequently, novel, general, and accurate analytical expressions for the outage probability, average symbol error rate, and average channel capacity are derived.

In this article, we for the first time, investigate a downlink NOMA system with flow-level dynamics, where long-lived flows and short-lived flows exist simultaneously, and formulate an optimization problem of user selection and power allocation. We aim to maximize the network utility at each time slot and simultaneously guarantee the throughput-optimality, under the quality of service (QoS) constraints. Considering the practicability of algorithm, the suboptimal algorithm containing two stages, is proposed. And we analyze the complexity of proposed algorithm. In the performance evaluation, the benchmark algorithm is provided for comparison. And we take the energy efficiency (EE) as an example of the network utility and define the scheduling delay (SD). Simulation results show that the suboptimal algorithm is throughput-optimal, and understandably, its performances could be better than those in the benchmark algorithm in terms of EE and SD, as long as the appropriate parameter is set.},

  abstract     = {In a wireless powered communication network (WPCN), wireless energy acquisition is weak due to the fading characteristic of wireless link, which makes it hard to supply the energy. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising performance enhancement technology for WPCNs, which can improve the energy and spectral efficiency, expand the network coverage, and thus improve the throughput. This article proposes a new framework for energy harvesting and information transmission of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based WPCNs aided by RIS. The total transmission capacity is maximized by joint optimization of energy precoding, information precoding, and the phase shift of RIS, which turns out to be a non-convex problem. Under the multi user scenario, we propose a joint optimization algorithm combing alternating optimization (AO), semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods, which is called ASS algorithm for short. Numerical results prove that compared with the non-RIS system, the ASS can increase the throughput of the system under multiuser scenario by 502.49%. For the system under single scenario, the energy precoding and information precoding are determined respectively by using the beamforming and the traditional maximal ratio combining (MRC) algorithm. The optimization problem is transformed into a complex higher order form optimization problem. Finally, a closed-form expression of the channel capacity is derived.},

Two phases of data transmission are assumed. In Phase I, the secondary transmitters employ uplink NOMA to transmit the symbols. The RS then uses downlink NOMA to broadcast the received symbols in Phase II. We employ the maximum ratio combining decoding scheme and propose a successive-interference-cancellation concept with ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$n+1$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ) stages to decode the symbols at the primary and secondary receiving ends, respectively.

Simulation results manifest that, compared with the conventional cooperative orthogonal multiple access-based spectrum leasing scheme, the proposed CNOMA-SL exhibits improved performance in terms of both achievable rate and outage probability. It is also revealed that the system performs better when the RS takes the lease of the whole spectrum. Furthermore, if more interference power is allowed to the primary receiver, the secondary users reach higher achievable rates.},

A major challenge facing by 6G is enabling a massive number of M2M devices to access networks in a timely manner. Therefore, this article exploits the spatial selectivity of massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) to reduce the collision issue when massive M2M devices initiate random access simultaneously. In particular, a beam-based random access protocol is first proposed to make efficient use of the limited uplink resources for massive M2M devices. To address the non-uniform distribution of M2M devices in the space and time dimensions, an Markov decision process (MDP) problem with the objective of minimizing the average access delay is then formulated. Next, we present a dynamic beam-based access scheme based on the double deep Q network (DDQN) algorithm to solve the optimal policy. Finally, simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme including the model training and random access performance.},

More particularly, a full-duplex (FD) base station (BS) communicates with the DL users via the STAR-RIS&#39;s transmission link, while exciting and receiving the information from the UL BackCom devices with the aid of the STAR-RIS&#39;s reflection link. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is exploited in both DL and UL communications for improving the spectrum efficiency. The system weighted sum rate maximization problem is formulated for jointly optimizing the FD BS active receive and transmit beamforming, the STAR-RIS passive beamforming, and the DL NOMA decoding orders, subject to the DL user&#39;s individual rate constraint. To tackle this challenging non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm for the joint active and passive beamforming design with a given DL NOMA decoding order. To address the potential high computational complexity required for exhaustive searching all the NOMA decoding orders, an efficient NOMA user ordering scheme is further developed. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that: i) compared with the baseline schemes employing conventional RISs or space division multiple access, the proposed scheme achieves higher performance gains; and ii) higher UL rate gain is obtained at a cost of DL performance degradation, as a remedy, a more flexible performance tradeoff can be achieved by introducing the STAR-RIS.},

Millimeter wave (mmWave) small cells can be densely deployed in macro cells to improve network capacity and spectrum utilization. Such a network architecture is referred to as mmWave heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets). Compared with the traditional wired backhaul, The integrated access and backhaul (IAB) architecture with wireless backhaul is more flexible and cost-effective for mmWave HetNets. However, the imbalance of throughput between the access and backhaul links will constrain the total system throughput. Consequently, it is necessary to jointly design of radio access and backhaul link. In this article, we study the joint optimization of user association and backhaul resource allocation in mmWave HetNets, where different mmWave bands are adopted by the access and backhaul links. Considering the non-convex and combinatorial characteristics of the optimization problem and the dynamic nature of the mmWave link, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) based scheme to maximize the long-term total link throughput of the network. The simulation results show that the scheme can not only adjust user association and backhaul resource allocation strategy according to the dynamics in the access link state, but also effectively improve the link throughput under different system configurations.},

In this article, the joint active and passive beamforming optimization of access points (APs) and RISs for the RISs-empowered cell-free network in the presence of channel state information (CSI) estimation errors is investigated. By taking the CSI estimation errors into account, we start with deriving the expression of a tight lower bound on the exact sum-rate, which is taken as the optimization criteria. Then, a robust joint beamforming optimization algorithm is proposed to obtain the highest sum-rate by using the lower bound, so as to obtain the best result out of the worst-case. In addition, a counter-intuitive but interesting result can be concluded via rigorous mathematical derivations that CSI estimation errors always impact the optimization of active transmitting beamforming matrices of APs, but surprisingly have no impact on the optimization of passive reflecting beamforming matrices of RISs when the covariance matrices of CSI estimation errors seen from two sides of each channel are proportional to an identity matrix. Simulation results demonstrate that RISs can considerably improve the sum-rate of the conventional cell-free network, and confirm the resilience of the proposed algorithm against CSI uncertainty.},

However, to further increase the network capacity, a large number of BSs need to be deployed, resulting in high cost and power consumption. To tackle this problem, econfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a cost-effective technology to enhance energy and spectral efficiency of wireless communications. In this article, we consider an RIS-aided CF network by exploiting their complementary advantages where each user assisted by a dedicated RIS can associate with multiple BSs. We first characterize each user&#39;s average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in the RIS-CF network. Then, we formulate an SINR balancing problem to maximize the minimum SINR among all users by designing the BS-user associations. Despite of the non-convexity and combinatorial feature of this problem, a two-step fractional linearization algorithm is developed to solve it optimally. Specifically, we transform a nested mixed-integer linear fractional program (MILFP) into a solvable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem through the generalized fractional programming and reformulation-linearization method. Finally, we provide numerical results to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm compared to other benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose an enhanced random access preamble (PA) detector for the low earth orbit (LEO) satellite-based non-terrestrial network (NTN) Internet-of-Things (IoT) that efficiently detects non-orthogonal PAs while suppressing interference. The proposed detector operates in two stages to efficiently suppress the interference caused by non-orthogonal PAs. In the first stage, reconstruction and cancellation of non-orthogonal PAs are performed. In the second stage, final PA detection is performed iteratively using the reconstructed PAs and received signal. In addition, we theoretically derive the probability of PA misdetection, PA collision, and successful PA detection under typical NTN line-of-sight (LoS) channel conditions. Simulation results verify that the proposed two-stage PA detector (TSPD) achieves performance close to the theoretical upper bound in terms of successful PA detection probability. The TSPD also shows a significantly greater successful PA detection probability than the conventional PA detector using orthogonal PAs while satisfying the random access requirement for the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) standard. Moreover, compared to the conventional PA detector for non-orthogonal PA, which adopts an interference cancellation scheme, the TSPD achieves up to 25.6 times lower detection complexity.},

  abstract     = {This article tackles the fundamental passive eavesdropping problem in modern wireless communications in which the location and the channel state information (CSI) of the attackers are unknown. In this regard, we propose deploying an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that serves as a mobile aerial relay (AR) to help ground base station (GBS) support a subset of vulnerable users. More precisely, our solution (1) clusters the single-antenna users in two groups to be either served by the GBS directly or via the AR, (2) employs optimal multi-user beamforming to the directly served users, and (3) optimizes the AR&#39;s 3D position, its multi-user beamforming matrix and transmit powers by combining closed-form solutions with machine learning techniques. Specifically, we design a plain beamforming and power optimization combined with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for an AR to optimize its trajectory for the security maximization of the served users. Numerical results show that the multi-user multiple input, single output (MU-MISO) system split between a GBS and an AR with optimized transmission parameters without knowledge of the eavesdropping channels achieves high secrecy capacities that scale well with increasing the number of users.

In particular, by assuming the existence of an eavesdropper, the secrecy performance of the considered uplink multiple-access system is investigated through the strictly positive secrecy capacity and secrecy outage probability, and closed-form expressions are derived for both quantities. Moreover, the secrecy performance is conducted regarding IQI compensation based on a preamble-based estimation method. Further, analysis of the impact of the different parameters of IM-OFDMA, IQI, and estimation method is included via analytical and simulation-based results. The results reveal that IM-OFDMA is more reliable in secrecy performance than OFDMA, regardless of whether IQI is present. Also, IQI compensation can lead to a better secrecy performance compared to the case of no IQI.},

Motivated by the spatial sparsity of HF skywave massive MIMO channels, we first prove that the ergodic sum-rate maximization problem can be solved in the beam domain without any loss of optimality. We prove that the beam domain transmission only involving power allocation for the beams that each user terminal (UT) occupies is asymptotic optimal if there are a sufficiently large number of antennas at the BS. Then, we derive an iterative beam domain power allocation algorithm using majorization-minimization (MM). Furthermore, we investigate a low-complexity DL transmitter design with ergodic sum-rate upper bound. We show that the beam domain design is still optimal and the asymptotic optimal solution can also be obtained by the beam domain power allocation. Specifically, we prove that the power allocation for different UTs should be performed in non-overlapped beams and simplify the MM based iterative power allocation algorithm.

Various types and numbers of access points (APs) can be deployed in heterogeneous cell-free systems, operating at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies. But, the instantaneous EE cannot give a full insight into these systems. To tackle this issue, in this article, we study the ergodic EE of mmWave heterogeneous cell-free systems. Since the derivation of a general closed-form expression for the ergodic EE is intractable, a semi-closed form expression was achieved via discretization, and its effects were investigated. Based on this expression, two specific cases of gain were obtained to describe the EE performance of the mmWave heterogeneous cell-free systems: the first determines the necessity to employ mmWave heterogeneous cell-free systems, and the second guides their deployment. Our simulation results validate the effectiveness of the two gain cases.},

The goal is to maximize their total weighted sum rate, subject to minimum rate requirements and maximum tolerable interference on the cellular system. Since the spectrum can be fully reused, the co-tier and cross-tier interferences among the users result in a mixed integer non-linear, non-convex program that is difficult to solve directly. Using insights into the structure of the interference, we derive a close, conservative approximation of the joint problem that has a convex relaxation that is tight. That enables good solutions to the joint problem to be obtained using a customized iterative algorithm employing the Lagrange dual decomposition method. Since the proposed iterative scheme is semi-distributed, the signaling overhead is mitigated. To further reduce the computational complexity, a low-complexity (primal) decomposition-based method is also introduced, in which we select the transmission mode heuristically based on the traffic level in the network, and then sequentially perform admission control, power control, and sub-channel allocation for the femtocell users and D2D users. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed iterative and heuristic algorithms, on average, achieve around 94% and 82% of the sum rate of the optimal Branch &amp; Bound method, respectively, and do so at much lower computational costs.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on low-latency transmissions for mobile edge computing (MEC)-assisted adaptive bitrate (ABR) video streaming. With the aim to realize minimum video service latency, an optimization problem is formulated by jointly designing caching, computing and power allocation, subject to diverse video version downloading rate requirements and the limited resources of MEC servers. The formulated optimization problem turns out to be a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To solve the problem and satisfy the low-latency service requirement of ABR video streaming, a low-complexity two-step iterative algorithm is proposed by decomposing the MINLP problem into two subproblems, a joint caching and computing subproblem and a power allocation subproblem. Due to the highly coupled nature of the caching and computing, the first subproblem is an integer nonlinear programming (INLP) problem. To solve it efficiently, the INLP problem is equivalently transformed into an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, which is thereafter solved by MATLAB intlinprog function. The second subproblem is a convex problem and is solved by low-complexity power allocation (LCPA) algorithm. Intensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges in a very short time, and can significantly reduce the average latency compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.},

We consider a two-tier HetNet comprising of half-duplex (HD) massive multi-antenna macrocell base stations (MBSs) and dual-antenna FD small cell base stations (SBSs) to support UL and DL transmissions of FD user equipments (UEs). Each FD UE is first associated to one MBS/SBS, based on the mean maximum received power (MMP) scheme or maximum received power (MRP) to harvest energy. During the consecutive data transmission phase, UEs choose to receive DL traffic from the same MBSs/SBSs as that associated with during energy harvesting phase, and send UL traffic through the same/another SBS. Leveraging tools from the stochastic geometry, we develop an analytical framework to analyze the average harvested energy and derive expressions for the UL and DL coverage probabilities of the proposed DUDe user association schemes. Our results show that there is an optimal value for the SBS density in the wireless-powered FD HetNets, at which both DL and UL coverage probabilities are maximized. Moreover, by applying MMPA and MRPA scheme, wireless-powered FD HetNets with DUDe achieves up to 138.78% and 83.37% energy efficiency gain over the FD HetNets with DL/UL coupled user association scheme and without wireless power transfer, respectively.},

The variable separation and relaxation are used to transform the problem into three convex sub-problems, which are alternatively solved through the convex optimization (CO) method. The major drawback of the proposed CO-based algorithm is high computational complexity. Thus, we make use of machine learning (ML) to tackle this problem. To this end, first, we convert the optimization problem into a regression problem. Then, we solve it with feed-forward neural networks (FNNs), trained by CO-based generated data. Simulation results show that the proposed ML-based algorithm has a performance equivalent to the CO-based algorithm, but with less computation complexity due to its offline training procedure.},

  abstract     = {For radar sensors in vehicle safety systems, it is of importance to establish a fundamental performance limit for the estimation accuracy of targets. Bayesian bounds, such as the Ziv–Zakai bound (ZZB), can provide an accurate prediction for the performance limit under all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. However, Bayesian bounds for the joint estimation of multiple parameters in radar systems have not been sufficiently studied and the explicit expression is still unavailable. In this article, we employ the thought of Shannon&#39;s information theory to propose a tight bound with closed-form expression for joint range and direction of arrival (DOA) estimation in phased-array radar. Based on the joint a posteriori probability density function, we define range-DOA entropy error (RDEE) as the entropy power of range and DOA. With normalized a posteriori entropies in low and high SNRs, the closed-form approximation for the theoretical RDEE is derived. The explicit theoretical RDEE is comprehensive and captures the effect of the SNR, the number of elements, and the ratio of the signal bandwidth to the carrier frequency. RDEE is compared with CRB and ZZB by a numerical simulation. The result shows RDEE and ZZB are almost identical in low SNR. Under high SNR, RDEE degenerates to ZZB.},

  abstract     = {In order to achieve high throughput and low-power consumption of the transmitter and improve the error performance of the receiver, a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided code index modulation (RIS-CIM) is proposed in wireless communications. RIS-CIM utilizes the index of a spreading code to convey additional information, which further improves the spectral efficiency (SE) and error performance of the receiver by adding and adjusting the reflected phase shift of low-cost reflective elements at the RIS-aided relay. To reduce the computational complexity incurred by the maximum likelihood (ML) detection, we propose two low-complexity detections, namely the match correlation (MC) detection and the optimal low complexity (OLC) detection. MC and OLC approaches separate the dispreading from the demodulation in the detection, which achieves a significant reduction of the computational complexity over ML detection demonstrated by the analysis of the computational complexity measurements. We present a thorough analysis for the upper bound on the average bit error probability (ABEP) of the ML detection and the bit error probability (BEP) of the OLC detection of RIS-CIM, which is verified by numerical simulations. Numerical simulations also demonstrate that the proposed RIS-CIM performs better in terms of the error performance of ML detection than several existing CIM and RIS-related schemes at a given SE setting. In addition, the proposed ML and OLC detections achieve an error performance close to the ML detection under various measures of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the increasing SE in the simulations. Moreover, RIS-CIM can utilize a large number of reflective elements at the RIS-aided relay to offset the performance degradation caused by the improvement of SE.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances demonstrate satellite communication (SatCom) as a potent enabler for future Terabit/s global connectivity. Existing SatCom systems, however, rely mostly on radio frequency (RF) transmission, whose limited available bandwidth is the main bottleneck for further data rate increases. Free-space optical (FSO) communication links, with huge license-free bandwidth, have emerged as an attractive alternative. Despite their ability to deliver high-throughput transmissions, FSO communications are weather-dependent and susceptible to atmospheric turbulence. Hybrid FSO/RF and space-air-ground (SAG) FSO transmissions are possible solutions to increase the reliability of FSO-based transmission systems. A strategically deployed unmanned-aerial vehicle, acting as a relay, can successfully mitigate the adverse effect of atmospheric turbulence, while the hybrid FSO/RF transmission can address weather-dependent effects. These solutions can also be integrated to create a system with significantly improved performance and reliability. To evaluate the performance of the resulting integrated transmission system, we analyze the outage probability and average symbol error probability in this work. Asymptotic expressions are also derived to obtain further insight into the system behavior and calculate the overall diversity gain. Furthermore, we consider the optimal design of switching thresholds. The numerical results show that the integrated transmission system achieves about 10 dB performance gain over existing solutions for both downlink and uplink scenarios.},

The time-frequency waveform design of OFDM for dual-functional radar-communications (DFRC) is critical to achieve the future communication and sensing requirements. Therefore, we propose a novel method to minimize Cramér-Rao bounds (CRBs) of the delay and Doppler estimation to improve radar performance of an OFDM DFRC system. Although some methods are proposed in the literature to improve the CRBs, these methods either require feedforward signaling or subcarrier reservation. However, it is possible to exploit the constellation extension of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) to achieve lower CRBs without these requirements. Therefore, the proposed method provides a transparent communication along with the CRB minimization for conventional OFDM systems. For the evaluation of the proposed method, CRB and symbol error rate (SER) are considered in the simulation results. Furthermore, the theoretical SER analysis of the proposed method is derived to understand the effects of CRB minimization on the communication performance.},

  abstract     = {This article explores the effect of the low probability of intercept (LPI) performance optimization on target tracking in distributed MIMO (D-MIMO) radar systems, where an intercept receiver is equipped on the target. The aim of the proposed LPI-based transmit resource scheduling (LPI-TRS) strategy is to optimize the LPI performance of the D-MIMO systems meanwhile satisfy the target tracking accuracy requirement by the proper transmit resource management design. Different from the existing research, we introduce a cascading mathematical model to describe the intercept process with the specific intercept receiver. A cascading product of the probabilities of interception and detection deduces the probability of report &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$ P_{R}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; for the interceptor, to evaluate the LPI performance of one transmit radar node.

Based on the min-max criterion, by minimizing the global LPI metric, a novel non-convex optimization problem is formulated wherein the requirements for target tracking performance and the system resource limitation are considered as the constraints. Wherein the tracking task is fulfilled by the two-tier hybrid processing framework. Meanwhile, we introduce a convex relaxation-based approach, so the sub-optimal results are acquired via a two-step fast computational search algorithm. Subsequently, the closed-loop scheme is set up to achieve LPI-based resource awareness in D-MIMO radar systems. Several numerical results demonstrate the theoretical analysis and show that the proposed LPI-TRS leads to significant LPI performance improvements.},

  abstract     = {The promising gains of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, in terms of extended coverage and enhanced capacity, are critically dependent on the accuracy of the channel state information. However, traditional channel estimation (CE) schemes are not applicable in RIS-assisted MIMO networks, since passive RISs typically lack the signal processing capabilities that are assumed by CE algorithms. This becomes problematic when physical imperfections or electronic impairments affect the RIS due to its exposition to different environmental effects or caused by hardware limitations from the circuitry. While these real-world effects are typically ignored in the literature, in this article we propose efficient CE schemes for RIS-assisted MIMO systems taking different imperfections into account. Specifically, we propose two sets of tensor-based algorithms, based on the parallel factor analysis decomposition schemes. First, assuming a long-term model – where the RIS imperfections, modeled as unknown phase shifts, are static within the channel coherence time – we formulate an iterative alternating least squares (ALS)-based algorithm for the joint estimation of the unknown phase deviations and the communication channels. Then, we develop the short-term imperfection model, which allows both amplitude and phase RIS imperfections to be non-static with respect to the channel coherence time. We propose two iterative ALS-based and closed-form higher-order singular value decomposition-based algorithms for jointly estimating the channels and the unknown impairments. We also investigate the computational complexity and the identifiability of the proposed algorithms and study the effect of various imperfections on the CE quality. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed tensor-based algorithms in terms of estimation accuracy and computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Short-packet communication is an important feature of the Internet of Things (IoT). For allowing massive IoT devices to connect to a network through short packets, this paper designs a cognitive radio-inspired non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme, where the IoT users will not necessarily occupy an exclusive spectrum. To further improve the connections in an IoT network, we propose a general NOMA scheme that serves multiple IoT users. Since the IoT devices are generally homogeneous, a user fairness-oriented power allocation scheme is designed for the proposed NOMA scheme. Besides, for comparison purposes, the benchmark orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme and its corresponding user fairness transmission scheme are also proposed. The closed-form expressions of average block error rates for secondary users are derived over Nakagami- &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; channels in both NOMA and benchmark OMA scheme. Simulation and analysis results show that a faraway primary network will benefit the spectrum sharing. In addition, shorter packets and more different channel conditions improve the NOMA gains over OMA. Besides, power allocation factors are found to be capable of achieving user fairness and the fairness transmission is achieved by the proposed scheme. Interestingly, when the channel differences are bigger enough, paring an extra NOMA user nearly does not affect the previous system performance.},

A new set of triangular DQ transmitting (Tx) coils for wireless EV chargers is newly proposed in this article for large longitudinal, lateral, and diagonal displacement tolerances. The proposed coil set consists of two layers, i.e., D-Tx and Q-Tx, where each Tx layer has two triangular coils of the same magnetic polarity diagonally, facing each other to generate a more uniform coupling coefficient between Tx and Rx w.r.t. the misalignments. In practice, diagonal misalignment tolerance is an important design criterion to deliver load power to EV because the worst scenario of misalignment is when longitudinal and lateral misalignments occur at the same time, i.e., diagonal misalignment. To solve these misalignment issues, the DQ transmitters were optimally designed to obtain uniformed output voltage against wide range of the diagonal misalignment situations. A prototype of an inductive power transfer (IPT) system having the proposed triangular DQ Tx coils for 3.5 kW wireless EV chargers was fabricated and experimentally verified with a switching frequency of 85 kHz, which can satisfy J2954 WPT1 class in the society of automotive engineers (SAE). As a result, it is found that 8.62 of the diagonal misalignment tolerance γ d has been achieved, and this value is superior to the other Tx coils.},

In this article, we first leverage the eigenvalues of covariance metrics of a multivariate time series to determine the anomaly score at each timestamp. Then, the anomaly scores are fed to various machine learning models. After that, we employ a Multivariate Variance-based Genetic Ensemble (MVVGE) learning method to ensemble the results of several models based on their corresponding performance. More specifically, we ensemble different Neural Network (NN), Random Forest (RF), and Linear Regression (LR) models based on their associated variance to catch the anomalies of three datasets, i.e., two satellite datasets: i) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), ii) Mars Science Laboratory rover (MSL), and Server Machine Dataset (SMD). Given that establishing the model confidence region is the bottleneck of our approach, we use an approximated version of the Bayesian NNs (BNN)s for acquiring confidence intervals of NN-based models. For RF and LR confidence intervals, we use an empirical method and bootstrapping, respectively. Simulation results confirm the superiority of our proposed approach compared to other methods.},

  abstract     = {This article studies optimal thermal management and charging of a battery electric vehicle driving over long-distance trips. The focus is on the potential benefits of including a heat pump in the thermal management system for waste heat recovery, and charging point planning, in a way to achieve optimality in time, energy, or their trade-off. An optimal control problem is formulated, in which the objective function includes the energy delivered by the charger(s), and the total charging time including the actual charging time and the detour time to and from the charging stop. To reduce the computational complexity, the formulated problem is then transformed into a hybrid dynamical system, where charging dynamics are modeled in the domain of normalized charging time. Driving dynamics can be modeled in either trip time or travel distance domains, as the vehicle speed is assumed to be known a priori, and the vehicle is only stopping at charging locations.

  abstract     = {The coprime planar array (CPPA) can obtain a larger virtual aperture using the sum-difference co-array (SDCA). Nonetheless, the holes in the SDCA always cause the virtual aperture to be not fully utilized. In order to solve this issue, a two-dimensional (2-D) directional of arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm with CPPA via matrix completion and sparse matrix recovery is proposed in this article. To accurately complete the missing elements in the SDCA, we construct an optimization problem based on the truncated nuclear norm regularization (TNNR) by constraining the conjugate flip symmetry property of the virtual array and the noise term. Moreover, we derive a complex-valued sparse matrix recovery algorithm based on the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding (FISTA) method avoiding using Kronecker product operations between dictionary matrices, which aims to reduce the computational complexity of the conventional vector-form sparse recovery algorithms. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can achieve a larger virtual aperture and lower computational complexity, improving the angle estimation performance. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for CPPA.},

The main quest of this research is to find out Can EV s and Photovoltaic ( PV ) systems support the DN and mitigate the voltage magnitude violations due to utilizing high penetration level EV ? This article proposes a novel volt/VAR optimization ( VVO ) model by leveraging the reactive power support of EV s and PV s as Distributed Energy Resources ( DER s) for the DN . The proposed VVO model contains the second-order conic relaxed form of the AC power flow equations. Thus, the presented VVO problem is a Mixed-Integer Second-Order Cone Programming (MISOCP) problem. To obtain the ability to support the DN , Smart Inverters ( SI s) are utilized to connect EV s and PV systems to the DN . Thus, to add the PV and EV systems to the convexified form of the VVO problem, the P-Q characteristics and the model of SI s working at different operating points are presented based on experimental results. The proposed model of SI s allows the participation of DER s in the reactive power compensation to mitigate voltage issues of DN due to utilizing high penetration level EV s. Besides, the proposed model of SI s enables DER s to increase their dispatchability. The performance of the proposed model is examined in the case studies using the IEEE 33-bus system and the 123-bus system. It is illustrated in the case studies that the solar dispatchability increases by 12% when the proposed volt/VAR model is utilized for IEEE 33-bus system. Besides, it is illustrated in the case studies that the voltage profile of buses remains in the desired operating range when the proposed model is leveraged, even if the penetration level of EV s increased to 40%.},

Practical consistency evaluation is significant for the management, equalization and maintenance of the battery system. Various evaluation methods have been developed over the past decades to better assess battery pack consistency. In these research efforts, the accuracy of the assessment results is often of paramount importance. In this work, a battery pack consistency evaluation approach is proposed based on multi-feature information fusion. Ohmic resistance, polarization resistance and open circuit voltage are identified as feature parameters from electric vehicle operation data. An adaptive forgetting factor recursive least squares (AFFRLS) algorithm is developed using fuzzy logic to modify the forgetting factor for parameter identification. Grey correlation analysis is applied to calculate the dispersion of features (DF). The DF is weighted to evaluate the inconsistency of the battery pack. Further, the weights are assigned through the CRITIC-G1 method. Moreover, a mapping model between the extracted voltage features and the DF is established through a cost-sensitive support vector machine (CS-SVM) algorithm, which is used to evaluate and predict the consistency distribution of battery parameters. Finally, the proposed algorithm is verified by experimental data. The results indicate that the proposed parameter identification, consistency evaluation and prediction methods have high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {For large-scale battery-swapping demands, reservations are utilized to effectively manage battery swapping. To achieve data security, one promising solution is heterogeneous signcryption (i.e. signature + encryption). However, existing heterogeneous signcryption cannot simultaneously support aggregation, batch verification, conditional privacy-preserving, bidirectional heterogeneous communication, and availability. Besides, to reduce the end-to-end delays, mobile edge computing (MEC) is introduced to reservations, so other challenge is to design an incentive mechanism to encourage mobile edge nodes (MENs) to transmit reservation messages. Seeking to address these challenges, we propose a reservation scheme with conditional privacy-preserving bidirectional heterogeneous aggregate signcryption and incentive mechanism, namely SecBS. More precisely, in status publication (i.e. SecBS-SP), electric vehicles (EVs) obtain status messages released by battery swapping stations (BSSs) via MENs, which is realized via heterogeneous signcryption from certificateless cryptosystem (CLC) to identity-based cryptosystem (IBC). In the reservation (i.e. SecBS-R), under the incentive, MENs transmit reservations sent by EVs to BSSs, which is realized via heterogeneous signcryption from IBC to CLC. Finally, formally security proof and extensive simulations are carried out to manifest the security and feasibility of our SecBS.},

For practical application, time-varying delay from vehicular communication and edge/cloud computing has a critical influence on the vehicle control performance. To address this problem, this article focuses on the stability analysis and controller design for connected vehicles under time-varying delay at the cloud-based control architecture. Particularly, connected car-following control and connected path-following control are under consideration as specific examples, where the cloud-unit assigns the control commands. A general switched system model has been established for connected vehicle control, where time-varying delay is imposed on partial system states. For stability analysis, an improved stability condition is proposed for the switched system under general case of time-varying delay with less conservative property compared with existing work. Further, based on Markov process assumption on time-varying delay, a quantitative stability evaluation method is introduced.

  abstract     = {In this article, an asynchronous stochastic self-triggered distributed MPC (DMPC) control scheme is proposed for vehicular platoon systems under coupled state constraints and additive stochastic disturbance. In considered platoon systems, each vehicle broadcasts its predicted state as beacon information to its neighbouring vehicles through the vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET). To reduce the communication burden in the VANET, each vehicle proactively determines the next sampling time instant by solving the stochastic self-triggered DMPC problem at the sampling time instant. The self-triggered problem is formulated by utilizing local vehicle states and asynchronous beacon information from its neighbours. Consequently, the proposed scheme reduces the communication load dramatically in the VANET while maintaining a satisfactory control performance compared to periodic time-triggered stochastic DMPC. To handle the state coupling between vehicles, e.g., for collision avoidance or communication connectivity purpose, probabilistic coupled state constraints are incorporated into the DMPC problem. Based on the information on stochastic disturbance, the probabilistic coupled state constraints are transformed into deterministic forms using the stochastic tube-based method. Theoretical analysis has shown that closed-loop platooning is quadratically stable at triggering time instants. Numerical examples illustrate the efficacy of the proposed control method in terms of data transmission reduction.},

The high nonlinearity of chassis dynamics and multi-actuator integrated control underlying this task is intractable, and this paper aims to address this crucial issue. We propose a chassis domain method of trajectory tracking based on the game-theoretical paradigm for automated vehicles. Unlike most prevailing studies which mainly focused on lateral control for path tracking, the proposed approach develops a unified control architecture to provide optimal tracking commands to longitudinal and lateral dynamic motions. Global chassis execution with fully adjustable chassis actuators called chassis domain control in this paper has dramatic potential to handle complex mobility situations in an efficient and flexible manner. This work develops a game-theoretical chassis domain approach to track both longitudinal and lateral trajectory profiles. The approach defines all chassis actuators as a set of players with associated objectives. Then it formulates a game-theoretical optimal problem to optimize multiple objectives including longitudinal tracking, lateral tracking, and vehicle handling dynamics. Various experimental tests are carried out, and the results suggest the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed chassis domain approach.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous Vehicles have wide-ranging applications in off-road environments. Off-road vehicular scenes can be abstracted as multi-agent systems, and trajectory prediction is a critical process for context understanding. Agents compete and cooperate other to pursue their individual targets, which makes trajectories complicated and changeable. Hence, in order to derive precise predictions, it is necessary to reason how agents interact with each other. However, current prediction algorithms lack a unified and appropriate method for spatiotemporal reasoning. Previous methods mainly rely on vehicle-lane constraints to capture features, which is only applicable in structured environments. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel off-road multi-agent trajectory prediction framework called SA-LSTM. This framework comprises situation awareness extraction and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) prediction backbones. Based on the analysis of agents’ movement patterns, we decompose actions into the maintenance of previous movements and the strategy variations in response to environment situations. In situation awareness extraction, risk field and pooling layers are applied to filter interpretable awareness. As for prediction backbones, proper LSTM networks are selected to adapt the task features. In short-term predictions, a residual mechanism is used to preserve physical inertia, while for long-term predictions autoregression process is applied. We also establish a multi-agent dataset based on human-manipulated chase-and-run tasks to train and validate the performance of SA-LSTM. Experiments show that compared with the best baseline model at each prediction length, SA-LSTM reduces the mean absolute error by 7.27%, 32.99%, and 28.07% at the prediction time of 0.6, 3.0, and 6.0 seconds, respectively, proving better prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Accurate short-term ride-sourcing demand prediction is vital for transportation operations, planning, and policy-making. With the models developed from data based on individual ride-sourcing companies to the joint models with data from multiple ride-sourcing companies, the prediction performance of the proposed models is enhanced significantly. However, the privacy issues of these models become a problem. Raw data collected from individual companies could cause business concerns and data privacy issues. In this article, we propose a Federated Learning (FL) based framework for traffic demand prediction (FedTDP), to solve this problem without sacrificing the prediction performance. In our framework, the model can encapsulate the spatial and temporal correlation of traffic demand data via LSTM and GCN respectively. Moreover, by associating FL with the spatio-temporal model, no raw data is uploaded to the centralized server, and only model parameters are required. Furthermore, a Shapley value-based reward mechanism is proposed to evaluate the contribution of ride-sourcing companies and can be used as a means to distribute rewards accordingly. Finally, a real-world case study of Hangzhou City, China, is conducted. More than 16 million real-world ride-sourcing requests collected from 8 ride-sourcing companies are used, covering most of the ride-sourcing travel demand across the city. The case study shows that the FL-based spatio-temporal model outperforms several well-established prediction models while preserving data privacy. It demonstrates the effectiveness and potential of our proposed framework. Some discussions related to the real-world implementations of the Shapley value-based reward mechanism are also given in the article.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in military warfare, and realizing safely autonomous motion control (AMC) in complex unknown environments is a challenge to face. In this article, we formulate the AMC problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose an advanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method that allows UAVs to execute complex tasks in different environments. Aiming to overcome the limitations of the prioritized experience replay (PER), the proposed asynchronous curriculum experience replay (ACER) uses multithreads to asynchronously update the priorities and assigns the true priorities to increase the diversity of experiences. It also applies a temporary pool to enhance learning from new experiences and changes the fashion of experience pool to first-in-useless-out (FIUO) to make better use of old experiences. In addition, combined with curriculum learning (CL), a more reasonable training paradigm is designed for ACER to train UAV agents smoothly. By training in a large-scale dynamic environment constructed based on the parameters of a real UAV, ACER improves the convergence speed by 24.66% and the convergence result by 5.59% compared to the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm. The testing experiments carried out in environments with different complexities further demonstrate the strong robustness and generalization ability of the ACER agents.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicle platoons are emerging as a promising solution to modern urban governance challenges, such as traffic congestion, air pollution, and fuel waste. As a data-driven paradigm, ensuring secure data sharing is a key challenge for autonomous vehicle platoon applications. However, existing research on secure data sharing of autonomous vehicles platoon suffers from practical weaknesses such as privacy leakage, lack of flexible data source identification, and inefficiency. Motivated by that, this article first proposes the LFBA scheme, which is the first fine-grained data sharing framework that supports bilateral access control and access policy hiding with lightweight and almost constant computational and storage resources consumption, this can be owed to the sophisticated algorithm structure we designed. We then construct an edge-assisted deployment model over LFBA (EA-LFBA) to further improve efficiency and security against common attacks. We then provide the security proof for LFBA, and security analysis for EA-LFBA. Simulation tests and comparative experiments demonstrate the practicality and superiority of our solution compared to state-of-the-art representative works.},

Rule-based decision-making methods provide a powerful solution with better interpretability. However, various hand-crafted rules may result in conflicts and poor scalability issues. To overcome this problem, this work proposes a hierarchical decision-making framework called State-Event-Condition-Action (SECA), which integrates the finite state machine and event-condition-action frameworks. This framework provides three products for system design: the SECA model–an abstract model of rules; the SECA state chart–a graphical visualization of rules; and the SECA rule description–a machine-readable format for practical deployment. The SECA framework offers several advantages, including convenient deployment, high efficiency, better logicality, and scalability. Simulation results demonstrate that the SECA framework enables autonomous decision-making in air confrontation scenarios and outperforms the event-condition-action framework in terms of computational time and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, the generalization test in robot navigation tasks verifies its potential applicability to other domains with different background knowledge.},

  abstract     = {With the advancement of chassis technology, a distributed driving six-wheel steering commercial vehicle chassis (DD-6WS CVC) became useful for enhancing traffic efficiency and facilitating rapid emergency rescue. In the face of harsh, complex working conditions and multiple unknown disturbances, the difficulty of research is determining how to comprehensively integrate the benefits of various subsystems to improve the stability of dynamics. Based on the dynamic model of the DD-6WS CVC, a coupled active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) is designed to improve the robustness of path tracking in emergency obstacle avoidance. First, the preview path information is optimized by the tracking differentiator (TD), and then the six-wheel steering control quantity is computed using model predictive control (MPC). Using the extended state observer (ESO), the total lateral disturbance is estimated and compensated. Second, the heading state quantity and disturbance estimation value are incorporated into the nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control (NFT-SMC) so that the direct yaw moment control (DYC) can achieve yaw stability in real time. Finally, the optimal distribution of six-wheel drive torque is completed. Experiments validate the algorithm&#39;s effectiveness and high robustness under multiple coupling disturbance. The results demonstrate that, in comparison to MPC and the linear quadratic regulator (LQR), the proposed algorithm has superior control characteristics and effectively enhances the robustness of the DD-6WS CVC in-phase steering path tracking.},

  abstract     = {Swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being explored as viable options for a variety of missions. However, extremely dynamic and rapidly changing environmental conditions such as wind prevent UAVs from maintaining a minimum safe distance and cause them to lose Connectivity. Furthermore, the UAVs near the swarm&#39;s edge will be more sensitive to connectivity failure. This study presents a thorough examination of the impact of wind on the connectivity of a large-scale swarm. The correlation between the number of UAVs needed to sustain swarm connectivity and characteristics like UAV speed, mass, wind speed, and drag force is also explored. From the results, the number of UAVs that do not maintain the minimum safe distance are seen to increase with increasing absolute value difference between the UAV and wind speed. Moreover, the number of critical UAVs is seen to decrease as the speed of UAVs increases relative to the mean wind speed for the same percentage of change in distance relative to the expected distance to be covered with the flight speed. Extending on these findings, a novel algorithm for updating UAV locations in a swarm in a constantly changing environment is also provided in order to maintain intra-UAV connectivity between individual UAV&#39;s. In this regard, a thorough examination of the impact of flying and maneuvering tactics selection is offered. As a result of comprehensive study, the proposed approach for updating UAV locations in uncertain conditions obtained a reduction in average outage probability of around 35%, 10%, and 40% using three distinct approaches, respectively, in contrast to earlier efforts. In addition, as compared to previous techniques, the proposed algorithm produced a smoother flight path with less jitters.},

Real-time inference on power- or memory-constrained devices would expedite the progress of autonomous driving. In this paper, a lightweight stereo matching network is proposed to simultaneously achieve high accuracy and fast inference time. A novel feature extractor using patch embeddings for downsampling together with a peculiar pyramidal strategy is proposed to obtain accurate disparity maps with less computational resources. By constructing the cost volume with the proposed group-wise L1 distance, the measured feature similarity is represented faster and more efficiently compared to the group-wise correlation. A lightweight 3D aggregation network with less 3D convolutions is proposed to further improve the accuracy and inference time. In addition, TensorRT optimizer approach is employed to improve the inference speed of the model. Exhaustive experiments on KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015 datasets demonstrate that our model has the ability to execute in real-time on resource-constrained devices, achieving higher frame rates than contemporary state-of-the-art networks. Our pipeline can process 1232 × 368 resolution images within the speed range of 33.8-73.5 frames per second on NVIDIA Jetson Nano with TensorRT optimization, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

This study proposed a real-time deep reinforcement learning based hierarchical eco-driving control strategy to optimally control a connected and automated hybrid electric vehicle in a traffic scenario with multiple constraints. The speed optimization layer of the proposed strategy employs a twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) based reference speed planning strategy to compute the optimized speed, based on a pre-trained optimal policy and observed environmental states. Specifically, to learn the optimal policy, a multi-objective reward function is designed that integrates fuel consumption reward and shaping reward involving car-following and road speed limit. Additionally, a rule-based competition-decision model is embedded within the speed optimization layer to ensure compliance with traffic light rules. In the vehicle controller layer, a real-time controller is implemented to specify appropriate actuator variables for the hybrid powertrain to track the reference speed and conduct energy management control. Simulation results show that the proposed TD3 based eco-driving strategy achieves remarkable energy saving performance by optimizing the speed. Besides, the proposed eco-driving strategy is capable of satisfying the constraint of diverse traffic scenarios, including car-following and traffic light, while also being computationally lightweight.},

Firstly, the optimal lane decision method is proposed via the conditional proximal policy optimization algorithm to optimize the traffic flow of each lane and avoid local congestion in heterogeneous traffic. Then, considering travel time, energy consumption, and emission, the eco-friendly merging optimization problem is established to optimize vehicles’ longitudinal velocity. According to the optimal lane and the optimal longitudinal velocity profile, the lateral end-point and longitudinal end-point of the local trajectory are solved for planning the local trajectory of the vehicles. Each vehicle tracks its local trajectory, realizing eco-friendly on-ramp merging. Compared with two existing ramp merging methods, results show that the proposed algorithm can mitigate local congestion effectively, and has superiority in traffic efficiency, energy economy, and eco-friendliness.},

Active tracking of non-cooperative objects in space was a good application example, which has important implications for the exploration of the space environment. Datasets of the space objects are difficult to collect, thus traditional machine learning is difficult to complete space tasks, which needs train from scratch, sufficient datasets and lots of training time. Thus, we propose a PID based for Meta-Learning method for space non-cooperative active object tracking, which overcome the shortcoming of few space datasets, and save a lot of training time. We incorporate PID into the meta-learning algorithm, past and change information of gradients to update the meta-learning parameters, and reducing greatly the overshoot problem of meta-learning and accelerating the optimization process of meta-learning. Our algorithm can help train a better initialized active object tracking model due to the differentiation and integration of gradients, which can retain more information and improve stability. Our PID based meta-learning method was based on reinforcement learning, which can help achieve automated and optimal object tracking. The initial model of our method can track a wide variety of objects without train from scratch.

Numerical results reveal that the building layout has a clear impact on the root mean square (RMS) DS. The significance of this work is twofold: 1) Architects need to consider DS gain when designing buildings to avoid severe inter-symbol interference (ISI) due to large DS gain; 2) Wireless network researchers and engineers can use DS gain and related fast and accurate calculation methods to guide wireless systems design to combat ISI.},

  abstract     = {The use of traditional methods in anomaly detection of multi-class ship trajectories showed some limitations in terms of robustness and learning ability of trajectory features. In view of this, an anomaly detection model for ship trajectory data based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) is proposed in this study using an unsupervised classification method. The proposed model modifies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by changing the inferential distribution of prior distribution and approximate posterior to the Gaussian mixture model. A high-dimensional hidden space is constructed to learn the features of multi-class trajectory data, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is applied to measure the error between the reconstructed trajectory and the original trajectory in order to judge whether the ship trajectory is abnormal. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from the US coastal areas are used to verify the proposed model, and the results are compared with other commonly used models in a manually labeled dataset. The research results indicate that the detection rate of the proposed model is 91.26%, and the false alarm rate is 0.68%, which performs the best. Using the Gaussian mixture model to describe the distribution of hidden space can improve the learning ability of multi-class trajectories of VAE, thus increasing the robustness of the model. This research can provide technical support for ship trajectory data analysis and risk management of maritime transportation.},

  abstract     = {The adoption of large-scale antenna arrays at high-frequency bands is widely envisioned in the beyond 5G wireless networks. This leads to the near-field regime where the wavefront is no longer planar but spherical, bringing new opportunities and challenges for communications and positioning. In this article, we improve the near-field positioning technology from the classical spherical wavefront model (SWM) to the more accurate and true electromagnetic propagation model (EPM). A generic near-field positioning model with different observation capabilities for three electric field types ( vector , scalar , and overall scalar electric field ) is developed based on the complete EPM. For these three observed electric field types, the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) is adopted to evaluate the achievable estimation accuracy. The expressions of the CRBs for different electric field observations are derived by combining electromagnetic propagation concepts with estimation theory. Closed-form expressions can be further obtained as the terminal is assumed to be on the central perpendicular line (CPL) of the receiving antenna surface. Moreover, the above discussions are extended to the system with multiple receiving antennas. In this case, the CRBs using various electric field types are derived and the effect of different numbers of receiving antennas is deeply investigated. Numerical results are provided to quantify the CRBs and validate the analytical results. Also, the impact of different system parameters, including electric field type, wavelength, size of the receiving antenna, and number of antennas, is evaluated.},

  abstract     = {In Internet of Things (IoT)-based federated learning (FL), if IoT devices are located far from the base station (BS), they consume lots of energy to transmit the updated parameters to BS, which can cause energy depletion of IoT devices. To mitigate this problem, IoT devices can be clustered and the clustered IoT devices transmit the updated parameters to their cluster headers (CHs) instead of BS. However, if the aggregated data distribution in each cluster is non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID), the desired accuracy of the model cannot be achieved. In this paper, we propose an energy and distribution-aware cooperative clustering algorithm (EDA-CCA) where several IoT devices with a sufficient energy level are selected as CHs. By considering the distance to these CHs and BS and the data distribution of IoT devices, other IoT devices are clustered, and then a hierarchical parameter aggregation (i.e., sequential aggregation within each cluster and synchronous aggregation between CHs and FL server) is conducted. Evaluation results demonstrate that EDA-CCA can make the model having the desired accuracy with the lowest energy consumption among the comparison schemes.},

To solve this challenge, we firstly design the vehicular MEC network in a non-competitive environment by maximizing the profit of the ES with a predetermined threshold of user QoE, and jointly exploit the caching and computing resources in the network. We then model the optimization problem into a binary integer programming problem, and adopt the cross entropy (CE) method to obtain the effective offloading and caching decision with a low complexity. Simulation results are finally presented to verify that the proposed scheme can achieve the near optimal performance of the conventional branch and bound (BnB) scheme, while sharply reduce the computational complexity compared to the BnB.},

Albeit traditional methods achieve moving target localization with antenna parameter errors, they still have some disadvantages, such as the high computational complexity of joint localization or the high noise sensitivity of estimating the target parameters. To overcome the drawbacks of existing algorithms, we first formulate a new localization model that joint target and antenna localization with a calibration object and then present an algebraic solution. Unlike previous work, the proposed estimator has additional unknowns of antenna parameter errors and presents new matrix equations by incorporating the calibration measurements. The proposed method is shown theoretically to attain the Cramer–Rao lower bound (CRLB) accuracy both in theory and simulations under small measurement noise and antenna error levels. Furthermore, simulation results show that the proposed method significantly improves the localization performance compared with existing methods.},

Additionally, the components of the total energy expenditure of the MEC system supporting collaborative task offloading are complex, necessitating appropriate resource allocation and offloading strategies to minimize the system&#39;s total energy consumption. To address these challenges, we propose a computing resource sharing auction (CRSA) algorithm to motivate idle users to participate in task offloading. Then, we establish a non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to minimize the total energy consumed by the system. By utilizing the McCormick and continuous relaxation (CR) approaches, we develop a low-complexity resource allocation algorithm.

This paper proposes a uniform standard of equivalent UE-BS distance for deciding HOs with IRS cascaded channels, where the reference signal from the serving BS is reflecting beamformed while the reference signals from the neighboring BSs are randomly scattered due to the IRS being occupied. Specifically, the geometric point set of possible BS locations satisfying the HO condition is revised via the equivalent UE-BS distance. In addition, the IRS reselection affects the cascaded channel gain and HO decision, so the distribution of UE-IRS distance is modified with the correlation of UE location in unit time. The compact expression of HO probability in IRS-aided networks is obtained and the effect of the degree of IRS distributed deployment on HO is studied. The results show that there exists an optimal distributed deployment factor that minimizes the HO probability, which decreases by 59.6% compared to networks without IRSs when the density of BS is &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$10^{3}/\rm {km^{2}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , the IRS serving distance is &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$20\rm {m}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; and the number of IRS elements per cell is 100.},

  abstract     = {For optical wireless communication, laser-based free-space optical communication (FSO) has high energy utilization efficiency and speed, but is easily blocked and cannot support multiple users. Visible light communication (VLC) based on light-emitting diode (LED) can support multiple mobile users, but has low energy efficiency in long-distance communication. Aiming at the above problems, this article proposes an OIRS-assisted cascaded FSO-VLC system. In this system, we adopt a FSO link with OIRSs at the front end. Multiple OIRSs are utilized to screen the optimal channel, thereby improving the flexibility and robustness of the system. The VLC link is used in the back end to support multi-user mobile communication. By jointly considering atmospheric turbulence, pointing error, OIRS&#39;s physical model and VLC geometric model, the closed-form solutions of the system&#39;s precise outage probability, asymptotic outage probability and BER have been derived. It is shown through numerical results that the derivation results are accurate. We can observe that both the increase of VLC source&#39;s coverage radius in VLC link and the decrease of pointing error in FSO link can effectively improve the system performance. Based on theoretical analysis and simulation results, the effect of each parameter and system design have been discussed.},

  abstract     = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a promising technique to overcome the explosive increase in the demand for high-speed data, quality of service and energy efficiency for fifth generation (5G) and beyond wireless systems. Low-complexity symbol detection in massive MIMO is one of the challenging issues for their practical realization. The existing approximate matrix inversion based and matrix inversion less iterative symbol detection techniques suffer significant performance loss when the number of users increases in the system. Therefore, this article proposes a low-complexity restricted search space exploration based ordered iterative detection (REOD) technique to achieve superior performance in large user massive MIMO systems. The proposed low-complexity REOD technique iteratively prunes the discrepancy term associated with the previous estimation and further explores an improved estimate confined to a predefined search space. Convergence of the proposed REOD technique is analytically justified. An analytical expression for the approximate upper bound on the bit error rate is derived and corroborated by simulations. The obtained results prove the viability of the proposed REOD technique compared to the several existing state-of-the-art uplink massive MIMO detection techniques, both in terms of error performance and computational complexity.},

While download time can be shortened either by increasing the data download rate, or by reducing the data size via on-board computation, the optimal trade-off between the two parts is still an open question. In this letter, the joint optimization of on-board computation and communication is studied to minimize the download time under realistic energy constraint. To decouple computation from communication, we first derive the exact expressions for the optimal computation frequency and transmit power based on a given computation strategy. As the resulting univariate optimization problem is an implicit one, we develop a Dinkelbach-like algorithm that iterates between solving a simplified explicit parametric problem to find a candidate strategy, and updating the parameter to approach the optima. The proposed scheme reduces at least 33.3% download time compared with conventional strategies, and the advantage becomes more significant under stringent energy constraint.},

Specifically, the cooperative UAV can adjust its jamming power and trajectory to exactly control the transmission rate of the suspicious link, thus improving the monitor vessel&#39;s surveillance performance. Furthermore, since the cooperative UAV cannot land or replenish energy on the sea surface, its jamming power allocation on the ocean should be carefully designed by the energy thresholds. Under such setup, we formulate a sum eavesdropping rate maximization problem, which jointly optimizes the jamming power and three-dimensional (3D) trajectory of the cooperative UAV, as well as the two-dimensional (2D) trajectory of the monitor vessel. To address this non-convex optimization problem, we decompose the design problem into three subproblems and propose an iterative algorithm to find its suboptimal solution.

In reality, due to the mobility of users, the stationary RIS might not provide a persistent LoS link. In such cases, RIS on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV-RIS) can provide a reliable LoS link since it is operated at a high altitude. In this paper, we propose a two-stage channel estimation technique for the UAV-RIS communication systems. Key idea of the proposed scheme is to decompose the UAV-RIS reflected channel into two components: slow-varying angles and fast-varying path gains, and then estimate these components in different time scales. Further, by configuring phase shift vectors for the UAV-RIS reflected channel estimation, we can improve the channel estimation accuracy. In doing so, the proposed scheme can accurately estimate the channel while minimizing the pilot overhead. From the simulation results, we demonstrate that the TUCE-PS significantly improves the NMSE over the conventional channel estimation techniques.},

Firstly, a coordinate graph (CG) model is adopted to characterize the topology structure and resource distribution of LEO satellite networks. Then, an E2E minimum-hop area is determined based on CG model, so that a minimum-hop binary tree (MHBT) is constructed. Finally, the pruning traversal of MHBT is performed to obtain all minimum-hop paths, based on which the E2E path with the shortest delay is determined. Simulation results show that the proposed routing algorithm not only reduces the path delay, but also improves the file delivery ratio.},

  abstract     = {This article considers a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) enhanced multi-antenna secure transmission system in the presence of both active eavesdroppers (AEves) and passive eavesdroppers (PEves). We propose a zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming strategy that can steer transmit beam to the null space of AEves&#39; channel, while simultaneously enhancing the SNRs for a legitimate user equipment (UE) and PEves without perfect channel state information (CSI). The design goal is to maximize the SNR of UE subject to the transmit power constraint at the BS, SNR limitations on PEves, and reflection constraints at RIS. Due to the complexity of modeling, we first introduce a homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP) to imitate the distribution of spatially random PEves, which derives a complicated non-convex problem. We then develop an efficient alternating algorithm where the transmit beamforming vector and the reflective beamforming vector are obtained by convex-concave procedure (CCP) and semi-definite relaxation (SDR) technique, respectively. Simulation results validate the performance advantages of the proposed optimized design.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning (DL)-based channel state information (CSI) feedback methods compressed the CSI matrix by exploiting its delay and angle features straightforwardly, while the measure in terms of information contained in the CSI matrix has rarely been considered. Based on this observation, we introduce self-information as an informative CSI representation from the perspective of information theory, which reflects the amount of information of the original CSI matrix in an explicit way. Then, a novel DL-based network is proposed for temporal CSI compression in the self-information domain, namely SD-CsiNet. The proposed SD-CsiNet projects the raw CSI onto a self-information matrix in the newly-defined self-information domain, extracts both temporal and spatial features of the self-information matrix, and then couples these two features for effective compression. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed SD-CsiNet by exploiting the self-information of CSI. Particularly for compression ratios &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$1/8$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$1/16$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , the SD-CsiNet respectively achieves 7.17 dB and 3.68 dB performance gains compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

However, the ever-growing massive number of devices in RIS-empowered IoT networks requires achieving energy self-sustainability for the entire network. Motivated by this, a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer system empowered by a wireless-powered RIS has been investigated under the condition of imperfect channel state information, in which both the RIS and zero-energy devices (ZEDs) harvest energy with the power-splitting (PS) scheme for their operation. Specifically, a non-convex transmit power minimizing problem is formulated to handle the power-limited issue of practical IoT networks, where the PS ratios of the ZEDs, the active beamforming of the access point and RIS reflective coefficients are jointly optimized and solved by an efficient alternating optimization framework. The improved performance of the proposed algorithm against the benchmark schemes and its robustness are verified by simulation results, which highlight the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in practical IoT networks.},

Firstly, the information transmission vehicles (ITVs) would be picked following the reputation value and its associated environmental data that makes the choice more comprehensive and objective than other mechanisms. Secondly, the authenticity of sharing information is determined with the help of Bayesian inference, aided by the reputation value of message reporting vehicles (MRVs).

  abstract     = {Vehicles in Internet of Vehicles must constantly broadcast basic safety messages to keep other vehicles informed of their location, speed, and other parameters. Attackers can use the content of these messages to follow the path of the vehicle and invade vehicle owner privacy. Vehicle location privacy was ensured by broadcasting these messages using pseudonyms and periodically changing these pseudonyms. However, in mix-zone-based strategies, vehicles are frequently restricted from changing their pseudonyms in specific places. Furthermore, most previous change strategies only safeguarded against the syntactic linking attack and did not account for the semantic linking attack. Thus, in this study, we proposed a broadcast and silence period pseudonym change strategy to overcome these difficulties. Mix zones were obtained by analyzing the locations where vehicles frequently stop. The vehicle broadcasts or silences in a mix zone according to our broadcast and silence period strategy and changes to the pseudonym assigned by the road side unit during the silence phase until it leaves the zone. Our safety analysis and experimental results indicate that the broadcast and silence period prevent both linking attacks while reducing the impact of radio silence on vehicle safety by limiting the silent time, thereby providing better location privacy protection for vehicles compared with the existing schemes. In addition, the number of signatures required to be verified each time it receives messages and the overhead incurred in changing pseudonyms for vehicles is acceptable.},

However, the dynamic nature of STN presents two challenges to the quality of experience (QoE): 1) the dynamic topology in different time slots; 2) the dynamic path planning for each user. These raise unique problems for the optimization of data delivery paths in STN with service continuity guarantee. In this article, we first model the STN by a time-varying graph to describe the data delivery in a certain service duration. An indicator called user satisfaction is constructed to measure delivery performance. Aiming at maximizing total user satisfaction, we reformulate the STN path planning problem by utilizing the spatial-temporal decomposition. Considering the path planning in each time slot, we modify the heuristic algorithm to optimize the allocation of transmission resources for different users. In the temporal dimension, we show that the path allocation results in previous time slots directly affect subsequent path calculation then propose an active time slot division algorithm to improve the STN service continuity. Excellent STN transmission performance is matched to the best fit time slot duration to obtain efficient and continuous data delivery. Experimental results show that the proposed STN data delivery optimization scheme achieves superior transmission performance with better service continuity.},

In this article, we investigate a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-aided ISAC system in which the ISAC base station utilizes NOMA to serve multiple NOMA-users while performing radar sensing towards a group of sensing targets by leveraging the superimposed NOMA signals for NOMA-users. To investigate this problem, we formulate a joint optimization of the beamforming, the NOMA transmission duration and the sensing scheduling of sensing targets, with the objective of maximizing the sensing efficiency (i.e., the number of sensed targets within a time-interval) of ISAC system, while satisfying both the communication quality requirement of each NOMA-user and the sensing quality requirement of each selected target. Despite that the formulated joint optimization problem is strictly non-convex, we propose a decomposition-based algorithm for solving the problem. Specifically, we exploit the successive convex approximation and penalty function method to equivalently transform the problem of optimizing the beamforming into a convex problem which can be addressed efficiently. Furthermore, with the optimal beamforming, we leverage the monotonic feature and adopt a bisection-search method to determine the NOMA transmission duration. Finally, we utilize an algorithm based on the cross-entropy learning to compute the optimal sensing scheduling. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and show the performance advantage of our NOMA-aided ISAC system.

This article proposes a reliable proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based concurrent multipath transfer mechanism (RpCMT) that can reduce retransmission probability, as a consequence, achieves low latency and high throughput. In particular, RpCMT employs in-network telemetry (INT)-based network-aware transmission control algorithm to make dynamical multipath transfer control depending on the link conditions. To generate precise transfer control policy, we formulate multipath flow scheduling as a minimization problem that considers both the link bandwidth utilization and transmission queuing length. Then, we propose a PPO-based multipath transfer policy updating algorithm to obtain the optimized control policy. Finally, we build a P4-based prototype system in which RpCMT is implemented to make experimental analysis. Experimental results show that RpCMT outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions, e.g. , weighted random routing (W-Random) and link weighted based ECMP (W-ECMP), in terms of the retransmission rate, throughput, and round-trip time.},

  abstract     = {Semantic communication technologies enable wireless edge devices to communicate effectively by transmitting semantic meanings of data. Edge components, such as vehicles in next-generation intelligent transport systems, use well-trained semantic models to encode and decode semantic information extracted from raw and sensor data. However, the limitation in computing resources makes it difficult to support the training process of accurate semantic models on edge devices. As such, edge devices can buy the pretrained semantic models from semantic model providers, which is called “semantic model trading”. Upon collecting semantic information with the semantic models, the edge devices can then sell the extracted semantic information, e.g., information about urban road conditions or traffic signs, to the interested buyers for profit, which is called “semantic information trading”. To facilitate both types of the trades, effective incentive mechanisms should be designed. Thus, in this article, we propose a hierarchical trading system to support both semantic model trading and semantic information trading jointly. The proposed incentive mechanism helps to maximize the revenue of semantic model providers in the semantic model trading, and effectively incentivizes model providers to participate in the development of semantic communication systems. For semantic information trading, our designed auction approach can support the trading between multiple semantic information sellers and buyers, while ensuring individual rationality, incentive compatibility, and budget balance, and moreover, allowing them to achieve higher utilities than the baseline method.},

An UAV inspection model is built to clarify the criteria for successful inspection, which is related to the UAV&#39;s 3D positions and velocity. The proposed UAV trajectory design involves two steps. First, the PoIs in proximity are grouped by convex optimization. Then, the multiple UAV trajectories are jointly designed by solving a multiple traveling salesman problem (MTSP). Numerical results show that the proposed design can significantly reduce the multi-UAV cooperative video inspection time, which enables swift response and efficient planning for post-disaster rescue.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by connected vehicles, the internet of vehicles (IoV) has a prosperous development, thus a variety of IoV applications have emerged, which causes the dramatic growth of data traffic and content request, thus affecting the quality of service (QoS) of IoV. Edge caching can effectively improve the QoS by caching the contents in the road side unit (RSU) near the requester. Moreover, most existing IoV caching strategies only consider that the content popularity has temporal correlation or assume that the content popularity is given, which will impact the accuracy of content popularity. In this article, we propose a spatial-temporal correlation approach to predict the content popularity, which can improve the accuracy of the content popularity by the spatial-temporal correlation analyzing of the RSU historical content requests. Then, we introduce a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) caching strategy based on the result of prediction, where each RSU agent individually chooses the action with the constraint of caching resources and updates the action to maximize the cumulative reward. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed caching strategy has better performance. Take the Zipf parameter is 0.8 as an example, compared with the probability caching scheme (PCS), the proposed caching strategy improves the caching hit ratio by 15% and reduces the delay by 34%.},

Considering that the learning performance heavily depends on the active participation of EDs, it is essential to motivate the resource-limited EDs to contribute their efforts to learning tasks. In this paper, a learning-based multi-task FEL mechanism is proposed to design the economic incentive and participation contribution strategy jointly. Specifically, the incentive-based interaction between the edge servers and EDs is formulated as a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. Then, the theoretical analysis is provided to prove the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium. To obtain the equilibrium solution under the incomplete information, a Markov decision process is formulated for the two-stage Stackelberg game. Considering the high dimensionality of the continuous action space, a multi-agent double actors deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is employed to achieve the optimal training-ratio of EDs and the payment policies of edge servers.

However, existing HO models have not investigated HO performance of cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under the influence of shadow fading at different altitudes. This paper proposes a 3D boundary model derived by trigger conditions to analyze HO performance of aerial users considering the shadow fading effect in two-tier HetNets, where the 3D HO trigger boundary and handover failure (HF) boundary are both in the form of a hemispherical shell with typical small base station (SBS) as center, composed of the point sets corresponding to the above HO events, which are derived by the Received Signal Strength (RSS) ratio of target SBS to source macro base station (MBS). Especially, the calculation of HO events probabilities under trigger conditions are transformed to the relationship between time-to-trigger (TTT) and during time inside 3D boundary by exploring the positional relationship between straight line and hemispherical shell boundaries. Thus, the compact expressions of HO probability, HF probability and PP probability are obtained to quantify the effect of 3D mobility and HO parameters in various deployment of HetNets. Theoretical results show that HF and PP probability dramatically drop by 68.5% and 47.1% when &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$H=20$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; m comparing to scenario of terrestrial users and HetNets deployment should be considered when choosing appropriate HO parameters.},

Despite these advantages, co-channel and cross-channel interference and ultra-massive connectivity are major issues. To address these issues, we integrate the power domain non-orthogonal multiple access techniques (PD-NOMA) on the base station (BS). NOMA serves more than one user and reduces the effect of interference at cellular users (CUs) using the successive interference cancellation (SIC). The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) with associated resources and power constraints of the base station (BS) and D2D pairs (DDPs) with an aim to maximize the sum rate and fairness among the NOMA-enabled CUs and DDPs. We first used the centralized deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and arithmetic-geometric mean approximation (AGMA) technique to reduce cross-channel interference and control the power. Then, to provide fairness to all the users, we transformed the proposed solution into a distributed deep deterministic policy gradient (D3PG). Also, the successive approximation technique is then integrated into the D3PG to mitigate the effect of co-channel interference among DDPs. The experimental results reveal that the proposed scheme has 21.05%, 34.21%, and 49.8% higher sum rate and fairness in comparison to DDPG, Deep dueling, and DQN scheduling.},

  abstract     = {Densely deployed femtocells in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) improve the quality-of-service (QoS) and quality-of-experience (QoE) for both next-generation networks and end users, respectively. However, users near the femtocell edge, i.e., femto edge users (FEUs), which are far away from the Femto base station (FBS) may receive a low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Moreover, due to the distributed and dynamic nature of HetNets, femtocells may not resist various eavesdropping attacks from different attackers. Thus, it is essential to ensure the wireless channel&#39;s secrecy through which FEUs communicate with FBS since they may face eavesdropping attacks and may have low SINR and achievable data rates. Aiming to enhance the secrecy rate of femtocells, in this article, we formulate a joint optimization problem of beamforming vectors, artificial noise (AN), and power control for terahertz (THz)-enabled femtocells. Addressing this non-convex optimization problem is challenging due to the system&#39;s complexity and dynamic nature of FEUs. Thus, we translate the optimization problem into a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem using the Markov decision process (MDP). Then, to solve the MDP with continuous action space, two deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based schemes, i.e., Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient-based Secrecy Maximization (DDPG-SM) and Asynchronous-Advantage-Actor-Critic based Secrecy Maximization (A3C-SM) are proposed to maximize the secrecy rate of femtocells. The secrecy rate performance of the proposed schemes is compared and analyzed with Advantage-Actor-Critic (A2C) and state-of-the-art Perfect Secrecy Rate Maximization (PSRM) schemes. Simulation results show that the proposed A3C-SM and DDPG-SM schemes achieve 37.73% and 22.64% better average secrecy rate in comparison to the PSRM scheme. Also, A3C-SM scheme outperforms all other DDPG-SM , A2C, and PSRM schemes in terms of average secrecy rate, received SINR, and energy-efficiency of femtocells.},

Sharing road data among vehicles effectively can greatly improve their driving efficiency and road experience. This, however, is hindered by security concerns, bandwidth limitations, and mobility and communication distance between vehicles. In this article, we propose a citywide data sharing platform among vehicles based on the digital twin. Specifically, we propose a digital twin based vehicular platform on the cloud to facilitate the effective data sharing of vehicles. A digital twin is a digital representation of a vehicle on the cloud that synchronises data with the vehicle in real time. Therefore, data sharing among vehicles can be accomplished by their digital twins on the cloud without any physical limitations. Considering the data privacy of vehicles, a framework that combines federated learning and transfer learning is applied which can realise personalised data sharing among vehicles without disclosing their data privacy. An incentive mechanism based on the game-theoretic approach is devised to combat the mutual distrust between vehicles and encourage their contribution to data sharing. By sewing the above mechanisms, the proposed digital twin enabled data sharing platform can effectively address privacy, bandwidth limitation and incentive issues. Using extensive trace-driven simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system.},

With rapid development of ITS, the size and complexity of WSN is rapidly increasing. Thus, how to evaluate the reliability of large-scale WSN has attracted more and more attention. In this article, reliability is defined as the probability that the WSN is functional. A confident information coverage (CIC) model-based reliability algorithm (CICRA) is proposed to comprehensively consider coverage reliability and connectivity reliability. Especially, to determine the impact of failing nodes on connectivity in large-scale WSN, a grid clustering connectivity algorithm (GCCA) is proposed to reduce the complexity of computing the connectivity between large-scale wireless sensor nodes, which transforms the connectivity problem between nodes into a grid connectivity problem. In addition, a 3-order tensor modeling is proposed to uniformly represent and model node states, node combinations, and coverage patterns. Furthermore, the network reliability combines coverage reliability and connectivity reliability is evaluated by tensor modeling. Simulation results indicate that the proposed CICRA can improve the network reliability and accuracy of reliability evaluation.},

  abstract     = {The communications between vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) with high frequency, group sending, group receiving and periodic lead to serious collision of wireless resources and limited system capacity, and the rapid channel changes in high mobility vehicular environments preclude the possibility of collecting accurate instantaneous channel state information at the base station for centralized resource management. For the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), it is a fundamental challenge to achieve low latency and high reliability communication for real-time data interaction over short distances in a complex wireless propagation environment, as well as to attenuate and avoid inter-vehicle interference in the region through a reasonable spectrum allocation. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a resource allocation (RA) method using dueling double deep Q-network reinforcement learning (RL) with low-dimensional fingerprints and soft-update architecture (D3QN-LS) while constructing a multi-agent model based on a Manhattan grid layout urban virtual environment, with communication links between V2V links acting as agents to reuse vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) spectrum resources. In addition, we extend the amount of transmitted data in our work, while adding scenarios where spectrum resources are relatively scarce, i.e. the number of V2V links is significantly larger than the amount of spectrum, to compensate for some of the shortcomings in existing literature studies. We demonstrate that the proposed D3QN-LS algorithm leads to a further improvement in the total capacity of V2I links and the success rate of periodic secure message transmission in V2V links.},

This work considers vehicular fog computing scenarios where the clients of computation offloading services try to minimize their own costs while deciding which VFNs to offload their tasks. We focus on decentralized multi-agent decision-making in a repeated unknown game where each agent, e.g., service client, can observe only its own action and realized cost. In other words, each agent is unaware of the game composition or even the existence of opponents. We apply a completely uncoupled learning rule to generalize the decentralized decision-making algorithm presented in [7] for the multi-agent case. The multi-agent solution proposed in this work can capture the unknown offloading cost variations susceptive to resource congestion under an adversarial framework where each agent may take implicit cost estimation and suitable resource choice adapting to the dynamics associated with volatile supply and demand. According to the evaluation via simulation, this work reveals that such individual perturbations for robustness to uncertainty and adaptation to dynamicity ensure a certain level of optimality in terms of social welfare, e.g., converging the actual sequence of play with unknown and asymmetric attributes and lowering the correspondent cost in social welfare due to the self-interested behaviors of agents.},

Intra-platoon message broadcast delay (InPB-delay) is a critical metric that is used to measure the message delivery performance in a platoon of vehicles, where a V2V multi-hop broadcast mode is used for message delivery. In this article, we study the modeling and analyses of the InPB-delay for a platoon of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), which employs an IEEE 802.11p EDCA mechanism for channel access. A 2-D Markov chain model is first built to describe a backoff procedure of a platoon broadcasting node, which takes into account the four access categories of different priorities in the EDCA mechanism. Based on the Markov model, a theoretical performance model is further derived to investigate the impacts of major system parameters on the InPB-delay, taking into account the effects of both platoon vehicles and non-platoon vehicles. The derived performance model is validated through simulation results and the impacts of major system parameters are investigated through numerical results. The InPB-delay model can be used to provide reference values for system parameter settings in order to ensure the stable operation of a platoon.},

  abstract     = {The past decade has witnessed an explosive growth of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which have attracted great attention in assisting Internet of Vehicles (IoV) communication systems thanks to the advantages of cost-effectiveness, high maneuverability, and flexible deployment. Yet several issues, such as UAVs&#39; transmit power and energy resources as well as the high-speed mobility of IoV user equipment (VUE), pose challenges to the development of UAVs in UAV-assisted IoV. To provide reliable and high-throughput wireless links for VUEs in a given ground area, this article considers a scenario in which a ground VUE is facing difficulties in receiving service from a ground roadside unit (RSU) owing to possible sudden RSU malfunction or poor signal coverage. In this case, UAVs are generally deployed in the air, serving as relays to establish communication links between uncovered VUE and the neighboring RSU. To maximize the system capacity, we investigate the deployment problem of UAV relays under single-UAV relaying and multi-UAV relaying cases upon considering VUE mobility, and exploit the optimal deployment strategy of UAV relays under fixed total power consumption. Comprehensive simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm can outperform benchmark methods on significant critical indicators such as the average achievable user rate, and the outage probability. Also, evaluations and analyses have highlighted the effects of key system parameters (e.g., altitude, number, and transmit power of UAV relays) on optimal UAV relay deployment position and system performance.},

  abstract     = {Flexible resource management can be facilitated by recent drastic advances in software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) technologies. Most of recent studies on resource management have mainly focused on the independent optimization of network function and computing function on top of a single-layer SDN architecture. In this paper, we focus on networking and processing resource orchestration to enhance the performance of network/computing functions in a hierarchical cloud-edge-radio 5G network architecture. Specifically, we propose a dynamic resource management algorithm, namely RACER , to process network/computing functions by opportunistically exploiting a tradeoff between the characteristics of the cloud and edge with respect to the amount of available resources and transmission delay. Herein, we decompose an original long-term problem including complex decisions in all network layers (that is, cloud, edge, and radio) into spatio-temporal subproblems without loss of optimality by leveraging Lyapunov optimization. Then, we derive the RACER algorithm to find the decisions in each layer and each time slot. This online-fashioned algorithm is pragmatic because it not only exploits information obtained from instantaneous time slots, but also operates in a distributed manner with small message exchanges between the different layers. Moreover, we demonstrate the excellent performance improvement of the proposed dynamic and holistic RACER algorithm compared to static and independent policies in the 5G network environment.},

VEC servers located at Roadside Units (RSUs) allow low-power vehicles to offload computation-intensive and delay-sensitive applications, making it a promising solution. However, optimal resource allocation between edge servers is a complex issue due to vehicle mobility and dynamic data traffic. To address this issue, we propose a Lyapunov-based Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (L-MADDPG) method that jointly optimizes computing task distribution and radio resource allocation to minimize energy consumption and delay requirements. We evaluate the trade-offs between the performance of the optimization algorithm, queuing model, and energy consumption. We first examine delay, queue and energy models for task execution at the vehicle or RSU, followed by the L-MADDPG algorithm for jointly optimizing task offloading and resource allocation problems to reduce energy consumption without compromising performance. Our simulation results show that our algorithm can reduce energy consumption while maintaining system performance compared to existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Terahertz (THz) communications are envisioned to be a promising technology for 6G thanks to its broad bandwidth. However, the large path loss, antenna misalignment, and atmospheric influence of THz communications severely deteriorate its reliability. To address this, hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) is recognized as an effective technique to ensure reliable THz communications. This article delves into the performance analysis of HARQ with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR)-aided THz communications in the presence/absence of blockage. More specifically, the analytical expression of the outage probability of HARQ-IR-aided THz communications is derived, with which the asymptotic outage analysis is enabled to gain meaningful insights, including diversity order, power allocation gain, modulation and coding gain, etc. Then the long term average throughput (LTAT) is expressed in terms of the outage probability based on renewal theory. Moreover, to combat the blockage effects, a multi-hop HARQ-IR-aided THz communication scheme is proposed and its performance is examined. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme, the other two HARQ-aided schemes, i.e., Type-I HARQ and HARQ with chase combining (HARQ-CC), are used for benchmarking in the simulations. In addition, a deep neural network (DNN) based outage evaluation framework with low computational complexity is devised to reap the benefits of using both asymptotic and simulation results in low and high outage regimes, respectively. This novel outage evaluation framework is finally employed for the optimal rate selection, which outperforms the asymptotic based optimization.},

The underlying key tasks corresponding to these modules are training sequence optimization and transceiver optimization. Hence, we jointly optimize the linear transmit precoder and the training sequence of MIMO systems using the metrics of their effective mutual information (MI), effective mean squared error (MSE), effective weighted MI, effective weighted MSE, as well as their effective generic Schur-convex and Schur-concave functions. Both statistical channel state information (CSI) and estimated CSI are considered at the transmitter in the joint optimization. A unified framework termed as joint matrix-monotonic optimization is proposed. Based on this, the optimal precoder matrix and training matrix structures can be derived for both CSI scenarios. Then, based on the optimal matrix structures, our linear transceivers and their training sequences can be jointly optimized. Compared to state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms, the proposed algorithms visualize the bold explicit relationships between the attainable system performance of our linear transceivers conceived and their training sequences, leading to implementation ready recipes.

Cascaded channel estimation is transformed into sparse signal reconstruction problem, and compressed sensing (CS) is applied to solve this problem. Only a small amount of training overhead provides reliable channel estimation gains as well as better beamforming gains. Second order rectified parallel factor (PARAFA) model is implemented in IRS-assisted SWIPT system, which is described by tensor decomposition method. The received signal can be represented by PARAFA model with algebraic structure and IRS phase shift. Two cascaded channel estimation approaches, namely, bilinear alternating least squares (BALS) and least squares Khatri-Rao factorization (LSKRF), are proposed respectively.

With the presence of pilot contamination, under the assumption that the LOS path is known, the performance of the maximum ratio combining (MRC) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver is analyzed. By using the Use-and-then-Forget (UatF) bound, when data streams are arbitrarily allocated to transmit antennas and received by the MRC receiver, the closed-form expression of the system sum rate is derived. Then, under the assumption that the LOS path is unknown, the performance of the two receivers with spatial multiplexing is analyzed. According to the random matrix theory, when the MRC receiver is used and the total number of receive antennas tends to infinity, the closed-form expression of the system sum rate is derived. Based on the analysis, a general pilot-allocation scheme is proposed.

  abstract     = {Directional beamforming will play a paramount role in 5G and beyond networks to combat the higher path losses incurred at millimeter wave bands. Appropriate modeling and analysis of the angles and distances between transmitters and receivers in these networks are thus essential to understand performance and limiting factors. Most existing literature considers either infinite and uniform networks, where nodes are drawn according to a Poisson point process, or finite networks with the reference receiver placed at the origin of a disk. Under either of these assumptions, the distance and azimuth angle between transmitter and receiver are independent, and the angle follows a uniform distribution between 0 and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$2\pi$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; . Here, we consider a more realistic case of finite networks where the reference node is placed at any arbitrary location. We obtain the joint distribution between the distance and azimuth angle and demonstrate that these random variables do exhibit certain correlation, which depends on the shape of the region and the location of the reference node. To conduct the analysis, we present a general mathematical framework that is specialized to exemplify the case of a rectangular region. We also derive the statistics for the 3D case where, considering antenna heights, the joint distribution of distance, azimuth, and zenith angles is obtained. Finally, we describe some immediate applications of the present work, including the design of analog codebooks, wireless routing algorithms, and the analysis of directional beamforming, which is illustrated by analyzing the coverage probability of an indoor scenario considering misaligned beams.},

In this article, we propose a complementary coded identical code cyclic shift multiple access (CC-ICCSMA) system under asynchronous frequency selective fading channels, which allows multiple data streams to transmit in parallel by sharing one spreading code for improving the bandwidth efficiency. Considering the impact of interferences, we propose an ICCS matched filterbank to tackle the interferences, which can decode the data under all paths and achieve a high multipath diversity gain.

To protect the primary message from being decoded by an intelligent eavesdropper (Eve), a secondary user is picked as a friendly jammer that transmits artificial noise (AN) to the Eve. However, the intelligent Eve can detect the existence of AN, and thus the AN is inclined to be covertly transmitted at a lower detection probability, thereby mistaking the AN as background noise by the Eve. In this article, firstly, by using a binary hypothesis testing, the detection error probability (DEP) is explicitly derived for detection performance analysis of the Eve in the perfect as well as statistical channel state information (CSI) scenario, separately. With the DEP, a covert jamming scheme is formulated to transmit the AN in both cases. Then, an optimization problem is formulated, and then recast into a two-part problem to maximize the secrecy performance with the covert jamming scheme in the perfect CSI case. Finally, the effective secrecy throughput is maximized under convert constraints in the statistical CSI case.

For the frequency-domain RFF extraction, the cepstrum of the ZC sequence is calculated to enlarge the gap between the constant RFF and the random fading effects, and the correlation between two cepstrum fragments is then calculated to mitigate the random fading components. For the temporal RFF extraction, the ramp-on and ramp-off features induced by the device-specific power amplifier are extracted by exploiting the CP structure of the PRACH frame, where the CP part and the duplicate part are adaptively filtered and the final adapted weight of the least mean square filter is used as RFF. No prior PRACH parameter knowledge is required in RFF extraction and both the frequency-domain and the temporal RFF are combined as the input of the convolutional neural network to enhance the classification accuracy. With four-months sampling of PRACH signals emitted from universal software radio peripheral devices, the experimental results show that the authentication accuracy of the proposed combined RFF can reach as high as 99.9% in the line-of-sight (LOS) scenario and 99.6% in the non-LOS scenario.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of system parameter estimation using adaptive filter. Conventional adaptive algorithms will result in degraded performance in the presence of impulsive noise and biased estimation when the input signal is noisy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a robust bias-compensated least mean squares (R-BC-LMS) algorithm. It is derived by performing the maximum- a - posteriori estimation subject to a constraint on the squared norm of the weight vector difference, and then introducing an unbiasedness criterion to insert a bias compensation term in the update. Under common statistical assumptions, the mean and mean square behaviors of weight deviation are derived for the R-BC-LMS algorithm. In addition, we develop the estimator for the input and output noise variances. Simulations in channel estimation, vehicle handsfree echo cancellation, and direction-of-arrival estimation demonstrate that our method outperforms the competing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is a key enabler for future wireless communication systems. On the other hand, crosstalk is inevitable in the highly integrated large-scale antenna array. The nonlinearity of power amplifiers (PAs) coupled with crosstalk is much more complicated when the number of antennas is large. Digital predistortion (DPD) can compensate for the PA nonlinearity without sacrificing efficiency and is widely applied in both base stations and mobile devices. Extending existing solutions to the large-scale MIMO system usually suffers from performance degradation or greatly increased complexity. In this paper, we consider the nonlinearity with crosstalk for the large-scale MIMO scenario. A much simplified DPD model is proposed by ignoring the high-order crosstalk terms generated from the complete nonlinear model. Compared to existing solutions, the proposed DPD can compensate for both the nonlinear and linear crosstalk of the system. It achieves satisfactory linearization performance with much reduced computational complexity. The complexity of the proposed DPD is linearly related to the number of transmitter branches. Thus, it is scalable in the large-scale MIMO scenario. Moreover, the proposed DPD can be extended to the partially-connected hybrid beamforming system with crosstalk. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed DPD scheme.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we introduce the concept of partially-connected receiving reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (R-RISs), which refers to metasurfaces designed to efficiently sense electromagnetic waveforms impinging on them, and perform localization of the users emitting them. The presented R-RIS hardware architecture comprises subarrays of meta-atoms, with each of them incorporating a waveguide assigned to direct the waveforms reaching its meta-atoms to a reception radio-frequency (RF) chain, enabling signal/channel parameter estimation. We particularly focus on the scenarios where the user is located in the far-field of all the R-RIS subarrays, and present a three-dimensional (3D) localization method which is based on narrowband signaling and angle of arrival (AoA) estimates of the impinging signals at each single-receive-RF R-RIS subarray. For the AoA estimation, which relies on spatially sampled versions of the received signals via each subarray&#39;s phase configuration of meta-atoms, we devise an off-grid atomic norm minimization approach, which is followed by subspace-based root multiple signal classification (MUSIC). The AoA estimates are finally combined via a least-squared line intersection method to obtain the position coordinates of a user emitting synchronized localization pilots. Our derived theoretical Cramér Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) on the estimation parameters, which are compared with extensive computer simulation results of our localization approach, verify the effectiveness of the proposed R-RIS-empowered 3D localization system, which is showcased to offer cm-level positioning accuracy. Our comprehensive performance evaluations also demonstrate the impact of various system parameters on the localization performance, namely the training overhead and the distance between the R-RIS and the user, as well as the spacing among the R-RIS&#39;s subarrays and its partitioning patterns.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted wireless communications where the UAV acts as the aerial base station to provide downlink data service to the ground users. We consider a typical hot-spot scenario in which the ground users move towards the target points of interests (PoIs) in groups. The UAV can also fly in air to cope with the movement of users. To maximize the system throughput, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly determine the subchannel assignment, the trajectory of UAV and its power allocation per time slot, where the navigation power of UAV, the co-channel interference as well as the quality of service (QoS) requirements of users are taken into account. As the problem is non-convex and hard to solve, we propose a cascade approach. First, we design a user clustering and pairing algorithm to accomplish the subchannel assignment. Then, we apply the block coordinate descent (BCD) based framework to decompose the remaining problem into the power allocation sub-problem and the trajectory design one. The sub-optimal solution can be gradually achieved through alternatively solving these two sub-problems. As for the power allocation sub-problem, we opt to the difference of convex (DC) functions form and the successive convex approximation (SCA) method to solve it. While for the trajectory design sub-problem, the auxiliary variables and SCA method are utilized. Vivid simulation results reveal that the proposed iterative algorithm can well satisfy the QoS of users and achieve significant performance gain compared with other benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is considered a promising solution to manipulate the radio frequency transmission environment in the sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems. However, little attention was received by IRS-aided localization techniques. Among range-free wireless localization strategies, received signal strength indicator (RSSI) fingerprinting-based technique is preferred since it can be easily accessed. Inspired by these and the tremendous success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), we propose an IRS-enabled fingerprinting-based localization methodology with the aid of DRL. Specifically, we firstly propose an IRS-enabled fingerprinting-based localization system. In this system, RSSI lists are created by periodic IRS configurations and pre-collected as database. When a request of localization from a receiver is sent to the server, the database is compared with the online-measured RSSI data to identify the best receiver position estimate using the nearest neighbor algorithm. In addition, we develop a DRL-based IRS configuration selector to identify the most qualified IRS configurations so as to minimize the localization error. We also propose a communication protocol for the operation of the proposed localization methodology. Extensive simulation under different circumstances have been conducted and the results indicate that the localization accuracy scales with the number of IRS configurations. With the aid of DRL, the localization accuracy is further boosted by more than 40% as compared with previous work.},

The transmission of such samples is placed in the context of the necessary integration of such external sensor data into the decision-making process of an autonomous vehicle. Therefore, we provide parameterization and access rules for communication links in resource-managed scenarios and lay out how to integrate the protocol into the popular DDS middleware. The performance of the parameterized links to satisfy their reliability requirements is studied and compared to error protection protocols in the current software stack. We base the evaluation on an OMNeT++ simulation, whereby an established wireless error model is used. The use case is placed in the context of collaborative sensing in a valet parking environment, where external infrastructure sensor data augments the autonomous vehicle&#39;s data processing chain via a lossy wireless link.

In the offline training phase, we construct CSI features and dimensionality-reduced Channel Charts (CCs). We annotate the CCs with per-beam SNRs for different combinations of a BS beam and the corresponding best UE beam, and train models to predict SNR from CSI features for different BS/UE beam combinations.

We consider K-nearest neighbors, Gaussian process regression, and neural network-based predictions. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed framework, we perform simulations for a street segment with synthetically generated CSI.

Based on the sparse beam domain channel, we propose a separate Slepian transform (SST) based detector, where a set of modulated Slepian sequences are designed independently for user terminals (UTs). Before the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) detection, the Slepian transform is performed for each UT to reduce the dimension of the observation vector and the channel matrix, thus avoiding high dimensional matrices multiplications and inversions. Due to the sparsity of the beam domain channel, the Slepian transform of channel vectors can be efficiently implemented by low-dimensional matrix-vector multiplications. To further reduce the computational complexity, we propose a joint Slepian transform (JST) based detector, where a fixed set of modulated Slepian sequences are designed. As a result, Slepian transforms of the observation vector can be efficiently implemented using low-dimensional fast Fourier transform (FFT). Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of high performance and low complexity of proposed detectors.},

In general, UAVs&#39; user-serving capacity is typically constrained by their limited battery life and the finite communication resources that highly impact their performance. This work considers the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) enabled multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV) communication systems to provide on-demand services. The main aim of this work is to derive an efficient technique for the allocation of radio resources, 3D placement of UAVs, and user association matrices. To achieve the desired objectives, we decoupled the original joint optimization problem into two sub-problems: (i) 3D placement and user association and (ii) sum-rate maximization for optimal radio resource allocation, which are solved iteratively. The proposed iterative algorithm is shown via numerical results to achieve fast convergence speed after fewer than 10 iterations. The benefits of the proposed design are demonstrated via superior sum-rate performance compared to existing reference designs. Moreover, results showed that the optimal power and sub-carrier allocation help to mitigate the inter-cell interference that directly impacts the system&#39;s performance.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative relays improve reliability and coverage in wireless networks by providing multiple paths for data transmission. Relaying will play an essential role in vehicular networks at higher frequency bands, where mobility and frequent signal blockages cause link outages. To ensure connectivity in a relay-aided vehicular network, the relay selection policy should be designed to efficiently find unblocked relays. Inspired by recent advances in beam management in mobile millimeter wave (mmWave) networks, this article addresses the question: how can the best relay be selected with minimal overhead from beam management? In this regard, we formulate a sequential decision problem to jointly optimize relay selection and beam management. We propose a joint relay selection and beam management policy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) using the Markov property of beam indices and beam measurements. The proposed DRL-based algorithm learns time-varying thresholds that adapt to the dynamic channel conditions and traffic patterns. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms baselines without prior channel knowledge. Moreover, the DRL-based algorithm can maintain high spectral efficiency under fast-varying channels.},

  abstract     = {High-accuracy indoor positioning is a demanding but challenging technology. In the Internet of Things applications, the existing indoor positioning schemes face the following challenges: 1) for the active positioning schemes, e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, etc., the targets need power supply to emit signals; and 2) for the passive positioning schemes, e.g., Radar, Lidar, etc., the base station usually needs beam-steering control to aim at the targets for receiving sufficient reflective signals. Here, we propose a passive 3-dimensional monocular positioning scheme, resonant beam based positioning (RBP), which adopts a resonant beam for angle-of-arrival estimation and a time-of-flight module for distance estimation. We present the principle of the proposed scheme and establish analytical models and simulation tools for evaluating the impacting factors on the positioning accuracy including sensing noises, signal power, etc. To verify the RBP performance, we also present a testbed. Both numerical analysis and experimental measurements demonstrate that the positioning accuracy can be less than 1 cm over 2 m distance in &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$15^{\circ }$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; field of view. With RBP, high-accuracy and monocular without computation and high complexity positioning can be achieved while the target needs no power supply and the base station needs no beam-steering control. RBP is an important candidate for providing location-aware services in the Internet of everything and the proposed simulation models provide guidelines for system analysis and design.},

Specifically, we first introduce some learnable parameters to an unfolded iterative algorithm for MIMO detection and improve it through a preconditioned process to speed up its convergence. Then we combine this modified algorithm with the successive interference cancellation (SIC) structure in NOMA detection to propose our learned preconditioned conjugate gradient descent network with SIC (LPCG-SIC). The proposed network has fewer parameters and lower computational complexity in which only few trainable parameters need to be optimized, and there are only addition and multiplication operations in online detection. Furthermore, to overcome the drawback that most of the existing deep learning-based detectors only focus on signal detection in a given environment and cannot adapt to changes in feature spaces or distributions, we propose a DTL-based detection algorithm and three model-driven transfer strategies for our LPCG-SIC detector to improve the reusability of the trained network. Simulation results show that our proposed method can perform signal detection under multi-user interference and outperforms conventional detectors. The transfer strategies can obtain significant performance gain with lower training cost compared to no-transfer methods.},

We aim to maximize the minimum achievable information rate among all users by jointly optimizing the active beamforming vectors, passive reflecting coefficients, and power splitting coefficients, subject to the minimum harvested energy requirements of these users and the total power budget at the transmitter. Due to the intricate coupling between the reflecting coefficients and beamforming vectors, we propose a two-level iterative optimization algorithm to solve this non-convex problem. Based on the above, we also study the weighted rate-energy region maximization problem. Numerical results show that the use of IGS significantly outperforms traditional proper Gaussian signaling (PGS) in the considered systems and also affirm the effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithm.},

In return, by opportunistically accessing PT&#39;s spectrum, STs send confidential information to a secondary receiver (SR) in the presence of external eavesdropper (Eve). Aiming to maximize covert rate, we model our CCCR framework as an evolutionary game in which each PT and ST make decisions based on their utility histories. By introducing the evolutionary game, we propose a game-oriented secondary user scheduling (G-SUS) scheme to find when multiple STs determine to access PTs&#39; spectrum. Moreover, we analyze covert performance of the proposed scheme and obtain a closed-form expression for Eve&#39;s detection error probability. Numerical results show that, the minimal detection error probability at Eve can be effectively impacted by creating channel uncertainty and noise uncertainty. Furthermore, the results also demonstrate the proposed scheme can converge quickly, which stimulates its practical implementation.},

To this end, we construct a dynamic NOMA-based computation offloading scheme for vehicular platoons on highways, where the vehicles can offload their computing tasks to other platoon members. To cope with the rapidly fluctuating channel quality, we divide the timeline into successive time slots according to the channel&#39;s coherence time. Robust computing and offloading decisions are made for each time slot after taking the channel estimation errors into account. Considering a certain time slot, we first analytically characterize both the locally computed source data and the offloaded source data as well as the energy consumption of every vehicle in the platoons. We then formulate the problem of minimizing the long-term maximum task queue by optimizing the allocation of both the communication and computing resources. To solve the problem formulated, we design an online algorithm based on the classic Lyapunov optimization method and successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Finally, the numerical simulation results characterize the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate its advantages both over the local computing scheme and the orthogonal multiple access (OMA)-based offloading scheme.},

  abstract     = {Signal asynchronism significantly challenges opportunistic cellular signal positioning. Existing solutions typically rely on global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-assisted initialization or multiterminal collaboration, resulting in limited application scenarios and high implementation costs. To overcome this, a differential time-of-arrival (DTOA)-based asynchronous cellular signal positioning system is developed. By treating the user equipment at the previous time as a differential reference, a DTOA positioning model is presented to implement asynchronous cellular positioning completely independently. The Taylor-series method, which has Cramer–Rao lower bound accuracy, is considered to solve the DTOA equations. To ensure global convergence, the two-step weighted least squares (TSWLS) method and its bias reduction methods are extended to DTOA positioning to obtain an initial position guess. The linear equations at each step are reconstructed, and TSWLS ambiguity is eliminated. Simulations are conducted to analyze the DTOA positioning geometry and the performance of the proposed algorithms. The proposed system implements preliminary positioning based on DTOA and exploits an extended Kalman filter for real-time positioning. It is validated experimentally, the DTOA and EKF positioning root mean-squared errors in the field test are 4.0 m and 4.2 m, respectively, which are close to the accuracy of a conventional system with GNSS-assisted initialization.},

  abstract     = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is indeed an important technique of 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) communication systems, as it can increase the spectrum efficiency and system capacity under the same bandwidth. Long-distance unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, comprising a base station and multiple UAVs, are commonly used for reconnaissance purposes due to the extended flight range of the UAVs, which can provide broad coverage and satisfy the requirements for real-time communication. To alleviate spectrum underutilization of single channel orthogonal multiple access, we investigate resource allocation in UAV networks by utilizing NOMA and then formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the network capacity. The formulated problem can be decomposed into two sub-problems, namely UAV grouping and power allocation optimization. Accordingly, we present a UAV grouping method with low complexity according to the difference of channel gain between UAVs and base station, in which the UAVs with larger difference will be in the same cluster such that they can transmit signals over the same channel. Then, a power allocation optimization algorithm based on Lagrange multiplier method is then used to optimize the transmit power of UAVs utilizing the same channel. This algorithm considers the quality of service requirements for each UAV, and assigns power levels that maximize the overall network capacity. Simulation results have shown that the presented algorithms improve network capacity by approximately 19% compared with that of orthogonal multiple access, which demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing NOMA in long-distance UAV networks.},

However, its performance is still under investigation by researchers in light of a variety of scenarios and assumptions. Following this direction, in this Article, the individual and joint effects of the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) in-phase and quadrature imbalances (IQI) on the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the uplink IM-OFDMA scheme are investigated by considering whether each user&#39;s RF front-end is identical or not. Moreover, to reduce the detrimental effect of IQI, a preamble-based estimation and compensation method is proposed for IM-OFDMA. Closed-form expressions for the average BER of IM-OFDMA are obtained by considering the physical effect of the Tx and Rx IQI. Also, using Monte Carlo simulations, the derived expressions are verified under different system configurations. Analytical and simulation results reveal that Tx and Rx IQI cause an error floor in the BER performance of IM-OFDMA schemes. However, the proposed estimation and compensation method not only reduces the impact of IQI but also leads to a better BER performance compared to the case of no IQI, which mainly refers to the frequency diversity caused by the IQI.},

Furthermore, a new reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided-sensing structure, where a dedicated RIS is deployed to provide virtual line-of-sight (LoS) links for radar targets, is also proposed to address the significant path loss or blockage of LoS links for the sensing task. Based on this setup, the beampattern gain at the RIS for the radar target is derived and adopted as a sensing metric. The objective of this paper is to maximize the minimum beampattern gain by jointly optimizing active beamforming at the base station (BS), power allocation coefficients among NOMA users and passive beamforming at the RIS. To tackle the non-convexity of the formulated optimization problem, the beampattern gain and constraints are first transformed into more tractable forms. Then, an iterative block coordinate descent (IBCD) algorithm is proposed by employing successive convex approximation (SCA), Schur complement, semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SRCR) methods. To reduce the complexity of the proposed IBCD algorithm, a low-complexity iterative alternating optimization (IAO) algorithm is proposed. Particularly, the active beamforming is optimized by solving a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem and the closed-form solutions of the power allocation coefficients are derived. Numerical results show that: i) the proposed RIS-NOMA-ISAC system always outperforms the RIS-ISAC system without NOMA in beampattern gain and illumination power; ii) the low-complexity IAO algorithm achieves a comparable performance to that achieved by the IBCD algorithm. iii) high beampattern gain can be achieved by the proposed joint optimization algorithms in underloaded and overloaded communication scenarios.},

We propose a Time-Frequency-Fused adjustable Deep Convolutional Neural Network (TFF_aDCNN). Meanwhile, a novel TFF_aDCNN-based sensing framework is also proposed. In this framework, we can obtain a pre-trained base model with a single distribution by training TFF_aDCNN. Then, for the sensing task in the actual environment, we use the base model for transfer learning, so that a newly trained sensing model can be obtained very quickly (i.e. fine-tuned model). In the TFF_aDCNN, we design a main network and an adjustable auxiliary network, where the former learns complex and abstract signal features, while the latter assists the main network in learning different data distribution patterns during the training process and regulates the focus direction of the main network during the perception process. Simulation results show that TFF_aDCNN can significantly reduce hardware cost and improve reconstruction accuracy and reconstruction capability, when compared with SOMP and SwSOMP-based WSS algorithms, single-dimensional deep learning spectrum sensing method, and deep learning-based WSS (DLWSS), especially at very low SNRs.},

  abstract     = {In wireless communication, unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) relay seems to be an available paradigm to combat path-loss and expand signal coverage. Due to the openness of wireless channel and the inconvenient recharging, transmission security and energy efficiency are the most concerned issues for UAV-enabled communication. In this article, for an UAV-enabled two-way relay system, where two wireless terminals exchange their information assisted by a flying UAV and a malicious user tries to eavesdrop the transmitted information, the achievable secrecy energy-efficiency is formulated when the UAV speed, trajectory, allowable power and the time scheduling in the uplink and downlink transmission are considered in a comprehensive manner. To solve this non-convex problem, we decompose it into three subproblems based on the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Then, the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique and the Dinkelbach algorithm are combined to obtain the global solution in an iterative manner. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes have higher secrecy energy-efficiency compared to the existing baseline schemes.},

  abstract     = {The emerging reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has nowadays been cast with great attentions. The latest research has unveiled that the severe double-fading effect significantly restricts the coverage of pure passive RIS. In this context, a novel active RIS architecture has recently been proposed, where active components are employed to magnify incident signals. Although the active RIS can effectively combat the double-fading loss, one potential drawback is the active components also bring non-negligible energy expenditure. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel sub-array-based RIS construction, which partitions the entire intelligent surface into multiple sub-arrays with each sub-array being flexibly switched on/off. This new architecture entitles one to wisely deactivate the sub-arrays with poor channel fading gains to save energy. Mathematically, the joint sub-array activation and beamforming design towards power consumption and energy efficiency (EE) optimization is highly challenging due to its combinatorial nature. To resolve this challenge, we combine the group sparsity inducing method and the majorization-minimization (MM) framework to develop efficient solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed solutions can achieve nearly identical performance with the exhaustive-search methods, but with a much lower complexity. Besides, our proposed sub-array-based RIS architecture can significantly improve the power and EE performance.},

This protocol innovatively adopts Elliptic Curve Qu-Vanstone (ECQV) implicit certificate and Group Diffie-Hellman (GDH) protocol for group key generation, which enables decentralized negotiation and does not require pre-shared secrets as well, providing high security level for Controller Area Network (CAN). And our protocol considers as many CAN bus behaviors (e.g., ECU removing and rejoining dynamically) as possible. Subsequently, the security proof for group key exchange and theoretical analysis for the robustness against several kinds of attacks in the proposed protocol are detailed. Afterwards, a series of protocol evaluations are conducted on three kinds of typical hardware platforms, including TBOX from real vehicle supported by XPeng, and the results reveal that the proposed protocol significantly outperforms the existing protocols in time complexity, communication overhead, and memory footprint.},

  abstract     = {To solve the problems of output voltage and system efficiency sharply decreasing in the case of misalignment for the electric vehicle inductive power transfer (IPT) charging system, a universal hybrid coupler with high misalignment tolerance is proposed. The hybrid coupler consists of a four-coil bipolar (BP) coupler, the T-type network and a compensation capacitor, which effectively achieves high anti-misalignment for any compensation networks. The introduction of the T-type network makes the two overlapping coils in the same side of the BP coupler transmitter decouple effectively and simplifies the design. Although the two overlapping coils in the receiver side are still coupled with each other, the parameter design only needs to consider the cross-coupling to be small enough, which significantly reduces the design difficulty of the coupler without iteration and repetition. Finally, a 2-kW misalignment-tolerance hybrid IPT system is constructed based on the proposed hybrid IPT coupler. A configurable series-series (SS) and series/inductor-capacitor- capacitor(S/LCC) compensation topologies are used to implement constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) load-independent outputs in the face of conditions where the coupling coefficient and load change simultaneously. The experimental results validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis.},

Firstly, this article attempts to analyze the generation mechanisms of interharmonics and their resulting pulsating torque in electric TDS and derives the formulas for calculating interharmonics and pulsating torque frequencies. Then, an electromechanical coupling model is established based on the electric TDS and the multibody dynamics, and the influence of pulsating torque caused by interharmonics on the vibration of the locomotive key components is discussed in detail. It is observed that the locomotive vibrations, especially the longitudinal and vertical vibrations of bogies and wheels, can be significantly influenced by the pulsating torque. It is noticeable that the frequencies of the vibrations are consistent with those of pulsating torque, which proves that electrical parameters can affect the vibrations of key locomotive components.

Firstly, the coarse estimate of attitude quaternion is conducted to obtain a rough attitude reference through taking the position matrix as an unknown constant matrix. Secondly, the influences of vehicle&#39;s linear motion on the estimate of the attitude quaternion are analyzed in detail. Then the angular rate related to vehicle&#39;s linear velocity, which causes the large yaw error in the coarse estimation stage, is eliminated from the gyroscope outputs. Moreover, a more accurate latitude estimate and attitude quaternion are achieved by using the corrected gyroscope outputs into the determination of attitude quaternion, completely separating the linear motion from the vehicle&#39;s in-motion condition. The results of simulation and experiment demonstrate that the proposed method can overcome the interferences of vehicle&#39;s linear motion, and verify its effectiveness to solve the in-motion coarse alignment with latitude uncertainty.},

First, considering tire force saturation, the nonlinear vehicle dynamic model is applied to predict lateral, yaw and roll motion under extreme conditions. Second, based on the real-time rollover index changing with the vehicle states, the control region is divided into stable, critically stable, unstable regions with different control requirements. Then, according to the driver behaviors and the collected road conditions, the identified stability boundaries are utilized as state constraints. By changing the weighting factors and constraint values of the model predictive controller, multiple safety requirements for different regions are dynamically coordinated to improve vehicle overall performance. Finally, CarSim and MATLAB/Simulink co-simulation, and hardware-in-the-loop simulation test results show that the vehicles handling performance, stability, and rollover prevention performance are effectively improved under high speed turning.},

To fill this gap, a segmented TPS modulation scheme is proposed. Considering wide-range ZVS, three different working modes are derived to achieve MEPT over the wide output voltage range. The proposed modulation scheme employs closed-loop control by integrating different working modes. In addition, the efficiency-oriented seamless transition method among different working modes is described, which can avoid the transient oscillation at the boundary of the mode transition. The proposed modulation scheme&#39;s on-state loss and switching loss are compared to the traditional TPS modulation scheme. Finally, a 1.5 k W prototype has been built to verify effectiveness of the proposed modulation scheme within the wide voltage range, and the measured efficiency can be increased by up to 0.82% in the deep buck mode and 2.20% in the deep boost mode.},

  abstract     = {Decomposition techniques generally have two limitations. First, for adaptive correlated kurtogram and variational mode decomposition, etc., the definition of the decomposition target has no direct relationship with the features of fault impacts, i.e., the decomposition is not guided by health indices used to characterize bearing faults, resulting in fault impacts cannot be completely separated from vibration. Second, it is hard to accurately determine the decomposition stop parameter (the number of final output modes), resulting in over- or under-decomposition. These are not conducive to bearing fault detection in engineering practice. Therefore, a new decomposition, multi-objective sparse maximum mode decomposition (MOSMMD), is proposed. Firstly, by analyzing the Fourier spectrum of vibration, MOSMMD constructs multiple finite impulse response filters covering different frequency bands to obtain initial candidate modes. Then, aiming at maximizing L2 / L1 norm of envelope spectrum (ES), the upper and lower cutoff frequencies of each filter are adjusted adaptively through iterative optimization, and the frequency bands covered by each mode are adjusted accordingly. Finally, by using that fault feature harmonics have periodic natures in ES, the redundant modes are eliminated and only the modes with obvious fault features are output. The decomposition target of MOSMMD is directly related to fault features, i.e., cyclostationarity, which makes the extraction of fault impacts more accurate. The number of final output modes of MOSMMD is determined adaptively and does not need to be set as input before application. Even when processing concurrent fault signals, MOSMMD can decompose fault modes from vibration without prior fault information.},

  abstract     = {AC power cycling tests allow the most realistic reliability assessment by applying close to real stress to the device or module under test to meet functional safety standards, which is highly critical for traction applications. This article presents a comprehensive guideline and shares critical know-how to develop a 120 KVA AC power cycling test setup for high-power Silicon Carbide (SiC) modules. As of today, traction applications can not generate an early warning signal for drivers to replace critical components on time. For this purpose, the suitable precursors for all dominant failure mechanisms are discussed, and the corresponding condition monitoring tools are proposed to monitor the device aging on power converters. These condition monitoring tools are integrated into the built-in desaturation protection circuit of the electric vehicle (EV) gate driver for low-cost, practical implementation. The on-resistance of all twelve switches is monitored online as a temperature-sensitive electrical parameter (TSEP) to measure the junction temperature of the devices. To avoid heavy processing load in the microcontroller, the out-of-order equivalent time sampling technique is developed for data sampling, which leads to a measurement error of less than 1.5%. In addition, the design considerations regarding common mode noise and aging effect on DESAT protection are investigated, and experimental findings are presented.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an autonomous emergency steering (AES) control strategy for the automated vehicle to avoid collisions with obstacles while maintaining the vehicle&#39;s yaw stability. Specifically, by capturing the surrounding traffic environment (i.e., dynamic/static obstacles and lane-road boundary) using an artificial potential field approach, a safe vehicle path trajectory in the form of a polynomial function was generated via Pontryagin&#39;s maximum principle (PMP). The generated path was complemented by a linear time-varying model predictive control (LTV-MPC) scheme that can predict the state behaviors near the operating points during the prediction horizon. Therefore, the proposed approach can effectively and dynamically adapt to the changes in the system model while respecting the state-and-control constraints. Furthermore, we assumed harsh driving environments where the vehicle drives on a slippery road at a relatively high speed, which may cause lateral instability to the vehicle. Hence, the developed controller has to consider both the vehicle&#39;s yaw stability and the path-tracking performance. To achieve this goal, we imposed the adaptive constraints in the designed LTV-MPC, depending on the road surface and driving conditions to prioritize the satisfaction of vehicle yaw stability instead of the path-tracking performance. The proposed approach was verified under various conditions using high-fidelity vehicle dynamics and control testing software (i.e., CarSim). Its effectiveness in vehicle yaw stability and path-tracking performance is compared to conventional baseline approaches.},

However, these methods have issues such as high demand for computing resources and poor robustness in face of unfamiliar environments. Aiming to solve the above problems, we propose a neuromorphic reinforcement learning method (Neuro-Planner) that combines spiking neural network (SNN) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to realize MAV 3D visual navigation with depth camera. Specifically, we design a spiking actor network based on two-state LIF (TS-LIF) neurons and its encoding-decoding schemes for efficient inference. Then our improved hybrid deep deterministic policy gradient (HDDPG) and TS-LIF-based spatio-temporal back propagation (STBP) algorithms are used as the training framework for actor-critic network architecture. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed Neuro-Planner, we carry out detailed comparison experiments with various SNN training algorithm (STBP, BPTT and SLAYER) in the software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulation framework. The navigation success rate of our HDDPG-STBP is 4.3% and 5.3% higher than that of the original DDPG in the two evaluation environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work combining neuromorphic computing and deep reinforcement learning for MAV 3D visual navigation task.},

Many studies focus on applying AI techniques to obtain a high-quality map, a precise localization, or improve the proposed trajectory to be followed by the agent. As traditional planning methods need a high-quality map to obtain optimal trajectories, this paper addresses the problem of multipath map-less planning, and proposes a novel multipath planning algorithm (Double Deep Reinforcement Learning - Enhanced Genetic (DDRL-EG)) for mobile robots in an unknown environment. It combines Double Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDRL) with Heuristic Knowledge (HK), Experience Replay (ER), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Dynamic Programming (DP), allowing the agent to reach its target successfully without maps. In addition, it optimizes the training time and the chosen path in terms of time and distance to the target. A hybrid method is also used in which Semi-Uniform Distributed Exploration (SUDE) is employed to determine the probability that the action is decided based on directed knowledge, hybrid knowledge, or autonomous knowledge. The performance of DDRL-EG is compared with two other algorithms in two different environments. The results show that DDRL-EG is a more robust and powerful algorithm since with less training, it can provide much smoother and shorter trajectories to the target.},

Clever design of control algorithms and communication systems is required to ensure that the vehicle platoon is stable and meets desired safety requirements. In this paper, we propose a centralized model predictive controller for a heterogeneous platoon of vehicles to reach a desired platoon velocity and individual inter-vehicle distances with driver-selected headway time. As a novel concept, we allow for interruption from a human driver in the platoon that temporarily takes control of their vehicle with the assumption that the driver will, at minimum, obey legal velocity limits and the physical performance constraints of their vehicle. The finite horizon cost function of our proposed platoon controller is inspired from the infinite horizon design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first platoon controller that integrates human-driven vehicles. We illustrate the performance of our proposed design with a numerical study, demonstrating that the safety distance, velocity, and actuation constraints are obeyed. Additionally, in simulation we illustrate a key property of string stability where the impact of a disturbance is reduced through the platoon.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of vehicles as countries become more developed has brought great challenges to traffic prediction. Recent works model only local or global spatial-temporal features via graph neural networks (GNNs). Furthermore, the explicit graph structure information may contain bias, in particular, the lack of connections among multiple nodes when in fact, they are interdependent. This results in the inability to accommodate information interaction and the underutilization of high-quality information. In this article, we design an adaptive spatial-temporal graph convolution networks (ASTGCNs) to collaboratively learn local-global spatial-temporal information for traffic prediction. Specifically, we obtain different local spatial-temporal information (i.e. spatial-temporal information of each temporal point) by dividing the global spatial-temporal information along the temporal dimension. For local spatial-temporal information, we establish an adaptive graph convolution to enhance the ability of graph convolution networks (GCNs) in managing bias in the explicit graph structure. We then employ an attention mechanism to learn the local summarization of dynamic node neighborhoods to obtain high-quality information. For global spatial-temporal information, a temporal convolution network (TCN) block and the ordinary differential equation (ODE) are utilized in our model. In essence, our proposed ASTGCNs integrates adaptive graph convolution, attention mechanism, TCN block and ODE to collaboratively learn local-global spatial-temporal information. Experimental results show that our ASTGCNs is superior to state-of-art (SOTA) methods when applied to four real-world datasets.},

However, with uncertainties in driving conditions and concerns about driving safety, speed planning results are cautious and with frequent speed variations, which deteriorates the energy economy of EVs in turn. To comprehensively optimize the energy economy and driving safety of EVs in a stochastic driving environment, this article develops a chance constraint model predictive control (CC-MPC) for co-optimizing the speed planning and powertrain control, which forms an advanced energy management method. To handle the instantaneous disturbance, a coordinated hierarchical method (CHM) is engineered for solving the CC-MPC. As suggested by simulation, the driving safety (measured by success rate) can be increased to 81% with the CC-MPC, which realizes a 62% improvement compared with situations without CC-MPC. Moreover, the proposed CC-MPC significantly mitigates the conflict between driving safety and the energy economy, and the worst deterioration of the energy economy is only 9.3%. Sacrificing merely 2.1% sub-optimality, CHM removes 86% computation loads, and the median of CPU time is merely 0.58s at each computation step (control interval 1s), which makes the CC-MPC promising for online implementation.},

  abstract     = {Lane detection is an important and fundamental task in autonomous driving. Modern convolutional neural network (CNN) methods have achieved high performance in lane detection; however, the intrinsic locality of convolution operations makes these methods limited in effectively modeling the long-range dependencies that are vital to capture global information of lanes. Additionally, numerous convolution operations result in considerable computational cost for high complexity. To overcome these difficulties, we propose an efficient lane detection method by combining CNN with a multilayer perceptron (MLP). First, an improved bottleneck-1D layer is used to replace the standard convolutional layer in overall network to reduce the computational cost and parameters while applying hybrid dilated convolution (HDC) to better capture multiscale lane information. Second, we construct a hybrid MLP block in the latent space to capture the long-range dependencies of lanes. The hybrid MLP projects tokenized convolutional features from spatial locations and channels, and then, they are fused together to obtain global representation, in which each output pixel is related to each input pixel. The introduction of MLP further decreases computational complexity and makes the proposed architecture more efficient for lane detection. Experimental results on two challenging datasets (CULane, Tusimple) demonstrate that our method can achieve a higher computational efficiency while maintaining a decent detection performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, this study indicates that integrating the global representation capacity of an MLP with local prior information of convolution is an effective and potential perspective in lane detection.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates a flux-switching (FS) machine with U-V-array permanent magnet (PM) arrangement, termed UV-FSPM. The key design is to construct parallel magnetic circuit by adopting U-V-array PMs. Based on the parallel magnetic circuit, the operating principle of the UV-FSPM is illustrated. To provide a deeper insight into the torque enhancement mechanism, the analytical model of the UV-FSPM is built by using the general air-gap field modulation theory. It is found that the U-V-array PMs can significantly enhance the dominant working harmonic which effectively contributes to torque enhancement of the investigated UV-FSPM. To reveal the impact of key parameters on torque performances, the parametric optimization of the UV-FSPM is conducted. The electromagnetic performances of three FSPMs are comparatively studied by finite element analysis (FEA). It is proved that the investigated UV-FSPM exhibits the highest torque density and highest PM utilization ratio within the pool. Finally, a prototype of the UV-FSPM is fabricated and tested for verification of the investigated concepts.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a spatial learning-based fault-tolerant control strategy is proposed for precise lateral tracking of autonomous vehicles subject to dynamical uncertainties, external disturbances as well as actuator failures. In order to facilitate the controller design, the uncertain vehicle dynamics are firstly transformed into a parametric form in the space domain, where the system uncertainties are reorganized and combined into the parametric and input distribution uncertainties. Furthermore, considering the under-actuated property of the vehicle dynamics, a novel technique in dealing with the non-square input distribution matrix is employed, in which a pseudo-like inverse matrix and a robust term are introduced into the controller to compensate the mismatch between the number of inputs and outputs. Then the proposed spatial learning-based fault tolerant control algorithm is developed, which is equipped with two adaptive parametric updating laws to estimate the parametric uncertainties and the multiplicative actuator faults correspondingly. Consequently, the convergence of the control algorithm is analyzed rigorously under the framework of composite energy function. Case studies verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

First, a path tracking system is established considering the effect of norm bounded uncertainty on lateral vehicle dynamics, and a state feedback path tracking controller is designed within the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy framework. Next, a decentralized event-triggered communication scheme is adopted between the sensors and controller, which makes it possible to save communication resources at the channel level. Finally, the results in the CarSim-Simulink joint-simulation environment show that the proposed controller can ensure a reliable path tracking performance in both lateral offset and heading error. At the same time, compared with the simple time-triggered scheme, the proposed method can effectively reduce the usage of communication resources by more than 80%.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting the trajectory of road agents in complex traffic scenarios is challenging because the movement patterns of agents are complex and stochastic, not only depending on their own past trajectories but also being closely related to the social interaction with other surrounding agents. Besides accuracy, efficient prediction with low inference latency is also a highly desirable feature for the practical application of trajectory prediction. To address these issues, we propose the VNAGT model, a variational non-autoregressive graph transformer that adopts the framework of conditional variational autoencoder and incorporates the non-autoregressive approach such that diverse trajectories and low prediction latency can be achieved simultaneously. In order to capture the social and temporal interaction, we put forward a unified graph attention-based module that is applicable for homogeneous and heterogeneous multi-agents such that the class information can be seamlessly integrated when it is available. Non-autoregressive decoding is combined with variational learning to produce multiple plausible predictions with low latency. We train and validate the model on two real-world homogeneous and heterogeneous trajectory datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our model in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Manufactures of automotive parts are struggling to secure redundancy in various ways. An alternative is to configure the system via a dual-winding motor and two electronic control units (ECUs). The dual-winding motor contains different winding arrangements according to poles/slots, and when only one of the two circuits is used owing to a failure, the electrical and mechanical characteristics differ depending on the winding arrangement. In this study, the electrical and mechanical characteristics were analyzed and compared according to the winding arrangement when the failure occurs. In particular, the winding arrangement of the motor is divided into line symmetry, point symmetry, and alternating symmetry. For each winding arrangement, the back-electromotive force, torque, and torque ripple were compared and analyzed through simulation and test. Also, vibration caused by electromagnetic force was analyzed. Here, to consider the tooth modulation effect, concentrated force was investigated and tangential force as well as radial force were considered. Additionally, the thermal characteristics were analyzed during fault operation using a lumped parameter thermal network with piecewise stator-housing modules. Lastly, the mechanical design characteristics of the motor hardware size that need to be changed according to the winding arrangement of the brake motor are explained. This study provides guidelines for the winding arrangement selection of a dual-winding motor with a similar magnetic field distribution suitable for the design purpose, by analyzing the electromechanical characteristics and size according to the winding arrangement during fault operation. The characteristics of other motor types or pole and slot number combinations can also be inferred from the results of this study, since the magnetic flux density distribution will be determined with line, point and alternating symmetry.},

  abstract     = {Coasting is a common method used in eco-driving to reduce fuel consumption by utilizing kinetic energy. However, in order to avoid excessive computation induced by integer coasting maneuvers, the powertrain model used in eco-driving controllers that rely on look-ahead road information has been oversimplified. This oversimplification assumes that the engine goes to idle when coasting, which significantly limits the fuel-saving potential. To address this issue, we propose an eco-coasting strategy that calculates the optimal timing and duration of coasting maneuvers using road information preview. Different from the engine-idling method, two control-oriented coasting methods, fuel cut-off method and engine start/stop method are formulated for the model-based optimal control. To evaluate and choose the best coasting mechanism for eco-coasting strategy, dynamic programming (DP) is performed to provide the globally optimal performance (i.e., benchmark results) for evaluating the engine-idling method, fuel cut-off method, and engine start/stop method. Based on the offline simulation results, the engine start/stop method consistently outperforms the fuel cut-off method in terms of both fuel consumption and travel time. This is attributed to the engine start/stop method eliminating the engine drag torque during deceleration, despite the additional energy cost required for engine restart being taken into account in the modeling, thus providing a fair evaluation. Then, the online performance of the eco-coasting strategy with engine start/stop mechanism is evaluated using Mixed Integer Model Predictive Control (MIMPC). We propose a tailored mixed-integer programming algorithm to facilitate online implementation. Simulation results show that the proposed eco-coasting strategy achieves near-optimal performance compared to DP and outperforms the rule-based method.},

Using some advanced sensors to estimate the PV state is a hot research topic. However, existing studies rarely use vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication to estimate the PV state. Meanwhile, the influence of model parameter perturbation on estimation accuracy is not fully considered. In this article, a strong tracking event-triggered unscented Kalman filter (STETUKF) is designed to estimate the PV state utilizing V2V communication. First, we develop a nonlinear vehicle model. Then, the strong tracking filtering is combined with the ETUKF to establish STETUKF. Among them, the event-triggered mechanism determines if onboard sensor data from the PV will be delivered to the host vehicle. By appropriately adjusting the event-triggered threshold, an ideal compromise can be achieved between the transmission rate and estimation accuracy. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that STETUKF has better estimation performance than the traditional UKF. The proposed algorithm can save at least 64.93% of communication resources and it is robust to the model parameter perturbation.},

To address these problems, a sliding windows operation for vector observation optimization is proposed. The derivation for the calculation of the new vector observations is given in detail. Using the new vector observations, the accumulated errors, which are existing in the observed vectors, are weakened.

Then, by exploring a switch-loaded omnidirectional source, a novel dual-polarized wide/narrow beamwidth switchable or reconfigurable method is proposed. To meet the demand for intelligent mobile communication for dynamic beam steering, the dual-polarized beamwidth reconfigurable radiator as the array element is used for the phased array or MIMO designs. As a proof of concept, an interesting four-element reconfigurable dual-polarized phased array is implemented in the Sub-6 GHz band. By controlling the switch states of each element, this array can be operated in two modes: wide-angle scanning coverage (V2V connection) and long-distance high-gain scanning (V2I communication) . In wide-angle scanning mode, the main lobe of the array can scan from −60° to +55°, and its peak gain is 9.1 dBi. In long-distance high-gain scanning, this array can scan the beam in the range of [−35°, +35°] with a peak gain of 11.2 dBi. Besides, the isolation between different elements or polarization is greater than 13 dB. This reconfigurable phased array demonstrates the advantages of low-cost, broadband, and flexible beam-steering capability.

  abstract     = {Fifth-generation mobile communication technology (5G) has greatly promoted the development of vehicular communication. Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology is becoming the magic key to enabling the high data rate exchange of future onboard devices. Due to the severe path loss at mmWave, the cell radius is short and causes frequent handovers for vehicle user equipment in the mobile network environment. The above problems increase the risk of communication interruptions and pose threats to driving safety. Thus, it is critical to understand the channel characteristics during handover and find a suitable handover mechanism for future vehicular communications. In this work, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) measurement campaigns are first conducted in urban scenarios using the moving network (MN) system. The measurements confirmed the potential benefits of beam-switching during movement and calibrated the ray-tracing (RT) simulator. Then intensive simulations are carried out for the handover procedure in the urban scenario. Based on simulation results, channel parameters are extracted and the channel characteristics for the handover procedure are studied. Finally, it is proposed to use beam-switching to complete the handover by evaluating handover parameters in detail. Compared to the conventional single beam, the beam-switching mechanism improves the SINR by about 30%, significantly enhancing the link quality during handover in the MN system.},

We model a hit ratio maximization problem subject to age of information (AoI), and prove the NP-hardness of the problem. For problem solving, we propose a scalable and effective algorithm based on repeated cutting plane (RCP), in which a cutting plane algorithm and a rounding algorithm are implemented iteratively. In addition, we derive a bound that serves as a benchmark of any suboptimal solution. Performance evaluations show that for RCP, the performance gap to optimum is less than 2.5%.},

  abstract     = {In this correspondence, a novel framework is proposed for analyzing data offloading in a multi-access edge computing system. Specifically, a two-phase algorithm, is proposed, including two key phases: 1) user association phase and 2) task offloading phase . In the first phase, a ruin theory-based approach is developed to obtain the users association considering the users&#39; transmission reliability and resource utilization efficiency. Meanwhile, in the second phase, an optimization-based algorithm is used to optimize the data offloading process. In particular, ruin theory is used to manage the user association phase, and a ruin probability-based preference profile is considered to control the priority of proposing users. Here, ruin probability is derived by the surplus buffer space of each edge node at each time slot. Giving the association results, an optimization problem is formulated to optimize the amount of offloaded data aiming at minimizing the energy consumption of users. Simulation results show that the developed solutions guarantee system reliability, association efficiency under a tolerable value of surplus buffer size, and minimize the total energy consumption of all users.},

It is found that when the number of IRS elements is small, the advantages of LF over DF can be observed, as long as the relay is not too close to the source. Moreover, it has been shown that the more IRS elements there are, the less sensitive the system performances will be to the relay schemes and relay locations.},

To address this issue, in this paper, an expectation propagation (EP) aided model-driven deep learning framework is proposed for OTFS signal detection. Specifically, each iteration of the EP algorithm is unfolded into a layer-wise network and trainable parameters are added to this network to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm, as well as improve the detection performance.

Different from the conventional single-stage decoding (SSD) scheme that performs local decoding at each access point (AP) independently, the MSD scheme exploits the local decoding information exchange between the APs and a central processing unit (CPU) to resolve access collisions and enhance access capacity with successive interference cancellation (SIC). To show the performance superiority of MSD to SSD, we analytically evaluate and compare the error probabilities of both the schemes by leveraging on techniques from stochastic geometry. Simulation results verify our analysis and indicate that the MSD scheme is able to effectively reduce the error probability and afford much higher access load compared to the SSD scheme, which makes it more suitable for massive MTC.},

In particular, the total energy efficiency (EE) and the number of IoT users that could be served fairly are maximized by jointly optimizing active and passive beamformers.

Then, we employ the fractional programming based on the quadratic form to obtain a sub-optimal solution for the active beamformers at the AP and the number of admitted users. In the passive beamforming case, a penalty-based approach is utilized together with the SCA technique to handle the unit-modulus constraints at the IRS.

In this paper, we propose an uplink grant-free massive access scheme for XL-MIMO systems, in which a mixed-analog-to-digital converters (ADC) architecture is adopted to strike the right balance between access performance and power consumption. By exploiting the spatial-domain structured sparsity and the piecewise angular-domain cluster sparsity of massive access channels, a compressive sensing (CS)-based two-stage orthogonal approximate message passing algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the joint activity detection and channel estimation problem. Particularly, high-precision quantized measurements are leveraged to perform accurate hyper-parameter estimation, thereby facilitating the activity detection. Moreover, we adopt a subarray-wise estimation strategy to overcome the severe angular-domain energy dispersion problem which is caused by the near-field effect in XL-MIMO channels. Simulation results verify the superiority of our proposed algorithm over state-of-the-art CS algorithms for massive access based on XL-MIMO with mixed-ADC architectures.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the secure uplink transmissions from ground nodes to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) receiver through analog collaborative beamforming (ACB). When the location information of the UAV receiver is available, ACB can be realized in a fully distributed manner, since each transmitting node can locally adjust its phase. ACB-based physical layer security (PLS) algorithm, where the virtual antenna array (VAA) elements are randomly selected at each transmit time unit, can effectively protect against eavesdropping attacks by creating artificial noise to the directions except the legitimate receiver (Bob). However, when Bob is mounted on the UAV, it can suffer from array gain loss due to jittering effects caused by airflow turbulence and mechanical vibration. Motivated by this issue, in this article, we investigate the impact of the UAV jitter on the secrecy performance. We derive the theoretical expressions of the secrecy rate both in the absence and presence of the jittering effects. Further, the simulation results show that the ACB-based PLS cannot guarantee non-zero secrecy rate even with the radial distance perturbations on the order of a few centimeters, especially when an eavesdropper (Eve) exists in close proximity to Bob.},

  abstract     = {The sixth generation networks envision the deployment of terahertz (THz) band as one of the key enabling property thanks to its abundant bandwidth. However, the ultra-wide bandwidth in THz causes beam-split phenomenon due to the use of a single analog beamformer (AB). Specifically, beam-split makes different subcarriers to observe distinct directions since the same AB is adopted for all subcarriers. Previous works mostly employ additional hardware components, e.g., time-delayer networks to mitigate beam-split by realizing virtual subcarrier-dependent ABs. This article introduces an efficient and unified approach, called beam-split-aware (BSA) hybrid beamforming. In particular, instead of virtually generating subcarrier-dependent ABs, a single AB is used and the effect of beam-split is computed and passed into the digital beamformers, which are subcarrier-dependent while maximizing spectral efficiency. Hence, the proposed BSA approach effectively mitigates the impact of beam-split and it can be applied to any hybrid beamforming architecture. Manifold optimization and orthogonal matching pursuit techniques are considered for the evaluation of the proposed approach in multi-user scenario. Numerical simulations show that significant performance improvement can be achieved as compared to the conventional techniques.},

The traditional protograph-coded DCSK receiver does not take full advantage of the reused chaotic reference signals and hence cannot obtain desirable error performance. To solve this problem, we design a new receiver architecture called weighted reference estimation and iterative decoding (WRE-ID) , which can universally improve the performance of protograph-coded reference reused DCSK systems over both multipath Rayleigh fading and additive white Gaussian noise channels. In particular, we put forward the WRE algorithm to estimate reference signal in order to calculate log-likelihood ratio (LLR) more precisely. Furthermore, extrinsic information output from the decoder is utilized to iteratively recalculate the weight of the WRE algorithm. As a further illustration, we derive the LLR expressions of the proposed WRE-ID-aided receiver of a typical protograph-coded reference reused DCSK (i.e., high-efficiency DCSK) system. Analytical and simulated results show that the proposed WRE-ID-aided receiver can always overtake the traditional receivers in reference reused DCSK systems. Hence, the protograph-based reference reused DCSK systems with the proposed receiver are very promising for high-rate high-reliability wireless applications.},

Therefore, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) based joint optimization scheme to improve the system performance. First, we model the MARL framework to portray the dynamic wireless communication environment and interactive agent entities, which interprets the relationship between reinforcement learning and communication strategies. Moreover, in an IRS-aided cell-free massive MIMO system, entries are collaborated by the CPU for joint optimization, and the actions are continuous. Thus we propose a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient scheme for jointly optimizing the user&#39;s power control and IRS&#39;s passive beamforming (MADDPG-JPA-PB). Via centralized training and decentralized execution, the system gradually converges into an optimized policy associated with the maximization of the success transmission rate. Simulation results verify that the performance of the proposed scheme outperforms various independent deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) schemes and traditional optimization methods.},

The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is widely used as a low-complexity solution based on a state evolution and measurement model of the state-space model. However, obtaining precise information about these models can be difficult in practice, and model mismatch greatly reduces state estimation accuracy. In this paper, we introduce Split-KalmanNet, a robust EKF algorithm that utilizes the power of deep learning for state estimation. Split-KalmanNet is inspired by the recent KalmanNet and calculates the Kalman gain using the Jacobian matrix of a measurement function and two recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with a split structure. The RNNs independently learn the covariance matrices of the prior state estimate and the innovation from data. The proposed split structure in calculating the Kalman gain allows for compensation of both state and measurement model mismatch effects. Numerical simulations show that Split-KalmanNet outperforms traditional EKF and the state-of-the-art KalmanNet algorithm in various scenarios of model mismatch.},

  abstract     = {The freshness of system information has attracted extensive attention and has become one of the most critical Quality of Service (QoS) indicators in industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs). For practical IWSNs composed of numerous components, the system freshness for a specific task is usually related to multiple and multitype sensing data. For example, in a chemical plant fire alarm system, the system controller (SC) cannot determine the fire notification until analyzing multiple types of ambient information, such as temperature, flame, carbon dioxide, and smoke. However, most existing research on freshness metrics, such as Age of Information (AoI) or Age of Processing (AoP), only considers a single-package setting with a single type of data. Therefore, to measure the system freshness accurately in IWSNs, we propose the Age of Task-oriented Information (AoTI) for industrial tasks. It measures the time elapsed of the latest analyzed results before arriving at the receiver since the generation of any type of sampling data belonging to an industrial task. Considering the time-varying and wireless environments, we aim to minimize the long-term AoTI for IWSNs applications by jointly optimizing access selections and sampling frequencies for all sensors. We first formulate this problem as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem and then transform it into a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), which is further relaxed as an MDP using the Lagrangian method. Finally, we develop a Learning-based Access selection and Sampling frequency Control (LASC) algorithm and verify its superiority through extensive simulations.},

In this paper, the spectral efficiency is further enhanced in TWR scheme by adopting Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technique. Specifically, the transmitted signals from the nodes in the first time slot are composed based on NOMA transmission and intended to multiple intermediate relay-nodes. Consequently, each relay will extract its own symbols, combine them and send them in the second time slot. The improvement of the spectral efficiency in our system, as compared to the Conventional TWR, is linearly proportional to the number of relay-nodes that can be installed. The performance of the proposed scheme is mathematically analyzed in terms of the spectral efficiency and error performance, shown significant gain when compared to the conventional TWR scheme.},

However, the existing RA algorithms consider the ideal cases of perfect channel state information and linear energy harvesting (EH), which will deteriorate system performance. To fill this gap, in this paper, we investigate a robust RA problem for a wireless-powered BackCom system with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) under the consideration of practical channel uncertainties and nonlinear EH models. The robust RA problem with Euclidean spherical uncertainties is formulated by optimizing the transmit beamforming vector of the access point (AP), the transmit power of each IoT device, and time allocation factors, where the maximum power constraint of the AP, the time frame constraint, the minimum EH constraint, and the quality of service constraint of each user are considered simultaneously. Subsequently, according to the block coordinate descent iterative method, an iteration-based robust RA algorithm is proposed by using the successive convex approximation, S-procedure, semidefinite relaxation, and Gaussian randomization methods. Simulation results prove that our proposed algorithm can drastically enhance system robustness compared to the non-robust algorithm and several benchmark algorithms.},

To characterize the performance of the proposed system, the average block error rate (BLER) and throughput performance of the secondary users are derived and analyzed, and the theoretical results are verified using Monte Carlo simulations. To facilitate the performance improvement of network communication, the analysis and insights on the node&#39;s mobility and imperfect channel estimation are provided. The results show that both node&#39;s mobility and imperfect channel estimation result in the degradation of system performance. In addition, our examination shows that the increase in distance between primary and secondary networks indeed reduces interference and improves performance. Interestingly, we further find that shorter blocklength enhances the throughput performance for a long-distance scenario between primary transmitter and secondary users. In contrast, the opposite result is obtained for the short-distance scenario, which means that short packet communication is prominent in our proposed system.},

All AUVs patrol a cylindrical region and dynamically control their 3-Dimensional (3D) location according to the random way-point (RWP) mobility model. Our specific interest focuses on the system throughput under different locations of the serving AUV. The following three serving AUV selection policies are investigated: 1)The serving AUV is the closest AUV among all active AUVs; 2) The serving AUV is randomly selected among the active AUVs; 3)The serving AUV is the farthest AUV among all active AUVs. Under the time slotted network scenario, the system throughput is defined as the probability that the sink can successfully recover the data packet from the serving AUV in one time slot. Further, we consider a practical constraint that all AUVs are equipped with limited data buffers. Based on the probability distributions of the distances between the AUVs and the surface sink, this paper presents a mathematical framework to characterize the performance of the random 3D mobile network. With the help of this framework, we obtain the theoretical performance in terms of the system throughput of the surface sink and the average queue delay of any AUV. Finally, extensive simulations are presented to verify the accuracy of our analysis and study the effects of various parameters.},

  abstract     = {Airborne base stations (ABSs) have drawn a significant interest since they can enhance network capacity and coverage thanks to their dominant line-of-sight links as well as flexible deployment. However, the system performance of ABS-assisted networks is severely confined by the limited endurance of the on-board battery. To overcome this energy issue, we are exploring the robotic airborne base station (RABS) with energy neutral grasping end-effectors able to autonomously perch at tall urban landforms. This paper studies the optimal deployment (fly to another grasping location or remain in the same one) and operation (active or sleep mode at an epoch) of RABS based on the spatio-temporal distribution of underlying traffic load, which problem is formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) aiming to maximize the volume of served traffic load under the on-board energy constraints. To tackle the curse of dimensionality in this ILP formulation, we first investigate a special case with a single RABS in the system and develop a Lagrangian heuristic algorithm to solve it by exploiting the totally unimodularity structure. A polynomial-time method is then proposed to decompose the multi-RABS problem into several single-RABS cases based on the Hungarian algorithm. In terms of aggregated traffic that can be supported, numerical results reveal that a single RABS outperforms four (4) fixed micro cells when the serving duration ranges from 10 to 24 hours, allowing in that sense efficient network densification. The traffic loaded in a RABS is 3.2 times higher than a fixed small cell when the traffic distribution is highly heterogeneous. Finally, the efficiency and performance of the proposed algorithms are also detailed.},

  abstract     = {One of the major factors which limits the throughput in wireless communications networks is the accuracy of time synchronization between the nodes in the network. Synchronization methods based on pulse-coupled oscillators (PCOs) have the advantage of simple implementation and achieve high accuracy when the nodes are closely located. However, such schemes tend to have poor synchronization performance for distant nodes, as well as in the presence of clock frequency offsets between the nodes. In this paper we present a novel PCO-based Deep neural network (DNN)-Aided Synchronization Algorithm coined DASA. We design DASA as a novel low-complexity and interpretable architecture by converting classic PCO-based synchronization into a trainable discriminative model . To enable DASA to operate in dynamic settings, we propose a novel, unsupervised, distributed, fast online training scheme which is able to train DASA within a few sampling instances, locally , thereby avoiding the need for information exchange between the nodes or for a central node for coordination. DASA is demonstrated to achieve an improvement by a factor greater than ten compared to the classic reference scheme. Lastly, we propose another novel, distributed offline training scheme for DASA, which is demonstrated to offer a tradeoff between performance and simplicity of deployment compared to the online training scheme, yet, at the same time, DASA with offline training still achieves superior performance compared to the classic reference scheme.},

  abstract     = {Recently, passive behavioral biometrics (e.g., gesture or footstep) acquired from wireless networks or mobile services have become promising complements to conventional user identification methods (e.g., face or fingerprint) under special situations, yet existing sensing technologies require lengthy measurement traces and cannot identify multiple users at the same time. To this end, we propose PURE as a passive multi-person identification system leveraging deep learning enabled footstep separation and recognition. PURE passively identifies a user by identifying the unique “footprints” in its footstep. Different from existing gait-enabled recognition systems incurring a long sensing delay to acquire many footsteps, PURE can recognize a person by as few as only one step, substantially cutting the identification latency. To make PURE adaptive to walking pace variations, environmental dynamics, and even unseen targets, we apply an adversarial learning technique to improve its domain generalisability and identification accuracy. Finally, PURE is robust against replay attack, enabled by the richness of footstep and spatial awareness. We implement a PURE prototype using commodity hardware and evaluate it in typical indoor settings. Evaluation results demonstrate a cross-domain identification accuracy of over 90%.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have proven to be useful in a variety of applications, including aerial base station relay. UAVs can be used to relay network access from the air to user equipment (UE) on the ground. To improve the quality of experience (QoE) provided by UAVs, proactive content frequently requested by UEs can be cached to the UAVs. However, it is difficult to predict the chaotic and nonstationary patterns of mobile UEs because of the QoE requirements, the frequent location changes, the delays in content delivery, and scalability issues. Thus, this paper proposes a novel Deep Federated Echo State Learning (DeepFESL) content caching scheme to predict popular content requests and mobility patterns, using the context information of UEs, such as device type, location, and other behaviors on the device. The adverse effects of training models with such sensitive data make it inevitable to consider the privacy issues related to using such data. As a result, the proposed DeepFESL scheme employs a decentralized technique, federated learning to collaboratively train shared models on UEs&#39; devices, where shared weights are aggregated at the control server. Popular contents are cached at the UAVs, where the UAVs form associations with the UEs in clusters based on predictions of the mobility patterns of the UEs. Experiment results show that our proposed DeepFESL scheme outperforms existing schemes in predicting popular UE contents and locations, increasing cache hit rate and cache utilization, reducing content transmission delays, and improving UEs&#39; QoE.},

  abstract     = {With the proliferation of wireless communication technologies, user equipments (UEs) in rural or disaster areas have data-transmission demand to upload their data to the core network. However, current networks lack coverage in rural or disaster areas due to the absence or damage of/to infrastructures. To address this issue, a promising solution is employing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as relays to assist the wireless backhaul of UEs to remote ground base stations (GBSs). For convenience, we call these networks as UAV-assisted wireless backhaul networks (UABNs). This paper aims to investigate the uplink transmission performance in UABNs. In particular, we analyze the connectivity of the two-hop uplink path from a reference UE to a remote GBS via a reference UAV. Compared with previous studies that mostly analyze single-hop transmissions, the investigation of the path connectivity of UABNs is more complex because of the location variation of UAVs as well as the complexity of the interference at the two-hop path. Considering the distribution of UEs, we exploit stochastic geometry to establish a theoretical model to analyze the path connectivity of UABNs. In our model, UEs form clusters according to a Poisson Cluster Process (PCP) and one UAV serves one UE cluster. Based on our model, the connectivity of a two-hop uplink path is finally derived by limiting the signal-to-noise-plus-interference (SINR) above a threshold. Theoretical values of the connectivity of UABNs match with simulation results, confirming the accuracy of the proposed analytical model. Our results also offer insightful implications for constructing and configuring UABNs.},

In addition, the demand of high data rate, low latency and user&#39;s satisfaction on content make content dissemination more challenging. To address the above problem which involves vehicle to vehicle (V2V) peer discovery and resource allocation, we propose an efficient content dissemination scheme which integrates both social and physical attributes of the users. V2V users are paired to share content based on the similarity in their preferences and link reliability, while considering the QoS of vehicle to network (V2N) users in both uplink and downlink phases. Moreover, we present an improved matching algorithm for channel allocation, which maximizes the sum rate of V2V pairs weighted by the intensity of their social relationship.

However, trust risks create tremendous challenges in MEC collaboration due to the distributed, complex, and unreliable nature of resource providers. In this paper, we present a trusted collaboration framework for VR video streaming to manage the video buffer in VR devices (VDs) under a more realistic distributed environment. In the framework, the rendering tasks can be processed collaboratively among edge servers (ESs) by exploring their behaviors (e.g., selfish behavior, malicious behavior, and cooperative behavior). Considering the collaborator may not be fully trustworthy, we present a novel trust evaluation method by combining direct and indirect values, aiming to ensure reliable collaborator selection. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to maintain an effective buffer state in VR devices (VDs) through jointly optimizing collaborator selection, spectrum allocation, and rendering resource allocation. Due to the fluctuating wireless fading channel and the dynamic video rate, the optimization problem is intractable by adopting traditional methods. Then, we adopt the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) to tackle this dynamic and distributed problem.

In the first stage, a distributed radio-frequency fingerprinting-based authentication model with consensus voting is designed to enhance the IoU security. Moreover, in the second stage, a performance optimization problem in consideration of authentication accuracy is formulated to maximize the data rate. It is proved that the problem can be transformed into a potential game, which implies that the optimization of the overall network&#39;s utility equals the optimization of each individual&#39;s utility.

However, the dynamic nature of VCs (i.e., limited contact duration among vehicles), caused by vehicles&#39; mobility, poses unique challenges to the execution of computation-intensive applications/tasks with a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure, where each task consists of multiple interdependent components (subtasks). In this paper, we study the scheduling of DAG tasks over dynamic VCs, where multiple subtasks of a DAG task are dispersed across vehicles and processed by vehicles cooperatively. We formulate DAG task scheduling as a 0-1 integer programming problem, aiming to minimize the overall task completion time while ensuring a high execution success rate, which turns out to be NP-hard. To tackle the problem, we develop a r anking and f oresight- i ntegrated d ynamic scheduling scheme (RFID). RFID consists of i) a dynamic downward ranking mechanism that sorts the scheduling priority of different subtasks, while explicitly taking into account the sequential execution nature of DAG; ii) a resource scarcity-based priority changing mechanism that overcomes possible performance degradations caused by the volatility of VC resources; and iii) a degree-based weighted earliest finish time mechanism that assigns the subtask with the highest scheduling priority to the vehicle which offers rapid task execution along with reliable transmission links.

This task is challenging since the amount of these resources depends on factors such as the channel quality of each UE, the packet scheduler discipline, and the GBR requirements. Under this context, we propose an analytical model to evaluate the UE blocking probability for a GBR slice. A key aspect of the proposed model is considering as input the distribution of the average Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) experienced by the UE, therefore allowing to capture the radio conditions in the cell. Our model builds a multi-dimensional Erlang-B system which meets the reversibility property. This involves our model is insensitive to the holding time distribution for the UE sessions. The reversibility property also involves the state transition probabilities have product form, so that the computational complexity of our model is low. Furthermore, the proposed model captures the SINR gain provided when the base station implements a channel-aware packet scheduler to allocate radio resources to the UE sessions. We validate the proposed model, demonstrating an estimation error for the UE blocking probability below 1.5%.},

In order to comprehensively evaluate the service provisioning capability of WMN, we first propose an end-to-end performance analysis model for reliable transmission of broadband real-time services in WMN based on stochastic network calculus (SNC). We define a general expression for the effective service process that a changing channel provides. The end-to-end delay violation bound and hop-delay relationship are obtained by applying the effective service process and the cascade theorem. Then based on this analysis model, we propose a deterministic routing search algorithm, where the initial path search sets are reduced through the hop-delay relationship. And the routes are obtained from the reduced path sets. The deterministic routing decision algorithm can ensure the bounded end-to-end delay of services with a certain probability. Theoretical and simulation results demonstrate the correctness of the proposed performance analysis model and the effectiveness of the routing algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Network slicing in fifth generation (5G) radio access network (RAN) enables serving massive network traffic with diverse and stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements. Multiple logical networks can be built using RAN slicing over a single RAN infrastructure. This paper considers three different types of slices that are standardized by third generation partner project (3GPP): ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), and massive machine type communication (mMTC). Each slice type has unique requirements for data rate, latency, and reliability. Cloud RAN (C-RAN) was proposed to address the requirements of 5G services, which involves physical separation between the remote radio head (RRH) and baseband unit (BBU) in 2-layers. While C-RAN enables more efficient resource utilization and energy consumption, it limits network scalability. Furthermore, C-RAN is unable to meet the stringent latency demands of URLLC services, as well as the massive fronthaul capacity required for eMBB requests. To address this issue, we propose a novel cloud fog RAN (CF-RAN) over wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) architecture. In CF-RAN over WDM the RAN functions are divided into 3 layers, which include the RRH at layer 1, fog nodes at layer 2, and BBU hotels at layer 3. We employ the emerging fog computing paradigm in optical and wireless networks in this suggested architecture. To facilitate low latency URLLC requests, the fog nodes are located closer to the cell site (CS). We propose an integer linear programming (ILP)-based mathematical model. The model&#39;s objective is to decrease the number of active BBU hotels and fog nodes while remaining compliant with practical network restrictions. Furthermore, a low complexity greedy heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the problem and is compared to the branch &amp; bound (B&amp;B) algorithm, which is assumed to provide an optimal solution with exponential complexity. The proposed 3-layer CF-RAN over WDM architecture achieves a 70% improvement in BBU centralization and a 50% reduction in request blocking when compared to the standard 2-layer architecture.},

  abstract     = {Flying Ad-hoc Network (FANET) is an autonomous technology that constitutes Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to establish a wireless network that is ad-hoc in nature. In FANET, without a well-established infrastructure, the UAV nodes within the network can communicate even with a constrained wireless communication range. Because of the rapidly changing network topology and unique characteristics of FANET, the existing routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) or vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are inappropriate. Thus, this paper proposes a 3D position-based modified OLSR routing protocol for efficient MPR selection, which deals with high mobility, topological changes, and energy constraint issues in the existing protocols. The proposed protocol takes into account both energy efficiency: by considering residual energy and node degree of UAVs and frequent topological changes: by combining the 3D-position information of the UAVs, which is used to calculate the link expiration time. The performance of the proposed protocol is mathematically assessed and simulated through the NS-3 simulator. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol enhances packet delivery ratio by 8%, 13.4% and average throughput by 4.46%, 19.67% on an average compared to the existing benchmark protocols “P-OLSR” and “improved OLSR-ETX”, respectively. In addition, the suggested technique minimizes the routing overhead by 6.47%, 4% and end-to-end delay by 18.99%, 25.10% on average compared to the existing protocols “P-OLSR” and “improved OLSR-ETX”, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is a promising technology for achieving privacy-preserving edge intelligence and has attracted extensive attention from industry and academia. However, in the FL training process, the server directly aggregates local models from mobile devices, which poses serious privacy and security threats. The identity authentication mechanism can provide FL with local model integrity and source authentication. However, the existing schemes are centralized, and most of them are computationally expensive, resulting in limited performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a decentralized and lightweight anonymous FL identity authentication scheme, namely DAFL. In our scheme, we first design a decentralized and simplified storage FL authentication framework by combining the directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain and accumulator. Then, we propose a lightweight digital signature algorithm that supports batch verification for authentication. Finally, nodes interact through pseudonyms to achieve anonymous communication, and the trusted authority (TA) can track and recover the real identities of nodes when malicious behavior occurs. We theoretically prove the security of the proposed DAFL. The extensive experiments demonstrate that DAFL achieves lower authentication overhead and better convergence performance compared to existing authentication schemes and vanilla FL systems.},

Although the current mainstream traffic flow prediction models have achieved good accuracy, they cannot effectively utilize the unique characteristics of the traffic network where the importance of a node in the traffic network is positively correlated with the traffic flow through the node. Actually, the historical traffic properties of nodes will have a great influence on the future. With this background, in this paper, we propose a node connection strength index by network representation learning to utilize the historical traffic attributes of nodes. Then, we design a graph convolution network based on the node connection strength matrix to predict the traffic flow of the node. A novel Dynamics Extractor is designed to learn the various characteristics of the traffic flow. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has a better performance by comparison with baseline methods.},

Most of existing signcryption schemes can satisfy above requirements, but they are rigidly compatible for a single cryptosystem rather than a heterogeneous system consisting of different cryptographic mechanisms. In this paper, we construct an efficient online/offline heterogeneous signcryption scheme with equality test (OOHSC-ET), in which the signcrypted message is delivered from certificateless cryptosystem (CLC) to public key infrastructure (PKI) system for information compatibility. Besides, this construction allows the cloud server to perform the equality test, to determine whether the different ciphertexts contain the same plaintext without unsigncryption, as a feasible solution for searching ciphertext in heterogeneous environment. In addition, the signcryption phase can be separated into online and offline manners, the former conducts the lightweight operation, while the latter initializes the heavy and preparative operation. In this way, the security and efficiency are both preserved. Finally, the security proof and performance analysis demonstrate that the OOHSC-ET scheme is more suitable for the payment operation in terms of IoVs.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) enables the integration of edge computing facilities in vehicular networks (VNs), allowing data-intensive and latency-critical applications and services to end-users. Though VEC brings several benefits in terms of reduced task computation time, energy consumption, backhaul link congestion, and data security risks, VEC servers are often resource-constrained. Therefore, the selection of proper edge nodes and the amount of data to be offloaded becomes important for having VEC process benefits. However, with the involvement of high mobility vehicles and dynamically changing vehicular environments, proper VEC node selection and data offloading can be challenging. In this work, we consider a joint network selection and computation offloading problem over a VEC environment for minimizing the overall latency and energy consumption during vehicular task processing, considering both user and infrastructure side energy-saving mechanisms. We have modeled the problem as a sequential decision-making problem and incorporated it in a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Numerous vehicular scenarios are considered based upon the users&#39; positions, the states of the surrounding environment, and the available resources for creating a better environment model for the MDP analysis. We use a value iteration algorithm for finding an optimal policy of the MDPs over an uncertain vehicular environment. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches improve the network performance in terms of latency and consumed energy.},

Besides, the limitation of the on-board energy motivates the design of a more energy-efficient way to transmit information. Moreover, the deployment of multiple UAVs can affect the quality of experience (QoE) of users. In this paper, we propose a method that combines the concept of index modulation (IM) with the UAV communications systems, which we refer to as IM-UAV, to attain an improved energy-efficiency (EE). Furthermore, based on the proposed IM-UAV communication system, a gradient descent based UAV deployment scheme is designed to maximize the downlink average rate of the ground users (GUs) in the target area. On the other hand, the maximum likelihood (ML) detection for the IM-UAV requires a high computational complexity for detection at the GUs, while providing the best possible performance. Hence, we propose a low-complexity detection scheme that can separately detect the index symbols and data symbols to reduce the computational complexity at the receiver side. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed deployment method is capable of attaining the appropriate positions to deploy the UAVs, while the EE is also improved by combining IM with UAV communication system. In addition, the proposed low-complexity detection scheme reduces the computation complexity by slightly sacrificing the bit error rate (BER) performance.},

To overcome these issues, we consider the hybrid MIMO networks to take advantages of both non-cooperative and cooperative MIMO network. In such hybrid system, the decision of whether cells operate in non-cooperative or cooperative mode, as well as the allocated bandwidth for cells are challenging due to the unavailability of channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, cells operating in the cooperative mode should optimize the quantized level selection and power allocation when the backhaul capacity is limited. To address this problem, we propose a joint learning-based and optimization-based framework. Particularly, we employ both large-scale and small-scale fading models to formulate the optimization problems, and then use the obtained solutions of these problems to determine fixed-size features in dynamic networks for the learner. Our numerical results show when the placement decision and the bandwidth assignment for cells are determined, the proposed algorithm can compute the quantized level and allocate power to significantly improve the system performance.

  abstract     = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) have garnered attention for the high-capacity and reliable communication required by Beyond 5G. However, IRS control in existing studies assumes information sharing and control instructions from base stations (BSs), thus requiring a backhaul link to the core network and BSs. This requires the construction of a network system, ruining the advantages of IRS, such as its low cost and installation flexibility. Therefore, a standalone-IRS, which is completely independent of the core network and BSs, is expected to maximize the performance of the IRS. However, a standalone-IRS cannot obtain sufficient information for control decisions, such as channel state information, which is frequently used in existing studies; therefore, inefficient control methods, such as exploration, must be used. Thus, this study proposes a significant reduction in the overhead required for exploration by hierarchical exploration and a reduction in the exploration itself using codebooks to store the results of exploration. Furthermore, to prevent the degradation of communication quality owing to the use of hierarchical exploration and codebooks, we propose an effective beamwidth expansion method for hierarchical exploration and an efficient codebook construction method based on user distribution as elemental methods. In this study, we evaluated the overhead reduction and communication quality of the standalone-IRS control by combining these methods through simulations.},

The proposed architecture is superior since it enjoys the benefits of the individual designs. We introduce a channel estimation approach of the cascaded channels with reduced overhead. Also, we obtain the deterministic equivalent (DE) of the downlink achievable sum spectral efficiency (SE) in closed form based on large-scale statistics. Notably, relied on statistical channel state information (CSI), we optimise both surfaces by means of the projected gradient ascent method (PGAM), and obtain the gradients in closed form. The proposed optimization achieves to maximise the sum SE of such a complex system, and has low complexity and low overhead since it can be performed at every several coherence intervals. Numerical results show the benefit of the proposed architecture and verify the analytical framework. In particular, we show that the RIS/STAR-RIS architecture outperforms the conventional double-RIS or its single-RIS counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent reconfigurable surface (IRS) becomes a promising technology for improving spectrum efficiency and reducing the energy consumption in the next-generation networks. To reap the passive beamforming gain of IRS, accurate channel estimation is essentially required. However, the existing channel estimation methods for the IRS-assisted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems suffer from serious performance loss, due to using the least-squares (LS) estimator and ignoring the channel sparsity in the time domain. Another drawback of the existing methods is that the channel estimation and data detection are separated from each other so that any inaccurate channel estimation would cause an error accumulation problem for the data detection. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a novel joint sparse channel estimation and data detection method for the IRS-assisted OFDM systems. The novelties of the proposed method are twofold: i) present a new common sparse representation model for the joint channel estimation and data detection, which can utilize the common channel sparsity between the pilots and data streams to significantly improve the channel estimation performance and reduce the training overhead; and ii) propose an efficient variational Bayesian inference (VBI) framework to simultaneously perform the Bayesian inference for the sparse channel recovery and data detection, where the coupling effect caused by the reflection pattern is trickly evaded by adopting an additional column-independent factorization. Besides exploiting the common sparsity for the channel estimation and data detection, the proposed method also avoids using the LS estimator, and thus its performance can be greatly enhanced. Simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {To fulfil different requirements in complex wireless communication scenarios for internet of things (IoT), terminal devices enabled with multiband and MIMO antennas are in demand. In this article, a method for designing multiband and multiport platform integrated terminal antennas is proposed using N -port characteristic mode (CM) approach. An example of handset antenna system is taken to illustrate the design procedure. N ports are firstly added along the handset, leading to a N × N impedance matrix. The status of the ports, i.e., short or open, is optimized based on the modal significances of the sub-impedance matrix at the target bands. Consequently, the optimized structure, with proper locations of breakings and groundings along the frames, is obtained. The feedings of the antennas are then selected from the grounding points based on the local modal currents of the desired modes. At the same time, low correlations between MIMO antennas are ensured by selecting the least correlated ports. As a result, six antennas are designed on the mobile handset, with two antennas covering the cellular bands of GSM900 (880–960 MHz) and DCS1800 (1710–1900 MHz) and other four antennas operating at the 5G bands of 2500-2690 MHz and 3300-3600 MHz. The proposed method is also applied to a transparent vehicular antenna for low profile and dual-band operations, showing its wide application to different terminal antennas.},

  abstract     = {Integrating digital twins (DTs) and multi-access edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology that realizes edge intelligence in 6 G, which has been recognized as the key enabler for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). In this paper, we explore a DT-assisted MEC system for the IIoT scenario where a DT server is created as a virtual representation of the physical MEC server, via estimating the computation state of the MEC server within the DT modelling cycle. To achieve spectrally efficient offloading, we consider that IIoT devices communicate with industrial gateways (IGWs) through a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) protocol. Each IIoT device has an industrial computation task that can be executed locally or fully offloaded to IGW. We aim to minimize the total task completion delay of all IIoT devices by jointly optimizing the IGW&#39;s subchannel assignment as well as the computation capacity allocation, edge association, and transmit power allocation of IIoT device. The resulting problem is shown to be a mixed integer non-convex optimization problem, which is NP-hard and challenging to solve. We decompose the original problem into four solvable sub-problems, and then propose an overall alternating optimization algorithm to solve the sub-problems iteratively until convergence. Validated via simulations, the proposed scheme shows superiority to the benchmarks in reducing the total task completion delay and increasing the percentage of offloading IIoT devices.},

  abstract     = {Based on the all-metal structure of the crossed dipole antenna, the base station antenna with heat dissipation function is realized by introducing metal PIN structures of different heights between the radiator and the ground, on the radiator, and in the hollow part inside the radiator. Through the distribution of current on the surface of the antenna, the working principle of the antenna and the influence of the heat dissipation PIN structure on the radiation characteristics of the antenna are analyzed. The measurement results of the 3 × 3 antenna array show that the operating frequency band with voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) less than 1.5 is 3.1–4.0 GHz. The gains of the central and edge elements in the array are greater than 5.6 dBi and 6.9 dBi, respectively. The front-to-back ratio is greater than 19 dB, the axial cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) is greater than 15 dB, and the XPD within the range of ±30° is greater than 10 dB. The thermal simulation results show that the maximum temperature of the proposed antenna array is lower than that of the microstrip antenna array and traditional dual-polarized dipole antenna array under the conditions of heat source power of 3.3 W, 14.1 W, and 18.8 W. The temperature differences between the proposed antenna and the microstrip antenna array are 18.6 °C, 76.2 °C, and 98.9 °C, while the temperature differences between the proposed antenna and the traditional dipole antenna array are 8.9 °C, 38.2 °C, and 50.9 °C. Under the above three power conditions, the difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures of the microstrip antenna array is 25.2 °C, 104.5 °C, and 136.8 °C, and the temperature difference of the traditional dipole antenna array is within 7 °C, while the proposed array is within 6.2 °C. All of this indicates that the proposed antenna array has strong thermal conductivity and heat dissipation performance.},

However, existing works in mmWave hybrid (analog and digital) MIMO systems do not adequately address the impact of unavoidable residual transceiver hardware impairments (HIs). This paper, considers a mmWave hybrid MIMO system with residual HIs and estimates the channel of considered system in a downlink scenario. The residual transceiver HIs are modeled as additive distortion noise, that severely affects the received pilot and information signals, which makes channel estimation a challenging task. As distortion noise is non-stationary, hence, an online adaptive filtering-based zero-attracting least mean square (ZALMS) algorithm is proposed. To ensure a lower mean square error the range of step-size and regularization parameters are obtained. Further, to achieve a faster convergence rate a sparse-initiated ZALMS (SI-ZALMS) is proposed. Furthermore, the impact of HIs on the mean square deviation and spectral efficiency is also analyzed. The proposed method offers significantly lower computational complexity as compared with the existing sparse channel estimation methods like Bayesian compressive sensing and sparse Bayesian learning. Simulation and analytical results corroborate the superiority of the proposed method as compared with existing methods.},

The mPRIDe attains lower implementation complexity with respect to its predecessor, without performance penalty. Moreover, the mPRIDe is blind, robust against time-varying noise and received signal powers, and exhibits the constant false alarm rate property. Two versions of the mPRIDe, namely mPRIDe v1 and mPRIDe v2, have been designed. The former privileges lower hardware complexity, whereas the latter aims lower latency, with both versions having a linear scalability with the number of sensors in cooperation. In comparison with the smallest area consumed by a state-of-the-art sensor, mPRIDe v1 and mPRIDe v2 consume 56.6% and 47.3% lower areas, respectively. The sensing times of the proposed sensors are 1.6 and 2.9 times better than the fastest sensing time of contemporary sensors. Moreover, the proposed designs deliver the lowest area-time-product and power-delay-product among state-of-the-art implementations. These metrics make both mPRIDe v1 and mPRIDe v2 the most hardware-efficient and power-efficient sensors reported in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), as a promising technology for 6 G communications, have received considerable attention. Herein, we investigate the downlink precoding in the RIS-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) system, where the access point (AP) uses hybrid digital and analog precoders. Due to the constraints of practical hardware and the difficulty of acquiring channel state information, we consider codebook-based passive beamforming and analog beamforming, and then formulate the downlink precoding problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To solve this NP-hard MINLP problem with low channel estimation overheads, we investigate beam training for the codebook-based passive beamforming and analog beamforming, and the MINLP problem is then reduced to a traditional MU-MISO precoding problem. To further reduce the beam training overheads, we propose a two-timescale-based beam training (TT-BT) algorithm. We prove that the TT-BT algorithm achieves the maximum codebook-based passive and analog beamforming gain. To avoid the limitations imposed the use of the TT property, we design the analog precoder by aligning the analog beamforming to RISs. Moreover, we characterize the rate loss due to codebook-based quantization. Compared with the empirical BT (EBT) algorithm, the proposed TT-BT algorithm achieves better performance with significantly lower training and feedback overheads.},

In this paper, we are committed to addressing this problem by the topology design of non-uniform planar array (NUPA) under a generalized scene where the receiving and transmitting arrays are misaligned placed with certain placement angles and a relative rotation offset angle. Specifically, the geometric structure relationship of the arrays must be investigated to derive a general expression for the channel capacity with this NUPA deployment. By applying the singular value decomposition (SVD) method and analyzing the relationship between the eigenvalues and the misaligned angles, the impact of misaligned angles on channel capacity can be disclosed, i.e., channel capacity under specific transmission distance is related to the offset angle but irrelevant to the placement angles. The NUPA design guidelines can then be acquired by using the Kronecker product. Numerical results confirm our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed NUPA topology in promoting channel capacity.},

  abstract     = {Radio access network (RAN) slices can provide various customized services for next-generation wireless networks. Thus, multiple performance metrics of different types of RAN slices need to be jointly optimized. However, existing efforts in multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) for RAN slicing are only in the scalar form, which is difficult to achieve simultaneous optimization. In this paper, we consider a non-scalar MOOP for RAN slicing with three types of slices, i.e., the high-bandwidth slice, the low-delay slice, and the wide-coverage slice over the same underlying physical network. We jointly optimize the throughput, the transmission delay, and the coverage area by user-oriented dynamic virtual base stations (vBSs)’ deployment, and sub-channel and power allocation. An improved multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (IMADDPG) algorithm, having the characteristics of centralized training and distributed execution, is proposed to solve the above non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem. The rank voting method is introduced in the inference process to obtain near-Pareto optimal solutions. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme can ensure better performance than the traditional scalar utility method and other benchmark algorithms. The proposed scheme has the advantage of flexibly approaching any point of the Pareto boundary, while the traditional scalar method only subjectively approaches one of the Pareto optimal solutions. Furthermore, our proposal strikes a compelling tradeoff among three types of RAN slices due to the non-dominance between Pareto optimal solutions.},

  abstract     = {Deploying the 5 G new radio network on the unlicensed mmWave band (NR-U) is a promising solution to meet the constantly increasing traffic demand of the cellular network. However, the coexistence issue on the unlicensed mmWave spectrum between NR-U and Wireless Gigabit (WiGig) networks becomes a significant concern. The coexistence schemes between LTE and Wi-Fi networks cannot be readily applied to support the coexistence between NR-U and WiGig networks due to the directional beamforming and propagation characteristic of the mmWave band. The directional transmission complicates the coexistence problem but opens up possibilities for increased system capacity via concurrent multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) transmission at the expense of interference management. To this end, we consider an NR-U and WiGig coexisting scenario and aim to maximize the total NR-U throughput on the unlicensed spectrum via resource allocation and inter-beam interference mitigation. The optimization problem is formulated into an integer nonlinear programming (INLP) problem and is further transformed into a many-to-one matching game for tractability. We propose a matching-based concurrent algorithm (MBCA) to solve it and the inter-beam interference is mitigated via the forbidden pairs (FPs). In comparison to the exhaustive search-based algorithm (ESA), simulation results show that FP effectively mitigates inter-beam interference and achieves near-optimal performance.

  abstract     = {Accurate channel estimation is essential to achieve the performance gains promised by the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in wireless communications. In the uplink of multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, synchronization errors such as carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) can significantly degrade the channel estimation performance. This becomes more critical in RIS-aided communications, as the RIS phases are adjusted based on the channel estimates and even a small channel estimation error leads to a significant performance loss. Motivated by this, we propose a joint CFO and channel estimation method for RIS-aided multi-user massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Our proposed pilot structure makes it possible to accurately estimate the CFOs without multi-user interference (MUI), using the same pilot resources for both CFO estimation and channel estimation. For optimization of the RIS phase shifts at the data transmission stage, we propose a projected gradient method (PGM) which achieves the same performance as a more computationally demanding grid search technique while having a significantly lower computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method provides an improvement in the normalized mean-square error (NMSE) of channel estimation as well as in the bit error rate (BER) performance. Moreover, analyzing the computational complexity and the pilot resource efficiency of the proposed method, we demonstrate that the proposed estimation approach requires low computational load and no extra cost in pilot overhead.},

However, with potential security risks, the current data trading schemes in the HetVNets lack the comprehensive consideration of the requirements of the participants including media data producers (MDPs), media data sellers (MDSs), and media data buyers (MDBs) to design a trading framework that integrates data caching services and data selling services. To this end, we propose an on-demand self-media data trading scheme in HetVNets. Specifically, based on blockchain and smart contracts, we first design an on-demand self-media trading architecture that jointly considers the data caching services and the data selling services to provide the participants with a secure transaction environment. In the data caching phase, by considering the value of media data generated by the MDPs and the sales capabilities of different MDSs, we model the requirements of the MDPs and the MDSs as utility functions and formulate the interactions between them as a Stackelberg game, where an iterative algorithm is designed for the MDPs and the MDSs to obtain their optimal strategies. In the data selling phase, we consider the diversified requirements of the MDBs and propose an iteration-based mechanism to help the MDSs dynamically determine the data selling strategies. Compared with the traditional schemes, the simulation results show that our scheme can obtain the optimal strategies for the MDPs and the MDSs and bring them the highest utilities.},

This paper investigates the secure communications of RIS assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks, where both external and internal eavesdropping scenarios are taken into consideration. More specifically, novel approximate and asymptotic expressions of secrecy outage probability (SOP) for the k -th legitimate user (LU) are derived by invoking imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC) and perfect successive interference cancellation (pSIC). To characterize the secrecy performance of RIS-NOMA networks, the diversity order of the k -th LU with ipSIC/pSIC is obtained in the high signal-to-noise ratio region. The secrecy system throughput of RIS-NOMA networks is discussed in delay-limited transmission mode. Numerical results are presented to verify theoretical analysis that: i) The SOP of RIS-NOMA networks is superior to that of RIS assisted orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and conventional cooperative communication schemes; ii) As the number of reflecting elements increases, the RIS-NOMA networks are capable of achieving the enhanced secrecy performance; and iii) The RIS-NOMA networks have better secrecy system throughput than that of RIS-OMA networks and conventional cooperative communication schemes.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, with the explosive growth of data traffic, communication base stations (BSs) need to serve more and more users. Offloading traffic from BSs has become an efficient way to reduce the burden on BSs. Device-to-Device (D2D) communications have emerged to improve spectrum utilization by reusing the frequency spectrum of the cellular frequency band. In the general environment, Heterogeneous Cellular Networks (HCNs) including millimeter wave (mm-wave) have appeared. Since the D2D link allows to share of spectrum resources with the cellular user, it will bring potential interference to the cellular user. Fortunately, an emerging technology called Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can mitigate the severe interference caused by D2D links by shaping the incident beam and improving the multipath phase shift. In this paper, we study the resource allocation scheme to maximize the system sum rate, in the RIS-assisted single-cell heterogeneous D2D communication scenario. To solve the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) problem, the problem of maximizing the sum rate is decomposed into three sub-problems. The resource allocation sub-problem is solved by a coalitional game method based on the game theory. The power allocation problem of the coalition converts the concave function into a convex optimization by mathematical transformation. The problem is solved by the gradient descent method. The local search method is adopted to find the optimum for the phase conversion problem. Then iterate until the difference of sum rate is less than the threshold. The simulation results show that the designed algorithm is superior to other benchmark schemes in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Coverage path planning (CPP) for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) plays a significant role in intelligent distributed surveillance systems. However, due to poor cooperation, most existing CPP methods may cause strongly overlapped trajectories, missing areas, or even collisions in uncertain and complex environments, leading to long task completion time and low coverage efficiency. To this end, in this paper we propose a novel multi-UAV distributed online cooperation (MDOC) CPP method that aims to minimize task completion time. Moreover, this method allows UAVs to quickly respond to unknown obstacles and complex emergencies, such as UAV breakdown or communication interruption. To establish close cooperation between UAVs, we propose an efficient environmental information map (EI-map) fusion technique that enables them to obtain global exploration in real-time in a cooperative manner. Then we innovatively develop a distributed cooperative deep Q-learning (DCDQN) algorithm to obtain UAVs&#39; coverage paths online that are determined by minimizing task time and avoiding overlaps, missing areas, and collisions. Specifically, attributing to the fused EI-map, we expand the state space of DCDQN to collect sufficient observations and design a novel cooperative learning pattern to efficiently plan the path for global optimization. Simulation results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in task completion time and coverage efficiency, especially in uncertain and complex environments. In addition, we validate that our method can efficiently complete full coverage even in emergencies.},

In this paper, we propose a DL-aided demodulation scheme for the M -ary code shifted differential chaos shift keying system with power allocation (PA-GCS-MDCSK) to enhance reliability performance. In this design, the deep neural network (DNN) adopts fully-connected layers (FCLs) to conduct the joint de-spreading of Walsh codes and chaotic demodulations. Meanwhile, the long short-term memory (LSTM) unit with the residual structure is constructed to extract the correlation between the chaotic sequences, thus the interferences induced by real-valued chaotic sequences can be suppressed, thereby improving the reliability performance. Then the computational complexity is analyzed and compared with benchmark schemes. Simulation results over both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), fading, and railway channels validate that the proposed design can achieve better bit error rate (BER) and robustness performances than benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {Real-time data-intensive applications in highly mobile environments with high data rates and low latency are one of the key requirements for beyond fifth-generation (5G) communications. Towards this end, a combination of the millimeter wave (mmWave) band with large available spectrum and orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation, which offers robust performance in high mobility scenarios, can be envisioned as a promising solution. However, employing OTFS in the mmWave frequency band is challenging in presence of nonlinear distortions attributed to radio frequency (RF) power amplifier (PA) and complex equalization involved in OTFS receiver in the delay-Doppler domain. The nonlinearity effect of PA is inevitable in mmWave systems due to the high operating frequency and large bandwidth. The nonlinear distortions induce interference and make the target distribution analytically intractable. In this paper, we propose a receiver design for mmWave OTFS systems that aims to address the challenges posed by the nonlinear distortions of the RF PA. The proposed receiver design leverages the use of a large-scale antenna array to decouple the received signal into multiple branches through beamforming. Specifically, we first derive the input-output relation in the delay-Doppler domain with nonlinearity. Then, a combination of maximal-ratio combining (MRC) and iterative particle filter (PF)-based nonlinear detector is proposed to address the issue. We also design a pilot pattern considering the additional interference from the PA impairment. Furthermore, we reformulate the threshold-based channel estimation to incorporate the nonlinearly distorted pilot in its estimation process. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the proposed algorithm&#39;s reliability and superiority over existing digital predistorters (DPD) and conventional linear detectors.},

In this paper, an energy-efficient interference management technique is proposed for heterogeneous networks (HetNets) with downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) operating in millimeter (mm) waves. The proposed technique utilizes data-driven-based power and resource blocks (RBs) allocation scheme to maximize the energy efficiency of the entire network while managing inter-user, co-tier, and cross-tier interference. The studied interference management problem is mathematically formulated as maximizing the energy efficiency of NOMA-HetNets under constraints; quality of service (QoS), successive interference cancelation condition (SIC), maximum power allocation, and the maximum capacity of each RB, which is a non-convex and combinatorial NP-hard problem that needs exhaustive search for an optimum solution.

  abstract     = {Efficient radio resource utilization is crucially important for future wireless communication systems. The advanced reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has recently been incorporated into the spectrum sharing mechanism, allowing for both spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE). Spectrum sensing is the cornerstone of spectrum sharing. Nevertheless, due to the doubling fading effect, the path loss experienced from the reflection link is thousands of times that from the direct link. Consequently, the detection performance gains obtained through passive RIS are negligible, especially in typical communication scenarios where the direct link is not weak. To address this issue, this paper proposes an active RIS assisted spectrum sensing mechanism that can notably improve the detection performance gains. Multiple active RISs are introduced and the closed-form expressions of the detection performance metrics are derived in this paper. More importantly, due to the extra energy consumption in amplifying reflected signals, it&#39;s necessary to investigate the EE maximization problem for the active RIS assisted mechanism by jointly optimizing the detection parameter and the reflecting precoding. Alternating optimization (AO) algorithm and quadratic transform (QT) method are utilized to decouple the multidimensional fractional programming (FP) problem. Then, the optimal detection parameter is obtained with a closed-form solution based on the convex optimization theory. The phase shift and amplification coefficient of each active element are optimized through the sequential rotation (SR) method and an improved differential evolutionary (DE) algorithm, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed active-RIS mechanism could outperform the conventional passive-RIS mechanism in achieving notably enhanced detection performance gains and higher EE by optimizing the reflecting precoding.},

The availability of vehicles and infrastructure is critical to the operation of applications. Accurate failure detector (FD) has been one of the fundamental components for maintaining high availability in VANETs. However, it is hard to find the vehicle failure accurately and timely due to the dynamic nature of VANETs caused by the high mobility of vehicles and communications link failures. Therefore, it is important to achieve an accurate FD which can cope with the high mobility of VANETs. In this paper, we propose a dead reckoning based FD, called DR-FD. It can predict the mobility of vehicle accurately and avoid the impact of link failures on the detection results by the cooperation between vehicles. Experimental results are provided to confirm that the proposed DR-FD method can achieve at most 20% reduction in detection time, 30% improvement in mistake rate and 20% improvement in overhead.},

  abstract     = {As the functions of connected vehicles become more complicated, the amount and type of data they generate during driving are increasing. Sharing the data among connected vehicles can improve users&#39; driving experience and reduce traffic pressure. However, the leakage of users&#39; private information caused by data sharing may harm the interest of vehicle users and even endanger their lives. Meanwhile, since the quality of data collected by vehicles varies, high-quality data sharing means users get more reliable services, while low-quality data can reduce service reliability, drive experience, or cause traffic accidents. Therefore, developing an effective and highly reliable privacy protection scheme for shared data becomes a pressing problem to be solved. At the same time, since data sharing requires low latency, it is also a challenge to introduce a privacy protection mechanism without significant delay. In this paper, we propose a decentralized federated learning-based data sharing scheme that provides strong privacy protection for data and improves the system&#39;s robustness. In particular, we decouple the data request process from the data sharing process to improve the sharing efficiency. Then we propose a TOP-K-based nodes selection scheme to improve the accuracy of the trained models and ensure data reliability. The security analysis shows that the scheme can resist attacks and achieve secure data sharing. Finally, the scheme&#39;s effectiveness and the model prediction&#39;s efficiency are verified through experiments. The results show that the scheme has high accuracy, efficiency, and security.},

  abstract     = {The mobile edge learning (MEL) system is an emerging intelligent system, which can collect the data generated by the Internet of things devices (IoTDs) and perform machine learning algorithms on the edge computing platform. However, due to the limited transmit power of IoTDs and the severe propagation loss, maximizing F-measure in MEL systems is a challenging task, which is a meaningful performance metric in machine learning algorithms. In order to address the dilemma, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless powered MEL system is proposed in this paper. In this system, the UAV provides energy for all IoTDs and collects the data from busy IoTDs for machine learning. The busy IoTDs transmit their respective data to the UAV through a direct and an indirect transmission process. In the latter one, the busy IoTDs utilize their neighboring free IoTDs that have no data to forward data. An F-measure maximization problem based on this system is investigated by jointly optimizing the minimum sample size among all classes, the transmit power of IoTDs, and the UAV&#39;s trajectory and velocity. Since the formulated problem is non-convex and intractable to solve, we propose two effective algorithms, one is based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and the other is based on alternating optimization (AO). And the computational complexity of the latter is lower than the former. Simulation results show that the SCA-based algorithm is superior to the AO-based algorithm and other baselines. The results also reveal that the proposed algorithms can converge within several iterations.},

  abstract     = {Co-prime array configuration is popular in the recent development of array signal processing. However, the assumption of Gaussian noise in most co-prime array processing research leads to model mismatch in practical scenarios of impulsive noise, therefore has an adverse impact on the estimation of direction of arrival (DOA) of the incoming sources. Moreover, co-prime array builds an enlarged virtual array by vectorizing the covariance matrix of the received signals, where the equivalent received signals of the virtual array have only a single snapshot. In this article, we propose an enhanced fractional low-order method (EFLOM) for co-prime array configuration in the scenarios of impulsive noise, from the perspective of pseudo snapshot augmentation. Since impulsive noise does not have finite second-order statistics or high-order cumulant, we construct a series of equivalent covariance matrices by using phased fractional low-order moments with different orders of the received signals. Then, the vectorization of the multiple equivalent covariance matrices can be considered as the equivalent received signals of virtual array with multiple pseudo snapshots. As multiple pseudo snapshots are constructed from the same sources, additional spatial smoothing preprocessing operations are still needed for enforced decorrelation. In this article, we propose an improved spatial smoothing (ISS) technique by applying the information of both autocorrelation and cross subarray correlation in the covariance matrix. Afterwards, the classical multiple signal classification (MUSIC) is applied for the estimation of DOAs. In addition, the proposed method can also be extended to the other sparse array geometrics. The performance of the proposed method is theoretically verified and simulations are provided to show its effectiveness in terms of the generalized signal to noise ratio (GSNR), parameter of impulsive noise, and angle separation. Simulation results show that the proposed method can greatly improve the resolution, accuracy, and degrees of freedom (DOFs) in DOA estimation in presence of impulsive noise.},

  abstract     = {In sixth generation (6 G) networks, a massive number of users and devices must be connected, necessitating flexible resource allocation. In this context, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been proposed as a promising technique to enable mass connectivity. This study presents a performance analysis for the impact of co-channel interference (CCI) on uplink NOMA networks. More specifically, it is considered that CCI is introduced by randomly deployed terminals within the cellular coverage area, affecting the reception of the base station (BS) in the uplink. In this network, fading conditions follow the Rayleigh distribution and two cases are examined for the CCI statistics, i.e. independent and identically distributed, and independent but not identically distributed. A thorough performance analysis is conducted to derive the outage probability, ergodic rate, error probability, achievable sum-rate, and throughput expressions, highlighting the adverse effects of CCI on the uplink NOMA network. Furthermore, an asymptotic analysis is provided, shedding light on the derived analytical results. Towards improving the performance of uplink NOMA, power allocation is formulated as an optimization problem, and solved to derive the power allocation coefficient of the users. Our analytical and asymptotic derivations are verified through Monte-Carlo-based computer simulations and it is revealed that the proposed power allocation method achieves significant performance gains, facilitating uplink NOMA.},

Considering the constrained power and storage resources while keeping the information freshness in S-IoT, we first propose three constraint conditions including average/peak power constraints, network stability and minimum throughput requirement. Then, we formulate a long-term age of information (AoI) minimization problem under the three constraint conditions. To solve this complex long-term problem, we transform the above mentioned constraints into three queue stability problems via the Lyapunov optimization framework, thus converting our long-term multi-slot stochastic optimization problem into a series of single time slot deterministic optimization problems. Moreover, we leverage the ListNet algorithm to derive the weights of the queue backlog and channel conditions to obtain an optimized power allocation order with linear complexity. Finally, we utilize the particle swarm optimization algorithm to derive the NOMA long-term AoI minimization (AM) power allocation problem within a practical complexity, named NOMA-AM scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed NOMA-AM scheme has the lowest expected weighted sum AoI compared to several benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework to exploit massive data generated by edge devices in developing a common learning model while preserving the privacy of local data. In implementing FL over wireless networks, the participation of more devices is encouraged to alleviate the training inefficiency due to irregular local data but it tends to increase communication latency. To solve this problem, we address non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted by intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) to accommodate more devices and tailor their channels favorably to the FL performance. For the FL with IRS-NOMA, we minimize the total latency by reducing the latency per training round dominated by local computation and uplink communication through optimization of IRS-NOMA strategies and improving the training efficiency under irregular local data through active device selection. We then propose an auction-based IRS allocation that utilizes the optimized total latency for the valuation of the IRSs when multiple base stations of different operators share their neighboring IRSs. Winner determination (WD) and payment methods are devised with multiple bids on IRS subsets in a way of maximizing social welfare. The results show that the proposed latency minimizing algorithm outperforms the benchmarks by improving both communication and training efficiency through device selection combined with IRS-NOMA optimization. In addition, the auction mechanism with the proposed WD outperforms the benchmarks, where the social welfare is improved by constructing each bid with the valuation on multiple IRSs and increasing the number of bids submitted.},

Effective SINR mapping (ESM) simplifies this problem by mapping the SINRs on different symbols to a single packet-level effective SINR. A novel ESM method, referred to as mean generalized mutual information mapping (MGMIM), is put forward in this paper. The proposed method transforms the SINR of each symbol to the generalized mutual information (GMI) and then derives an effective SINR from the mean GMI measure over different symbols. The derived effective SINR summarizes the effect of all the SINRs on the packet, which would produce the same PER performance under an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Compared to existing techniques, MGMIM does not require MCS-dependent tuning parameters but delivers competitive or even better PER prediction accuracy. More importantly, MGMIM allows reliable PER prediction when the receiver employs approximate demodulation, which boosts its applicability in practice. These features are demonstrated by comparative numerical simulations.},

To address this issue, we propose a multi-stage equalization based design scheme of multi-tap equalizers with low implementation complexity. The scheme can alleviate the impact brought by the phenomenon effectively and improve the equalization performance significantly. Besides, we analyze the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and ergodic achievable rate performance of the proposed scheme, and further elaborate its self-equalization property that inter-user interference and noise vanishes as the number of BS antennas increases. In this case, there only remains some residual interference within the same user, which is tiny enough to be ignored. Thus, SINR can approach the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) upper bound, i.e., the SIR in single-input single-output (SISO) scenario when the channel response is unit impulse. Simulation results confirm the performance analysis and show that the proposed scheme with shorter equalizer length can outperform other schemes with longer equalizer length. Moreover, even with finite number of BS antennas, the interference brought by the channels can be almost eliminated.},

  abstract     = {Active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) draws great attentions recently due to its unique nature of “changing” the wireless propagation channels via simultaneously adjusting the phase and amplifying the amplitude of signals, and is proved to effectively overcome the double fading effect when the signals are reflected by RIS compared with the widely investigated passive RIS with only adjusting the phase of the signals. Motivated by this great advantage, in this paper, we apply active RIS into a multi-user system and focus on enhancing the secure transmission performance in the presence of a malicious eavesdropper (Eve). Specifically, two types of imperfect channel state information (CSI) between RIS and Eve, namely imperfect CSI with bounded estimation error and with statistical distribution of estimation error, are considered, and we focus on enhancing the worst-case secrecy rate (SR) as well as weighted sum-SR of this system under each CSI condition. In particular, for the study of weighted sum-SR maximization, a more serious situation is assumed where Eve can filter out all the interference signals as well as the external noise generated by RIS when decoding each user&#39;s information. Given these settings, we propose a robust alternating optimization (AO)+line search combined algorithm to optimize the worst-case SR, and a dual-successive approximation algorithm to optimize the weighted sum-SR. Numerical examples demonstrate that compared with the benchmark scheme under passive RIS aided case, the proposed algorithms for the active RIS aided system greatly enhance both the worst-case and weighted-sum SR under these CSI conditions.},

These effects and constraints will lead to thermal stress and concomitant deformation, and seriously affect the safe operation of in-wheel motors (IWMs) and vehicles. Aiming at the above problems, this paper takes a 15 kW IWM as the research object. Based on the analysis of the mutual coupling relationship between the multi-physics field, such as the electromagnetic field, the temperature field, the flow field and the structural field, a thermal stress analysis model of the IWM is established and verified firstly. Then, quantitative calculation of the thermal stress/strain state of the IWM with or without eccentricity is carried out under different working conditions. The analytical results show that the thermal load generated internally leads to the generation of uneven thermal stress and accompanying thermal deformation, and the maximum thermal stress (MTS) and maximum thermal deformation (MTD) do not appear on the same component. Although eccentricity does not affect the position of the MTS and the MTD, it has an important effect on the maximum value of the stress and deformation, especially the eccentricity exceeds 30%. The results also demonstrate that the permanent magnet (PM) is most significantly affected by the eccentricity.},

To address these issues, the RNN with small sequence trained by multi-level optimization is proposed in this paper to improve the accuracy and the gradient problem of the SOC estimation. First, the small sequence is introduced to improve the gradient problem and running speed of RNN and the SOC post filter is used to increase the continuity of SOC estimation. Then, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to pre-train the RNN to obtain the optimal weight and threshold value, and the hybrid optimizer of Adam and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is utilized to improve the accuracy of SOC estimation. The experimental data of the charging and discharging test, and the performances of the proposed method, the nonlinear autoregressive with exogeneous inputs neural network (NARX), RNN, long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) for estimating the SOC of lithium batteries are compared. The results show that the estimation error of the RNN is within 3.66% and that of NARX is within 6%, and the proposed method, LSTM, and GRU reduce the error to 0.47%, 1.04%, and 0.48%, respectively. Moreover, the calculation time of the proposed method is 1/3 and 1/9 of that of LSTM and GRU. Besides, the proposed method is robust to different vehicle cycles, measurement noises, temperature variations, and battery aging.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of active jamming technology has led to a surge of interest in jamming suppression. This work proposes a one-dimensional adaptive multi-scale residual autoencoder (1-DAMRAE) to take overlapping signals (echo signals and jamming signals) as input and restore correspondingly-sized echo signals, which frames the jamming suppression as a regression problem. 1-DAMRAE incorporates three key components. First, adaptive multi-scale convolutional blocks are developed to adaptively fuse multi-scale information for a more robust representation learning. Second, a fully residual design is explored to improve information flow within and across blocks. Third, given the unknown of jamming sources, our method encodes contextual dependencies and produces a plausible hypothesis for the potential missing information to handle out-of-distribution (OOD) jamming. To verify the reliability of 1-DAMRAE, the dynamic short-range detection system model is established. Experimental results show that 1-DAMRAE achieves excellent anti-jamming performance while keeping complexity and computation cost at a low level. Even facing unseen OOD jamming, 1-DAMRAE can still achieve desirable anti-jamming performance.},

To improve the driving range without affecting the driving performance, a Dual-Motor Two-Speed All-Wheel-Drive (DMTS-AWD) electrified powertrain is proposed in this work. The system adopts a motor on the front axle and rear axle, respectively, and the rear motor adopts a two-speed automatic mechanical transmission to improve energy efficiency and dynamic performance. An advanced Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3)-based Energy Management Strategy (EMS) is used to pursue better motor working efficiency with consideration of practicability. In addition, a direct control method without complicating the structure of the actor network is proposed to realize mode selection and torque distribution simultaneously, which is a discrete(mode)-continuous (motor torque) hybrid action space. The simulation results show that the energy consumption of DMTS-AWD with TD3-based EMS improves by 6.44% compared to the Single-Motor Single-Speed (SMSS) powertrain, which is comparable to the global optimization method. Moreover, the proposed EMS in this paper has a faster convergence speed and better adaptability compared with the classic Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG).},

Next, the safe reinforcement learning algorithm is employed to design the approximate optimal controller under an online actor-critic framework. Further, a robustifying term is presented to compensate for the neural network approximation errors introduced by the actor-critic framework. Hereafter, the stability analysis of the closed-loop system is accomplished by utilizing the Lyapunov technique, which shows that SRL-RAOC can guarantee that the equilibrium point is asymptotically stable.

However, a key challenge of MEC is how to keep the delay and energy consumption to a minimum in the computation offloading process, while ensuring the privacy security of offloaded data and the load balancing of edge resources. Namely, how to simultaneously optimize multiple indicators that affect computation offloading, which creates a challenging multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Aiming at the MOO problem, we propose a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) algorithm based on double deep Q-network (DDQN). Each DDQN agent obtains rewards on different objectives according to different reward functions, and dynamically approximates the optimal offloading decision on multiple objectives. To conquer the trade-off problem among multiple conflicting objectives, we propose a weight-learning network based on radial basis function (RBF) networks, which dynamically adjusts the weights by learning the value changes among the objectives. Interestingly, we discovered encouraging potential of MORL for solving computation offloading problems in IoV, and numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional reinforcement learning methods by 30.24% in terms of overall energy consumption.},

Ignoring these factors significantly deteriorates the performance of the localization system. This paper focuses on the localization problem of AUV in motion with an unknown sound velocity and beacon calibration error. The Cramér–Rao lower bound of the concerned localization problem is first derived as the performance bound of an unbiased estimator. Next, through multi-stage processing, we design a closed-form solution that can attain the corresponding performance bound under small measurement noise conditions. Furthermore, considering that the AUV motion velocity is typically much lower than the sound velocity in practical applications, a simpler and more efficient simplified closed-form solution is proposed, which can guarantee localization performance under the condition that the AUV motion speed is low, as well as small measurement noise.

However, the fusion performance of traditional factor graph reduces when dealing with asynchronous and abnormal measurements, yielding compromised estimation results for localization and calibration. In this article, an enhanced adaptable factor graph for simultaneous localization and calibration (SLAC) in GNSS/IMU/odometer integration is proposed. First, a novel factor graph framework for GNSS/IMU/odometer integration is designed. In view of the asynchronism among sensors, the variable nodes in factor graph are built according to odometer measurement. IMU pre-integration is then used to establish the relationship between asynchronous GNSS position and corresponding variable nodes to form residuals. To properly deal with the coupling noise in the proposed model, the expectation maximum (EM) algorithm is utilized to estimate the noise parameters based on the proposed model. Simulations and field tests are done to validate the proposed method. It shows that the proposed method has better estimation accuracy for localization and calibration compared with traditional methods.

Obtaining high-resolution SAR images requires precise ego vehicle velocity estimation. A small velocity estimation error can result in a focused SAR image with objects at offset angles. In this paper, we consider an automotive SAR system that produces SAR images of static objects based on ego vehicle velocity estimation from the radar return signal without the overhead in complexity and cost of using an auxiliary global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and inertial measurement unit (IMU). We derive a novel analytical approximation for the automotive SAR angle estimation error variance when the radar estimates the velocity. The developed analytical analysis closely predicts the actual SAR angle estimation variance. It provides insights into the effects of the radar parameters and the environmental condition on the automotive SAR angle estimation error. We evaluate via the analytical analysis and simulation tests the radar settings and environmental conditions in which the automotive SAR attains a significant performance gain over the angular resolution of the short aperture physical antenna array. We show that, perhaps surprisingly, when the velocity is estimated by the radar, the performance advantage of automotive SAR is realized only in limited conditions. Hence since its implementation comes with an increase in computation and system complexity as well as an increase in the detection delay, it should be used carefully and selectively.},

Firstly, it employs a modified robust controller to generate an expert car-following control experience. Subsequently, it imitates the expert behaviors via the behavioral cloning (BC) technique, thereby developing the anti-disturbance ability. Lastly, the obtained policy is optimized using the self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL) approach. The simulation experiments, comprising both training and evaluation phases, are performed via Python. To simulate car-following scenarios, we utilize the ground-truth data from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) datasets. Through recursive interactions with the perturbed car-following environment, self-supervised RL drives stable policy improvement. The proposed anti-disturbance self-supervised RL (ADSSRL) policy presents a smooth and almost monotonously increasing reward curve. Further evaluation of disturbance dampening performance suggests that at least a 44.5% reduction in control efficiency cost and a 10.1% reduction in driving comfort cost are achieved compared with baselines.},

  abstract     = {The periodic beacon message is one of the most common messages in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) and plays an important role in enhancing road safety. To protect the identity and location privacy of the vehicle, the beacon messages should be anonymous and unlinkable under a conditional privacy-preserving authentication protocol. However, due to malicious intent or sensor failure, even certified vehicles may share dishonest anonymous beacon messages, thereby endangering road safety. In this paper, according to the three important trust factors including expectation, risk and confidence, we propose a three-factor based data-centric trust model (ERC-TM) to judge the trustworthiness of anonymous beacon messages. First, we evaluate the expectation value, risk value and confidence value of a beacon message respectively. Then, according to the qualitative relationship between trust and the three factors, we propose a trust decision based on the three factors to judge whether the beacon message is trustworthy. The proposed trust model makes the trusted beacon messages have the characteristics of high expectation, low risk and high confidence. We define different attacks according to the modification degree of beacon messages, and conduct simulation experiments in two common traffic scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed model can effectively identify malicious beacon messages. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of different attacks and the confidence values of the proposed model. In addition, the impact of each trust factor is also analyzed through ablation experiments, and the relevant requirements are discussed.},

The narrow, long and circuitous characteristics of the confined spaces challenge the conventional obstacle avoidance planning methods for vehicle operation. Therefore, this article studies the obstacle avoidance planning method for the driverless TRTV. Firstly, a novel environment model is constructed with a basic grid map and a risk one. The basic grid map describes the obstacle information with multiple planes, while the risk grid map characterizes the safety of drivable areas with five levels. Then, an improved obstacle avoidance planning algorithm is proposed by designing a risk grid particle swarm optimization (RGPSO) algorithm. Finally, by resorting to four typical map benchmarks, our proposed RGPSO is comprehensively evaluated. Compared with the existing heuristic algorithm based obstacle avoidance planning algorithms, the proposed obstacle avoidance planning method has significant merits for complex environment with narrow detours and dead zone traps. Furthermore, based on our results, a two-layer environment model is build for the case mine, and RGPSO is used for obstacle avoidance planning. The results meet the practical mining requirement.},

  abstract     = {Traffic prediction serves as a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems for applications including routing planning and traffic control. With the advances of sensor technologies and Internet of Things (IoTs), the exploitation of traffic data motivates us to reformulate the traffic-state prediction problem based on the big-data characteristics. In order to infer multifarious traffic information, the standard one/two-relational traffic data in the vector/matrix form needs to be expanded to multi-relational traffic data in an arbitrary tensor form. However, none of the existing approaches is capable of performing traffic prediction by characterizing and tracking the inherent multi-relational nonlinear dynamics which are often encountered in the realistic time-series analysis. Furthermore, there hardly exist convergence studies on convergence condition and convergence speed pertinent to the existing traffic-prediction methods. In order to combat the aforementioned challenges, we propose a new tensor Levenberg-Marquadt algorithm (TLMA) to conduct the multi-relational nonlinear regression for traffic prediction involving tensorized data. Meanwhile, we also derive the lower-bound of the number of iterations required to make the error-norm below a specified tolerance for global convergence. Besides, we derive the conditions for our proposed TLMA to converge to the optimal solution. The convergence rates with respect to different nonlinear cost functions have been derived theoretically. The computational- and memory-complexities of our proposed new TLMA are studied as well. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the traffic prediction performance of our proposed new TLMA over real traffic data in comparison with other existing multi-relational prediction methods.},

  abstract     = {A predicted trajectory guidance control (PTGC) framework is proposed to deal with the degradation of maneuverability and drivability of a teleoperated ground vehicle caused by large communication delays. Humans dominate the control of the teleoperated ground vehicle, and human sensitivity to delays is the main reason for control performance degradation. To address this problem, the proposed framework predicts the teleoperator&#39;s intended trajectory using the control commands and the 3D point cloud of the environment at the vehicle side, which is then used to guide the vehicle directly. The novelty of the approach is to attenuate the sensitivity of the human-in-loop system to delays by removing the teleoperator from the direct control loop. Delays can be compensated as long as the predicted horizon exceeds the delays. Human-in-loop simulation experiments are designed to evaluate the teleoperation performance of the proposed method at various delay levels. By means of repeated measurement analysis of variance, it is concluded that the proposed method can significantly improve maneuverability and drivability metrics at large delays(&gt;200ms), such as the task completion time, deviation to centerline and steering efforts. In addition, the results also show that since teleoperators can adapt well to small delays ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$ \leq 200\ \mathbf{ms}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ), the presented method is ineffective in this case.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) methods are commonly regarded as effective solutions for designing intelligent driving policies. Nonetheless, even if the RL policy is converged after training, it is notoriously difficult to ensure safety. In particular, RL policy is susceptible to insecurity in the presence of long-tail or unseen traffic scenarios, i.e. , out-of-distribution test data. Therefore, the design of the RL-based decision-making method must account for this shift in distribution. This paper proposes a robust decision-making framework for autonomous driving on the highway to improve driving safety. First, a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)-based RL policy that directly maps observations to actions is constructed. Subsequently, the model uncertainty of the DDPG policy is evaluated at runtime to quantify the policy&#39;s reliability and identify unseen scenarios. In addition, a complementary principle-based policy is developed using the intelligent driver model (IDM) and the model for minimizing overall braking induced by lane changes (MOBIL). It will take over the DDPG policy when encountering unseen scenarios to guarantee a lower-bound performance of the decision-making system. Finally, the proposed method is implemented on an embedded system, i.e. , NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier, and out-of-training distribution challenging cases are considered in the experiment, i.e. , observation with sensor noise, traffic density increasing significantly, objects falling from the front vehicle, and road construction causing temporal changes in road structure. Results indicate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally, the code is provided.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneously predicting the future trajectories of heterogeneous multiple agents in a neighborhood is crucial for ensuring the safe and efficient operations of autonomous vehicles in intelligent transportation systems. The unsignalized roundabout is a typical traffic scenario wherein the multivariate and complex information interactions make the prediction task challenging. To address the aforementioned challenges, a macro-micro-hierarchical spatio-temporal attention (MMH-STA) architecture, which can effectively extract the temporal and spatial features of multiple agents based on the interaction mechanism, is presented in this article. This work makes three contributions: 1) A novel hierarchical framework, which considers the heterogeneity of different types of agents, is proposed for trajectory prediction in the roundabout environment. Similarly, the macro-state for interaction with the roundabout structure and the micro-state for interaction with other agents are introduced for an agent. 2) A heterogeneous graph is devised to represent the spatial interactions of a multi-agent, which is reflected in connections between different types of agents and the properties of nodes and edges in the graph. 3) A novel heterogeneous graph attention network with a multi-order neighborhood is designed to describe the spatial feature interactions in the neighborhood. Finally, a characterized decoder forecasts the future trajectories of multiple agents concomitantly. The experimental results reveal that the proposed model can effectively implement multi-agent trajectory prediction in roundabout scenarios with high accuracy and state-of-the-art performance compared to the baseline.},

To address these issues and improve the efficiency of data storage, processing, and sharing in the IoV, we propose a vehicle-based secure blockchain consensus (VBSBC) algorithm. Our VBSBC algorithm overcomes the limitations and drawbacks of state-of-the-art approaches by leveraging blockchain technology and a consensus algorithm to ensure secure communication between vehicles. In addition, the algorithm includes an authentication process and a key distributing and request process, illustrated during vehicles&#39; movement between different zones.

  abstract     = {Human drivers have excellent perception and reaction abilities in complex environments such as dangerous highways, busy intersections, and harsh weather conditions. To achieve human-level driving performance, autonomous driving systems require powerful environmental perception systems and the ability to make accurate decisions in difficult situations, enabling vehicles to maintain smooth driving. However, making decisions based on visual perception is still a daunting challenge for autonomous vehicles, also current end-to-end networks and modular frameworks have limitations in effectively addressing perception, decision-making, and control, such as a lack of interpretability and weak generalization ability in complex environments. This paper proposes an elaborate modular pipeline for autonomous driving that effectively integrates semantic perception information, multi-level decision tasks, and control modules. The decision-making module comprehensively considers high-level maneuver selection and low-level motion control in both horizontal and vertical directions. The proposed MP framework is trained end-to-end by a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning method with a new action sampling mechanism. To adapt to the experimental scenarios, we use the CARLA simulation platform to collect data to evaluate the proposed autonomous driving framework and its new training method, considering various environmental factors such as sunny, dusk, and rainy weather. The results show that the framework exhibits smooth and effective driving strategies in different environments and can converge quickly and stably. The method improves learning efficiency and reduces unnecessary coupling and error propagation. Overall, the proposed framework and training method provide new ideas for improving existing autonomous driving systems.},

Reliable and real-time trainto-train (T2T) wireless communications are quite desirable to ensure the stability of VCTS. Moreover, with the development of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), an IIoT-based VCTS is proposed. Due to the physically exposed wireless environment, T2T wireless communications are vulnerable to jamming attacks (JAs), causing packets loss, time delay, and interference with the operation of VCTS systems. The distance between adjacent trains in the IIoT-based VCTS would be violate the minimum relative braking distance regulated by the traditional moving block (MB) principle if JAs were not mitigated. This is a severe safety events, which is intolerable for train control systems. In this study, we develop an event-triggered control (ETC) based resilience control method to mitigate the impact of JAs on the IIoT-based VCTS. A cooperative control approach, stable IIoT-based VCTS range and T2T communication cycle are jointly designed in the ETC-based model. The resilience control approach enables the communication cycle to be adjusted by sacrificing part of the system performance to ensure the safety and stability of VCTS systems when JAs occurs. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ETC-based resilience control model can successfully defend against jamming attacks, and the transportation efficiency in urban rail transits can be significantly improved even under JAs.},

The underlying mechanism behind CACC is the use of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) wireless communication networks to transmit acceleration commands to adjacent vehicles in the platoon. However, the use of V2V networks leads to increased vulnerabilities against faults and cyberattacks. Here, we address the problem of increasing the robustness of CACC schemes against cyberattacks by using multiple V2V networks and a data fusion algorithm. The idea is to transmit acceleration commands multiple times through different communication channels to create redundancy at the receiver side.

While researchers have previously developed methods to estimate the tire-road friction coefficient, methods to create a high resolution map of snow cover and ice on roads have not been developed. The prototype and data processing methods presented in this study provide a potential solution that would greatly benefit winter road maintenance teams. Having a device capable of creating a detailed map of snow and ice cover on roads would allow for more efficient plowing and salt deployment, better informing of the public about current road conditions, as well as better analysis of current plowing techniques to improve winter road maintenance operations. The measurement of the snow profile is based on the use of two types of inexpensive ranging sensors mounted on a rotationally controlled stepper motor platform. The technical challenges addressed in the development include analysis of the scan path over which the system scans the road, differentiation between asphalt, concrete, and snow surfaces using reflection amplitudes, accurate transformation of raw distance measurements to inertial coordinates, and identification of the Euler angles of the sensors using parameters associated with the scanned surface profile. Extensive experimental results and test data are presented, which show that the system is capable of measuring the snow profile on a road with an accuracy of ±1 cm when a reasonable portion of bare road is visible, and ±2 cm when only small portions of bare road are visible.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous improvement and optimization of security monitoring networks, vehicle Re-Identification (Re-ID) becomes an emerging key technology in the development of intelligent visual surveillance systems. Due to the influence of viewpoint variation and fine-grained differences, vehicle Re-ID is still a research topic worth investigating. To alleviate above problems, a novel end-to-end framework named Unified Relational Reasoning Network (URRNet) is proposed in this paper, which integrates global features with local features to obtain better recognition accuracy. For the proposed framework, to understand the overall semantics of the image, an algorithm based on the global feature graph-structure learning is designed. The pixel-level feature maps are transformed to the node features of graph in the interactive space by projection, then graph reasoning is performed by using the graph convolutional network to improve the representation of global features. Moreover, an algorithm based on multi-scale local feature relational reasoning is designed. Using keypoint and viewpoint to obtain the multi-scale partial characteristics of the vehicle, and the vehicle multi-view features are learned from the single-view vehicle images through relational reasoning and attention mechanism. The two algorithms are combined to obtain the overall model, which not only preserves the details of the vehicle, but also effectively solves the problem of viewpoint variation. Comprehensive experimental results on two public datasets (VeRi-776 and VehicleID) indicate that the proposed URRNet can practically improve the model&#39;s representation ability and generalization ability, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art vehicle Re-ID methods.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) and autonomous vehicles have been widely studied recently for on-road transportation. In the study of autonomous HEVs, the control of the vehicle&#39;s external dynamics and powertrain dynamics are often treated separately. Optimizing these two problems together can significantly improve fuel economy. In this article, an autonomous HEV following a leader is considered. First, the augmented model to integrate the abovementioned dynamics is presented. Second, the optimization problem is defined to find the optimum fuel consumption of the follower in pursuit of a leader in a drive cycle. A customized control strategy based on Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) is then explored in which the optimal cost-to-go at each time step is approximated using neural networks. Also, the accuracy of the optimization solution is enhanced by applying the concept of the reachable sets. At last, three case studies show that the examined integrated control strategy outperforms the one with the separated optimization method by an additional 7.4%, 4.6%, and 11.8% improvement in fuel consumption, respectively.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid and growing spread of automotive radar systems in modern vehicles, the problem of their mutual interference is becoming a major safety concern. This article considers the use of receive-only sensors onboard the vehicles, which exploit an external illumination source to provide automotive radar functionalities. The passive radar paradigm would solve the problem of mutual interference, allowing different systems to share the same transmitted signal. A preliminary analysis of the feasibility of this concept is carried out, exploiting real-world transmitters of opportunity. The potentialities offered by both satellite and ground-based illuminators are investigated and the expected performance is evaluated in terms of achievable coverage and spatial resolution. Aiming to enable a practical implementation of the proposed concept, an appropriate signal processing scheme is proposed to obtain maps of the observed scene. A Doppler beam sharpening approach is adopted to discriminate and localize stationary scatterers in azimuth based on the differences in their relative Doppler shift. The problem of left/right ambiguity arising from the forward-looking geometry is tackled by exploiting an array of few antenna elements on receive. Specifically, an ambiguity removal approach is proposed, based on digital beam pattern adaptation, designed to maximise the response in the desired direction and suppress unwanted echoes from the corresponding ambiguous one. The effectiveness of this approach is further improved by cascading an apodization technique that prevents the undesirable increase in the noise level. Moreover, some criteria are introduced for the design of the antenna layout, resorting to non-uniform linear array configurations. The proposed system is tested against a simulated environment, where the multi-channel signal processing, combined with a properly designed array layout, is shown to provide an unambiguous mapping of the observed scene over wide angular sectors, even operating with few antenna elements on receive.},

  abstract     = {Occlusion is a critical problem in the Autonomous Driving System. Solving this problem requires robust collaboration among autonomous vehicles traveling on the same roads. However, transferring the entirety of raw sensors&#39; data among autonomous vehicles is expensive and can cause a delay in communication. This paper proposes a method called Realtime Collaborative Vehicular Communication based on Bird&#39;s-Eye-View (BEV) map. The BEV map holds the accurate depth information from the point cloud image while its 2D representation enables the method to use a novel and well-trained image-based backbone network. Most importantly, we encode the object detection results into the BEV representation to reduce the volume of data transmission and make real-time collaboration between autonomous vehicles possible. The output of this process, the BEV map, can also be used as direct input to most route planning modules. Numerical results show that this novel method can increase the accuracy of object detection by cross-verifying the results from multiple points of view. Thus, in the process, this new method also reduces the object detection challenges that stem from occlusion and partial occlusion. Additionally, different from many existing methods, this new method significantly reduces the data needed for transfer between vehicles, achieving a speed of 21.92 Hz for both the object detection process and the data transmission process, which is sufficiently fast for a real-time system.},

First, a parametric measurement model that incorporates the practical dependence of the clutter responses on transmit frequencies is introduced. Then, based on the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test, an adaptive detector that requires no training data is developed to determine the existence of a target in a specific cell under test, where the scattering features of the target and clutter are assumed unknown. In addition, the detector has the property of constant false alarm rate (CFAR) with respect to the clutter. Moreover, under the criterion of maximizing the detection probability, we propose an adaptive scheme in which the collected data are utilized to select the transmit weights for power allocation to improve the detection. Numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed detector and demonstrate the performance improvement owing to the adaptive power allocation design.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, based on the irregular shaped geometry-based stochastic modeling (IS-GBSM) approach, a novel three-dimensional (3-D) model for cooperative multi-vehicle communication channels is developed. By employing the cooperative communication technology, multi-vehicles can form a platoon to cooperatively transmit data streams, which can achieve distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system performance. The proposed cooperative IS-GBSM distinguishes static and dynamic clusters, where continuously arbitrary vehicular movement trajectories (VMTs) of dynamic clusters and multi-vehicles are imitated. A new method, which combines frequency-dependent path gain and spectral clustering algorithm in machine learning (ML), is proposed to model cooperative space-time-frequency (S-T-F) non-stationarity with cooperative time-space (T-S) consistency. Based upon Poisson and Bernoulli processes, the developed method can also model the disappearance of links/sub-channels due to the destruction of transceivers by missiles in an optional manner. Therefore, the proposed cooperative IS-GBSM can further mimic an actual military cooperative communication scenario, i.e., cooperative multiple-unmanned ground vehicle (multi-UGV) communications for Mosaic Warfare. From the proposed cooperative IS-GBSM, typical channel statistics are derived. Simulation results show that cooperative S-T-F non-stationarity with cooperative T-S consistency is mimicked and the influences of vehicular traffic density (VTD) and VMT on channel statistics are investigated. Finally, simulation results fit well with the ray-tracing-based results, confirming the accuracy of the proposed cooperative IS-GBSM.},

Considering the unreliable UAV channel and the fundamental tradeoff between collision and idle slots in slotted ALOHA, we propose an idle-less slotted ALOHA (ILS-ALOHA) protocol that detects and utilizes idle slots to transmit control messages to drones. In ILS-ALOHA, the ground control station recognizes the idle slot promptly at the beginning of each slot and then transmits acknowledgment (ACK) and beacon messages during the remaining period of the idle slot. Therefore, it can control the access of the drone swarm more adaptively and feed back the ACK to the drones more frequently in an error-prone UAV environment without allocating additional slots. The analysis and simulation results show that the proposed ILS-ALOHA protocol outperforms the conventional slotted ALOHA-based protocols in terms of identification time, channel throughput, and probability of successful identification.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a deep learning (DL) model to estimate the channel matrix for a massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system with a one-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC). In the literature, various DL methods were proposed to estimate the channel matrix; however, they were limited to a small range of noise levels. We are driven to break the data appropriately so that the estimation performance improves with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) because the primary premise is that the DL model should perform better in the case of higher SNR. We suggested breaking the received signal into sequences to consider the entire system as multiple sub-systems, where each antenna serves the same number of users considered as a sub-system. Consequently, the model trained the data received by each sub-system sequentially. However, the conventional back-propagation with extensive training, because of the large number of base station (BS) antennas, causes a vanishing gradient, leading to training failure. Hence, we combine long short-term memory (LSTM) with gated recurrent units (GRU) to accelerate the training speed of the network under the hypothesis that LSTM effectively processes MIMO data and overcomes the vanishing gradient problem, whereas GRU accelerates the convergence rate. The results show that our model outperforms other methods at different SNRs and various numbers of BS antennas.},

  abstract     = {Wireless sensors are everywhere. To address their energy supply, we proposed an end-to-end design for polar-coded integrated data and energy networking (IDEN), where the conventional signal processing modules, such as modulation/demodulation and channel decoding, are replaced by deep neural networks (DNNs). Moreover, the input-output relationship of an energy harvester (EH) is also modelled by a DNN. By jointly optimizing both the transmitter and the receiver as an autoencoder (AE), we minimize the bit-error-rate (BER) and maximize the harvested energy of the IDEN system, while satisfying the transmit power budget constraint determined by the normalization layer in the transmitter. Our simulation results demonstrate that the DNN aided end-to-end design conceived outperforms its conventional model-based counterpart both in terms of the harvested energy and the BER.},

However, the existing content caching methods do not fully explore and exploit potential caching and computation capabilities. In this paper, we propose a distributed caching approach as well as the corresponding content addressing method. Furthermore, a problem of caching optimization with the target to minimize the average transmission delay is investigated. We transform this nondifferentiable nonlinear programming problem into a linear programming problem. Then we utilize an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve this problem. Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm can converge to the global optimum and our proposed distributed caching approach reduce the average transmission delay significantly. In popular caching strategy, the average transmission delay in our proposed method decreases over 30% and 50% when compared with caching maximum distance separable (MDS) packets and caching entire files, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Illegal intelligent reflecting surfaces (I-IRSs), i.e., the illegal deployment and utilization of IRSs, impose serious harmful impacts on wireless networks. The existing I-IRS-based illegal jammer (IJ) requires channel state information (CSI) or extra power or both, and therefore, the I-IRS-based IJ seems to be difficult to implement in practical wireless networks. To raise concerns about significant potential threats posed by I-IRSs, we propose an alternative method to jam legitimate users (LUs) without relying on the CSI. By using an I-IRS to actively change wireless channels, the orthogonality of multi-user beamforming vectors and the co-user channels is destroyed, and significant inter-user interference is then caused, which is referred to as active channel aging. Such a fully-passive jammer (FPJ) can launch jamming attacks on multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems via inter-user interference caused by active channel aging, where the IJ requires no additional transmit power and instantaneous CSI. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed FPJ scheme. Moreover, we also investigate how the transmit power and the number of quantization phase shift bits influence the jamming performance.},

This paper proposes a joint node-association and cooperative BF scheme to maximize the weighted sum rate with a low overhead based on a two-step design. In the first step, only slowly varying channel information are used to determine the node-association, analog active BF, and passive BF. In the second step, the baseband BF and power allocation are designed only using the effective channel information with reduced dimension.

Invoking the two multi-RIS schemes, namely, the cooperative RIS (CR) and the opportunistic RIS (OR) schemes, exact and asymptotic outage expressions are obtained while accounting for small scale fading and non-zero boresight pointing errors. The accuracy of the analytical results is validated with Monte-Carlo simulations. The obtained results recognize a clear advantage of the proposed system compared with conventional standalone direct THz link. Thus, with carefully planned networks, enabling direct and multi-RIS cooperation for THz wireless systems can maintain sufficient coverage in sixth-generation (6 G) networks.},

  abstract     = {The fact that integrating the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) newfangled applications in the envisioned next generation (nextG) necessitates a considerable high throughput, makes terahertz (THz) band an emerging key enabler to support stringent requirements in the nextG wireless ecosystem. To fully utilize the potential of a synergy of UAV with THz frequency band, a THz-enabled UAV communication is scrutinized in this paper, where a single antenna UAV is serving the ground users by incorporating non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme. Our objective is to maximize the total rate of all ground users by jointly optimizing bandwidth allocation, power allocation, and UAV deployment in THz communication systems. The formulated max-sum rate optimization problem is non-convex, which makes it hard to solve optimally. Therefore, to cope with the aforementioned puzzle, we adopt an inner convex approximation-based path-following approach that considers a Joint Optimization of Power, Bandwidth allocation, and UAV&#39;s Deployment (JOPBD) by utilizing NOMA scheme. Furthermore, a comparison of our proposed JOPBD algorithm, with the orthogonal multiple access, and other baseline schemes is conducted. Then, the numerical simulations are carried out to reveal the impact of our proposed approach, and also to confirm its significance for the UAV operating in THz band.},

  abstract     = {As a potential solution for the backhaul of next-generation mobile or low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, free-space optical (FSO), has received much attention recently. Various techniques have been suggested for employing an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in FSO systems, such as anomalous reflection, power amplification, and beam splitting. It is also possible to deliver more power to the receiver (Rx) by collimating or focusing the reflected beam at the Rx lens. In this paper, we propose a phase-shift design of an IRS for beam focusing. In addition, we propose a new pointing error model and an outage performance analysis for the case when the beam width is comparable to or less than the aperture size of the Rx. The analytical results are validated by Monte Carlo simulations. This paper provides essential preliminary results for future research that assumes a focused beam in FSO systems.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter (mmWave) positioning can go beyond classical localization, allowing to extract more complete situational awareness in terms of, e.g. clock offsets, antenna orientations or landmark locations. In this article, we formulate an extended Kalman filtering (EKF)-based framework called MU-PoSAC ( M ulti- U ser Po sitioning, S ynchronization and A nchor State C alibration), that allows to jointly estimate and track the locations and clock offsets of multiple users together with the unknown locations and orientation offsets of the anchors, building on angle-of-arrival (AoA) and time-of-arrival (ToA) measurements. We provide an extensive set of numerical results in the context of mmWave 5G New Radio (NR) deployment in an industrial facility with moving robots and other industrial vehicles, incorporating full-scale ray-tracing for accurate propagation modeling as well as actual uplink reference signal based AoA and ToA estimators. Our numerical results show that estimating and tracking the overall system state is feasible, and that a single reference anchor can further enhance the estimation accuracy. In addition, more users are shown to lead to better performance, due to the beneficial coupling of the anchor state. Therefore, our study demonstrates that in order to maximize the estimation performance, it is desirable to have at least one anchor state precisely known, and to have multiple users in the system. Finally, the important practical aspect of Line-of-Sight (LoS) blockage is addressed. It is shown that in the considered industrial use case, the proposed MU-PoSAC framework can offer robustness against intermittent LoS blockage.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we employ multiple UAVs coordinated by a base station (BS) to help the ground users (GUs) to offload their sensing data. Different UAVs can adapt their trajectories and network formation to expedite data transmissions via multi-hop relaying. The trajectory planning aims to collect all GUs&#39; data, while the UAVs&#39; network formation optimizes the multi-hop UAV network topology to minimize the energy consumption and transmission delay. The joint network formation and trajectory optimization is solved by a two-step iterative approach. Firstly, we devise the adaptive network formation scheme by using a heuristic algorithm to balance the UAVs&#39; energy consumption and data queue size. Then, with the fixed network formation, the UAVs&#39; trajectories are further optimized by using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning without knowing the GUs&#39; traffic demands and spatial distribution. To improve the learning efficiency, we further employ Bayesian optimization to estimate the UAVs&#39; flying decisions based on historical trajectory points. This helps avoid inefficient action explorations and improves the convergence rate in the model training. The simulation results reveal close spatial-temporal couplings between the UAVs&#39; trajectory planning and network formation. Compared with several baselines, our solution can better exploit the UAVs&#39; cooperation in data offloading, thus improving energy efficiency and delay performance.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an optimal resource allocation scheme is proposed for random multiple access (RMA) oriented sparse code multiple access (SCMA) based vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. We consider an uplink RMA oriented SCMA, where vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) users and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) users are considered to randomly choose codebooks for transmission from a shared codebook pool. To avoid mutual interference between V2I users and V2V users, the total bandwidth is decomposed into two parts for transmission of V2I users and V2V users. A joint user-codebook selection and bandwidth allocation optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum rate of V2I users while guaranteeing the reliability requirement of V2V users. This problem is a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem with probabilistic constraint, thus it is impractical to directly solve. To solve the problem, the probabilistic constraint is converted into a non-probabilistic one by approximation. Subsequently, efficient but suboptimal staged algorithms are proposed to solve the joint optimization problem. Firstly, a new decoupled Q-learning based user-codebook selection algorithm (DQL-UCSA) is proposed to find the optimal user-codebook selection relationships, which completely address codebook collision problem. Under the optimal user-codebook selection relationships determined, the joint optimization problem is transformed into a single objective bandwidth allocation problem. Then, we solve the single objective problem using a convex optimization method, which maximizes the sum rate of V2I users. Simulation results show the DQL-UCSA can converge quickly and enable a significant performance improvement by addressing codebook collisions. Besides, the proposed RMA-SCMA with optimal bandwidth allocation (OBA) is significantly superior to conventional schemes in terms of sum rate.},

  abstract     = {The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military and civilian systems access sensitive data via cellular networks and are ubiquitous. Therefore, the number of handovers may increase, and the process of sharing authentication keys between drones to new drones may be vulnerable to eavesdropping due to the wireless connectivity. For example, a UAV initially served by cell A may be handed over to cell B after a certain point. Therefore, Security and privacy concerns raise if there is a change in the flight path of the UAV due to wide-area connectivity traffic management, including authentication threats as well as the leakage of identity, location, and flying routes. Also, drones are resource-constrained devices that cannot perform extensive operations, leading to the inability to resist drone capture attacks and impersonation attacks. Therefore, this paper presents a high-performance and efficient anonymous handover authentication protocol to secure the drone traveling path. The protocol utilizes the advantages of the AES-RSA algorithm to provide efficient and secure key management and a fast verification and signature generation that speeds up drone authentication. The protocol&#39;s security was proved using the formal verification ROR model and automated security verifier ProVerif tool to validate the protocol resistance against various attacks and provided forward secrecy. In addition, the performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated using the OMNeT++ simulator in terms of communication, computation cost, energy consumption, packet drop ratio, end-to-end delay, and throughput. The results showed that the protocol achieves better security, efficiency, and performance than other protocols.},

However, due to expensive sensors and complicated architectures, it is unrealistic to deploy precise but heavy multi-modal object detectors into UAV nodes. To get over the dilemma, inspired by model compression and cross-modal signal processing techniques, this paper proposes a cross-modal knowledge distillation (CKD) enabled object detection paradigm, which achieves comparable detection performance with multi-modal techniques, yet requires less computational resource. On the one hand, in order to avoid transferring redundant feature knowledge, we design a Selective Feature Imitation (SFI) to selectively shorten the distance between cross-modal features according to their types. On the other hand, in order to transfer the most valuable prediction knowledge, we design an Adaptive Prediction Imitation (API). It evaluates the quality of prediction knowledge, and then adaptively adjusts the distillation intensity for cross-modal prediction. Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset have shown the performance improvement of the proposed scheme.},

This article proposes a novel resource allocation and precoding algorithm based on collaborative sensing in the dual-mode network.

Some practical constrains including the inter-UAV interference among the information UAVs and the jammer UAV, the maximal available propulsion energy at UAVs, and the curvature radius limitations of UAVs&#39; trajectories are concurrently taken into account. In order to maximize the minimum secrecy rate among the ARs, the AR scheduling, the UAVs&#39; power allocation and the trajectories of UAVs are jointly optimized by formulating a multi-variable optimization problem. To solve the non-convex problem efficiently, we present a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based approach, where the penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is designed to optimize the AR scheduling, and successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm is proposed to optimize the UAVs&#39; power allocation and the trajectories of UAVs. The complexity of the presented BCD-based approach is analyzed, which achieves polynomial complexity. Simulation results show that imposing curvature radius limitations on the UAVs&#39; trajectory design is effective to avoid sharp turning of UAVs. Moreover, as curvature radius increases, the system max-min secrecy rate decreases. Besides, the secrecy rate performance of the system can be enhanced by exploiting one jammer UAV to interfere with the URs.},

  abstract     = {The use of Wireless Charging Vehicles (WCVs) to wirelessly recharge sensors is a promising but not yet fully developed technology. The existing WCV trajectory planning schemes either fail to consider the directional characteristics of wireless recharging or fail to jointly optimise the mobile feature and the one-to-many feature. The objective of this paper is to find the optimal recharging scheme to minimise the energy costs of WCVs (recharging cost and mobile cost) in rechargeable networks. In this paper, we prove that the recharging group can reduce mobile costs. Based on this idea, we optimise the recharging trajectory of the WCV to reduce the mobile energy consumption. The optimal recharging group generation problem is discussed, and the problem is proven to be NP-hard. We propose a greedy recharging group generation algorithm with an approximate ratio of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$ \ln N$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , where &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$ N$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is the number of sensors. On this basis, we propose a linear programming equation to minimise the recharging delay of the recharging group to reduce the energy cost during recharging. Experiments show that the number of recharging groups generated by this scheme is 24.5% less than the circle coverage baseline method on average. The energy consumption is reduced by 49.8% on average compared with one-to-one recharging.},

  abstract     = {Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) is an emerging beyond fifth-generation (5G) technology that improves energy efficiency (EE) and removes cell structure limitation by using multiple access points (APs). This study investigates the EE maximization problem. Forming proper cooperation clusters is crucial when optimizing EE, and it is often done by selecting AP–user pairs with good channel quality or aligning AP cache contents with user requests. However, the result can be suboptimal if we determine the clusters based solely on either aspect. This motivates our joint design of user association and content caching. Without knowing the user content preferences in advance, two deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches, i.e., single-agent reinforcement learning (SARL) and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), are proposed for different scenarios. The SARL approach operates in a centralized manner which has lower computational requirements on edge devices. The MARL approach requires more computation resources at the edge devices but enables parallel computing to reduce the computation time and therefore scales better than the SARL approach. The numerical analysis shows that the proposed approaches outperformed benchmark algorithms in terms of network EE in a small network. In a large network, the MARL yielded the best EE performance and its computation time was reduced significantly by parallel computing.},

  abstract     = {Under the background of 5G and 6G super bandwidth and ultra-low delay, Software Defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization (SDN&amp;NFV) makes the communication technology develop rapidly. Service Function Chain (SFC) selection is a crucial aspect of SDN&amp;NFV, which faces many challenges of poor algorithm performance, high latency, and low profit. Moreover, most of the existing studies are stuck in optimizing for a single metric, which leads to a poor generalization of the proposed path optimization method. In this paper, we propose an SFC path optimization strategy based on the clustering of network functional layouts to address the urgent problem. First, we design a topological network identification algorithm, model the SFC path optimization problem as an attention problem and use a multi-headed attention mechanism to optimize different kinds of SFC layouts in a targeted manner. Among them, the multi-headed attention mechanism achieves the effective capture of multiple features in the SFC path selection problem compared with the traditional strategy. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Network-Functional Layout Clustering Strategy (NFLCS) in optimizing SFC paths and show the ability to optimize the service function chain paths well in future complex network situations.},

Literature works are dedicated to improving the reliability and efficiency of data delivery, to address problems such as high and unstable End-to-End (E2E) latency, high network overhead. This paper explores the routing protocol with assistance of core network to provide high-reliability and low-latency data delivery services. We propose a Multi-dimension and Priority-based Vehicle-Road Collaborative Routing (MP-VRCR) protocol to improve the efficiency and reliability of data delivery. Specifically, MP-VRCR utilizes multi-dimension indicators to evaluate the data delivery capability of candidate devices, considering trajectory similarity of data, predicted buffer time, buffer occupation and distance cost. Furthermore, MP-VRCR evaluates device priority based on geographical information, selects optimal next-hop device, and evaluates data priority to order data forwarding. Then, MP-VRCR updates the congestion status of network relay devices according to buffer occupation. Vehicles carry data bypass congested network relay devices to reduce the E2E latency. Extensive simulation results show that MP-VRCR significantly outperforms other baseline algorithms regarding delivery ratio, overhead, average delivery latency.},

  abstract     = {The semantic communication mechanism enables wireless devices in vehicular networks to communicate more effectively with the semantic meaning. However, in high-dynamic vehicular networks, the transmission of semantic information faces challenges in terms of reliability and stability. To address these challenges, a long-term robust resource allocation scheme is proposed under the Device-to-Device (D2D) vehicular (D2D-V) networks, where multiple performance indicators (user satisfaction, queue stability, and communication delay) are considered. Due to the sophisticated probabilistic form with consideration of channel fluctuations, the Bernstein approximation is introduced to acquire the deterministic constraint more efficiently. The robust resource allocation problem is proposed and separated into two independent subproblems by the Lyapunov optimization method, which includes semantic access control in the application layer and power control in the physical layer. After that, the successive convex approximation method and Karush-Kuhn-Tucher conditions are adopted to solve the subproblems, thereby proposing a robust resource allocation algorithm. The simulations reveal the trade-off relationship between user satisfaction, queue stability, and communication delay, which is on the premise of meeting the user SINR requirement. Moreover, the simulations also prove the necessity of considering channel uncertainty in high-speed mobile vehicular communication scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Spoofing attacks are one of the most critical threats against secure global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning. Since correct positioning is a must in many vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication systems, the detection of these attacks is vital. In the literature on the detection strategies of spoofing attacks, the majority of the solutions are based on the assumption that all available signals are spoofed. In this paper, we focus on detecting spoofing attacks in which authentic and spoofing positioning signals coexist in a V2X system. The observable pseudorange values are utilized with the help of derived hyperbola equations during the design of the spoofing detection algorithms. We propose an algorithm, which is named as the sub-optimal search-based spoofing detection algorithm (Algorithm 1), and it considers all possible numbers of spoofing attacking signals, but not all spoofing scenarios with the same amount of spoofing signals. To address the complexity problems based on the increased number of search scenarios of this approach, we propose another algorithm, which is called subset selection-based spoofing detection algorithm (Algorithm 2), with a smart selection of the search subsets. Both of these algorithms are first compared with fixed detection thresholds, which are determined with the Pareto front approach. Then, the performance of the algorithms is investigated when vehicle mobility and spoofing imperfection are considered. Finally, a supervised learning-based decision tree machine learning (ML) algorithm is run without specifying any detection threshold. The results indicate that Algorithm 1 provides higher detection rates than the subset selection-based algorithm; however, the false alarm ratios of Algorithm 2 are much lower than its original performance.},

  abstract     = {Massive machine type communication (mMTC) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks provide global connectivity for massive number of end devices anytime-anywhere. The most challenging part in implementing such networks is the development of spectrum access strategies to provide ultra-reliable low-latency (URLL) transmissions for a large number of nodes with sporadic traffic behavior. Such networks have to deploy spectrum-efficient transmission schemes, and thus, non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) is considered as a viable solution, that can be used to provide high number of URLL transmissions. We propose a random access NOMA transmission protocol (RA-NOMA) for IoT networks with large number of clustered IoT devices is proposed. The nodes in the proposed scheme adopt timer and power back-off strategies to transmit their short packets in a collision-free NOMA-based manner to achieve the URLL requirements. Closed-form expressions for network metrics, namely, delay violation probability, average packet latency, reliability, and effective sum rate (ESR) are analytically derived. Furthermore, the effect of blocklength, back-off timer (countdown value) and the number of active nodes on network metrics is explored. Additionally, the effect of the estimation error on the number of active nodes is analyzed and the impact of preamble transmit power on reliability in the presence of estimation error is investigated. Moreover, mathematical expressions for network metrics are also derived for NOMA-ALOHA with transmission diversity (NOMA-ALOHA-TD) in the underlying scenario, and the obtained results from NOMA-ALOHA-TD and the proposed RA-NOMA are compared.},

We decouple the formulated nonconvex problem into three subproblems. For active beamforming subproblem, we linearize and approximate the constraints using S-procedure and general sign-definitiveness technique. Then, we again apply S-procedure and convex-concave technique to handle the passive beamforming. For UAV trajectory subproblem, we apply first-Taylor expansion to transform the problem into a tractable form. On the highlights of the proposed solution, we design a hybrid semi-unfolding deep neural network (HSUDNN) to mitigate the constraints during the channel state information gain for RIS and UAV links in real-time. Using our proposed active beamforming solution and the optimality conditions, we design the unfolding-based sub neural network. Moreover, we design inception-like multi-kernel convolutional long short-term memory (IL-MK-CLSTM) sub networks to handle the UAV trajectory and passive beamforming. IL-MK-CLSTM provides spatiotemporal connection which helps in overcoming vanishing gradient problem and provides multi-step prediction. The proposed HSUDNN achieves 99.24% accuracy which demonstrates its superior performance in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art techniques in literature.},

  abstract     = {Due to the restricted computing resources and high upgrading costs, onboard processors alone cannot meet the quality of service (QoS) requirements of the emerging and constantly upgrading vehicular applications. Computation offloading is a feasible solution to the excessive computation-intensive tasks. Meanwhile, vehicular collaborative edge computing (VCEC) is a paradigm to make the best use of surrounding vehicles&#39; idle computing resources when the task density on a specific road segment suddenly increases. However, the high mobility of vehicles and the ad hoc nature of vehicular networks make maintaining stable task offloading performance quite challenging. Especially when the idle computing resources surrounding vehicles are insufficient, there has not been researching to achieve stable offloading performance. Based on this, we consider a proactive strategy that can decrease the events that affect performance stability. First, we propose a mobility prediction model for future network status prediction. Then we design an adaptive task offloading scheme based on proactive adjusting (PATO) to maintain stable task offloading performance. The scheme includes a state processing model and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based task offloading algorithm. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations in various scenarios with insufficient resources to validate the task offloading performance of PATO. Compared with the existing DRL-based algorithm, the simulation results show that PATO can improve the mean offloading utility by 95.4% and the completion ratio by 15.8%.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are an essential part of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). VANETs promise to offer drivers and passengers safety, traffic efficiency, and infotainment services. To this end, VANETs require vehicles to periodically broadcast unencrypted beacon messages that contain position, velocity, timestamp, and identity. Consequently, VANETs naturally expose users&#39; identities and locations, facilitating tracking by an adversary. To address VANETs location privacy issues, researchers have proposed different pseudonym-based privacy-preserving techniques in the literature. One of the techniques is pseudonym swap. In pseudonym swap techniques, vehicles exchange pseudonyms with each other hence fewer pseudonyms for each vehicle since vehicles can reuse pseudonyms. However, existing pseudonym swap-based schemes either exchange pseudonyms via Roadside Units (RSUs) or ignore VANETs&#39; security requirements by not informing the Certification Authority of the exchanges. Hence, they suffer from high RSUs deployment costs, inflexibility to location privacy preservation, unaccountability, and repudiation attacks. Moreover, the lower level of location privacy provided by the schemes demands further improvements. Therefore, we propose a novel pseudonym swap scheme that uses swappable and non-swappable pseudonyms to attain infrastructure independence while adhering to VANET security requirements. In this scheme, vehicles, independent of RSUs, cooperatively swap and change pseudonyms within mix-contexts having a high level of location privacy. Each exchange is then reported to the authority to enforce accountability and non-repudiation. Besides adhering to VANET security requirements, the simulation experiments show that our scheme outperforms existing pseudonym swap schemes, providing VANET users with a high level of location privacy.},

  abstract     = {To handle the ever-increasing IoT devices with computation-intensive and delay-critical applications, it is imperative to leverage the collaborative potential of edge and cloud computing. In this paper, we investigate the dynamic offloading of packets with finite block length (FBL) in an edge-cloud collaboration system consisting of multi-mobile IoT devices (MIDs) with energy harvesting (EH), multi-edge servers, and one cloud server (CS) in a dynamic environment. The optimization problem is formulated to minimize the average long-term service cost defined as the weighted sum of MID energy consumption and service delay, with the constraints of the available resource, the energy causality, the allowable service delay, and the maximum decoding error probability. To address the problem involving both discrete and continuous variables, we propose a multi-device hybrid decision-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution, named DDPG-D3QN algorithm, where the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and dueling double deep Q networks (D3QN) are invoked to tackle continuous and discrete action domains, respectively. Specifically, we improve the actor-critic structure of DDPG by combining D3QN. It utilizes the actor part of DDPG to search for the optimal offloading rate and power control of local execution. Meanwhile, it combines the critic part of DDPG with D3QN to select the optimal server for offloading. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed DDPG-D3QN algorithm has better stability and faster convergence, while achieving higher rewards than the existing DRL-based methods. Furthermore, the edge-cloud collaboration approach outperforms non-collaborative schemes.},

  abstract     = {With the development of 5G and other communication techniques, the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) is regarded as a promising solution to provide wide-range, cost-effective, and real-time wireless access. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Tracking plays a crucial role in guaranteeing the performance of SAGIN. However, UAV tracking still faces a series of challenges in the real-world deployment, especially in the case of the presence of malicious attackers, who may launch a series of attacks (e.g., message spoofing attack, routing misbehavior attack) to disrupt the systems. In this study, to enhance the security and efficiency of SAGIN when conducting object tracking, we propose a novel and secure object tracking system named SecTracker to overcome the emerging security problems in the SAGIN. Focusing on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking, we design the Local Voting based Detection Module to defend the message spoofing attack and implement the Routing Evidence based Detection Module to defend the routing misbehavior attack. Besides, efficiency enhancement mechanisms (i.e., probabilistic detection algorithm and game theory based algorithm) are proposed in this paper to improve the efficiency of SecTracker . Considering the above-mentioned attacks, the overall tracking accuracy is improved from 88.16% in existing schemes to 96.64% in SecTracker , which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system.},

  abstract     = {With the rapidly increase demand on reliable wireless communication for rail scenarios, especially for real-time services, the resource limitations of on-board users are becoming increasingly prominent. The mobile edge computing (MEC) technology can expand the computing capability of terminal equipment with the edge server and reduce the end-to-end delay in the communication structure. To meet the requirements on the response delay of task execution of on-board users, deploying MEC servers in the rail communication system could be an efficient scheme. In this paper, a task offloading scheme based on task preprocessing deep deterministic policy gradient (TP-DDPG) algorithm is proposed, and a cache-assisted framework is introduced. Considering the high-speed characteristics of trains, a relevant environment interaction model is designed by using agents and interactive training to obtain an optimized task offloading and resource allocation scheme. Simulation results show that compared with other algorithms, the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the system delay and improve the quality of service.},

Specifically, the legitimate transmitter employs non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and rate-splitting (RS) to communicate with users aided by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). In this context, we investigate key performance indicators of covert communication, namely the detection error probability and the covert communication rate. Meanwhile, we consider the physical layer security (PLS) of the proposed system in the presence of an eavesdropper, and derive the approximate secrecy outage probability (SOP) expression. Also, an asymptotic analysis of the SOP is also carried out. Various numerical results are presented that demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed analysis, which are complemented by simulated ones, verifying the correctness of the theoretical framework. From these results, it becomes evident that the use of RS, NOMA, and RIS can improve the performance of covert communication.

The STAR-RIS, which is deployed in the middle of the SNGs and adopts the time splitting (TS) working mode, can help the energy transfer in the wireless energy transfer (WET) phase and the information transfer in the wireless information transfer (WIT) phase. The paper aims to maximize the sum throughput from the two SNGs to the AP by jointly designing the phase shifts of the STAR-RIS and the working time allocated to the two SNGs in the WET and WIT phases, respectively. To solve the formulated non-convex optimization problem, we propose a low-complexity algorithm where we first derive the optimal phase shifts of the STAR-RIS in the WIT phase. Then, we adopt the Lagrange dual method to simplify the optimization problem and optimize the phase shifts of the STAR-RIS in the WET phase by the Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm and the complex circle manifold (CCM) algorithm. Next, a two-layer iterative algorithm is used to obtain the optimal values of time allocated to the two SNGs. Finally, we evaluate the improvement of the proposed scheme by the simulation results compared with other benchmark schemes..},

  abstract     = {The integration of integrated access and backhaul (IAB) and full-duplex communications on unlicensed bands can improve the spectrum efficiency and mitigate the spectrum resource shortage. To guarantee fair coexistence on unlicensed spectrum, the listen-before-talk mechanism needs to be executed at the IAB nodes, where the clear channel assessment (CCA) is applied before transmission. However, the residual self-interference (RSI) brought by the full-duplex communication may degrade the CCA detection performance tremendously. Therefore, in this paper we propose an adaptive channel detection scheme for the full-duplex IAB network to minimize the impact of RSI on the CCA detection, which can enhance the spectrum efficiency. In particular, the closed-form expressions of false alarm probability and detection probability are derived. Accordingly, the energy detection (ED) threshold applied in CCA is adjusted adaptively to improve the system throughput. Then, a novel timing sequence with respect to the self-interference cancellation and CCA detection is proposed. The corresponding optimal initial threshold is also derived to realize the adaptive ED threshold. Furthermore, an enhanced request to send/clear to send mechanism is proposed to solve the hidden terminal problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed schemes can effectively reduce the impact of RSI on the CCA detection accuracy and significantly improve the system throughput.},

We consider two radar sensing design criteria, including the conventional sensing beampattern matching and the newly proposed minimum weighted beampattern gain maximization, respectively. Under this setup, we maximize the radar sensing performance while ensuring the communication users&#39; individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements subject to the BS&#39;s maximum transmit power constraints. In particular, we consider two types of communication receivers, namely Type-I and Type-II receivers, which do not have and do have the capability of cancelling the interference from the a-priori known dedicated radar signals, respectively. Under both Type-I and Type-II receivers, the beampattern matching and minimum weighted beampattern gain maximization problems are non-convex and thus difficult to be optimally solved in general. Fortunately, via applying the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique, we obtain the globally optimal solutions to these problems by rigorously proving the tightness of their SDRs. Besides, for both design criteria, we show that dedicated radar signals are generally beneficial in enhancing the system performance with both types of receivers under general channel conditions, while the dedicated radar signals are not required with Type-I receivers under the special case with line-of-sight (LOS) communication channels. Numerical results show that the minimum weighted beampattern gain maximization design significantly outperforms the beampattern matching design, in terms of much higher beampattern gains at the worst-case sensing angles and much lower computational complexity in solving the corresponding problems. It is also shown that by exploiting the capability of cancelling the interference caused by the dedicated radar signals, the case with Type-II receivers results in better sensing performance than that with Type-I receivers and other conventional designs.},

It is known that in this regime, reliable channel state information, both imperfect and perfect, cannot be obtained owing to energy constraints and limitations. This suggests the need for schemes which can perform well without channel state information. In this work, we present one such scheme, called wideband time frequency coding, which achieves rates on the order of the additive white Gaussian noise capacity without requiring any channel state information. Wideband time frequency coding combines impulsive frequency shift keying with pulse position modulation, which allows for information to be encoded in both the transmitted frequency and the transmission time period. On the detection side, we propose a non-coherent decoder based on a square-law detector, akin to the optimal decoder for frequency shift keying based signals. The impacts of various parameters on the symbol error probability and capacity of wideband time frequency coding are investigated, and the results show that it is robust to shadowing and highly fading channels. When compared to other modulation schemes such as code division multiple access, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, pulse position modulation, and impulsive frequency shift keying without channel state information, wideband time frequency coding achieves higher rates in the wideband regime, and performs comparably in smaller bandwidths.},

This technique is important since a key issue often overlooked in most single-RF systems, including SSK, is pulse shaping. The proposed pulse shaping technique is based on using an electronically steerable parasitic array radiator (ESPAR). It can avoid the bandwidth expansion arising from switching in SSK while enhancing spectral efficiency (SE) compared to conventional time-limited pulse shaping. In the proposed approach, we pulse shape the parasitic loads of the antennas in the ESPAR by using pulse shaped baseband control voltages to continuously vary the parasitic loads. This is enabled by developing an approximate linear mapping from the baseband control voltages to the ESPAR element currents. Simulation results of the proposed technique are provided, including the continuous-time ESPAR current and its power spectrum density, adjacent channel power ratio, symbol error rate (SER), SE, and energy efficiency (EE). It is shown that the proposed technique can perform spectrally efficient pulse shaping for beamspace SSK and achieve higher SE and EE than time-limited pulse shaping while maintaining the same SER.},

The FD EV can concurrently exploit its antennas to spoof one UE pilot and to estimate its link to the same UE in the uplink, and then to eavesdrop the UE&#39;s data and perform directional jamming in the downlink. From the perspective of the EV, we derive an expression for the ergodic rate difference, which is general for any possible overlap between spoofing and jamming antenna subsets. Residual spoofing and jamming self-interferences and their statistical dependencies are accounted for in the derived expression. The EV optimizes the trade-off between both spoofing-jamming powers, and antenna subsets to minimize the ergodic rate difference. Numerical results show that the EV is capable of destroying the security of the legitimate communication with a small number of antennas and a power budget equal to that of the attacked UE. The severity of the attack depends on the EV&#39;s knowledge of the power allocation strategies used at the base station (BS).},

  abstract     = {Near-optimal designs consisting of a pair of finite resolution analog precoder and combiner and a baseband encoder for hybrid massive MIMO communication systems are proposed in this paper. Firstly, for any configuration of hybrid MIMO systems, several powerful upper bounds on the maximal achievable rates are presented and are used as guidelines for the proposed designs. Armed with the insights of upper bounds, designing the coefficients for finite resolution analog precoders and combiners is then regarded as a lattice decoding problem, where low-complexity lattice decoders and convex solvers are employed to yield optimal solutions with the best structure for partial connection. Simulation results show that the proposed design achieves within a negligible gap from the rate upper bound using phase shifters with low resolution, while reducing the number of required phase shifters by roughly 20% and significantly outperforming many existing designs at the same time.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter-wave(mmWave) communication is a key technology that enables autonomous vehicles and roadside units to collaborate in environment perception, thereby improving traffic efficiency and safety to a new level. Some recent works have focused on relay-based solutions to overcome inherent defects of mmWave, such as severe path loss and high sensitivity to obstacles. However, they both neglect the selfish behaviors of vehicles. Considering the application-oriented nature of vehicular communication, we propose an information value-based relay strategy in this article to characterize the selfishness of vehicles, which enables vehicles to make relay decisions through the value assessment of messages. Specifically, an extensible relay probability model is introduced to evaluate the information value based on the required awareness range of vehicles. By using stochastic geometry (SG), we construct an integrated three-dimensional (3D) system model for the vehicular relay-based vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) mmWave downlink, and derive the exact expressions of both blockage and outage probabilities. Simulations verify the analytical results and reveal the highest connection reliability of the vehicle exists and relies on both network- and application-related parameters. Moreover, the selfishness of vehicles deteriorates the connection reliability, especially under the conditions of the small information value of forwarded messages. These results laid the foundation for the further expansion of the information value-based relay strategies to a wider range of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications.},

To assess the impact of user placement on the system performance, three user pairing schemes are designed. Closed-form expressions for the outage probability, diversity order, diversity-multiplexing trade-off (DMT), and system throughput are derived under different user location distributions, revealing that the novel SWIPT-assisted impartial cooperative NOMA improves these metrics of the near user, and does not degrade those of the far user, compared with the conventional schemes.

  abstract     = {The fifth generation (5G) communication system aims to support diverse services such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC). In order to enable the coexistence of eMBB and URLLC services on a common physical infrastructure, network slicing incorporated in the distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output (DM-MIMO) system is regarded as a promising solution. In this paper, a non-orthogonal slicing scheme is proposed to improve the spectral efficiency, and the short packet transmission is adopted for URLLC to meet the low latency requirement. Through a joint optimization of beamforming and remote radio unit (RRU) selection, we investigate the energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem for the downlink DM-MIMO system. The formulated problem is a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP) that we solve by applying some efficient approaches, such as the Dinkelbach method, the reweighted &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\ell _{1}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -norm and difference of convex (DC) programming. By combining these approaches in one iteration, a double-loop procedure based on semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) is employed to find the suboptimal solution of the problem. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the EE of the DM-MIMO system and efficiently manages resource allocation.},

Our objective is to maximize the system sum-rate subject to the constraint of minimum user data rate, the total power of base station, SCMA codebook structure, and IRS channel coefficients. To this end, a joint optimization problem involving IRS phase vector, factor graph matrix assignment, and power allocation problem is formulated, which is non-convex in nature. This problem is solved by developing an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. A key idea is to first divide the formulated non-convex problem into three subproblems (i.e., factor graph matrix assignment, power allocation, and phase vector of IRS) and then tackle them iteratively. The validity of the proposed schemes is shown using the simulation results. Moreover, compared to the SCMA system without IRS, a significant performance improvement in the IRS-aided SCMA system is shown in terms of achievable sum-rate.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are a promising technology for future-generation wireless networks by extending coverage region to blind spots and increasing mmWave propagation paths in non-line of sight environments. User association (UA) in dense millimeter wave (mmWave) networks is vital to characterizing connections among base stations (BSs) and mobile users for load balancing, interference management, and maximizing network utility. However, it has yet to be examined thoroughly in a multi-IRS-aided network. This paper presents a new UA scheme that takes cell interference into account for a multi-cell mmWave cellular network aided with multiple IRSs. We formulate a network spectral efficiency maximization problem by jointly optimizing active beamforming (AB) at the BSs, passive beamforming (PB) at the IRSs, and user-BS association with consideration of the impact of IRSs. We then propose a computationally efficient iterative algorithm based on alternating optimization (AO) to resolve this intractable mixed-integer non-convex problem. A fractional programming technique is used to optimize active beamforming at the BSs and passive beamforming at the IRSs, and a penalization method combined with successive convex programming is applied for UA optimization, which is shown to reach the optimal solution. Simulation results show significant performance improvements obtained by the proposed algorithm, providing higher spectral efficiency compared to several benchmark algorithms, while having a low computational complexity.},

These IoT devices with different amounts of data and are sparsely located in an untraveled area. In this scenario, we consider minimizing the UAV&#39;s cruise time by jointly optimizing the clustering strategy of the IoT devices, the association strategy between the UAV and the IoT devices, the UAV&#39;s trajectory, and the bandwidth allocation strategy. Traditionally, the minimal cruise time is obtained by visiting all IoT devices one by one and this will lead to huge cost. To address this problem, affinity propagation (AP) algorithm is proposed to cluster all these IoT devices first of all. Then, to avoid visiting all devices one by one and realize parallel computation of data collection time, the entire UAV&#39;s flying process is divided into two phases, namely, the inter-cluster phase and the intra-cluster phase. For the inter-cluster phase, the minimal cruise time is formulated to minimize total distance among clusters using the traveling salesman problem with a neighborhood (TSPN)-based algorithm. Subsequently, for the intra-cluster phase, we formulate the collecting time minimization problem in each cluster as a mix-integer non-convex optimization problem. To address these issues, we design a two-loop algorithm involving the bisection search, the altering optimization (AO), and the successive convex approximation (SCA) methods.

Nevertheless, any of the existing array configurations with fixed number of sensors corresponds to a certain array element arrangement, the virtual coarray and the uniform DOF may be affected significantly when the positions of one or several sensors changed. In this paper, a generalized nested array (GNA) configuration family is proposed by incorporating the concept of family into array design. The arrays in GNA family generally consist of three subarrays, and the inherent geometric characteristic is analyzed from the perspective of two-dimensional (2D) representation. For the array configurations of GNA family, one can be transformed into another by setting order factor, thus they can provide more flexible element arrangements as compared to a specific array configuration. Moreover, each array of the GNA family has hole-free difference coarray. Based on the GNA family, compressive sensing (CS) approach is employed for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation by solving an l 1 norm minimization problem. The theoretical propositions are proved and numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed GNA family and the DOA estimation.},

In this paper, we develop an effective and efficient method to deal with this intractable optimization task. First, we explore the most promising azimuth and downtilt configurations of each antenna with a branch-and-bound procedure followed by a semi-definite relaxation algorithm, which finally generates a codebook with finite elements to reduce the unnecessary searches for similar or unpromising configurations during global search; second, a Monte Carlo tree search method is introduced to iteratively optimize the azimuths and downtilts of all antennas, aiming at alleviating the mutual interference of adjacent antennas to maximize the signal-to-interference ratio of the target service area, during which the generated antenna configuration codebook guides the iterative search process efficiently. Experiment results in real urban scenarios show that our proposed method can produce the best signal-to-interference ratio coverage as compared with state-of-the-art ones. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can scale up straightforwardly, making it a competitive choice for large-scale network optimization.},

The antenna consists of 16 dual-band units and a double layer coding metasurface (CMS) which can transmit and reflect electromagnetic (EM) waves in the sub-6 GHz and X-band, respectively. The CMS is located underneath the antenna array, which is not only used as the reflector to increase gain and to transform the polarization for the higher frequency band, but also acts as a bandpass lens to realize the beam-forming for the lower frequency band. The proposed antenna has a very low profile (8.5 mm) and the bandwidth is sufficiently large to meet the need of vehicular communications. The simulated and measured results show that the -10 dB impedance bandwidth is from 5.58 to 5.85 GHz for the lower band and is from 9.79 to 10.09 GHz for the higher band. The maximum gain at 9.88 GHz (for satellite), at 5.73 GHz (for terrestrial) and at 5.83 GHz (for in-car) are more than 19.54 dBic., 14.03 dBi and 5.35 dBi, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The dwell time resource is usually limited when a phased array radar (PAR) tracks multiple targets. In this paper, a fast solver is proposed for the dwell time allocation (DTA) in the cluttered environments. The optimization model is established as minimizing the worst case of position Bayesian Cramér-Rao lower bounds (BCRLBs) among multiple targets under the constraint of total dwell time budget. The BCRLB minimization is hindered by the intractable information reduction factor (IRF) term, which expresses the information loss due to clutter. By replacing the IRF with its upper bound, the probability of detection (PD), we formulate a closed-form objective function-based optimization problem. By using the strictly decreasing property of the BCRLB, two optimal conditions are proposed to obtain a unique subset of the optimal solutions. Then, the remaining parts can be directly set as the lower or upper bounds. Simulation results confirm the competitive performance and computation saving, compared with existing convex optimization-based methods and the sequential relaxation-based method, especially when facing a large number of targets. The target with a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) will be given more dwell time resources.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) with two way relaying (TWR) is an emerging paradigm towards cellular fifth/sixth generation (5G/6G) technology that can support various data hungry applications with improve coverage, network throughput, and reliability. The foreseen potential of mmWave TWR system can be further alleviated by using large-scale multiple input multiple output (MIMO) architecture. However, high power consumption, hardware complexity and cost of fully digital large-scale MIMO architecture restricts its application. As a countermeasure, hybrid precoding structures with reduced RF chains are utilized. Therefore, the amalgamation of TWR MIMO mmWave system with hybrid precoding structure demands an accurate channel state information (CSI) to avail the maximum gain of two way MIMO communications. Furthermore, the inherent self-interference in TWR systems in collusion with sparse mmWave channels imposes severe challenges in acquiring accurate CSI. The challenge is further aggravated in case of frequency-selective mmWave channel. To solve this problem, we propose a novel iterative variational Bayesian inference (IVBI)-based channel estimation (CE) scheme in the time domain for TWR system with reduced RF chain. In the proposed method, we follow the alternative minimization method involving variational Bayesian inference (VBI) to estimate all the channels of mmWave TWR system. The performance of the proposed algorithm are evaluated over both flat fading and frequency-selective channel. Extensive simulation results for symmetric and non-symmetric MIMO structure validate the proposed algorithm. The Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound (BCRB) of the proposed estimator is also derived. This novel scheme converges fast and achieves significant improvement in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and bit error rate (BER) as compared to state-of-art.},

  abstract     = {The Space-Ground Integrated Network (SGIN) concept constitutes a promising solution for providing seamless global coverage. However, the mobility of satellites and wireless terminals imposes unprecedented challenges on the location management in SGIN. We tackle this challenge by conceiving a split identifier (ID) and Network Address (NA) based design for providing natural mobility support, and characterize the ID-NA mapping allocation problem by exploiting the storage capacity of both Geostationary Earth Orbit Satellites (GEOSs) and Low Earth Orbiting Satellites (LEOSs) to form a spatially distributed binding resolution system and optimize the caching reward in each LEOS. By considering the large quantity of ID-NA mapping and the sparsity of popular mapping having positive mean caching rewards, we formulate the mapping allocation problem as a sparse Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) learning procedure, where the mappings are treated as the arms and the LEOSs act as the players. A distributed learning algorithm, namely the Sparse Upper confidence bound based Learning aided Caching algorithm (SULC), is proposed for estimating the mean caching rewards of mappings and selecting the optimal mappings for caching. Moreover, we derive a sub-linear upper bound of the cumulative learning regret to prove the learning efficiency of the proposed SULC. Extensive simulations have been conducted to show that the proposed SULC can quickly identify the popular mappings and provide near-optimal content hit rates. In contrast with the existing solutions, SULC has higher caching rewards and can significantly reduce the cumulative regret after a short period of learning.},

  abstract     = {As the resolution of video becomes high and the number of mobile devices proliferates, the demand for video traffic is exploding. New traffic types, such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), which require high-throughput and low-latency, are also emerging. Two of the promising techniques discussed in increasing throughput and lowering latency are multi-link transmission and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). However, in most cases of a device using a low-cost chipset, there are potential limitations to using HARQ on multi-link. This article proposes a HARQ-based adaptive retransmission control scheme (HARE), which determines the optimal retransmission policy by casting it as a Markov decision process (MDP) for the devices undergoing the aforementioned limitations. Through this, we can decide whether to execute HARQ and select the adequate modulation and coding rate when a retransmission occurs. Through extensive analysis, we found that HARE can greatly increase throughput compared to the ARQ-only and HARQ-only retransmission methods with a small amount of buffer occupancy. This technique expects high-resolution video and brand-new services such as AR/VR to be enjoyed even by the devices with low-cost chipsets.},

The proposed PLS precoder is reinforced with secret parameter exchange with Bobs and a CSI acquisition model is proposed to reduce the PLS algorithm&#39;s computational load substantially at the transmitter. The closed-form expressions for the achievable secrecy rates and their upper and lower bounds are derived. Via Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm that Bobs can successfully decode their information in various user configurations while Eve&#39;s received SINR is significantly worsened by the jamming signal induced by the proposed precoder with secret key exchange. It is also shown that Eve&#39;s bit error rate (BER) is increased to the 0.5-level for almost any position in the considered indoor environment. Finally, we corroborate the derived secrecy expressions by computer simulations and show that the proposed scheme provides PLS for Bobs.},

  abstract     = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems using sub-Terahertz (sub-THz) wave bands are viewed as a promising way to increase greatly the capacity of future mobile communications because they can provide a wider bandwidth than conventional wireless communications. Distributed mMIMO systems can improve the spatial multiplexing transmission performance by reducing spatial correlations among the MIMO channels in line-of-sight environments. Unfortunately, beam search is more complex than in conventional wireless communications, because each access point (AP) requires a very narrow beamwidth to compensate for the significant propagation attenuation in sub-THz waves and beam search must involve all distributed APs. To address this problem, this paper proposes a fast beam search method to limit the beam-sweep directions of beam sweep based on the beam combinations selected for the distributed APs in the past. Simulations show that the proposed method maintains the transmission capacity while greatly reducing the number of search beams compared to conventional all-AP exhaustive beam search. The results show based on 16 APs that while matching the transmission capacity attained by all-AP exhaustive or two-stage beam search methods, the proposed method reduces the number of search beams by APs (excluding the initial AP executed exhaustive beam search) by 90.8% at the 50th percentile and 62.5% at the 95th percentile compared to two-stage beam search for 50,000 sets of user equipment used for recording beam combinations before evaluating the performance.},

To maximize the sum rate of all the users, the trajectory of the UAV and its transmit beamforming, as well as the passive beamforming at the IRS, are optimized jointly. Specifically, a block coordinate descent method is firstly leveraged to decompose the original non-convex optimization problem into three tractable subproblems. By developing an alternate iterative algorithm, the transmit beamforming at the UAV, the passive beamforming at the IRS, and the trajectory of the UAV are circularly optimized by employing fractional programming, semidefinite programming, reinforcement learning, etc. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization scheme is feasible in the proposed IRS backscatter communication network.},

Hence, the IRS is used to assist the communication system, however, the impacts of inter-cell interference (ICI) on cell-edge users are severe in multi-cell communications but have been ignored in most literature about IRS-assisted communication systems. In this paper, we consider the downlink transmission of cell-edge users in multi-cell millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems with the aid of multiple IRSs deployed at the cell boundary. To suppress the ICI, we maximize the weighted sum-rate (WSR) by jointly optimizing the IRS-user association matrix, the transmit beamforming of mmWave base stations (MBSs), and the phase shifts of IRSs, subject to the power limits of MBSs, the reflection constraints of IRSs, and the association constraints. Then, a joint IRS-user association and beamforming algorithm with alternating optimization (AO) framework is developed to tackle the mixed-integer non-convex problem. Specifically, a simplified objective function with respect to the association variables is derived and the non-convex binary constraints are handled by the relaxation operation and the first-order Taylor expansion, while the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality (AGMI)-based rank-one relaxation algorithm and the ring-based penalty convex-concave procedure (CCP) method are proposed for obtaining the transmit beamforming matrix of MBSs and the phase shifts of IRSs, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the benchmark schemes. The useful insights into the optimization of IRS-user association and design of the number of elements of IRSs are also presented for future networks.},

For the global CSI scenario, we first enhance zero-forcing (ZF), maximum ratio transmission and combining (MRTC), and minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) beamforming to be compatible with multi-antenna users and IBFD base stations. Then, we investigate beamforming schemes for the local CSI assumption where only intra-cell channel knowledge is fully available at the base stations, and inter-cell channels are known statistically due to the limited training resources. With these limitations, two MMSE-based methods are proposed, which regard unknown CSI as random instances (i.e., eMMSE-RI) and noise (i.e., eMMSE-N). We explore the self-interference cancellation (SIC) capability of beamformers and evaluate the performance of these methods in 3GPP scenarios. Numerical results reveal that the enhanced MMSE beamforming can achieve the desired IBFD with low analog SIC depth, inspiring a low-cost IBFD transceiver design. The practical imperfections (e.g., transceiver HWIs, channel uncertainty, limited CSI) decrease the achievable sum rate but do not reduce the IBFD gain. With CSI limitations, eMMSE-RI outperforms eMMSE-N for microcells, where the probability of the presence of LOS is high, whereas eMMSE-N performs better when cell size is enlarged.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive decoding mechanism (ADM) for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled uplink (UL) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communications. Specifically, considering a harsh UAV environment, where ground-to-ground links are regularly unavailable, the proposed ADM overcomes the challenging problem of conventional UL-NOMA systems whose performance is sensitive to the transmitter&#39;s statistical channel state information and the receiver&#39;s decoding order. To evaluate the performance of the ADM, we derive closed-form expressions for the system outage probability (OP) and system throughput. In the performance analysis section, we provide novel expressions for practical air-to-ground and ground-to-air channels, while taking into account the practical implementation of imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) in UL-NOMA. Moreover, the obtained expression can be adopted to characterize the OP of various systems under a Mixture of Gamma (MG) distribution-based fading channels. Next, we propose a sub-optimal Gradient Descent-based algorithm to obtain the power allocation coefficients that result in maximum throughput with respect to each location on UAV&#39;s trajectory. To determine the significance of the proposed ADM in nonstationary environments, we consider the ground users and the UAV to move according to the Random Waypoint Mobility (RWM) and Reference Point Group Mobility (RPGM) models, respectively. Accurate formulas for the distance distributions are also provided. Numerical solutions demonstrate that the ADM-enhanced NOMA not only outperforms Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA), but also improves the performance of UAV-enabled UL-NOMA even in mobile environments.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study a novel joint information-theoretic secrecy and covertness model for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted finite blocklength transmission system, in which an UAV delivers classified information to a ground user (Bob) in the presence of two unauthorized users (Eve and Willie). Specifically, Eve tries to decode the legitimate information while Willie tries to detect if the UAV&#39;s transmission is present or not. Firstly, we assume that the perfect location knowledge of both Eve and Willie is known at the UAV. In this scenario, to guarantee security and covertness, the average secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated via joint design of the UAV&#39;s transmit power and three dimensional (3D) trajectory under Willie&#39;s covertness constraint. Technically speaking, the optimization problem is non-convex and mathematically intractable to tackle owing to the coupling of multiple variables. To address this non-convex problem, an iterative alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed with the assistance of the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. After that, we extend the system model to both Eve&#39;s and Willie&#39;s imperfect location knowledge case, which is more sophisticated compared to the perfect location knowledge case due to the uncertain location constraints. We still utilize the iterative AO algorithm combined with SCA and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathcal {S}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -procedure techniques to cope with the nonconvex problem. Numerical results indicate that our proposed 3D optimization algorithm performs better than the conventional two dimensional (2D) scheme and the benchmark scheme for both perfect and imperfect location knowledge cases.},

  abstract     = {Transmit beamforming is a diversity technique in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. It improves the diversity order and enhances the information security of the MIMO systems. In this paper, we mathematically analyze the secure performance of a MIMO decode-and-forward (DF) relay system under the presence of an eavesdropper and with the imperfect channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropping channel. To enhance the secrecy performance, we employ multiple antennas at all legitimate nodes and utilize two linear beamforming schemes, i.e., maximal ratio transmission (MRT) and transmission zero-forcing (TZF), at the transmitter and maximal ratio combining (MRC) scheme at the receiver. The probability density function (PDF) of the output SNR for different numbers of antennas at the transmitter and receiver is plotted and discussed. After that, we apply this PDF to derive the closed-form expressions of the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and ergodic secrecy capacity (ESC) of the considered MIMO-DF relay system over Rayleigh fading channels for MRT/MRC and TZF/MRC schemes. In addition, based on the obtained analysis results, we provide the location of the relay that minimizes the system SOPs. All the analysis results are validated by Monte-Carlo simulations. The results show that the TZF/MRC scheme provides better SOP and ESC than the MRT/MRC scheme. Moreover, the number of antennas at the legitimate nodes and the location of the eavesdropper significantly impact the secrecy performance.},

In this paper, we study a downlink STAR-RIS-based multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) mmWave hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (H-NOMA) wireless network, where a sum-rate maximization problem has been formulated. The design of active and passive beamforming vectors, time and power allocation for H-NOMA is a highly coupled non-convex problem. To handle the problem, we propose an optimization framework based on alternating optimization (AO) that iteratively solves active and passive beamforming sub-problems. Channel correlations and channel strength-based techniques have been proposed for a specific case of two-user optimal clustering and decoding order assignment, respectively, for which analytical solutions to joint power and time allocation for H-NOMA have also been derived. Simulation results show that: 1) the proposed framework leveraging H-NOMA outperforms conventional OMA and NOMA to maximize the achievable sum-rate; 2) using the proposed framework, the supported number of clusters for the given design constraints can be increased considerably; 3) through STAR-RIS, the number of elements can be significantly reduced as compared to conventional RIS to ensure a similar quality-of-service (QoS).},

  abstract     = {With the use of power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and backscatter communication (BAC), future sixth-generation ultra-massive machine-type communications networks are expected to connect large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, due to NOMA co-channel interference, power allocation to large-scale IoT devices becomes critical. With existing convex optimization approaches, it is challenging to find the optimal resource allocation in a dynamic environment. To alleviate this problem and increase the sum rate of uplink backscatter devices, this work develops an efficient model-free BAC-NOMA approach to assist the base station with complex resource scheduling tasks in a dynamic environment. We jointly optimize the transmit power of downlink IoT users and the reflection coefficient of uplink backscatter devices using the soft-actor critic algorithm. The proposed algorithm ensures the quality of service (QoS) requirements of downlink users while enhancing the sum rate of uplink backscatter devices. Numerical results reveal the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the conventional optimization (benchmark) approach in terms of the average sum rate of uplink backscatter devices. We show that a network with multiple downlink users obtained a higher reward for a large number of iterations than episodes with a lower number of iterations. With different numbers of backscatter devices, the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmark scheme and BAC with orthogonal multiple access. Additionally, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithm enhances sum rate efficiency at different self-interference coefficients and noise levels. Finally, we evaluate the sum rate efficiency of the proposed algorithm with varying QoS requirements and cell radii.},

Generally, IRS is usually equipped with large-scale elements when implemented at THz frequency. In this case, the near-field model and beam squint should be considered. Therefore, in this article, we investigate the far-field and near-field beam squint problems in THz IRS communications for the first time. The far-field and near-field channel models are constructed based on the different electromagnetic radiation characteristics. Next, we first analyze the far-field beam squint and its effect for the beam gain based on the cascaded base station (BS)-IRS-user channel model, and then the near-field case is studied. To overcome the far-field and near-field beam squint effects, we propose to apply delay adjustable metasurface to IRS, and develop a scheme of optimizing the reflecting phase shifts and time delays of IRS elements, which effectively eliminates the beam gain loss caused by beam squint. Finally, simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes in combating the far-field and near-field beam squint.},

We derive the relative entropy between the probability density functions associated with the two test hypotheses under low-resolution ADCs. We formulate our optimization problem by maximizing the relative entropy, subject to the constant envelope and orthogonality constraints. To suboptimally solve the resultant problem, a two-stage framework is developed. In the first stage, we optimize the transmit power at the directions of the target and clutter. In the second stage, an efficient iterative algorithm based on majorization-minimization is presented to obtain the constant-envelope beamformer according to the attained transmit power. Specifically, we apply a quadratic function as the minorizer, leading to a low-complexity solution at each iteration. In addition, to further facilitate low-cost implementation of the constant-envelope beamformer, we consider the problem of one-bit beamforming design and propose an efficient iterative method based on the Nesterov-like gradient method to solve it.

For chasing the best fuel consumption efficiency, the coupled optimization problem of driving strategy and energy management for DEHT is addressed in this paper. We propose a bi-level optimization method that jointly designs driving strategy and energy management for DEHT. The optimal driving strategy is obtained by modeling a particle swarm optimization problem in fuel consumption reduction at the top level. The power allocation for the diesel generator set and the battery is described as a convex optimization problem and solved at the bottom level. The proposed method can converge to an optimal value after cyclic iterations. In each iteration, the top-level outputs the current optimal driving strategy to the bottom problem. Based on this current optimal driving strategy, the bottom level calculates the current best fuel consumption and energy management, then feeds back to the top level to start a new iteration. To verify our introduced method, the proposed optimization is compared with the common problems, such as single energy management optimization, single-speed optimization, and sequence optimization. Results show that the maximum and minimum fuel consumption reduction by the introduced optimization method is 20.0% and 2.7%, respectively.},

Measurement data is directly used for sharing information generation with the convolutional neural network. Then, the multiple task-specific layers are added for state/temperature monitoring. The transfer learning strategy is designed to improve accuracy further under various application scenarios. Experiments under different working profiles, temperatures, and aging conditions are conducted to evaluate the method, which covers the wide usage ranges in electric vehicles. Comparisons with several benchmarks illustrate the superiority of the proposed method with better accuracy and computational efficiency. The monitoring results under extremely current working profiles and variable internal and external conditions are evaluated. Results show that the mean absolute error and root mean square error of state of charge and state of energy estimation are less than 2.31% and 3.31%, respectively. The above errors in the prediction of future temperature five steps ahead are less than 0.89 °C and 1.29 °C, respectively. The framework is also suitable for monitoring second-life batteries retired from electric vehicles. This paper illustrates the potential application of data-driven multi-state monitoring throughout the entire battery life.},

  abstract     = {The Controller Area Network (CAN) dominates in-vehicle networking systems in modern vehicles. CAN was designed with low-latency and reliability as key features. Authenticity of a CAN frame was not considered in the design, thus, most in-vehicle network nodes inherently trust received messages as coming from a legitimate source. As a result, it is trivial to program (or hack) a network node to spoof traffic. Authentication is challenging for CAN and related protocols, such as SAE J1939, due to limited frame sizes and high bus utilization. Adding a message authentication code (MAC) as a separate message can unduly stress the real-time delivery of safety-critical messages. Although this stressor is well-known, the impact of authentication protocols on real-time message delivery in CAN has not yet been thoroughly examined. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of real-time schedulability analysis applied to authentication schemes for CAN, CAN Flexible Data-rate (CAN FD), and CAN extra long payload (CAN XL). We formulate the response time analysis for addition of MACs and periodic transmission of MACs, and we examine their impact on two case studies and through evaluation with randomized schedulability experiments over a wide range of message sets.},

Based on decomposed model series expansion, a fusion filter is derived to estimate the vehicle position based on Gaussian approximation. The fusion filter can guarantee higher real-time localization accuracy than other linearization-based approaches, since it is derived on the basis of the decomposed process model and the series expansion scheme involves a loss function to ensure minimum truncated orders.

  abstract     = {Since no engine clutch exists in the power-split system of the hybrid electric bus, the torque variations of the power sources (i.e., the engine, motor, and generator) are easy to cause system shock during mode switching. To yield a better control effect, the model predictive control (MPC) based dynamic coordination control strategy (DCCS) is considered as an effective solution to guarantee the drivability and reliability of the system. However, the existing MPC-based DCCS still have the challenge of model accuracy and computational complexity. Therefore, to solve the problem, a data-driven Fast - MPC(FMPC) based DCCS is proposed for a power-split hybrid electric bus in this paper. Firstly, to ensure the accuracy of the engine dynamic model, a piecewise data fitting method is proposed by analyzing the historical data of the engine. Then, considering the high dimension of the control model (based on the dynamics model of the power-split system), a fast solving method for the quadratic optimization problem of MPC is proposed with respect to the proper assumption and simplification. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy, offline simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation experiments are carried out. Simulation results show that good driving comfort and real-time performance have been achieved. This research is expected to promote the application of MPC in the DCCS and further improve the dynamic performance of the power-split system.},

  abstract     = {With the increase of on-board sensors, as a new paradigm of mobile crowdsensing (MCS), vehicular crowdsensing (VCS) shows great potential in realizing low-cost, large-scale sensing tasks. In order to improve the user engagement and task completion quality of VCS, an appropriate incentive mechanism can promote enough users to participate in the sensing activities and further provide high-quality sensing data. However, due to the contradiction between personal interests and user data security protection, the development of the incentive mechanism is seriously affected. To deal with these challenges, this article aims to propose a security protection incentive mechanism with data quality assurance (SPIM-DQA) for the VCS system. First, we adopt the blockchain-enabled VCS framework, and propose a series of smart contracts to ensure the automatic execution of the incentive mechanism, which solves the user data security issues existing in the traditional incentive mechanism. Then, based on this framework and these smart contracts, a data quality-aware incentive mechanism is proposed from the perspective of data quality. After selecting low-cost and high-quality users to perform the crowdsensing task, user reputation is updated by evaluating the quality of the provided data. In particular, there is a correlation between user reputation and reward distribution, which incentivizes users to consistently provide high-quality data to increase their rewards. Finally, extensive simulation results show that SPIM-DQA can effectively improve data quality while meeting security requirements.},

The control objective of this paper is divided into two aspects. One is formation control for collision avoidance and connectivity preservation among a leader and communication-connected followers, and the other is obstacle avoidance between followers and potential obstacles including environmental obstacles and communication-connectionless followers. A tangent-type formation error transformation function is introduced for the first topic. With this transformation, an error transformation equation is developed, and the first topic is transformed into an error stabilization issue. Then, an improved continuous differentiable potential function is constructed for the second topic, and the partial derivative of this improved potential function is smooth and continuous as obstacles enter or exit detection ranges. A predictor-based neural network disturbance observer (PNNDO) is developed for generalized disturbances. Prediction errors are introduced to update NNs&#39; weights, and this replacement avoids phenomenon of high-frequency oscillations with overlarge adaptive gains. With a normalized learning method, the number of NNs&#39; learning parameters is also reduced. With the help of the Lyapunov stability, it is proved that the control objective is achieved.

Firstly, we present the system concept and block diagram. Then, the imaging performance and feasibility are analyzed for the typical illuminators. It is found that the system can achieve distinct mission performance with different kinds of illuminators, which offers more alternatives for various mission requirements. A set of mission performance evaluators is established to comprehensively assess the capability of the system, including UAV navigation, passive SAR imaging and communication. An energy-efficient path planning method is then presented to generate a UAV path with optimized mission performance. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the performance evaluators and path planning method. Finally, a real implementation of the system is given.

  abstract     = {This paper is focused on the pulse-and-glide (PnG) control for a parallel hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) in car-following. PnG is an eco-driving technique that alternately turns on and off the engine to save fuel. For HEVs, the ride comfort concerns by PnG in conventional vehicles can be alleviated by oscillating the battery state of charge (SOC), instead of the vehicle speed. However, due to the ohmic losses during the battery charging and discharging process, the fuel saving potential is much reduced. In order to reach a balance between ride comfort and fuel economy, a control method is proposed to utilize both the vehicle body and the battery as the energy buffers simultaneously in the PnG operation. In particular, two minimum-time control problems, one for the pulsing phase and another for the gliding phase, are formulated and implemented as model predictive control (MPC). With the applications of a series of approximations and sparsity optimization techniques, these two control problems become quadratic programming (QP) problems after the application of the pseudo-spectral (PS) method. The online implementability is thus ensured. Numerical simulations using naturalistic driving data show on average 17.1% and 5.1% improvements of fuel economy for local and highway speeds, respectively. It is shown that the proposed method is able to improve the fuel economy while maintaining both ride comfort and SOC sustenance.},

At each sampling instant, the 3D point cloud and image acquired by a LiDAR and a camera are fused into a color point cloud, where objects are detected by the Point-GNN method. And, a novel height-intensity-density (HID) image is constructed from the bird&#39;s eye view. The HID image truly reflects the shapes and materials of objects and effectively avoids the influence of object occlusion, which is helpful to object tracking. In two sequential HID images, a new rotation kernel correlation filter is proposed to predict the objects. Furthermore, an object retention module and an object re-recognition module are developed to overcome the object matching failure in the in-between frames. The proposed method takes full advantage of the multi-modal data and effectively achieves the information complementation to improve the accuracy of multi-object tracking. The experiments with the KITTI dataset show that the proposed method has the best performance among the existing traditional multi-object tracking methods.},

They help with the GPS receivers to determine the relative locations of vehicles to other existing traffic and objects over the road network such as entrance/exit points, obstacles, road intersections, etc. This helps drivers or autonomous vehicles to decide the most appropriate reaction, in terms of speed, take-over, or stop operations ahead of time. Several daily traveling vehicles do not have digital maps. Besides, digital maps are vulnerable to being destroyed or inaccurate. They require regular updates due to the continuous construction and re-design of the road networks. These constructions aimed to enhance the road design and the traffic efficiency there. Moreover, accidents, broken vehicles, traffic congestion, or other ad-hoc obstacles appear unpredictably over the road network. In this article, we aim to introduce a prediction protocol that gathers and analyzes the traffic characteristics of vehicles over the investigated road scenario using wireless transceivers in vehicles. Then, it predicts the physical and traffic context based on the analyzed traffic data. This protocol can replace the absent or broken digital maps in vehicles. It also can be used to verify the correctness of the digital map in vehicles. From the experimental results, we can infer that the proposed protocol has succeeded in predicting the road context over highways and downtown scenarios. More accurate and better predictions are acquired by increasing the percentage of wireless transceiver-equipped vehicles.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the problem of age of information (AoI) aware radio resource management for a platooning system. Multiple autonomous platoons exploit the cellular wireless vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication technology to disseminate the cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to their followers while ensuring timely delivery of safety-critical messages to the Road-Side Unit (RSU). To lower the computational load at the RSU and cope with the challenges of dynamic channel conditions, we exploit a distributed resource allocation framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where each platoon leader (PL) acts as an agent and interacts with the environment to learn its optimal policy. Motivated by the existing literature in RL, we propose two novel MARL frameworks based on the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), named Modified MADDPG, and Modified MADDPG with task decomposition. Both algorithms train two critics with the following goals: A global critic which estimates the global expected reward and motivates the agents toward a cooperating behavior and an exclusive local critic for each agent that estimates the local individual reward. Furthermore, based on the tasks each agent has to accomplish, in the second algorithm, the holistic individual reward of each agent is decomposed into multiple sub-reward functions where task-wise value functions are learned separately. Numerical results indicate our proposed algorithms&#39; effectiveness compared with other contemporary RL frameworks, e.g., federated reinforcement learning (FRL) in terms of AoI performance and CAM message transmission probability.},

  abstract     = {Offloading tasks in smart devices (SDs) to an edge intelligence-empowered service centre (EISC) is a promising solution to support burgeoning intelligent applications in large-scale intelligent urban rail transits (URTs). However, dynamic computation resource allocation is still a crucial challenge, facing that various large-scale SDs share the EISC computation resources and the reality that the allocated computation resource for an SD is coupled with the offloading rate of all SDs. This paper proposes a joint dynamic offloading rate control and computation resource optimization method for large-scale intelligent URTs. Firstly, we model the large-scale multi-agent computation resource competition problem by a multi-player differential game (MPDG) and prove that the Nash equilibrium (NE) based optimal solution exists for each SDs. Then, we transform the MPDG model into a mean-field game (MFG). By introducing the mean-field into the game, we can solve the multi-agent optimization problem with a single-agent optimization method. We illustrate the rationality of the MFG model and propose an iterative solution method based on the finite difference method to derive the solution. Finally, we propose a z-transforming-based control method to dynamically reschedule computation resources among intelligent applications to achieve a satisfactory quality of service (QoS). Extensive simulation results show that our proposed scheme can significantly improve the performance of intelligent URTs.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an event-triggered saturation-tolerant solution to the problem of trajectory tracking control with application to autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) considering quantitative transient behaviors. To prespecify the transient tracking behaviors quantitatively and avoid the possible violation of behavioral functions induced by input saturation, a saturation quantitative prescribed performance control (SQPPC) is proposed, where auxiliary subsystems are devised to monitor the input saturation and modify the behavioral boundaries, such that SQPPC can automatically adapt to the input saturation without transgressing the exact output constraints. Intermittent measurement-based uncertainty and disturbance estimator (IMUDE) is devised to reconstruct the lumped disturbances with reduced communication resource usage. Building upon the estimation results obtained from IMUDE, an event-triggered control law is designed, attaining ultimately uniformly bounded (UUB) results, where a relative threshold-based event-triggered mechanism (RTETM) is constructed to reduce the communication resource dissipation along the controller-to-actuator channel. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in controlling an omni directional intelligent navigator, simulation results are provided and analyzed.},

  abstract     = {High-precision and continuous positioning is a fundamental requirement for intelligent navigation applications. Nowadays, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) real-time kinematic (RTK) technique is recognized as a feasible solution to provide precise positioning services, but its accuracy is susceptible to signal attenuation and will deteriorate drastically in urban environments. Fortunately, the low-cost inertial measurement units (IMU) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) are available in modern vehicle systems and could be integrated to enhance GNSS performance. In this contribution, aiming to improve RTK performance in GNSS-challenging environments, we propose a tightly coupled RTK/Inertial navigation system (INS)/LiDAR integration method. The GNSS double-differenced pseudorange and carrier-phase measurements, IMU data, and LiDAR plane features are fused at the raw-data level via an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Both simulated tests and real-world experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed method is able to achieve sub-decimeter-level accuracy in GNSS-challenging environments, with the improvements of (51.8%, 82.0%, 75.0%) and (53.9%, 71.0%, 41.5%) compared to state-of-the-art LIO-SAM and loosely coupled GNSS/INS/LiDAR integration. Meanwhile, the ambiguity fixing rate could be improved by more than 10% with the assistance of LiDAR plane features. Similar improvements can also be achieved in velocity and attitude estimation.},

Simultaneously, the absolute value of each attitude-tracking error is less than another defined boundary.

  abstract     = {The shortage of charging piles and the soaring power demand of charging stations will lead to long waiting times for electric vehicles (EVs) that need to accomplish charging tasks. Most charging scheduling methods pay more attention to the overall waiting time, and they usually do not consider the time-aware fairness among EV users. Moreover, it has become important to schedule EVs effectively to minimize the operating cost of the station. This paper considers the trade-off between the time-aware fairness and overall waiting time of EVs to optimize the individual waiting time. A novel metric, the time-aware fairness index (TAFI), is proposed to evaluate the fairness performance for competing EVs. Therefore, a bi-objective charging and discharging scheduling problem is formulated. A novel online scheduling algorithm based on the dynamic schedulable time of EVs and the energy demand fluctuation of the station is proposed to obtain an optimal scheduling solution. Experimental results indicate that our method effectively reduces the total waiting time while minimizing the maximum individual waiting time and reducing the operating cost of the station. Moveover, the TAFI results confirm that the desired fairness behavior occurs.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) technology, limited self-driving vehicles have been commercially available in certain leading intelligent transportation system countries. When formulating the car-following model for CAVs, safety is usually the basic constraint. Safety-oriented car-following models seek to specify a safe following distance that can guarantee safety if the preceding vehicle were to brake hard suddenly. The discrete signals of CAVs bring a series of phenomena, including discrete decision-making, phase difference, and discretely distributed communication delay. The influences of these phenomena on the car-following safety of CAVs are rarely considered in the literature. This paper proposes an efficient safety-oriented car-following model for CAVs considering the impact of discrete signals. The safety constraints during both normal driving and a sudden hard brake are incorporated into one integrated model to eliminate possible collisions during the whole driving process. The mechanical delay information of the preceding vehicle is used to improve car-following efficiency. Four modules are designed to enhance driving comfort and string stability in case of heavy packet losses. Simulations of a platoon with diversified vehicle types demonstrate the safety, efficiency, and string stability of the proposed model. Tests with different packet loss rates imply that the model could guarantee safety and driving comfort in even poor communication environments.},

In this paper, we consider an air transportation system where multiple AVs are operated to transport passengers or cargo from different sources to destinations along their pre-defined paths. During the flight, the minimum communication Quality of Service (QoS) must be achieved at all times to ensure flight safety. Our objective is to minimize the total mission completion time by jointly optimizing the velocities and spectrum allocation for all AVs. We formulate the optimization problem as a multi-stage Markov game where the optimization variables are coupled together. A multi-agent deep reinforcement learning VD3QN algorithm is proposed to enable cooperative learning among AVs. Additionally, we propose a heuristic greedy algorithm (HGA) and an orthogonal multiple access (OMA) solution as baseline solutions. Extensive simulation results show that our learning-based solution outperforms the baseline solutions under different network configurations.},

However, the spatial attribute of vehicle movement behavior has been overlooked, resulting in incomplete information utilization. To bridge this gap, we put forward for the first time a hierarchical trajectory prediction structure using the capsule neural network (CapsNet) with three sequential components. First, the geographic information is transformed into a grid map presentation, describing vehicle mobility distribution spatially and temporally. Second, CapsNet serves as the core model to embed local temporal and global spatial correlation through hierarchical capsules.

While the theory of BATS codes has been developed over the past decade, little research has been done on its hardware implementation, which is important for practical adoption. This paper provides a systematic way to analyze the performance of a BATS hardware accelerator when the code varies. A roofline model which provides an upper bound of the performance considering both computational and input/output constraints is developed. Next, we build a model connecting the BATS code design space with the hardware execution time, which can be used to determine an optimal code. Finally, we propose and test a flexible and scalable BATS code design paradigm for hardware accelerators with numerical results.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a three dimensional (3D) geometry based. stochastic model (GBSM) considering planar antenna array is firstly proposed for the sixth generation (6G) terahertz (THz) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems. Then, a novel beam domain channel model (BDCM) is derived from the proposed GBSM based on the Fourier transform matrix from the spatial domain to the angle domain in horizontal and vertical directions simultaneously. The THz propagation characteristics, including non-negligible diffuse scattering and limited order of reflection, are considered in these two channel models. In addition, the proposed GBSM and BDCM can capture the spherical wavefront and spatial non-stationarity characteristics in massive MIMO channels by deriving steering vectors of near-field clusters and partly visible clusters, respectively. The angle-domain sparsity property of the BDCM can be observed, which helps reduce the complexity of the GBSM and improve the mathematical tractability. Typical statistical properties of the proposed GBSM and BDCM are derived and compared. The effects of the spherical wavefront on space-time-frequency correlation functions (STF-CFs) and channel capacity are also studied for the proposed GBSM and BDCM. The power leakage of the BDCM caused by the spherical wavefront and visible region (VR) is thoroughly analyzed. It is found that the statistical properties of the GBSM and BDCM fit well and are considerably influenced by the spherical wavefront and VRs},

  abstract     = {The availability of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in vehicle exteriors makes possible the use of visible light communication (VLC) as a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) wireless connectivity solution. While there has been a growing literature on vehicular VLC, the existing works inherently assume the deployment of regular passenger vehicles. In this paper, we consider the use of VLC for vehicular connectivity between heavy vehicles such as trucks. We assume that low beam headlights are used as transmitters. Due to the nature and function of vehicular low beam lighting, the upward distribution of lighting is fundamentally different from its downward distribution. Hence, the vertical displacement (i.e., the height difference between transmitter and receiver) and the vertical oscillation experienced by heavy vehicles might significantly impact the VLC link. Based on experimental measurements, we first propose an accurate path loss model that takes into account the effect of vertical displacement and oscillation. Then, we derive a bit error rate (BER) expression for VLC-based truck-to-truck communication system and investigate the effect of several system and channel parameters on the performance. In an attempt to mitigate the degrading effects of the vertical oscillation, we further investigate the proper selection of photodetector location to minimize the error rate performance.},

  abstract     = {In vehicular edge computing networks, edge service caching has emerged as a promising technology that supports delay sensitive applications. When the vehicles pass the coverage areas of roadside units (RSUs), the vehicles can offload part/all of their tasks to the RSUs that had cached the related service data in advance. However, it is difficult to utilize the service caching resources in RSUs efficiently, for the high mobility, variable task computing requests of vehicles and the limited storage and computation capacity of RSUs. In this paper, we propose a co llaborative task o ffloading and service caching r eplacement scheme from a vehicle perspective, named CoOR, the task processing cooperation between the adjacent RSUs and the service caching replacement for vehicle are mainly considered. We formulate the system computing cost and delay minimization as a mixed integer programming problem, it faces challenges of task offloading and service caching coupling, the heterogeneous computation requests and dynamic data transmission conditions. Thus, we develop an iterative algorithm combined with the Gibbs sampling and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to find the optimal decisions. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed schemes have good convergence and better performance than the traditional baselines.},

In particular, gathering the measurement results of all nodes on a specific node requires substantial time for aircraft networks. Therefore, methods simultaneously calculating all the target node positions are challenging to apply due to information delay. This study uses only two hops measurements information relying on the time of arrival (TOA) and angle of arrival (AOA) to propose a weighted least squares (WLS) method that decentralizes the calculation of a specific single target node position in a 3D environment. Moreover, the effect of TOA and AOA measurement errors on localization accuracy is analyzed based on the geometric relationship. Consequently, a novel weight-factor calculation method is designed. The simulation results show that the proposed cooperative localization method can improve localization accuracy compared with the decentralized non-cooperative method. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid approach provides superior localization accuracy than the weight-factor calculation method which only considers the distance.},

First, the optimal solution of power control for a user pair is obtained under different decoding orders, where closed-form expressions and a low-complexity algorithm are given by monotonic optimization. Then, a criterion for finding the optimal decoding order is derived for any given user pair in the considered scenario. Results show that the optimal decoding order is distinct for different user pairs, which can be achieved separately. This indicates that the decoding order is not a necessary prerequisite for user pairing in NOMA-enabled CoMP systems. Moreover, the optimal decoding order is shown to depend on the differentials of channel gains between the user served by JT and coordinated base stations.},

To address this challenge, we design a cooperative learning (CL) framework which manages computation and coordination strategies of the CP and APs using dedicated deep neural network (DNN) modules. To build a versatile learning structure, the proposed CL is carefully designed such that its forward pass calculations are independent of the number of APs. To this end, we adopt a parameter reuse concept which installs an identical DNN module at all APs. Consequently, the proposed CL trained at a particular configuration can be readily applied to arbitrary AP populations.

Since wireless resource allocation problems usually have several constraints, primal-dual learning based UL framework are widely adopted. However, the primal-dual learning approach has the problem of oscillation around the constraint threshold while training and there may be serious constraint violations when deployment. In addition, although the output of the neural network can also be restricted to the feasible region by the penalty function method, the optimality of such training methods cannot be guaranteed. In this article, we combine the primal dual learning method with the penalty function method and propose a regularized unsupervised learning (RUL) framework to enhance the robustness of the primal-dual learning based UL framework. In the proposed RUL framework, we use regularization techniques to improve the robustness of primal-dual learning by reducing the risk of constraint violations while training. A quadratic penalty term is introduced into the Lagrangian function of the wireless optimization problem where the constraints can be equivalent to equality constraints to form its augmented Lagrangian function. In the simulation, we give a simple point to point power optimization problem as an example to show that the proposed RUL can improve the robustness of constraint convergence, and can also accelerate training speed.},

Conventional methods ignoring the communication delays could severely jeopardize driving safety. To fill this gap, this article proposes a robust V2X motion planning policy that adapts between competitive driving under a low communication delay and conservative driving under a high communication delay, and guarantees small communication delays at key waypoints via power control. This is achieved by integrating the vehicle mobility and communication delay models and solving a joint design of motion planning and power control problem via the block coordinate descent framework.

Nevertheless, the multiplicative fading effect of passive RIS limits its applications in the absence of direct links, which promotes the development of active RIS. In this paper, we consider an active RIS-assisted ISAC system and aim to jointly design the transmit beamformer, the active RIS reflection and the radar receive filter to maximize the radar output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while guaranteeing pre-defined signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) for communication users. To solve for this non-convex problem, an efficient algorithm is developed by leveraging the techniques of block coordinate descent (BCD), Dinkelbach&#39;s transform and majorization-minimization (MM).

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been envisioned as a promising technique to alleviate the spectrum congestion problem. Inspired by the applications of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in dynamically manipulating wireless propagation environment, in this article, we investigate to deploy a RIS in an ISAC system to pursue performance improvement. Particularly, we consider a RIS-assisted ISAC system where a multi-antenna base station (BS) performs multi-target detection and multi-user communication with the assistance of a RIS. Our goal is maximizing the weighted summation of target detection signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the RIS reflection coefficients, while satisfying the communication quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, the total transmit power budget, and the restriction of RIS phase-shift. An efficient alternating optimization algorithm combining the majorization-minimization (MM), penalty-based, and manifold optimization methods is developed to solve the resulting complicated non-convex optimization problem. Simulation results illustrate the advantages of deploying RIS in ISAC systems and the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.},

The proposed method utilizes an autoencoder built by fully-connected layers to correlate the features of I/Q data and obtain the interaction feature from the intermediate layer, which is concatenated together with the original I/Q data as model inputs. To accommodate the new data dimensions, a modification scheme for the existing representative deep learning based AMR (DL-AMR) models is presented. Experimental results show that our method can improve the recognition accuracy of the state-of-the-art baseline models, and has a smaller time overhead compared with complex-valued neural networks.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) systems need beam management to establish and maintain reliable links. This complex and time-consuming process seriously affects communication efficiency. Benefiting from data-driven technology in deep learning, the beam can be predicted from the waveform without coordination between transceivers. By passively listening enough waveforms that are transmitted from the base station (BS) to other receivers, the BS can predict which beam is suitable for transmitting in the downlink. However, training such a waveform learning neural network usually requires a large number of labeled training samples. This is a huge challenge, because it is difficult for the receiver to get the precise signal parameters from the transmitter in advance in the non-cooperative mmWave system. As a result, the limited samples may cause overfitting and seriously restrict the performance. Although the data augmentation technology can improve the performance under limited samples, existing data augmentation methods are mostly based on strong prior knowledge which cannot further exploit the potential characteristics of data in the real environment. This paper proposes a mixed regularization training method for training the beam prediction neural network under limited training samples. Specifically, data augmentation is implemented in the data pre-processing procedure with prior knowledge and then the signal splicing strategy is proposed in the training procedure. In order to mine the time correlation characteristics of signals, the cyclic time shift (CTS) based data augmentation method is proposed in the data augmentation step. The simulation results show that our proposed deep regularized waveform learning method needs less training samples under the same performance. Moreover, the proposed method can achieve best performance compared with existing data augmentation methods.},

The effective and efficient service quality of the cloud database is inseparable from communication technology, just as improving communication quality will reduce the concurrency phenomenon in the ticketing system. In order to visually observe the impact of communication on the cloud database, we propose a Communication-Database (C-D) Model with a single-server database over the quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel, which consists of three parts: CLIENTS SOURCE, COMMUNICATION SYSTEM and DATABASE SYSTEM. This paper uses the queuing model, M/G/1//K, to model the whole system. The C-D Model is analyzed in two cases: nonlinearity and linearity, which correspond to some instances of SISO and MIMO. The program simulation results of average staying time, average number of transactions and other performance characteristics are basically consistent with theoretical results, which verify the validity of the C-D Model. The comparison of these experimental results also proves that poor communication quality does lead to the reduction in the quality of database service.},

On this basis, we propose a low-complexity iterative algorithm to solve the simplified problem by solving the two convex subproblems alternately.

This paper considers a CF mMIMO system over Rician spatially correlated fading channels with the single-antenna user equipments (UEs) and multi-antenna APs, where the phase-shift induced by the UEs&#39; movement exists at the line-of-sight path. Though the low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) can effectively address the expensive hardware cost and power-hungry problems, complicated data processing algorithms are of vital importance to be well designed to compensate for the performance gap compared with the real scenarios since the hardware impairments. However, the novel mixed-ADC architecture could solve the above challenges with better performance. So, we investigate the effect of mixed-resolution ADCs deploying at APs and the in-phase and quadrature-phase imbalance (IQI) on the CF mMIMO systems. Furthermore, the achievable uplink spectral efficiency (SE) is analyzed considering IQI and quantization loss based on a two-layer decoding scheme. Moreover, the novel closed-form SE expression with the maximum ratio (MR) combining is derived. And we find the relationship between the SE performance and different combining schemes, quantization bits, and IQI parameters. Finally, the numerical results reveal the mixed-resolution ADCs show a great advantage in boosting the SE performance, and increasing the number of APs is an effective means to promote the system performance.},

Existing coverage models, such as the disc model, do not consider malicious intrusion, which still has a great gap with the realistic application scenarios. Therefore, it is urgent to study a coverage model considering network intrusion and node reliability. In this paper, a novel trust-based reliable confident information coverage (T-RCIC) model is proposed based on the confident information coverage (CIC) model and trust management. Trust management is adopted to determine whether a node is trusted, critical trusted, or malicious. If a node is identified as malicious, all its functions will be blocked. For critical trusted nodes, the trust value is utilized to determine the trust feature distance to reduce its proportion of coverage estimation. Furthermore, the reliable coverage degree (RCD) is defined to evaluate coverage reliability from node trust value and reliable coverage percentage. Simulation results indicate that the proposed model inherits the advantages of the CIC model in the spatial correlation and can effectively identify malicious nodes. The proposed T-RCIC model can significantly enhance coverage reliability.},

Different from the traditional network performance metrics emphasizing transmission and resource consumption, the packet-level performance helps to better understand the impact of not only packet transmission but also packet waiting time in a multihop network. Simulation results demonstrate that the assistance of IAB-based UAVs can efficiently relieve the load of terrestrial macro- and small-cell networks, and the appropriate network deployment parameters play pivotal roles in improving both the packet-level throughput and energy efficiency performance.

In particular, base stations (BSs) are mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that travel to schedule UL transmissions and collect data from devices. To attain an ultra-reliable unified device-centric performance, the UL connection is established when the UAV-BS is hovering at the nearest possible distance from the scheduled device. The performance of the proposed URDC-UL scheme is benchmarked against a stationary UAV-centric uplink (SUC-UL) scheme where the devices are scheduled to communicate to UAV-BSs that are continuously hovering at static locations. Utilizing stochastic geometry and queueing theory, novel spatiotemporal mathematical models are developed, which account for the UAV-BS spatial densities, mobility, altitude, antenna directivity, ground-to-air channel, and temporal traffic, among other factors. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of the URDC-UL scheme to the ratio between hovering and traveling time. In particular, the hovering to traveling time ratio should be carefully adjusted to maximize the harvested performance gains for the URDC-UL scheme in terms of link reliability, transmission rate, energy efficiency, and delay. Exploiting the URDC-UL scheme allows IoT devices to minimize transmission power while maintaining unified reliable transmission. This preserves the device&#39;s battery and addresses a critical IoT design challenge.},

In the proposed Stackelberg game, the SBSs control their transmit power to achieve cost minimization based on the interference price offered by the MBS. Given the optimal power control strategies of SBSs, the MBS can adjust the interference price to realize the objective optimization. Renewable energy sources are introduced into the proposed HetNets, and differential equations formulate the SBSs&#39; dynamic energy. Meanwhile, the MBS&#39;s state is given by the dynamic spectrum resources. Then the differential game is imported to achieve optimal power control and interference pricing.

This work is devoted to study the impact of the number of links on optimal coexistence performance between Licensed-Assisted Access (LAA) and WiFi in unlicensed bands. In particular, we consider three coexistence cases, including 1) single LAA link coexisting with single WiFi link; 2) single LAA link coexisting with multiple WiFi links; 3) multiple LAA links coexisting with multiple WiFi links. The throughput performance in all the three cases is characterized as explicit expressions, based on which the maximum total throughput under the throughput fairness and the corresponding optimal initial backoff window sizes are derived. A systematic comparison among the optimal performance of the three cases is conducted, and it is found that while the maximum total throughput is insensitive to the change of the number of multiple links, the drastic change from single link to multiple links in one network would lead to fierce internal competition in that network, and thus deteriorates both the optimal throughputs of the coexisting network and WiFi. This work sheds important light on the realization of fair and efficient spectrum sharing.},

However, to achieve the potential of edge computing, an effective computation offloading scheme is a key issue needed to be addressed, because it determines how efficient the computing resource allocation and the whole network performance are. Toward providing a solution to such an important issue, this paper formulates the offloading problem as a cooperation game problem about how to share the reasonably adjacent computing resource to users to form an efficient coalition network for the best performance, and then proposes a Shapley value-based computation offloading approach. The proposed approach includes three main steps: Firstly, following the principle of edge computing (users to be close to resources) and reducing the complexity, a clustering algorithm is proposed to divide the whole network into clusters and each cluster has one edge node. Then the non-linear programming is implemented in each cluster and neighboring two or three clusters respectively to obtain the delay values and task allocation results. Finally, to check whether cooperation and coalition among neighboring clusters can bring better network performance, Shapley value is used to evaluate whether combining neighboring clusters in edge computing for the first time. The objective values obtained from the non-linear programming are used to evaluate the profit of different coalitions, which are used to compute Shapley values to determine the final best coalitions between clusters. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Many existing works have focused on optimizing FL accuracy within the resource constrained in each individual round. However there are few works comprehensively consider the optimization for latency, accuracy and energy consumption from a long-term perspective in wireless federated learning. Inspired by this, in this paper, we investigate FL in wireless networks where client selection and bandwidth allocation are two crucial factors for improving the FL accuracy as well as reducing latency and energy consumption. We formulate the optimization problem as a mixed-integer problem, which minimizes the cost function over finite rounds while satisfying energy budget constraints of each client from a long-term perspective. To address this optimization problem, we propose the Per-round Energy Drift Plus Cost (PEDPC) algorithm in an online manner, including two parts: client selection and bandwidth allocation, which can be addressed by Increasing Time-Maximum Client Selection (ITMCS) algorithm and Barrier Method, respectively. Finally, the performance of the PEDPC algorithm is verified by extensive simulations in terms of latency, accuracy and energy consumption in IID and NON-IID data distributions.},

  abstract     = {Direct-to-direct (D2D) communication is a promising technology to increase network capacity, and user equipments (UEs) in a D2D group can communicate with each other without the help of a base station (BS). According to 3GPP specifications, a D2D transmitter will be assigned to radio resource blocks (RBs) based on the amount of its unsent data observed at the scheduling time instant. Most previous methods assign fewer (or say just enough) RBs to consume unsent data of the D2D transmitter. By this policy, each of the assigned RBs has to carry more data bits, and the D2D transmitter needs to enlarge its transmit power on the assigned RBs. As a result, the D2D transmitter will induce more interference to its nearby groups and may cause those nearby groups to be unschedulable. To tackle the above problem, we propose a spread unsent-data strategy , which distributes the observed unsent data to more usable RBs. Since each RB carries fewer data bits, the D2D transmitter can reduce its transmit power. Therefore, this strategy can offer the benefits of reducing interference and increasing concurrent D2D transmissions. In this work, we design a two-phase scheduling method, named &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$DS^2$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , to accomplish the strategy.

This mathematical model is specifically designed to evaluate the quality of service (QoS) experienced by a typical ground user equipment (UE) residing either inside or outside a generic area affected by a calamity. In particular, we model the functioning terrestrial base stations (TBSs) as an inhomogeneous Poisson point process (IPPP), and assume that a given number of uniformly distributed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with cellular transceivers is deployed in order to compensate for the damage suffered by some of the existing TBSs. The downlink (DL) coverage probability is then derived based on the maximum average received power association policy and the assumption of Nakagami- m fading conditions for all wireless links. The proposed numerical results show insightful trends in terms of coverage probability, depending on: distance of the UE from the disaster epicenter, disaster radius, quality of resilience (QoR) of the terrestrial network, and fleet of deployed ad-hoc aerial base stations (ABSs). The aim of this paper is therefore to prove the effectiveness of vertical heterogeneous networks (VHetNets) in emergency scenarios, which can both stimulate the involved authorities for their implementation and inspire researchers to further investigate related problems.},

Mobility affects the communication environment and leads to critical challenges for computation offloading. In this paper, we consider an intelligent task offloading scenario for vehicular environments including smart vehicles and roadside units, which can cooperate to perform resource sharing. Intending to minimize the average offloading cost which takes into account energy consumption together with delay in transmission and processing phases, we formulate the task offloading problem as an optimization problem and implement an algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning with Double Q-learning which allows user equipments to learn the offloading cost performance by observing the environment and make steady sequences of offloading decisions despite the uncertainties of the environment. Besides, concerning the high mobility of the environment, we propose a handover-enabled computation offloading strategy that leads to a better quality of service and experience for users in beyond 5G and 6G heterogeneous networks. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves low-cost performance compared to the existing offloading decision strategies in the literature.},

  abstract     = {The explosively growth of mobile applications imposes much burden on the current computing networks. Wireless Computing Power Network (WCPN), as an emerging computing architecture, can sense and coordinate computing resources through agile wireless communications, and realize distributed intelligence based on federated learning. However, the mobility and heterogeneity of WCPN nodes typically impact the security (e.g., malicious node disturbance) and efficiency of federated learning in WCPN. In light of this, this article proposes a provable secure and decentralized federated learning based on blockchain for WCPN, where nodes can freely participate or leave the WCPN federated training without authorization and security threats. Particularly, we design a blockchain with proof-of-accuracy (PoAcc) consensus scheme to deeply integrate with the federated learning procedure, in which high-accuracy local models have the priority of aggregation, thus accelerating the convergence of federated learning and improving the efficiency of WCPN. The proposed PoAcc is proved to be secure as long as the ratio of honest to malicious nodes is above a lower bound. To further meet the security requirement of PoAcc, we then propose an evolutionary game-based incentive scheme that incentivizes honest nodes to participate the WCPN federated learning under malicious node disturbance. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme ensures the consistency and security of federated learning in WCPN, while outperforming the benchmarks in terms of model accuracy and resource consumption.},

  abstract     = {In the past decade, the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) swarm has become a disruptive force reshaping our lives and work. In particular, advances in artificial intelligence have allowed multiple UAVs to coordinate their operations and work together to accomplish various complex tasks, one of which is Federated Learning (FL). As a promising distributed learning paradigm, FL can be adopted well with the limited resources and dynamic network topology of UAV swarms. However, the current FL&#39;s training process relies on homogeneous data paradigms, which require distributed UAVs to hold the same structure data. This ideal hypothesis can not apply to the heterogeneous UAV swarms. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we design a clustered federated learning (CFL) architecture, in which we cluster UAV swarms based on the similarities between the participants&#39; optimization directions. Then, we formulate the model trading among model owners, cluster heads, and UAV workers as a three-stage Stackelberg game to optimize the allocation of the limited resources. We design a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm to search for the Stackelberg equilibrium under the clustered federated learning system. The performance evaluation demonstrates the uniqueness and stability of the proposed three-stage leader-follower game under the clustered framework, as well as the convergence and effectiveness of the reinforcement learning algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Most of the existing user recruitment methods are designed for the two-tier structure. However, the computational consumption of the cloud platform rises rapidly as data volumes increase. In recent years, edge computing has been introduced into mobile crowdsensing. In this article, we study dynamic user recruitment with edge-aided mobile crowdsensing. Specifically, we consider the scenarios for different sensing tasks. One is the long-duration task, and the other is the short-duration task. For the former, it is time-insensitive, while the latter is time-sensitive. In the scenario with the long-duration task, we consider a simple offline scenario and propose an Edge-Node User Recruitment (ENUR) algorithm to recruit users statically. Then, we consider the online scenario and propose a Budget Re-Distribution algorithm for Edge Nodes User Recruitment (BRD-ENUR). It dynamically redistributes the budget according to the task completion ratio of different edge nodes. In the scenario with the short-duration task, the whole sensing process consists of multiple rounds. In each round, edge nodes need to recruit users between selected users (exploitation) and unselected users (exploration) under the budget. We model such a user recruitment process as a novel combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem. Then, we propose an Edge Nodes User Recruitment algorithm based on combinatorial Multi-armed Bandit (EN-URMB). Extensive experiments show the validity and reliability of our user recruitment algorithms based on the real data set.},

  abstract     = {Age of information (AoI) is a pertinent metric for characterizing the timeliness of status updates in Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Resources allocated to update transmission would significantly affect the timeliness of status update observed at the receiver end. This work investigates the sum average AoI of a two-source wireless updating system in IoV by modeling the system as a non-preemptive queue with a size-two source-dedicated buffer. Two bandwidth allocation schemes, i.e., an asynchronous time division multiplexing (ATDM) scheme and a dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) scheme, are proposed for the system. In the ATDM scheme, status updates are transmitted using all available bandwidth sequentially while in the DBA scheme, the server fractionally allocates the available bandwidth for transmitting the arrived update based on the buffer state. By analyzing the age evolution of each update stream based on stochastic hybrid systems, the closed-form per-source average AoI and the sum average AoI of the two proposed schemes are derived. In particular, the per-source average AoI when the system provides priority for serving one update stream is also given. It is demonstrated that by employing the ATDM scheme and the DBA scheme with optimized bandwidth allocation factor, the system can achieve a significant improvement in terms of sum average AoI, enhancing the update freshness.},

We propose a cache-enabled UAV emergency communication network framework in which a limited number of ABSs are deployed overlaid the partially destructed cellular network. The ABSs are equipped with cache units that adopt probabilistic caching strategy. We design a content-centric association strategy within the specified circular cache area by comprehensively considering the cache status and channel conditions. Based on the framework, we derive the exact expressions of the offloading probability and average rate under the general channel model taking line-of-sight (LOS)/ non-line-of-sight (NLoS) path loss and Nakagami-m fading into account. Simulation results demonstrate that there exist optimal values for ABSs number, ABSs altitude, and cache serving radius to maximize the offloading probability and average rate. Moreover, increasing ABSs number and the cache serving radius in the case that ABSs are deployed at the relatively low altitude is beneficial to improve the system performance. A large number of ABSs helps to reduce the optimal cache serving radius for maximizing the system performance.},

In practice, however, social-aware caching will make severe congestion if high-sociality users have weak SW. It is hard to handle the challenge since it is difficult to jointly quantify the impact of sociality, SW, and caching strategy on congestion. In this paper, we study the congestion avoidance caching strategy to maximize throughput capacity, considering user&#39;s sociality and SW. Specifically, the congestion mechanism in CHetNet is captured by efficient betweenness (EB), which is defined as the number of content delivery paths through a node. Aided by EB, it is interestingly revealed that popular contents should be preferentially cached in users with high SW and low sociality. Inspired by this, we propose a caching strategy to optimize the offloading ratio between layers and further tune caching probabilities to avoid local congestion. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy outperforms the compared sociality-preference schemes. Moreover, it is shown that the large caching buffer size may conversely decrease throughput capacity due to congestion.},

This paper proposes a novel methodology of joint active and passive beamforming optimization for wireless communications with the aid of multiple IRSs. In the considered system, the IRSs are deployed to assist the communication link from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to single-antenna users. We maximize the received signal to noise ratio (SNR) and sum rate of the multi-IRS-assisted communication system for single user and multiple users respectively, by solving a joint optimization problem of the active beamforming at the AP and the reflection beamforming at the IRSs. Specifically, we develop a mechanism of joint beamforming optimization for multi-IRS-assisted communications based on covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), namely the BO-CMA algorithm, to jointly consider both the AP active beamforming and IRS reflection beamforming in the dynamic signal propagation environment. Furthermore, simulation results are provided to show that the BO-CMA algorithm is capable of significantly outperforming the benchmark schemes. Consequently, the solution based on the BO-CMA algorithm can dynamically rebuild the signal propagation environment, and improve the received SNR and the sum rate respectively for multi-IRS-assisted one user and multiple users communications.},

However, their communication performance is prone to both channel estimation errors and potential eavesdropping. Hence, we investigate the effective network secrecy throughput (ENST) of the uplink UAV network, in which rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is employed by each legitimate user for secure transmission under the scenario of massive access. To maximize the ENST, the transmission rate versus power allocation relationship is formulated as a max-min optimization problem, relying on realistic imperfect channel state information (CSI) of both the legitimate users and passive eavesdroppers ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$Eves$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ). In the model considered, each user transmits a superposition of two messages to a UAV base-stations (UAV-BS), each having different transmit power and the UAV-BS adopts a successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique to decode the received messages. Given the non-convexity of the problem, it is decoupled into a pair of sub-problems. In particular, we derive a closed form expression for the optimal rate-splitting fraction of each user. Then, given the optimal rate-splitting fraction of each user, the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\epsilon$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -constrainted transmit power of each user is calculated by harnessing sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) programming.

We utilize the time-varying model to capture the sparsity and temporal correlation of the mmWave channel, and an off-grid model is incorporated for an accurate AoA acquisition. Essentially, the beamspace channel tracking is a quantized sparse Bayesian learning problem, which is solved under the expectation maximization (EM) framework. We first employ the Bussgang decomposition to linearize quantized signals, based on which, the Kalman filtering (KF) is adapted for the statistics&#39; update in the expectation step. In this way, we propose a Bussgang joint channel tracking and data detection (BJ-CTDD) algorithm, in which the detected data symbols are reused to enhance the tracking without extra pilot overhead. To further reduce the computational burden caused by the KF, a variational inference joint channel tracking and data detection (VIJ-CTDD) algorithm is proposed. Finally, extensive simulations validate the superiority of the proposed BJ-CTDD and VIJ-CTDD algorithms over several existing works.},

We also formulate and solve a constrained optimization problem to determine the fraction of elements to be activated at any IRS in order to guarantee near-identical SEP performance for both the users. We present results to elucidate that adding few extra IRS elements yields SNR gain for both users, requires allocation of lower power to weaker user and supports communication with higher-order constellation without significant increase in SEP/PEP.

Novel closed-form expressions of secrecy outage probability (SOP) are derived for these three selection schemes in both practical and ideal scenarios. The novel theoretical analysis and simulation results show the impact of wireless backhaul uncertainties and channel estimation errors on system secrecy performance. In addition, we investigate how the number of small-cell transmitters affects the system secrecy performance. The asymptotic behaviour is provided to obtain insights into the system performance. The analytical derivations and asymptotic expressions are validated by Monte Carlo simulations. Our novel theoretical analysis can guide different physical layer security (PLS) designs.},

  abstract     = {In cognitive radios (CR), compressive spectrum sensing (CSS) is a promising technique to detect wideband spectrum holes with reduced sampling rate requirement of analog-to-digital converter (ADC). It is implied in compressive sensing (CS) that the minimum sampling rate is determined by the sparsity order of the observed wideband signal. Unfortunately, the sparsity order is previously unknown and dynamically varies. Meanwhile, CS technology fails to work efficiently for the nonsparse spectrum case. For example, the CSS performance degenerates significantly for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios since the observed signal becomes nonsparse in frequency domain. To overcome the above-mentioned challenges, we propose a novel CSS algorithm with temporally-correlated prior knowledge mining (TPKM-CSS) to detect spectrum holes without a prior sparsity order information. The proposed scheme can handle both the sparse and nonsparse spectrum cases. The proposed solution has three contributions: firstly, CR implements multiple parallel sampling simultaneously to acquire wireless spectrum signals, which have a low-rank spectrum matrix. Secondly, the temporal correlation between continuous CS data is further exploited to improve the estimation accuracy of the current spectrum. Finally, the theoretical performance of the proposed TPKM-CSS is evaluated, wherein the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the spectrum reconstruction error is derived in the closed form. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme works well for both sparse and nonsparse spectrum scenarios. Compared with the CSS schemes that are based on low-rank matrix recovery (LMR-CSS), maximizing correlation (MC), iterative compressive filtering (ICF), or Bayesian CS (BCS), the proposed scheme yields the superior performance in terms of the probability of detection and the probability of false alarm, especially for nonsparse signals. Furthermore, the simulated statistical performance of the spectrum reconstruction error matches well the theoretical CDF curve.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has recently been envisioned to enhance the power of the desired received signal or suppress the interference signal by deploying low-cost passive reflection elements. This paper investigates an IRS-aided multi-cell millimeter wave (mmWave) communication system for suppressing inter-cell interference (ICI) to assist the downlink transmission of cell-edge users. We aim for maximizing the minimum weighted signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) through jointly optimizing the active beamforming vectors of mmWave base stations (MBSs), the phase shifts of the IRS, and the location of the IRS. Especially since it is challenging to obtain the perfect channel state information (CSI) related to the IRS links, we also study the performance of IRS-aided mmWave communication in the case of imperfect CSI. First, in the case of perfect CSI, to tackle the challenging and non-convex minimum weighted SINR maximization problem, we develop an alternating optimization (AO)-based beamforming algorithm via updating the active beamforming vectors at MBSs, the phase shifts at the IRS, and the location of the IRS alternately. Then, in the case of imperfect CSI, we propose a low-complexity majorization-minimization (MM)-based robust beamforming algorithm to obtain the benchmark performance. Moreover, the proposed algorithms are also extended to multi-IRS-aided multi-cell mmWave scenarios. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the advantages in terms of the SINR, effective sum rate as well as energy efficiency after introducing the IRS to mitigate the ICI.},

  abstract     = {A multiuser mixed radio frequency/terahertz (MRFTHz) system is studied, where the multiple RF channels experience η-μ fading and the THz channel obeys α-μ 1 fading with pointing errors (PEs). Both fixed-gain (FG) amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) protocols are considered in the relay. Firstly, the exact expressions of the cumulative distribution functions of the overall signal-to-noise ratio under AF and DF schemes are derived. On this basis, the Fox&#39;s H-function (FHF) and bivariate FHF are used to obtain exact analytical expressions of the outage probability (OP), average bit error rate, and average channel capacity. Additionally, the asymptotic results at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are provided to gain the system&#39;s diversity order (DO). Results show that the DOs of the AF and DF relaying systems are decided by the PEs and channel fading parameters (FPs). In addition, considering the FG AF relaying and multi-antenna scenarios, the asymptotic OP at high SNRs is derived, which obtaining the DO is determined by the numbers of the antenna, PEs, and FPs. Finally, we apply the Monte Carlo simulations to verify numerical results. Results show that the path loss, PEs, FPs, and the number of users can significantly affect the proposed multiuser MRFTHz system.},

  abstract     = {In space communications, the signal quality generally suffers due to long-distance transmission and high dynamic movement. Long-distance transmission causes a very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and high dynamic movement causes a dynamic Doppler-shift on carrier frequency. To boost the signal component in SNR, multiple symbols over a long duration of time are accumulated, which is termed as long-term accumulation. However, during the long-term accumulation, the large acceleration and jerk result in a time-varying Doppler shift, thus dispersing the energy over a wide frequency range. In this paper, we propose a comb-search and hierarchical-clustering (CSHC) based Doppler-shift acquisition scheme, including the Generic CSHC algorithm and Iterative CSHC algorithm, to address the energy dispersion problem for space communications. In the Generic CSHC algorithm, the comb-search (CS) decreases the noise energy by a narrower CS-range while the hierarchical-clustering (HC) increases the signal energy by clustering multiple signal elements into one signal cluster. Then, the Iterative CSHC algorithm, which builds on the iterations of CS and HC, further decreases the noise energy and increases the signal energy. Simulations results verify that our proposed CSHC scheme significantly improves the acquisition probability, as compared with the existing schemes.},

To this end, we consider the use of Bayesian compressive sensing approach in which the clustered sparse structure of the channel in the angular domain is employed to reduce the pilot overhead. To capture the clustered structure, we employ a conditionally independent identically distributed Bernoulli-Gaussian prior on the sparse vector representing the channel, and a Markov prior on its support vector. An expectation propagation (EP) algorithm is developed to approximate the intractable joint distribution of the sparse vector and its support with a distribution from an exponential family. The approximate distribution is then used for direct estimation of the channel. The EP algorithm assumes that the model parameters are known a priori. Since these parameters are unknown, we estimate these parameters using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The combination of EM and EP referred to as EM-EP algorithm is reminiscent of the variational EM approach. Simulation results show that the proposed EM-EP algorithm outperforms several recently-proposed algorithms in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Wireless powered mobile edge computing (MEC) networks have been envisaged as a promising technology to ensure the ultra-low-power requirement and enhance the continuous work capacity of wireless devices (WDs). However, when multiple WDs coexist in the network, it is non-trivial to minimize the total tasks delay since the optimization variables are intrinsically coupled. Even more, channels are dynamically varying from time to time and the tasks are unpredictable, which aggravates the difficulty to obtain the closed-form solution. This paper considers a challenging hybrid tasks offloading scenario, where offloading tasks can be partially executed locally and remotely in parallel, and each WD is endowed to take both the active RF-transmission and passive backscatter communication (BackCom) for remote tasks offloading. Furthermore, a game-combined multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm is proposed to minimize the total tasks delay with the fairness consideration of multiple WDs, i.e., potential game for offloading decision and MADDPG for time scheduling and harvested energy splitting. Equipped with the feature of ‘centralized training with decentralized execution’, once well trained, each agent in MADDPG can figure out the proper time scheduling and harvested energy splitting independently without sharing information with others. Besides the unilateral contention among WDs for the offloading decision by potential game, a fully decentralized framework is finally designed for the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the game-combined MADDPG algorithm can achieve the near-optimal performance compared with existing centralized approaches, and reduce the convergence time compared with other no-game learning approaches.},

  abstract     = {In reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless communication systems, channel estimation is of paramount importance to unleash the full advantage of the high passive beamforming gains from RIS. However, it is particularly challenging due to the massive number of RIS reflecting elements which lack signal perception and processing capabilities, thus incurring prohibitively high pilot overhead between transceivers. To address this challenge, we focus on an RIS-assisted multiuser multiple-input single-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MU-MISO-OFDM) system, and propose a practical transmission protocol with non-uniformly spaced comb-type pilots for compressed channel estimation and data transmission, by exploiting the sparsity of RIS-associated channels. To solve a bivariate pilot optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the mutual coherence of the measurement matrix influenced by pilot positions and pilot powers simultaneously, we propose two enhanced whale optimization algorithm (EWOA)-based approaches by leveraging the second order cone programming (SOCP) and compressed coding scheme (CCS). Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods over benchmark schemes in various aspects. It corroborates that considering the coupling relationship between pilot positions and powers can help improve the channel estimation performance of the RIS-assisted MU-MISO-OFDM system with limited pilot overhead.},

Hybrid analog and digital beamforming (HBF) schemes operating at mmWave frequency bands can exploit the sparse nature of the channel by using large scale antenna arrays (LSAs) to shape multiple beams that overcome the severe path loss. However, due to the long and straight geometric characteristic of the rail track, there is a significant variance in the train-to-ground communication rate when the train is near or far from the BS. To address this issue, a novel hybrid beamforming scheme is developed based on a non-uniform beam design. We first model and investigate different beam design schemes in terms of spectral efficiency. Then, an efficient straight route based adaptively analog beamforming scheme with the non-uniform beam is proposed for HSR, which is designed to resist path loss. Finally, an adaptive non-uniform HBF algorithm based on the orthogonal matching pursuit method (OMP) is developed to minimize the rate gap between different locations by selecting the appropriate predefined beams. Numerical results show that the proposed hybrid beamforming scheme can efficiently ensure signal coverage, and reduce the variance of the train-to-ground communication rate along a straight track route.},

However, the synchronization of radio access network (RAN) and core network (CN) slicing has not been well-studied as an interdependent resource allocation problem. This work proposes a novel slice-to-node access factor (SNAF)-based end-to-end (E2E) slice resource provisioning scheme and deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based real-time resource allocation algorithm for E2E interdependent resource slicing and allocation, respectively, specifically for RAN and CN. To ensure effective resource slicing and allocation, we consider the versatile user equipment (UEs) QoS requirements on transmission delay and data rate. Notably, the SNAF-based scheme provides proper resource provisioning and traffic synchronization, while the DRL-based algorithm allocates radio resources based on affordable traffic and backhaul resources. Based on the 5 G air interface, we conduct system-level simulations to evaluate the performance of our proposed methods from various perspectives. Simulation results confirm that our proposed SNAF and DRL-based interdependent E2E resource slicing and allocation techniques achieve better E2E traffic-resource synchronization, and improve the QoS satisfaction with minimal resource utilization compared to other existing benchmark schemes.},

The metric Age of Information (AoI) is adopted to measure the data freshness from the user side (Kaul et al., 2012). In this paper, we investigate the AoI-minimization problem of wireless networks with time-varying channels and the peak power constrained base station (BS). Firstly we model the time-varying channels as a multi-state ergodic Markov chain and formulate the multi-user scheduling problem. Next, we relax the original strict power constraint and formulate the relaxed problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). To reduce the computational complexity, we exploit the threshold structure of the optimal policy for the CMDP and search for the optimal policy via Linear programming (LP). To satisfy the original strict power constraint, we propose an truncated multi-user scheduling policy, which is proven asymptotic optimal. Finally, we simulate our proposed scheduling policy and compare the AoI performance with other policies. Simulation results verify the theoretical analysis and indicate that our policy can significantly reduce the AoI of users with bad channel quality, thus outperforming other policies.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates an uplink coordinated multi-point (CoMP) coverage scenario, in which multiple mobile users are grouped for sparse code multiple access (SCMA), and served by the remote radio head (RRH) in front of them and the RRH behind them simultaneously. We apply orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation for each user to exploit the degrees of freedom arising from both the delay and Doppler domains. As the signals received by the RRHs in front of and behind the users experience respectively positive and negative Doppler frequency shifts, our proposed OTFS-based SCMA (OBSCMA) with CoMP system can effectively harvest extra Doppler and spatial diversity for better performance. Based on maximum likelihood (ML) detector, we analyze the single-user average bit error rate (ABER) bound as the benchmark of the ABER performance for our proposed OBSCMA with CoMP system. We also develop a customized Gaussian approximation with expectation propagation (GAEP) algorithm for multi-user detection and propose efficient algorithm structures for centralized and decentralized detectors. Our proposed OBSCMA with CoMP system leads to stronger performance than the existing solutions. The proposed centralized and decentralized detectors exhibit effective reception and robustness under channel state information uncertainty.},

Besides, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is also the key technology in the sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication system. In this work, we study a multiple input single output (MISO) STAR-RIS assisted NOMA downlink network and investigate the energy efficiency (EE) maximization to achieve the tradeoff between the sum rate and the power consumption. The original formulated problem is non-convex due to the coupled beamforming vectors of the users and phase shifts of the STAR-RIS. To efficiently solve the problem, we split the original non-convex problem into the phase shift and beamforming optimization problems and then solve them alternatively. In the phase shift optimization, fractional programming (FP) is applied to transform the sum rate maximum problem to convex semidefinite relaxation (SDR) one with the rank-one constraint. After this, a novel sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SROCR) is proposed to convert the rank-one constraint into a convex one, which can effectively overcome the inadequacy of Gaussian randomization, i.e., quality of the solutions and computational complexity. Similarly, FP is applied to solve the beamforming problem by transforming it to SDR problem. It turns out that the optimal solution of the SDR beamforming optimization problem can be guaranteed to be rank-one by the mathematical proof and experiments. The simulation results demonstrate the STAR-RIS NOMA system can achieve the superior performance in EE.},

In this paper, we propose a hybrid beamforming (HBF) scheme with low power consumption and fully directional beamforming gains. The proposed HBF scheme integrates digital beamforming (DBF) with analog beamforming (ABF) to adopt a fully connected (F-C) structure to realize high spectral efficiency (SE) and accurate target sensing. Specifically, for HBF in a single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) system, we design a fast Riemannian manifold optimization (FRMO) method by minimizing the weighted summation of the communication beamforming error and radar beamforming error. The proposed method can achieve optimal DBF for downlink communication and guarantee the desired beampattern for radar sensing. For HBF in a multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) system, we formulate the weighted optimization problem to mitigate multiuser interference (MUI). We design a low-complexity method, namely, the adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithm, to obtain a near-optimal solution for HBF based on the criteria of minimizing MUI and the radar beamforming error. We conduct excessive simulations to evaluate the proposed algorithms for the HBF design in both the SU-MIMO system and MU-MIMO system. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve near-optimal performance compared to existing HFB methods with high computational efficiency in terms of beamforming gains and SE.},

In this paper, we propose a task-oriented prediction and communication co-design framework, where the reliability of the system depends on prediction errors and packet losses in communications. The goal is to minimize the required radio resources subject to the low-latency and high-reliability requirements of various tasks. Specifically, we consider the just noticeable difference (JND) as a performance metric for the haptic communication system. We collect experiment data from a real-world teleoperation testbed and use time-series generative adversarial networks (TimeGAN) to generate a large amount of synthetic data. This allows us to obtain the relationship between the JND threshold, prediction horizon, and the overall reliability including communication reliability and prediction reliability. We take 5G New Radio as an example to demonstrate the proposed framework and optimize bandwidth allocation and data rates of devices. Our numerical and experimental results show that the proposed framework can reduce wireless resource consumption up to 77.80% compared with a task-agnostic benchmark.},

  abstract     = {Innon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems, transmit power allocation plays a crucial role in maximizing the sum rate, while satisfying quality of service requirements of users. In prior study, an interior point method (IPM) has been presented as an iterative algorithm for power allocation, which can maximize the sum rate and minimize the outage rate. However, such iterative algorithms typically suffer from low computational efficiency and excessively high latency. To overcome these limitations, machine learning-based power allocation schemes have been widely studied. Along the same line, in this paper, focusing on unsupervised learning to improve the computational complexity for power allocation as well as user selection, we propose a deep neural network (DNN)-based joint user selection and power allocation technique for the cellular downlink multiple-input single-output(MISO) NOMA systems, where the transmit antenna selection and multi-cell cooperation are considered. Especially, an optimization problem for user selection and power allocation is formulated to maximize the sum rate under the constraint of minimum data-rate requirement. We propose a new loss function and training model for user selection and power allocation to solve the optimization problem, where the training and testing models are based on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) information instead of channel state information, which can significantly reduce the input data size in DNN. Through simulations, we show that our proposed scheme provides comparable performances in terms of sum rate and outage rate to the optimal solutions, while requiring lower computational complexity compared to the optimal ones.},

  abstract     = {As a representative application scenario of the Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) plays an important function in the area of intelligent transportation. However, data traffic exchanged in IoV is usually correlated with plenty of sensitive information, thus leading to privacy leakage. Nevertheless, if all personal data about vehicles are completely protected, it will be hard to trace the real identities of malicious vehicles, which also raises other security issues in IoV. In addition, existing schemes are not fully suitable for 5G-enabled IoV due to their complex structure and high computation requirements. In order to realize more efficient communication and anonymous authentication of vehicles with superior security, we propose a conditional privacy-preserving authentication scheme with hierarchical pseudonyms (CPAHP) in 5G-enabled IoV, which is based on the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) problem. Through the hierarchical pseudonym mechanism, CPAHP can protect the real identities and movement tracks of vehicles. Whereas, if vehicles have malicious behaviors, their real identities can be recovered through the corresponding pseudonyms. Furthermore, by taking advantage of a batch verification method, receivers can easily cope with a huge influx of messages in a short space of time. Moreover, by introducing blockchain technology, traffic information can be shared smoothly among all vehicles. Through the security analysis and performance evaluation, it is demonstrated that CPAHP can not only meet the security requirements but also provide higher computational efficiency.},

Exploiting millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals in 5G and Beyond 5G systems can provide accurate localization with limited infrastructure. We consider the single base station (BS) localization problem and extend it to 3D position and 3D orientation estimation of an unsynchronized multi-antenna user equipment (UE), using downlink multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) signals. Through a Fisher information analysis, we show that the problem is often identifiable, provided that there is at least one multipath component in addition to the line-of-sight (LoS), even if the position of corresponding incidence point (IP) is a priori unknown. Subsequently, we pose a maximum likelihood (ML) estimation problem, to jointly estimate the 3D position and 3D orientation of the UE as well as several nuisance parameters (the UE clock offset and the positions of IPs corresponding to the multipath). The ML problem is a high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem over a product of Euclidean and non-Euclidean manifolds. To avoid complex exhaustive search procedures, we propose a geometric initial estimate of all parameters, which reduces the problem to a 1-dimensional search over a finite interval. Numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed ad-hoc estimation, whose gap to the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) is tightened using the ML estimation.},

Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) data sharing can improve driving experience and quality of service, and Vehicle-to-Roadside unit (V2R) communication can improve road transport efficiency. A certain amount of bandwidth is consumed in the process of data sharing between V2V and V2R, and when multiple vehicles request data from the RSU at the same time, there may be network delay or congestion. Therefore, the vehicle obtains data faster by requesting high bandwidth from the RSU. However, since the bandwidth resources of RSUs are limited, optimal bandwidth service strategies need to be investigated. In addition, in order to ensure the safety, efficiency and traceability of data sharing between V2V and V2R, a blockchain-supported IoV needs to be established. Therefore, we design a blockchain-based framework for V2V and V2R transaction framework that integrates DAG blockchain and modern cryptography. The framework ensures security and scalability during the execution of data exchange and completion of bandwidth transactions, improves the service quality of vehicles and realizes decentralized payment. In this work, a two-stage Stackelberg game is established under two pricing schemes of uniform pricing and discriminatory pricing to jointly maximize the benefits of vehicles and RSUs. In Stage I, the RSU sets the corresponding bandwidth service and pricing strategy. In Stage II, the vehicle decides the service demand according to the observed pricing strategy. The optimal bandwidth allocation and pricing strategy between the RSU and the vehicle is determined through the game of both parties, and the existence and uniqueness of the two-stage subgame Nash equilibrium is analyzed by applying backward induction. The correctness of the model is verified by experiments, and the comparative analysis shows that the proposed model has high throughput.},

  abstract     = {In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), the broadcast storm problem may disable road safety applications and cause congestion or traffic accidents. Existing schemes propose broadcast storm mitigation by reducing the number of relay vehicles. Concurrently, in improving reachability, these schemes stipulate that vehicles expected to transmit packets to more next-hop neighbors have higher relay priority. However, the potential redundancy caused by duplicate reception by neighbors is ignored, which exacerbates the contention and collisions in transmission. This paper proposes an adaptive backoff mechanism for mitigating broadcast storm in VANETs (ABM-V). Specifically, the receiver estimates the expected benefit and redundancy by combining the distribution of neighbors. Then, the receiver adaptively adjusts the backoff time by utilizing Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. Finally, the receiver with the shortest backoff time becomes the relay and rebroadcasts the packet to its neighbors. Simulation results illustrate that ABM-V significantly reduces the rebroadcast ratio and redundancy ratio compared with the existing typical schemes while maintaining stable reachability.},

  abstract     = {Full-dimensional (FD) multi-user massive multiple-input multiple output (m-MIMO) systems employ large two-dimensional (2D) rectangular antenna arrays to control both the azimuth and elevation angles of signal transmission. We introduce the sum of two outer products of the azimuth and elevation beamforming vectors having moderate dimensions as a new class of FD beamforming. We show that this low-complexity class is capable of outperforming 2D beamforming relying on the single outer product of the azimuth and elevation beamforming vectors. It is also capable of performing close to its FD counterpart of massive dimensions in terms of either the users&#39; minimum rate or their geometric mean rate (GM-rate), or sum rate (SR). Furthermore, we also show that even FD beamforming may be outperformed by our outer product-based improper Gaussian signaling solution. Explicitly, our design is based on low-complexity algorithms relying on convex problems of moderate dimensions for max-min rate optimization or on closed-form expressions for GM-rate and SR maximization.},

  abstract     = {Finite blocklength is a favorable way to meet the extremely low-latency requirement, which leads to the classic Shannon&#39;s capacity formula no longer suitable. With the achievable rate region, optimization problems on three different scenarios are considered: (i) joint design of power and blocklength allocation for two transceiver pairs with single-antenna transmitter; (ii) beamforming and blocklength design for the two transceiver pairs with multi-antenna transmitter; (iii) beamforming and blocklength design for the multiple transceiver pairs with multi-antenna transmitter. Under the finite blocklength transmission mode, the achievable rate expression is a complicated function with respected to the blocklength and power allocation coefficients or beamforming vector, which makes the optimization problems difficult to solve. In this paper, by analyzing the monotonic and concaveconvex properties of achievable rate with interference channel (IFC), we formulate the achievable rate region as the convex hull of a series of power/beamforming and blocklength rate regions for two-user systems with IFC, as well as the Pareto boundary of achievable rate region on the blocklength and beamforming vector for the two-user systems, respectively. Sequentially, the optimal blocklength and power coefficients are derived in the closed-form and optimal beamforming vectors are also obtained by transforming the non-convex problem into convex one. Numerical results provide the perspective of looking at the rate region with finite blocklength.},

  abstract     = {A 2 × 2 dual-band dual-circularly polarized (CP) Fabry-Pérot cavity (FPC) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antenna is proposed in this paper. It is formed by arranging four identical FPC antenna elements with 90° rotation. The FPC antenna element is composed of a single linearly polarized (LP) feeder and a chiral metamaterial (CMM)-based partially reflective surface (PRS), which acts as a polarization converter. The feeder is with a hybrid structure of a slot radiator operating in the low band and a patch radiator in the high band. As the orthogonal currents on the end and center arms of the H-shaped patch break the degeneracy of two CP waves at different frequencies, the PRS simultaneously realizes left-hand CP (LHCP) and right-hand CP (RHCP) features at two different bands, respectively. To enhance the port isolation between two adjacent antenna elements, a broadband, wide-angle, polarization-independent metamaterial absorber (MMA) is introduced to suppress the space wave coupling. To verify the design concept, the proposed MIMO antenna prototype is fabricated and measured. The measured bandwidth with a voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) of less than 2 covers 3.32–3.42 GHz and 6.23–6.93 GHz, and the LHCP pattern and RHCP pattern are realized at 3.33-3.42 GHz (2.7%) and 6.59–6.75 GHz (2.4%), respectively. A maximum gain enhancement is up to 5.31 dBi in the low band and up to 4.3 dBi in the high band. In addition, the port isolation is better than 42 dB, and the ECC is less than −40 dB. With these performances, the proposed MIMO antenna is suitable for vehicular satellite communication applications.},

  abstract     = {With the emergence of various applications in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), the cooperative communication among the nodes on roads is becoming more and more important in vehicular networks. However, selfish nodes, which are not willing to relay data packets for others, drastically decrease the communication performance of the network in various aspects including packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, communication bandwidth, etc. It is critical to detect the selfish nodes in the network for avoiding the decrement of network performance. Nevertheless, it is extremely challenging to correctly and fairly detect selfish nodes in vehicular networks where the network topology is highly dynamic and link quality between nodes is lossy. In order to address this issue, a novel detection scheme is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme jointly considers the link quality, mobility, and vehicle behaviors at the network layer and MAC layer with fuzzy logic in a fully decentralized manner. Furthermore, an innovative perception module is deployed based on probabilistic calculations to refine the detection decisions of the scheme. The scheme is validated by simulation platforms which integrate Veins, SUMO, and INET Framework under IEEE 802.11p and AODV protocols. The computer simulations are conducted with both highway and urban traffic scenarios of Xi&#39;an city in China. As the results shown, the proposed scheme demonstrates better detection capabilities than the conventional schemes in terms of Precision , Recall , and F1-score with an acceptable communication overhead.},

However, considering the restricted computation capabilities of UAVs, even multiple UAVs may not satisfy the quality of service (QoS) requirement of IoT users with heavy-computation applications. In this paper, a heterogenous-multiple-UAVs enabled collaborative aerial-ground MEC framework is proposed. The total computation bits maximization problem under the time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme and partial offloading mode is formulated by jointly optimizing the user association, the CPU-cycle frequencies of users and computing UAVs, the transmit power of users and UAVs, the offloading time of users and UAVs, as well as the UAVs&#39; trajectories. Due to the non-convexity of the original problem with the nonlinear coupling of different variables, a two-layered alternative optimization (TLAO) algorithm is proposed, where the outer layer optimizes the user association and resource allocation, while the inner layer optimizes the UAV trajectory scheduling. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed TLAO scheme can improve the total computation bits compared with other benchmark schemes, and achieve fast convergence. Moreover, comparative results also verify that our proposed strategy is flexible to apply to homogeneous multi-UAVs and single-UAV scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has attracted a surge of research interest in both academia and industry. To support aerial user equipment (UEs) in the existing cellular networks, one promising approach is to assign a portion of the system bandwidth exclusively to the UAV-UEs. This is especially favorable for use cases where a large number of UAV-UEs are exploited, e.g., for package delivery close to a warehouse. Although the nearly line-of-sight (LoS) channels can result in higher powers received, UAVs can in turn cause severe interference to each other in the same frequency band. In this contribution, we focus on the uplink communications of massive cellular-connected UAVs. Different power allocation algorithms are proposed to either maximize the minimal spectrum efficiency (SE) or maximize the overall SE to cope with the severe interference based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) principle. One of the challenges is that a UAV can affect a large area meaning that many more UAV-UEs must be considered in the optimization problem, which is essentially different from that for terrestrial UEs. The necessity of single-carrier uplink transmission further complicates the problem. Nevertheless, we find that the special property of large coherent bandwidths and coherent times of the propagation channels can be leveraged. The performances of the proposed algorithms are evaluated via extensive simulations in the full-buffer transmission mode and bursty-traffic mode. Results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively enhance the uplink SEs. This work can be considered the first attempt to deal with the interference among massive cellular-connected UAV-UEs with optimized power allocations.},

To this end, a stochastic sum-outage-probability minimization problem is formulated for joint beamforming design, data rate allocation, and power allocation over subcarriers. In order to solve this problem efficiently, a block statistic learning approach is introduced using training data generated from a priori knowledge of path blockage probabilities. To initialize the stochastic learning solver, the novel initial beamforming is also proposed based on the upper bound of the original objective function, which improves convergence without tuning hyper-parameters. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed block stochastic learning approach in terms of both convergence behavior and outage probability. Furthermore, these results confirm that the proposed approach with only blockage probabilities is comparable to the outage performance of a CoMP sum rate maximization (SRM) transmission scheme with perfect channel state information (CSI) and perfect knowledge of blockages.},

  abstract     = {Wireless interference identification (WII) is a critical technology for the non-cooperative communication systems, and it is widely applied into military and civilian scenarios. With enormous success in many computer vision and language processing applications, deep learning (DL) has also achieved the remarkable performance for WII. However, existing DL based WII methods can not dynamically allocate proper computing resources conditioned on the inputs, causing serious waste of resources and low computational efficiency, which is unacceptable for edge computing devices, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided systems. In this paper, the problem of dynamic computation resource allocation is modeled as adaptively learning forward propagation depth of networks on a per-input basis, and this novel method is termed as dynamic computing resource allocation in convolutional neural networks (DCRACNN). In particular, the proposed DCRACNN is composed of two subnetworks: a main network and a policy network. The main network is equipped with multiple classifiers at different depths, allowing test examples to stop early during inference so as to significantly improve computational efficiency. The policy network is optimized with reinforcement learning to address the bottleneck of non-differentiable decisions of optimal forward propagation depth for the main network while preserving recognition accuracy. To address the challenges of high error rates of early classifiers in the main network, novel methods are introduced, which can be seamlessly integrated into DRCACNN. In addition, a novel network pruning process is proposed for the main network to further reduce model sizes and computational complexity. Experiments demonstrate that DCRACNN can significantly reduce the calculation cost with boosting accuracy for WII.},

We focus on the question that which role the EH node plays, as a friendly jammer or as a cooperative decode-and-forward (DF) relay. Accordingly, we propose two EH node aided multiuser scheduling schemes to help the secure communications between BS and multiple users, i.e., the EH jammer aided transmission (EHJT) scheme where the EH node acts as a friendly jammer and the EH relay aided transmission (EHRT) scheme where the EH node acts as a cooperative DF relay. For comparison purposes, the direct transmission (DT) scheme is also presented. We analyze the security-reliability trade-off (SRT) performance of the proposed EHJT and EHRT schemes as well as the DT scheme in terms of deriving their exact and asymptotic expressions of outage and intercept probabilities. Additionally, we propose an iterative algorithm based on the golden search to determine the optimal time allocation factor (OTAF) for the sake of minimizing the sum of outage and intercept probabilities for the proposed EHJT and EHRT schemes. Numerical results show that the EH node can improve the SRT performance of the multiuser network more significantly as a friendly jammer than as a cooperative DF relay. It is also shown that the best SRT performance of the EHJT and EHRT schemes can be achieved by adjusting the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and time allocation factor.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent transportation systems contribute to improved traffic safety by facilitating real-time communication between vehicles and infrastructures. In this context, message authentication is crucial to safeguard vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) from malicious attacks. The current state-of-the-art for authentication in VANETs relies on conventional cryptographic primitives, introducing significant computation and communication overheads. This paper presents a cross-layer authentication scheme for vehicular communication, incorporating the short-term reciprocal features of the wireless channel for re-authenticating the corresponding terminal, reducing the overall complexity and computation and communication overheads. The proposed scheme comprises four steps: S1. Upper-layer authentication is used to determine the legitimacy of the corresponding terminal at the first time slot; S2. Upon the verification result, a location-dependent shared key with a minimum number of mismatched bits is extracted between both terminals; S3. Using the extracted key and under binary hypothesis testing, a PHY challenge-response algorithm for multicarrier communication is proposed for re-authentication; S4. In the case of false detection, the key extraction step (S2) is re-executed after adapting the quantisation levels at different conditions of channel non-reciprocity based on the feedback from the re-authentication step (S3). Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme even at small signal-to-noise ratios. In addition, the immunity of the proposed scheme is proved against active and passive attacks, including signatures&#39; unforgeability against adaptive chosen message attacks in the random oracle model. Finally, a comprehensive comparison in terms of computation and communication overheads demonstrates the superiority of the proposed scheme over its best rivals.},

  abstract     = {Mobile-edge computing (MEC) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) have been recognized as two key technologies for 6G mobile networks. Consequently, we propose the IRS-based MEC schemes for the delay-constrained quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning over radio frequency (RF) powered 6G mobile networks with non-linear energy harvesting (EH) model. Using the IRS, multiple mobile users (MUs) first harvest energy from a multi-antenna base station (BS) equipped with an MEC server and then transmit their data to the BS for data-processing. First, we formulate a delay minimization problem for MUs under their QoS requirements, by jointly optimizing the IRS&#39;s phase-shift matrices, the MEC server&#39;s finite computation resource allocation, the MIMO based BS&#39;s multi-MU detection (MUD) coefficients, and the energy/data transmission time and task allocation coefficient of each MU. Second, we define the total delay of each MU as the sum of its EH time, data-transmission time, and data-processing time. Since our formulated joint-optimization problem is non-convex with multiple coupled variables, we apply the block coordinate descending (BCD) method to decompose it into several subproblems which can thus be iteratively solved by a low complexity algorithm. Third, we extend our proposed scheme to IRS-based MEC over Terahertz (THz) mobile networks. Finally, we validate and evaluate our developed delay-minimization schemes through numerical analyses, showing that the total delay of the RF-powered MUs can be significantly reduced by using our proposed schemes.},

With the global transition towards electrification of the transportation sector, several countries have set ambitious goals of Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption. However, deployment of adequate EV charging infrastructure, which is one of the most critical factors for seamless adoption of EVs, is limited by various challenges, including technical, policy and regulatory issues. In order to mitigate the challenges, this paper presents a combined ranking of the key interventions. Critical analysis of all the identified interventions has been undertaken and the learnings have been utilized to frame a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) process to identify the priority of roll-out of the interventions. The unified ranking of technical, and policy and regulatory interventions would enable rapid and widespread deployment of EV charging infrastructure.},

To this end, we first propose a TS fuzzy reduced-order observer design, which can be implemented with low computation effort, for nonlinear systems. The stability and robustness of the observer scheme against the modeling uncertainty is guaranteed by the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathscr {H}_{\infty }$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; filtering method. A data-driven approach is proposed to construct feedforward neural networks (NNs) for uncertainty approximation. This data-driven approach exploits a specific sliding mode observer (SMO) to identify the model uncertainty data from the collected training data. The NN-based uncertainty approximation is incorporated into the TS fuzzy observer structure to mitigate the effect of uncertainty and improve the estimation quality. Via Lyapunov&#39;s stability theory, design conditions of both the TS fuzzy reduced-order observer for dynamics estimation and the SMO for uncertainty identification are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Experimental results obtained with the INSA autonomous vehicle on a real test track demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TS fuzzy observer under various driving scenarios. Performance comparisons are also performed to illustrate the interest of using NN-based uncertainty approximation for the new reduced-order observer scheme, especially under extreme driving conditions.},

First, the three degrees of freedom vehicle dynamics model and the PMSM mathematical model are established, and a strong tracking cubature Kalman filtering algorithm based on orthogonal transformation (T-STCKF) is derived to overcome the problem that the STCKF algorithm is prone to nonlocal sampling when dealing with high dimensional systems. Second, a PMSM sensorless control system based on the adaptive exponent reaching law of sliding mode control and the T-STCKF algorithm is established, and confirmed its validity. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through multicase simulation and experiment and the results shows that the T-STCKF algorithm is more accurate than the STCKF algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Sensor fault diagnosis is of great significance to ensure safe battery operation. This paper proposes a novel sensor fault diagnosis method that achieves the simultaneous fault detection, fault source and type identification, and fault estimation in a comprehensive way. Specifically, a set-valued observer, featuring a state predictor and a state estimator, is first constructed and designed to guarantee the inclusion of the unavailable actual battery state due to unknown modeling errors and noises at every instant of time. Compared with the traditional observers, a distinct feature of the proposed one lies in that the calculated state predictions and estimations of the battery system at each time step are ellipsoidal sets in state space rather than single vectors. The boundedness of state prediction and estimation errors is formally proved, and the tractable design criteria for determining the real-time optimal prediction and estimation ellipsoids are also derived. As for diagnosis algorithm, fault detection is implemented based on the intersection between the prediction and estimation ellipsoids. Then, a two-layer Pearson correlation coefficient analysis mechanism is developed to identify the source and type of sensor faults. Another set-valued observer based on an augmented battery model is further designed to estimate the fault level. Finally, experimental studies of a battery cell under different sensor fault sources, types and values are elaborated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

An objective function is composed of a frequency-shaped jerk to minimize the shift shock and take into account the bandwidth limit of the lower-level controller. Equality constraints are defined for smooth model changes during the gear shift processes. Moreover, the conditions needed to reflect the driver&#39;s pedal input (which can be changed in real-time) is composed of an equality constraint. In addition, inequality constraints are constructed to limit the maximum value of the torque, torque rate, and jerk during gear shift processes. Finally, the problem is formulated in quadratic programming (QP) form. The gear shift trajectories and feedforward inputs are generated by obtaining an optimal solution through the QP solver.

Secondly, the synchronizer control system model is constructed to imitate the fork displacement sensor fault as the experimental vehicle works in normal condition and the collected data lacks of faulty sensor signal. Finally, the residual is obtained by comparing the predicted fork displacement and the measured sensor information. The sensor fault is detected as the residual exceeds the predetermined threshold.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a double-layer energy management system (EMS) for electric vehicles driven by multiple permanent magnet synchronous motors. The system minimizes energy consumption and ensures safe longitudinal motion. The inner-layer distributes torques and flux currents by minimizing the motor input power. The outer-layer generates the total torque command by controlling the aggregated motor speed via a disturbance observer-based controller. A design condition that sufficiently guarantees the system&#39;s L 2 stability is presented. The condition is independent of the torque distribution ratios and can be checked conveniently via passivity notation without linearizing the total system. Various validation tests were performed using a three-wheel recreational electric vehicle (EV) platform. The advantage of the double-layer EMS has been compared with several EMSs proposed recently in the literature. Critical testing scenarios were employed, including sharp change in road friction during high acceleration. Test results reveal that, regardless of such condition, the double-layer EMS can prevent the wheel slip, thereby significantly reducing energy consumption. The New European Driving Cycle test was also conducted to demonstrate the merit of simultaneously optimizing torque distribution ratios and motor flux-currents.},

However, the simultaneous identification of the SoC-OCV relation remains challenging. This paper presents a novel technique to construct the SoC-OCV relation, which is eventually converted to a single parameter estimation problem. The Kalman filter is implemented to estimate the SoC and the related states in batteries using the proposed parameter estimation and the SoC-OCV construction technique. In the numerical simulations, the algorithm demonstrates that it accurately estimates the battery model parameters, and the SoC estimation error remains below 2%. We also validate the proposed algorithm with a battery experiment. The experimental results show that the error in SoC estimation remains within 2.5%.},

The inherent hysteresis nonlinearity of a magneto-rheological damper (MRD), however, may lead to unpredictable and complex dynamic behavior of the vehicle system. In this study, a pitch-plane half-car model comprising MR suspension with hysteresis nonlinearities was formulated to investigate its dynamic responses as a function of the driving speed. The dynamic stability of the vehicle model was investigated under harmonic excitations through Lyapunov exponents to globally illustrate strong dependencies on the excitation frequency and amplitude. The influences of driving speed, and excitation amplitude and frequency on the nonlinear response characteristics were analyzed through bifurcation diagrams, phase portraits and Poincaré maps. The dynamic evolution of periodic motion to chaotic motion was illustrated through Hopf, saddle node and period-doubling bifurcations, respectively, under low-, mid- and high-speeds. Moreover, the hyperchaotic oscillation of the system was observed for the first time. The results show that the nonlinear response behavior of the half-car MR suspension is mostly concentrated in the medium frequency range for low- as well mid-speeds, which is concerned with ride comfort performance of the vehicle. The results obtained in the study provide essential basis for further investigations on effective controller synthesis and stability analyses of more practical higher order models of vehicles with MR suspension.},

Therefore, the real-time rotor temperature monitoring plays a critical role, however, it is hard to online measure with sensors. To this end, a rotor temperature estimation method based on the lumped-parameter thermal networks and dual H infinity filters is proposed. Firstly, the lumped-parameter thermal network of three nodes, such as the stator, rotor and bearing, is numerically formulated to determine the power loss. Accordingly, the discretized state-space expressions are specified for the time-step iterative solution. Then, to address the uncertainty of model parameters, the dual H infinity filters are used in the rotor temperature estimation process. Finally, the simulation and experimental tests are performed to validate the effectiveness and the real-time executability of the proposed method. The test results show that the proposed method can well track the actual temperature tendency with estimation errors of less than 7.5 °C. Compared with the existing methods, the worst-case estimation accuracy has been improved by at least 25%; besides, the proposed method presents good robustness against the parameter uncertainty; meanwhile, the higher estimation convergence is made in the face of huge model deviations.},

  abstract     = {Permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) provides a very competitive technology for electric vehicle (EV) traction drive with its higher power density and higher efficiency. When the control system of PMSM for EV is affected by the change of motor parameters and the interference from the external environment, the motor system cannot provide high-quality dynamic performance in time. In the paper, an EV motor control strategy based on improved sliding mode and proportional resonance theory is proposed, in which a speed controller is designed based on the improved exponential reaching law. The improved exponential approximation law overcomes chattering in traditional sliding mode control without increasing parameters and improves the anti-interference performance of the EV. In addition, the improved proportional resonance method is used to design the current controller of the PMSM control system, and the combination of the two has been successfully applied to EV for the first time. Finally, the experiment and urban road condition test are carried out to verify. The results show that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the dynamic performance and robustness of the PMSM system for EVs.},

Especially, the path is planned based on the trajectory optimization theory (i.e., Pontryagin maximum principle), resulting in the analytical optimal solutions. Furthermore, to handle the state-constrained optimization problem that is considered to ensure the vehicle lateral stability, we include the punctual and isolated equality constraints in the formulated optimization problem, which can designate the state variables as the desired value at the intermediate time instants. Through the numerical examples on various driving conditions and high-fidelity model-based verification, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed path planner, and our approach can effectively generate a safe vehicle path rapidly, depending on the road surfaces and vehicle speeds.},

This article addresses safety-aware automatic berthing of MASSs moving in a constrained water region with stationary and moving obstacles. A safety-critical constrained anti-disturbance control method is proposed for the automatic berthing of MASSs subject to velocity constraints, input constraints, and collision-avoidance constraints, as well as ocean disturbances. At the kinematic level, desired linear velocities and yaw rate are prescribed by incorporating a line-of-sight guidance scheme to achieve position-heading stabilization. At the kinetic level, an anti-disturbance kinetic control law is designed based on an extended state observer. Through converting the input constraints to velocity constraints on guidance signals, the safety-guidance signals are obtained by solving a quadratic programming problem subject to the state, input, and collision-avoidance constraints. It is proven that an MASS controlled by using the proposed method is input-to-state safe in the presence of ocean disturbances. Simulation results are elaborated to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed safety-certified control law for the automatic berthing of an MASS subject to physical constraints and environmental disturbances.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle-to-vehicle energy trading has become one of the most popular charge-sharing systems nowadays. It allows energy transfer between electric vehicles without being necessarily relied on infrastructure-based charging stations. However, the demands-offers matching and energy transportation between the vehicles remain challenging issues while considering vehicles– space and temporal location, their dynamicity, availability, and reliability. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a framework of energy trading based on blockchain and smart contracts. The energy transfer between vehicles is performed via a distributed coalition of unmanned aerial vehicles transporting the electric energy from selected sellers to a needy requester vehicle. The selection mechanism of sellers aims to maximize the service availability and fault-tolerance and minimize both the energy transportation latency and overhead. We modeled the selection process by a 0-1 knapsack problem, which we relaxed using a dynamic protocol of energy negotiation, and then developed a linear approach for its resolution. The seller reliability assessment is addressed by the proposition of a trust management approach, which evaluates over time the quality of participants regarding their history of transactions. We conducted intensive simulations with a comparison to the exact solution of resolution. The obtained results show a reduction of 42% of charging latency, an improvement of 24% of service availability, a 96% of approximation from the exact resolution, and an increase of up to 62% of robustness against unfulfilled commitments.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous intersection management (AIM) guides vehicles to pass through signal-free intersections individually. Since vehicles are permitted to turn in any direction from any lane in AIM, it is desired to erase lane changes on the entry lane to achieve high traffic efficiency. However, erasing lane changes exposes intersections to complex conflicts. To study the trade-off between lane changes on the entry lanes and conflicts inside the intersection, this paper makes a comprehensive comparison of two kinds of intersection systems. First, all-direction turn lanes (ADTL) and specific-direction turn lanes (SDTL) are designed to distinguish lane change behaviors. Second, a two-stage method is proposed to manage the oncoming vehicles at the intersection. The first stage is timing schedule optimization and the second stage is trajectory optimization. Then, a method based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is designed to solve the timing schedule optimization model at high traffic demands. Finally, two parts of simulation experiments are conducted in this paper. The first part verifies the performance of the MCTS-based method. The second part compares ADTL and SDTL in multiple scenarios. The results show that ADTL outperforms SDTL in the efficient system, but the opposite conclusion appears in the fault-tolerant system. Besides, combining ADTL with lane changes may bring out the full value of ADTL.},

Then, the ET-ASC with respect to correction signal is proposed to mitigate the effects of such sensor attacks. In what follows, two theorems, which include both input to state stability (ISS) criterion and controller design method, are carefully derived for the path following control of UGVs under the proposed ET-ASC scheme. The advantage of the proposed ET-ASC scheme lies in that it can actively amend the sensor attacks in an adaptive way and exclude Zeno phenomenon naturally. At last, a verification simulation experiment are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed ET-ASC method.},

  abstract     = {Realistic uncertainties and disturbances cannot be ignored when striving towards high-performance autonomous driving. Meanwhile, advanced vehicular sensing technology enables more and more self-driving techniques to come out. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to holistically address the system uncertainties and disturbances in the path tracking control of autonomous vehicles (AVs) by the preview control theory to achieve superior control performance. First, unmeasureable multi-uncertainties and the external disturbance are considered simultaneously into the robust gain-scheduling framework with variable longitudinal velocity. Then, by the equivalent delay approach, ineluctable time-varying system delays are effectively handled. Next, the physical constraints of the steering system and direct yaw moment control (DYC) system are considered for practical implementation through robust set invariance theory. The parallel distributed compensation (PDC) technique and auxiliary feedback matrices approach are introduced for reducing design conservatism. After that, by incorporating the road curvature into the augmented system state, the path tracking preview control problem can be solved without online optimization. Thereafter, the closed-loop system stability and guaranteed performance have been proved through the Lyapunov- Krasovski approach. The proposed controller design is finally reformulated as the optimization problem based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) via specific convexification techniques. Finally, to verify the validity of the proposed controller, Software in Loop (SIL) tests with Carsim full-vehicle model under different dynamic conditions have been implemented.},

The stability of the close-looped prediction-based control system under a certain delay boundary is analyzed, and the sufficient stability condition is proposed. Third, with the help of Cone Complementary Linearization (CCL), an iterative algorithm is proposed to design stabilized controller and observer gains.

Since the battery in the bus can be wirelessly charged during the moving, the need to stop for the vehicle at the charging station is eliminated, and recharging time is remarkably decreased. One of the best methodologies to commercialize the WCETB technology is to economically allocate the power tracks on considered routes while optimally determining the battery size of the vehicle at the same time. In this paper, the planning of the power transmitters and the capacity of the battery size for a WCETB with a multi-route model is optimally designed by Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). In particular, the DDPG algorithm is adopted in this model, an appropriate reward function is defined for the multiple route problem, and the optimal problem is solved by adopting the training ability of deep neural networks (DNNs), i.e., Actor and Critic neural networks. A complex Nguyen-Dupuis (N-D) traffic network with multiple routes is considered a case study to evaluate the validity and performance of the proposed deep learning scheme from a systematic point of view.

Based on our previous published work, this article designs and proposes a novel method for road profile estimation that is based on suspension nonlinear dynamics. The proposed approach first establishes the road profile height estimation model considering a real suspension design, including nonlinear characteristics of the shock absorber, bushing stiffness and damping, actual geometry of the control arms, and positioning of absorber. Unlike the conventional sprung-unsprung mass model, the real nonlinear suspension model provides much higher output prediction accuracy as computational and experimental results demonstrated. Moreover, the established estimation method and model require only two easily measurable parameters, which are the acceleration of the sprung mass and the travel of the shock absorber. While considering nonlinearity and hysteretic characteristics of the damping force, the proposed approach is based on the estimation framework of linear parameter-varying systems and establishes a sliding mode observer for estimating the road profile height. The stability of estimation error dynamics of the observer is guaranteed by the Lyapunov stability analysis. As bench-test experiments of a hardware implementation of the suspension-wheel unit validated the computational results. The tests demonstrated that the proposed method allows for real-time estimating of the road profile height in different road conditions and electric currents of the suspension damper and is robust to uncertainty of the payload.},

In DSCPSO, the tent chaos theory is introduced into the updating of particle swarm algorithm (PSO) populations, inertia weights and learning factors to enhance its ability to explore potentially better regions. Moreover, a memory tempering annealing (MTA) strategy is employed to guarantee particle pluralistic learning, which combines the superior robustness of the simulated annealing algorithm (SA) while enhancing population diversity. Furthermore, to achieve a reasonable tradeoff between exploration and exploitation, a dynamic lens imaging opposition-based learning (DLIOBL) and domain optimization strategy based on evolutionary information is designed, i.e., DLIOBL in the pre-evolutionary stage guarantees the depth of the exploration learning, while the domain optimization strategy is performed in the post-evolutionary stage accelerates the exploitation operation and avoids the problem of slow convergence in the late stages of PSO. The proposed method is applied to the parameter estimation of PMSM and the experimental results show that, the proposed method can track the VSI nonlinearity and variable parameter better than the conventional method under different working conditions.},

First, an improved Gaussian error function (IGEF)-based approximation strategy is presented to replace saturation nonlinearity in a smooth way. Then, an adaptive fixed-time control algorithm via sliding mode control is proposed with which the individual vehicle stability and string stability can be guaranteed in a given time, and the settling time can be prescribed in advance as needed. Besides, a set of adaptation laws are introduced to deal with uncertain parameters and unknown disturbances. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is illustrated by numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, automobiles have become increasingly networked with the development of information and communication technology (ICT). With the enhancement of the connectivity between the electronic control units of the vehicle and the external network, cybersecurity and driving safety issues have also arisen. However, as a traditional in-vehicle network standard, the controller area network (CAN) protocol lacks a network security mechanism design, making it vulnerable to hacker attacks. The current research on the cybersecurity enhancement method for in-vehicle CAN is a multi-objective optimization problem with response time, bandwidth consumption and computational complexity reduction. This study presents an in-vehicle message authentication method based on digital watermark and Huffman coding that are compatible with current CAN bus protocols. Our method not only minimize the delay of message authentication, but also save the storage resources to the greatest extent. Moreover, to tackle the issue of low computing resources, multiple messages can be authenticated at one time. In order to evaluate the performance, we implement our method on CAN communication platform and validate its high accuracy, low latency, and compatibility.},

The complex low-level interactions between the thermal and the electrical part represent a non-trivial and challenging system to be controlled online. We present a novel controller architecture composed of a supervisory controller for the energy management, a feedforward cylinder deactivation controller, and a track region-dependent low-level nonlinear model predictive controller to optimize the engine actuators. Except for the nonlinear model predictive controller, the proposed controller subsystems are computationally inexpensive and are real time capable. The framework is tested and validated in a simulation environment for several realistic scenarios disturbed by driver actions or grip conditions on the track. In particular, we analyze how the control architecture deals with an unexpected gearshift trajectory during an acceleration phase. Further, we demonstrate how an increased maximum velocity trajectory impacts the online low-level controller. Our results show a suboptimality over an entire lap with respect to the benchmark solution of 49 ms and 64 ms, respectively, which we deem acceptable. Compared to the same control architecture with full knowledge of the disturbances, the suboptimality amounted to only 2 ms and 17 ms. For all case studies we show that the cylinder deactivation capability decreases the suboptimality by 7 to 8 ms.},

  abstract     = {The levitation-propulsion integration ability of radial permanent magnet electrodynamic wheel (PM EDW) renders its competitive edge over other magnetic levitation systems. A low-cost and effective second induction method is proposed to target the synchronous improvement of the saturation speed, levitation and propulsion forces. Its effectiveness is determined from the small-scale EDW to the full-scale EDW via theoretical model, simulation analysis and experiments test. First, according to magnetic charge theory, an updated EDW is proposed and developed. Simulated and tested results of the small-scale EDW demonstrate that the levitation force, propulsion force and saturation speed are increased by 14%, 7% and 30%. This improvement benefits the increased induced current and the mitigated skin effect. Afterwards, further analysis of the full-scale EDW with rings of various conductivity and thickness is conducted. The levitation force, propulsion force and saturation speed are enhanced by more than 50%, 10% and 200% synchronously. Based on analysis of power loss under the same levitation and propulsion forces, the updated EDW is more efficient than the original EDW. Ultimately, a proof-of-principle prototype with the updated EDW and 4-m long guideway are developed. The multi-loop PID control strategy along with dynamic mode implementation methodology are introduced. The scaled prototype is levitated over guideway at 12 mm and the levitation-propulsion ability is implemented with the maximum acceleration of 1.25 m/s 2 . This proof-of-principle prototype with updated EDW and control strategy paves the way to engineering applications of Maglev car.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the cooperative search for stationary targets by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited sensing range and communication ability in a dynamic threatening environment. The main purpose is to use multiple UAVs to find more unknown targets as soon as possible, increase the coverage rate of the mission area, and more importantly, guide UAVs away from threats. However, traditional search methods are mostly unscalable and perform poorly in dynamic environments. A new multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) method, DNQMIX, is proposed in this study to solve the multi-UAV cooperative target search (MCTS) problem. The reward function is also newly designed for the MCTS problem to guide UAVs to explore and exploit the environment information more efficiently. Moreover, this paper proposes a digital twin (DT) driven training framework “centralized training, decentralized execution, and continuous evolution” (CTDECE). It can facilitate the continuous evolution of MADRL models and solve the tradeoff between training speed and environment fidelity when MADRL is applied to real-world multi-UAV systems. Simulation results show that DNQMIX outperforms state-of-art methods in terms of search rate and coverage rate.},

To track the desired path and ensure driving stability, a robust tube-based model predictive control method is proposed considering lateral, yaw and roll motions. Simultaneously, for the longitudinal motion, a robust sliding mode control method is designed to achieve accurate tracking of longitudinal velocity. Meanwhile, the uncertain crosswind and varied passenger mass faced by the DDEBs are decoupled into external disturbances and their effects on the system are eliminated in both controllers. Then, to cope with energy optimization problem in path tracking, a torque distribution controller is constructed by formulating the vehicle stability margin, tracking dynamic requirements and energy efficiency as constrained weighted least squares problem. Finally, a Trucksim-Simulink co-simulation is performed, where the simulation results demonstrated that the proposed control framework is robust and effective, and can achieve better energy saving effect compared to the original control methods.},

We verify the feasibility of our approach with extensive simulations and real-world experiments. First, we simulate wireless channels under realistic traffic conditions using a ray-tracing simulator and a traffic simulator. Next, we conduct experiments in a real-world environment and collect messages transmitted from a roadside unit (RSU). The results show that we are able to predict different levels of service with an accuracy above 80% both on the simulation and experimental data. Further, the proposed approach is capable of estimating the number of vehicles with a low mean absolute error on both data. Our approach is suitable to be deployed alongside the current monitoring systems. It doesn&#39;t require additional investment in infrastructure since it relies on existing vehicular networks.},

  abstract     = {Recently, many sparse arrays are proposed to achieve increased uniform degrees of freedom (uDoFs) for the direction of arrival (DoA) estimation of non-circular sources. In light of this recent attention, the high number of uDoFs is the primary motivation for designing those sparse array structures. Although both the number of uDoF and mutual coupling can influence the DoA estimation performance. However, mutual coupling is not considered in many of those sparse array configurations. In this article, two optimized shifted coprime arrays with sum-difference coarrays, called OSCAwSDCa-I and OSCAwSDCa-II, are proposed to reduce mutual coupling. The OSCAwSDCa-I and OSCAwSDCa-II are obtained by rearranging actual sensors of the augmented coprime array. The proposed array designs have closed-form expressions for their sensor locations and achievable uDoFs. Additionally, it is proven that the first three weights of OSCAwSDCa-II are independent of the array size. Moreover, the number of virtual sensors co-locating at the same lag is reduced. Consequently, smaller weight values are obtained, resulting in more robustness against mutual coupling. Finally, extensive simulations show that OSCAwSDCa-I and OSCAwSDCa-II can achieve comparable uDoFs concerning the existing array structures. In the presence of strong mutual coupling, simulation results demonstrate the robustness of OSCAwSDCa-II more than other compared configurations.},

  abstract     = {Dual-function periodic slotted patch and its quasi-complementary structure in designing large frequency ratio antennas for vehicular 5G communications are presented in this article. Firstly, a circular patch with periodic circular slots is employed as a partially reflecting surface (PRS) antenna in the millimeter-wave band. Simultaneously, the circular slotted patch is operated in the microwave band as a patch antenna, achieving dual functions. It is flexible to design the two antenna parts due to their polarization orthogonality. In the next place, with similar working principles, its quasi-complementary structure that contains periodic connected circular patches is also utilized for the large frequency ratio antenna design. As the proof of concept, two large frequency ratio antennas working in the 3.5-GHz and 28-GHz bands with a frequency ratio of 8 for 5G applications were designed. Finally, for verification, a periodic slotted patch antenna was fabricated and measured. Good agreement between the measured and simulated results is found. Measured −10-dB impedance bandwidths of 6.25% (3.41–3.63 GHz) and 20.57% (24.21–29.76 GHz), and measured peak antenna gains of 8.14 dBi and 14.04 dBi are obtained at the lower and upper bands, respectively.

However, fading channels can adversely affect the performance of UAV-assisted dual-hop FSO systems owing to various factors. This paper presents a unified system performance analysis of UAV-assisted dual-hop FSO/FSO systems with the amplify-and-forward relaying protocol and intensity modulation/direct detection technique. For general applicability, the influence of the attenuation loss, atmospheric turbulence, pointing error impairments, and angle-of-arrival (AOA) fluctuations on the FSO link between the source and the UAV is considered. Meanwhile, the FSO link between the UAV and the destination is modeled using Málaga distribution channels, which are affected by atmospheric turbulence. The tight closed-form expressions for the outage probability and the average bit error rate of the dual-hop system are derived, followed with the diversity order of the system in the high signal-to-noise ratio range. Furthermore, the impact of various system parameters and channel parameters correlated with the attenuation loss, atmospheric turbulence, pointing error impairments, and AOA fluctuations on the system performance is studied, and a detailed comparative investigation of the various modulation schemes is conducted. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate the analytical results.},

  abstract     = {Network forces attempt to dominate the spectrum in tactical wireless networks while preventing their opponents from holding any communication. In this context, both the defensive and the offensive capabilities of a network force are critical. Therefore, in this paper, we study the communication competition between two network forces, denoted as blue force (BF) and red force (RF), where each force is equipped with a transmitter, a receiver, and a friendly jammer. We propose defense and offense strategies for the BF using recurrent neural networks (RNN)s where the occupied channels by the RF nodes in the future time slots are predicted. Then the entity of each occupied channel in terms of RF users and jammer is identified. As a result, the BF transmitter finds unoccupied channels, and the BF jammer jams the RF transmitter&#39;s channels. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by calculating both the ergodic rate (ER) of the BF receiver and RF receiver as well as the prediction accuracy of RF future channels. Simulation results show that the BF receiver attains ER of at least 90% of the maximum achievable ER and a detection accuracy higher than 85% for all the considered scenarios. Furthermore, the BF jammer can target the RF transmitter frequency channels and can reduce the RF receiver ER to less than 10% of its maximum achievable value.},

A challenge of this technique is that the weighted least-squares (WLS) needed for it tend to incur the threshold effect when the noise level is high or when the localization geometry is poor, because its implementation requires the inversion of a matrix whose condition number will be large under such conditions. This paper presents an iterative method that does not require any matrix operation and is proved to be convergent with any initial value. Additionally, it outperforms the WLS-based methods as validated by comprehensive simulation results. Index Term -Angle-of-arrival (AOA), target localization, weighted least-squares (WLS).},

  abstract     = {Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications have very strict throughput and latency requirements, even in scenarios with high mobility. IEEE 802.11bd is being developed as a WiFi amendment to improve V2X performance, allowing up to three repetitions per packet, along with other features. Message repetitions increase time diversity and enable maximum ratio combining at the receiver, thus improving the probability of correct decoding. This paper investigates the IEEE 802.11bd packet repetition feature. First, we analyze how the increased channel load due to repetitions may in some cases result in a higher collision rate leading to lower network performance. Then, we propose two strategies for exploiting the IEEE 802.11bd repetition feature. The proposed strategies use the channel busy ratio to adapt the number of transmissions to the channel load and are validated through network-level simulations, which account for both the acquisition and decoding processes. Results show that the proposed strategies improve network performance under variable traffic conditions and enable fair access to the channel.},

However, incomplete 3D radio map is usually obtained in practice due to the infinite number of positions where aircraft perform RSS measurement suffering from constrained trajectories. In order to tackle this problem, we propose a 3D radio map reconstruction scheme based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), where a novel GAN variant with unsupervised learning is proposed. Specifically, the cost function of the variant integrates a reconstruction loss and an adversarial loss, while the network structure exploits ResNet and dilated convolution under the idea of patchGAN. Numerical results reveal that the network structure and the cost function can benefit the reconstruction scheme, yielding low-volatility and lower average mean squared error (MSE). Moreover, it is shown that the proposed scheme can outperform baselines in terms of the average MSE, even if the number of measured samples for inference significantly decreases.},

  abstract     = {Offloading tasks to edge servers has been regarded as a potential way to solve the computation resource poverty problem of the end devices like autonomous vehicles. However, due to the sharing and openness features of edge computing, it raises severe security problems. In order to combat such issues, Trust Execution Environment (TEE), such as TrustZone, is advocated to strength the security of task offloading to edge computing in the hardware level. For the exploration of TrustZone, the inevitable involvement of cryptographic operations make existing offloading strategies not applicable, or not efficient enough, any more. In addition, TrustZone does not allow multiple tasks to coexist and execute on one CPU core at the same time. Taking the above issues into consideration, we investigate a secure task offloading problem for minimizing the total task completion time under the constraint of energy budget. To address this problem, we propose a Priority-aware Secure Task Offloading (PASTO) algorithm and evaluate the performance of PASTO by both numerical analysis and prototype based experiments. All the experiment results show that PASTO can effectively reduce the total task completion time in comparison with other state-of-the-art offloading approaches in TrustZone-enabled edge clouds.},

By using order statistic and moment matching, we approximate the end-to-end channel gain to follow the Gamma distribution and then derive the approximate closed-form expressions for the average block error rate (BLER) in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime and then conduct a refined analysis of the interplay among the minimum common blocklength, optimal power allocation, and the related parameters of IRS (e.g., the number of elements of the IRS) for achieving target BLERs at two users. Finally, numerical and simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of theoretical analysis.

The RISeUAV performs as an aerial transponder and reflects optical and wireless communication signals in dense urban areas. The navigation problem of the RISeUAV is nontrivial where RISeUAV should be autonomously navigated through an energy-efficient obstacle-free path. Notably, the flight altitude should be relatively low to ensure the quality of ALoS service while the maximum possible ALoS links for vehicles are provided in an obstructed environment. However, designing the flight path for rendering valid ALoS service is an NP-hard problem that is not feasible in real-time for autonomous navigation. We model the RISeUAV navigation as an optimization problem and propose an efficient technique to make the problem computationally tractable in real-time using Benders’ decomposition method and sequential convex programming.

More specifically, on the one hand, a successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm is proposed to optimize the continuous transmit beamforming. On the other hand, by applying a SCA, penalty convex-concave procedure (PCCP), and quantization-based algorithm, the discrete phase shifts are obtained.

The proposed scheme allows primary and secondary transmitters to transmit in alternate time slots and, hence, no primary transmitter&#39;s (PT) interference at the secondary receiver (SR). However, since the relay node and secondary transmitter (ST) are transmitting simultaneously on the same frequency spectrum, ST causes interference to the primary user. Therefore, the proposed scheme imposes the variable interference threshold constraint (v-ITC) to ST transmit power to improve the performance of both primary and secondary networks. We derive the closed-form expressions for the outage probability and ergodic rate of the proposed system. Furthermore, numerical results are presented to manifest the advantages of the v-ITC scheme on outage performance and the ergodic rate of the secondary network (SN).},

  abstract     = {In this paper, spatial multiplexing aided orthogonal time-frequency space with index modulation (OTFS-IM) is conceived, which combines the benefits of both OTFS-IM and vertical-bell laboratories layered space-time (VBLAST) techniques. Specifically, in the proposed VBLAST-OTFS-IM, information bits are divided into groups, each of which is modulated by OTFS-IM before being transmitted via different antennas. This allows the proposed system to fully exploit the spatial multiplexing gain. To further analyze its theoretical performance gain over the original OTFS-IM, we summarize the mathematical input-output relations of OTFS-IM and VBLAST-OTFS-IM in the form of equivalent channel matrices. Based on that, the ABEP upper bounds are derived for both original OTFS-IM and VBLAST-OTFS-IM systems by exploiting the moment-generating function (MGF) to bypass the dismantling of the sparse structure of OTFS-IM. Finally, the superiority of VBLAST-OTFS-IM and the validity of the derived ABEP upper bounds are verified by our simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Extra-large massive multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is envisioned to be a promising technology for 6G wireless, where the number of antennas is greatly increased to a new extent, resulting in extra large aperture arrays. In this case, different users may see different array parts (termed as visible region, VR) due to the spatial non-stationarity. Exploiting the VR information can facilitate low-complexity transmission design, but how to acquire this information for a large amount of users is still challenging. To this end, we first establish a VR model for XL-MIMO systems and show that a user&#39;s VR is location-dependent. Assuming that the VRs of some beacon users can be known a priori, we propose three location-based VR recognition schemes, including Voronoi cell partition, weighted Voronoi cell partition, and a neural network (NN) approach termed VR-Net, which takes the location of a user as input and returns its VR index as output. Simulation results show that all schemes can achieve high VR recognition accuracy if the number of beacon users is sufficiently large. Notably, in the more practical scenario that the available location-VR dataset is limited, the proposed VR-Net is able to achieve much better recognition performance.},

However, it still remains an open question whether the reciprocity holds between the uplink and downlink channels in the IOS-aided wireless communications. In this work, we first present a physics-compliant IOS-related channel model, based on which the channel reciprocity is investigated. We then demonstrate the angle-dependent electromagnetic response of the IOS element in terms of both incident and departure angles. This serves as the key feature of IOS that drives our analytical results on beam non-reciprocity. Finally, simulation and experimental results are provided to verify our theoretical analyses.},

A novel successive interference cancellation-based CDU JCAS processing method is proposed to enable the estimation of uplink communication symbols and downlink sensing parameters.

By deploying a small number of active elements at the RIS, the RIS can receive and process the training signals. Through the partial channel state information (CSI) obtained from the active elements, the overall training overhead to estimate the entire channel can be dramatically reduced. To minimize the estimation complexity, the proposed technique is based on the linear combination of partial CSI, which only requires linear matrix operations. By exploiting the spatial correlation among the RIS elements, proper weights for the linear combination and normalization factors are developed. Numerical results show that the proposed technique outperforms other schemes using the active elements at the RIS in terms of the normalized mean squared error when the number of active elements is small, which is necessary to maintain the low cost and power consumption of RIS.},

However, to minimize the performance loss caused by a coarse-resolution spatial equalization matrix, its coefficients must be carefully designed in the minimum mean-square error sense to achieve the desired bit error rate (BER) performance, which unfortunately constitutes an NP-hard optimization problem. To tackle this problem, we first reformulate the finite-alphabet equalization design problem as an unconstrained optimization on a smooth Riemannian manifold. Then we propose an algorithm based on Riemannian manifold optimization (RMO) to solve the reformulated problem. Based on simulation results, the proposed 2-bit RMO-assisted equalizer outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts while maintaining the same asymptotic complexity.

We propose simple and highly efficient AoA estimators, by approximating the power of the array response as a Gaussian function. One estimator is based on the power ratio and can coherently combine multiple measurements scanned at arbitrary intervals and with different beam widths. The other two are based on an innovative idea of Gaussian curve fitting with weighted least square techniques, and one of them can even work without knowing the beam width.

Explicitly, both the amplitude-phase shift keying (A-PSK) and quadrature amplitude-phase shift keying (QA-PSK) are conceived, where the RIS is assumed to be part of a transmitter to deliver information to the multi-antenna aided downlink receiver. In the proposed design, the RIS is partitioned into multiple blocks, and the information bits are conveyed by controlling both the ON-OFF state and the phase shift of the RIS elements in each block. Since the propagation paths spanning from each RIS block to the receiver can be coherently combined as a benefit of appropriately configuring the phase of the RIS elements, the received signal constellations can be designed by controlling both the ON-OFF pattern of the RIS blocks as well as the phase shift of the RIS elements. Both the theoretical analysis and the simulation results show that our proposed RIS-aided modulation schemes outperform the state-of-the-art RIS-based PSK modulation both in terms of its discrete-input-continuous-output memoryless channel (DCMC) capacity and its symbol error probability, especially in the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) region, when considering realistic finite resolution RIS phase shifts.},

Unlike previous works on GFRA that regard all user equipments (UEs) selecting the same pilot as undetectable, we give a more accurate model that the access point (AP) can detect the strongest UE when its signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) exceeds a threshold. On top of this, we also define the concept of effective access that a UE is successfully detected by APs around it within a limited area. With tools from stochastic geometry, the probability of UE effective access and the minimum required AP spatial density that satisfies UEs&#39; access delay constraints are derived. It is found that increasing the AP antenna number from 1 to 2 can significantly improve the UE access probability and reduce the required AP number, while this improvement decays quickly as the antenna number keeps growing, which works more obviously when the access delay constraint is strict or the pilot length is short.},

However, the newly proposed power-consumption outage indicates that the heat generated by high data rate devices has an influence on the performance. This correspondence investigates a novel resource allocation scheme considering power-consumption outage. Specifically, based on the analysis of the heat transfer model in the smartphone, we formulate the problem to jointly allocate the downlink power and bandwidth while considering the impact of power-consumption outage. According to the dynamic feature of the problem, the Markov decision process (MDP) is utilized to model it. Furthermore, dut to the continuity of action space, the problem is handled by normalized advantage function (NAF), a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is corroborated in the simulation results on the basis of which its applicability for services with different features is further discussed.},

For this purpose, we have conducted several channel measurement campaigns in the airport area at UHF- and L-band (around 433 MHz and 1.518 GHz). In the line-of-sight (LoS) case, we give the distance-dependent pathloss models for both frequenciy bands. Meanwhile, it is found that the measured pathloss in the LoS scenario has a good agreement with the two-ray propagation model at short link distances. This is because of the strong ground reflection path. In the non-LoS (NLoS) case, we propose the elevation-dependent pathloss model at UHF-band based on the field measurement results. On the other hand, considering that the airframe of the UAV can block the wave propagation during the 3-D rotation in the air and the taking off and landing procedures, we specifically analyze the statistical characteristics of the airframe shadowing loss for the two cases and provide the loss distribution models for the fixed-wing, small-sized UAVs made of wood structure and carbon fiber skins.},

  abstract     = {The prevailing issue in multi-hop wireless networking is interference management, which militates against the efficiency of traditional routing and scheduling algorithms. We develop a self-supervised learning approach to address the classic NP-hard problem of capacity optimization over a multi-hop wireless network, where the routing and scheduling decisions are deeply coupled. Our two-stage design leverages historical computation experiences to accelerate the optimization of new problem instances, where an instance represents the application-level input containing network topology, interference model, and other user-level traffic constraints. The first stage, Scheduling Structure Classification (SSC), distills the scheduling structure of the historical optimization instances into an appropriate number of classes, through a properly designed clustering algorithm without prior assumption or knowledge. The second stage uses the instances labelled with class information from the first stage to train an Application Identification (AID) neural network model capable of predicting a future problem instance&#39;s scheduling class given its application-level information. When solving the new instance, its predicted scheduling class and the associated scheduling structure are exploited to compute an efficient approximate solution, avoiding the time-consuming iterative search for such scheduling structure as practiced by the conventional approaches. We apply our method to different types of wireless multi-commodity flow problems across various network sizes and disparate flow requirements. The results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the computation time robustly by at least 70% with only slight loss in the solution quality.},

However, as the reliability and trust requirements for connected autonomous systems continue to grow, the centralized communication and decision approaches that are in use today are reaching their limits. Focusing on autonomous driving applications, this paper proposes a resilient and trustworthy framework on wireless distributed consensus networks, where the communication links are less reliable or are even in the presence of incorrect local sensor readings/decisions. To accomplish that, a novel three stages consensus mechanism is proposed based on the practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT), where the veto collection and gossip stages are designed to meet the stringent and complex requirements for a vehicle&#39;s maneuvers. A plan tree synthesis is also proposed to make consensus on a series of decisions while adopting network members&#39; decision preferences. A detailed protocol including the distributed consensus, plan tree synthesis, dynamic grouping, etc. is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed consensus mechanism is able to be reached and propagated through the network under poor wireless communication conditions and the presence of faulty vehicles with incorrect sensor readings. The result can be extended to other autonomous systems to significantly enhance safety in critical industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {The past decade&#39;s research in RF-based indoor localization has shown the possibility of decimeter-level accuracy based on the Angle of Arrival (AoA) of WiFi signals. However, existing systems require either recurring manual calibrations or the assistance of extra sensors to calibrate uncertain initial phases for accurate AoA estimation, hindering their large-scale deployment. In this paper, we propose AutoLoc, a ubiquitous localization system that overcomes the above limitation and can be seamlessly applied to the widely deployed WiFi Access Points. The key insight underlining AutoLoc is that the uncertain initial phase is constant once the RF oscillators are frequency locked. To this end, we propose three main innovations. First, we eliminate the uncertain initial phase while preserving the geometric information by combining Channel State Information (CSI) from different locations. Second, we introduce a cooperative confidence-aware localization algorithm that accurately localizes the target by quantifying the confidence of all possible AoA candidates. Third, we design a two-phase localization framework to fortify AutoLoc in multipath-rich scenarios. We implement AutoLoc on Commercial Off-The-Shelf WiFi devices. The experiment results in large-scale environments reveal that AutoLoc can achieve comparable median accuracy and 54 &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\%$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; better 90 &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\%$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; percentile accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art localization approach with manual calibration.},

  abstract     = {Offloading computationally heavy tasks from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to a remote server helps improve battery life and can help reduce resource requirements. Deep learning based state-of-the-art computer vision tasks, such as object segmentation and detection, are computationally heavy algorithms, requiring large memory and computing power. Many UAVs are using (pretrained) off-the-shelf versions of such algorithms. Offloading such power-hungry algorithms to a remote server could help UAVs save power significantly. However, deep learning based algorithms are susceptible to noise, and a wireless communication system, by its nature, introduces noise to the original signal. When the signal represents an image, noise affects the image. There has not been much work studying the effect of the noise introduced by the communication system on pretrained deep networks. In this work, we first analyze how reliable it is to offload deep learning based computer vision tasks (including both object segmentation and detection) by focusing on the effect of various parameters of a 5G wireless communication system on the transmitted image and demonstrate how the introduced noise of the used 5G system reduces the performance of the offloaded deep learning task. Then solutions are introduced to eliminate (or reduce) the negative effect of the noise. Proposed framework starts with introducing many classical techniques as alternative solutions, and then introduces a novel deep learning based solution to denoise the given noisy input image. The performance of various denoising algorithms on offloading both object segmentation and object detection tasks are compared. Our proposed deep transformer-based denoiser algorithm (NR-Net) yields state-of-the-art results in our experiments.},

  abstract     = {Wireless fingerprint localization technologies have drawn significant attention because of their ubiquitous infrastructure and low energy consumption. However, they often suffer from the Received Signal Strength (RSS) instability (i.e., RSS variations across heterogeneous devices and RSS fluctuations over time) and fingerprint spatial ambiguity issues. Although various deep learning-based methods have been proposed recently, most of them only pursue remarkable accuracy in an ideal environment and escape the above-mentioned problems. The co-existence of these factors would make most existing methods suboptimal or invalid when applied in real scenarios. In this paper, to address the RSS instability, we define the fingerprint spatial gradient (FSG), which can convert the vulnerable and unstable fingerprints to stable relative values but lose absolute information for positioning. Next, to relieve the fingerprint instability and model the temporal sequential dependencies in a trajectory, we propose a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM)-based framework to fuse FSG and RSS, where an attention module is used to guide the fusion according to their contributions to the result. Finally, the beam search strategy is used to search for the optimal solution from outputs of the LSTM, eliminating the spatial ambiguity of fingerprints. The experiments show that DeepWiPos reduces average positioning error by 23.44% and 22.18% on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, respectively when compared with the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Fog computing is an emerging technology which enables computing resources accessibility close to the end-users. It overcomes the drawbacks of available network bandwidth and delay in accessing the computing resources as observed in cloud computing environment. Resource allocation plays an important role in resource management in a fog computing environment. However, the existing traditional resource allocation techniques in fog computing do not guarantee less execution time, reduced energy consumption, and low latency requirements which is a pre-requisite for most of the modern fog computing-based applications. The complex fog computing environment requires a robust resource allocation technique to ensure the quality and optimal resource usage. Motivated from the aforementioned challenges and constraints, in this article, we propose a resource allocation technique for SDN-enabled fog computing with Collaborative Machine Learning (CML). The proposed CML model is integrated with the resource allocation technique for the SDN-enabled fog computing environment. The FogBus and iFogSim are deployed to test the results of the proposed technique using various performance evaluation metrics such as bandwidth usage, power consumption, latency, delay, and execution time. The results obtained are compared with other existing state-of-the-art techniques using the aforementioned performance evaluation metrics. The results obtained show that the proposed scheme reduces 19.35% processing time, 18.14% response time, and 25.29% time delay. Moreover, compared to the existing techniques, it reduces 21% execution time, 9% network usage, and 7% energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Multi-access edge computing (MEC) is regarded as a promising approach for providing resource-constrained mobile devices with computing resources through task offloading. Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is a code-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme that can meet the demands of multi-cell MEC networks for high data transmission rates and massive connections. In this paper, we propose an optimization framework for SCMA-enabled multi-cell MEC networks. The joint resource allocation and computation offloading problem is formulated to minimize the system cost, which is defined as the weighted energy cost and latency. Due to the nonconvexity of the proposed optimization problem induced by the coupled optimization variables, we first propose an algorithm based on the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to iteratively optimize the transmit power and edge computing resources allocation by deriving closed-form solutions, and further develop an improved low-complexity simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to solve the computation offloading and multi-cell SCMA codebook allocation problem. To solve the problem of partial state observation and timely decision-making in long-term optimization environment, we put forward a multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm with centralized training and distributed execution. Furthermore, we extend the framework to the partial offloading case and propose an algorithm based on alternating convex search for solving the task offloading ratio. Numerical results show that the proposed multi-cell SCMA-MEC scheme achieves lower energy consumption and system latency in comparison to the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and power-domain (PD) NOMA techniques.},

  abstract     = {Multi-connectivity facilitates higher throughput, shorter delay, and lower outage probability for a user in a wireless network. Considering these promises, a rationale policy for a network operator would be to implement multi-connectivity for all of its users. In this paper, we investigate whether the promises of multi-connectivity also hold in such a setting where all users of a network are connected through multiple links in the downlink. In particular, we consider a wireless network where every user connects to its &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; closest base stations. Using a framework of stochastic geometry and probability theory, we obtain analytic expressions for per-user throughput and outage probability of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -connectivity networks under several failure models. In contrast to the conclusions of previous research, our analysis shows that per-user throughput always decreases with increasing &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; . However, multi-connected networks are more resilient against failures than single connected networks as reflected with lower outage probability. Moreover, multi-connectivity leads to higher throughput fairness among the users. Consequently, we conclude that rather than implementing multi-connectivity for all users, a network operator should consider it for the users who would benefit from additional links the most, e.g., cell edge users.},

  abstract     = {Fog-based road condition monitoring systems (RCMS) have been widely deployed to reduce traffic congestion and improve road safety. Considering the semi-credibility of fog nodes (FNs), it is vital to perform mutual authentication between vehicles and FNs (V2F). However, existing schemes require the remote trusted authority (TA) participating in V2F authentication online, which results in huge network delays. Besides, these schemes pre-store numerous pseudonyms and private keys into vehicles for identity privacy protection, resulting in an excessive memory burden. Moreover, most schemes fail to consider the reliability and confidentiality of road information provided by vehicles. Inspired by this, we design an reliable and privacy-preserving V2F authentication scheme (VFAS) without real-time participation of TA. Notably, pseudonyms and full private keys are produced by the vehicle itself rather than being pre-stored in the vehicle, which greatly reduces the vehicle&#39;s memory burden. Moreover, to ensure the reliability and confidentiality, FN receives road information encrypted with session keys from more than threshold &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\omega$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; different vehicles.

  abstract     = {In millimeter-wave (mmWave) cellular network, the highly directional beam generated by large-scale antenna array considerably depresses the inter-cell/intra-cell interferences. To fully exploit this feature in resource management, we introduce the concept of near interference-free (NIF) scheduling, representing a well-designed user scheduling scheme which avoids the possible strong interferences in mmWave network. In this paper, a generalized NIF scheduling methodology is proposed to jointly design user scheduling, beam scheduling and power allocation. The proposed methodology exhibits versatility to handle various optimization objectives, including the maximization of (weighted) sum rate, the maximization of minimum user rate, and the minimization of total transmit power. We take into account 3-dimensional user scheduling (over time, frequency and spatial domain) under the constraints induced by hybrid analog-digital beamforming. The directional beam feature is utilized to simplify the problem, and leads to linearity/convexity in the optimization of resource allocation. For each of the studied optimization objectives, simulation results validate that our proposed NIF scheduling methodology outperforms the state-of-the-art user scheduling schemes.},

Collaborative caching among edge servers and user devices has been regarded as a promising technology for releasing backhaul pressure and reducing content download delay in the next-generation communication network. However, given the capacity constraint of edge servers and caching devices, a challenge is how to exploit these storage resources efficiently. In this paper, we introduce a three-tier collaborative caching architecture for edge-user networks and propose a social-aware graph-based collaborative caching (SGCC) strategy to minimize content download delay. Specifically, the small base station tier and user equipment tier are modeled as a one-tier directed graph. Moreover, we model the physical attributes and social attributes as the weight of the directed edges in the physical link graph and social graph, respectively. Then, we construct a social-aware graph by merging the two-tier topology of the physical link graph and social graph to simplify the caching decision. Further, we design SGCC to cache the most popular content according to the weighted content popularity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SGCC can effectively reduce the average download delay and has a 26.8% lower average download delay, compared with the uniform popular caching baseline.},

  abstract     = {To avoid physically extracting secrets from the storage of devices, Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is used in various authentication schemes. In these schemes, after the devices are registered on the Trusted Authority (TA), the subsequent authentication still must need the help of the TA. And these devices usually don&#39;t move. Due to the high mobility of vehicles, frequent involvement with the TA becomes expensive and impractical in motion. As a result, these schemes are not well suited to VANETs where devices move at high speeds. Motivated from this, we propose a physically secure and conditional-privacy authenticated key agreement scheme for VANETs. In the proposed scheme, PUF is utilized to prevent the physical extraction of secrets from vehicles and RSUs. Unlike others using PUF, the proposed scheme does not require the TA&#39;s participation during the authentication between the vehicles and RSUs. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme provides conditional-privacy with pseudonym mechanism, which enables the anonymity of legitimate vehicles and the tracking of malicious vehicles. Then, formal and informal security analysis show that the proposed scheme meets the expected goals and is secure against several known attacks in VANETs. Finally, compared with relevant studies, the proposed scheme has certain advantages in computation burden and communication burden.},

  abstract     = {Traffic monitoring services show great potential for improving traffic efficiency in vehicular networks. With the assistance of 5G innovation, vehicles can report information such as driving misbehavior and traffic status to the traffic monitoring server which then returns feedback to the network to enhance the efficiency of traffic management. However, some challenging issues in information reporting need to be addressed first. Trivial reported information significantly increases the workload of the server. Moreover, a server is difficult to distinguish the truth of reported messages. As a result, the server is incapable of returning immediate feedback to the network, thereby reducing the quality of traffic services. Meanwhile, uploading location-based information to the server exposes vehicles&#39; privacy. Although some existing techniques such as trust management benefit information reporting, a complete framework is still missing. In this paper, we propose an information reporting framework for solving both efficiency and privacy issues. Specifically, messages are probabilistically reported to the server depending on their importance. Furthermore, the DAG-based blockchain ensures that messages reported for a specific event are all gathered in the same ledger. We also present a scheme based on the geo-indistinguishability to protect the location privacy of vehicles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework preserves the location privacy of vehicles and achieves efficiency with acceptable overheads.},

This paper is intended for the cache strategy in the non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellite constellations and formulates an effective data sharing strategy between NGSO satellites for avoiding the invalidation of cached data. The density of cached data is a key indicator for the sharing strategy, because excessive sharing can increase the probability of cache hits at the expense of waste of resources and vice versa. Spreading dynamics is a physical model to describe the interaction of individuals in complex networks, which is helpful to predict the decisive threshold in the system. Therefore, this paper identifies the relationship between satellite speed, constellation structure, data size and hit probability, calculating a decisive threshold for the effective data density based on spreading dynamics. Meanwhile, the ideas of water-filling algorithm and reinforcement learning algorithm have been improved and applied to the data sharing strategy limited by the satellite cache space. Finally, the proposed strategy is compared with the traditional strategy in a variety of scenarios, and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed optimization strategy in terms of energy consumption and service delay.},

We evaluate the security properties of the proposed protocol by the formal analysis tool AVISPA and compare it with the existing schemes in terms of computing overhead, transmission overhead, signaling overhead, and security. The comprehensive results indicate that our protocol performs better in all aspects and has higher reliability and scalability.

However, in a multi-RSU VEC scenario, the uneven geographical distribution of the vehicles naturally causes the load imbalance among the edge servers and leads to the overload and performance degradation problems of the edge servers in hot areas. To this end, in this paper, we propose a joint task offloading and resource allocation for VEC with edge-edge cooperation, in which the tasks offloaded to a high-load edge server can be further offloaded to the other low-load edge servers. Our objective is to minimize the total task processing delay of all the vehicles while guaranteeing the task processing delay tolerance and the holding time of each vehicle. An M/M/1 queue is used to model the task queuing and task computing processes on each RSU. An exact potential game is adopted to model the competition process for the task offloading among the RSUs. A two-stage iterative algorithm is designed to decompose the optimization problem into two stages and solve them iteratively. We analyze the computational complexity of the algorithm and conduct extensive simulations by varying different crucial parameters. The superiority of our scheme is demonstrated in comparison with 3 other reference schemes.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Vehicles (IoV) realizes information interaction between vehicles and all networked entities, and the heterogeneous, openness, and diversity make it suffer from various security challenges such as authentication and access control problems. Attribute-based signature (ABS) is a promising cryptographic tool for addressing the above concerns, however, some existing ABS schemes take heavy computation overheads for signature verification. Though some server-aided ABS schemes are proposed to enhance performance, those schemes suffer from devastating collusion attacks. In addition, current signature-policy ABS schemes only support the single threshold access policy, which fails to meet various access control requirements of IoV. To address the above problems, we propose an efficient server-aided ABS with collusion resistance (SAABS-CR) for IoV. It utilizes server-aided computation technology to mitigate the computation burden of verifiers, while resisting perfectly the collusion attacks that include between signers and between the signer and the aided server. Moreover, SAABS-CR supports flexible expressions of access policy under the signature-policy framework by using the linear secret-sharing scheme (LSSS), and it is proved to be secure in the security model of strong unforgeability against chosen-message attacks (SU-CMA). Theoretical analyses and experimental evaluations show that SAABS-CR improves efficiency by reducing the time cost of signature generation at least 34.8% and user verification at least 15%.},

A Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) energy trading has emerged as one of the most promising alternatives for relieving the load imposed on the traditional grid enabling two individuals to buy and sell energy directly without intermediaries. However, the Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV) environment is trustless, and such P2P energy trading is prone to different kinds of cyber attacks. Blockchain technology has lately been proposed to implement V2V energy trading to securely and fairly share energy. The consensus mechanism is one of the most important modules of blockchain applied to the V2V network. It determines the efficiency and security among untrustworthy EVs of the energy trading blockchain (ETB). Nevertheless, most works on ETB have currently adopted traditional consensus mechanisms. Due to high computing power and communication overhead, these consensus algorithms are unsuitable for applications requiring real-time services such as energy trading. The efficient and secured Hashgraph is the revolutionary technology of consensus in blockchain and a promising technology suitable for V2V energy trading with frequent transactions. However, Hashgraph does not support the dynamic addition and deletion of nodes and is completely decentralized and vulnerable to Sybil Attack in a large-scale blockchain. Furthermore, this “complete decentralization” model may result in states losing the ability to macro-control the energy industry and even systemic energy security issues. Therefore, we propose a Block Alliance Consensus (BAC) mechanism to solve these problems. BAC can maintain the throughput of Hashgraph and resist Sybil Attack in a large-scale P2P energy trading network. We design a cryptography-based leader election mechanism and adopt a reputation incentive mechanism to motivate honest and cooperative electric vehicles (EVs). Finally, we implement ETB and the BAC consensus mechanism on the Hyperledger Fabric platform. The high efficiency and security of BAC and the blockchain-based V2V energy trading platform are verified through experiments.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of the joint design of the mobile communication system and the control scheme for enabling vehicle platooning applications. Vehicles communicate essential information for platooning control through multi-hop vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications and are assisted in this task by Road Side Units (RSU), when available. While classical approaches, adopted in previous and current mobile systems, consider the application needs solely as requirements for the communication network, we advocate a bi-directional interaction of application and communication network. We first study the impact of different communication strategies on the application-level performance, namely the inter-vehicle distance in the platoon. Such schemes introduce a tradeoff between the packet delivery rate and the additional delay introduced by relaying. In order to assess the impact of both metrics, we start by developing a Markov model for the different communication links (inter-vehicle and vehicle-to-RSU). We then propose a cross-layer approach that adapts the application layer (platoon control parameters) to the observed Medium Access Control (MAC) layer performance. We demonstrate via simulations the benefit of the proposed relaying scheme, and that a joint design of application and communication systems is essential for enabling the integration of industrial applications in future generation networks.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow forecasting is a challenging task due to its spatio-temporal nature and the stochastic features underlying complex traffic situations. Currently, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) methods are among the most successful and promising approaches. However, most GCNs methods rely on a static graph structure, which is generally unable to extract the dynamic spatio-temporal relationships of traffic data and to interpret trip patterns or motivation behind traffic flows. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantics-aware Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (SDGCN) for traffic flow forecasting. A sparse, state-sharing, hidden Markov model is applied to capture the patterns of traffic flows from sparse trajectory data; this way, latent states, as well as transition matrices that govern the observed trajectory, can be learned. Consequently, we can build dynamic Laplacian matrices adaptively by jointly considering the trip pattern and motivation of traffic flows. Moreover, high-order Laplacian matrices can be obtained by a newly designed forward algorithm of low time complexity. GCN is then employed to exploit spatial features, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is applied to exploit temporal features. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world traffic datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of SDGCN outperforms existing traffic flow forecasting methods. In addition, it provides better explanations of the generative Laplace matrices, making it suitable for traffic flow forecasting in large cities and providing insight into the causes of various phenomena such as traffic congestion.},

  abstract     = {For multi-task mobile edge computing (MEC) systems in satellite Internet of Things (IoT), there are dependencies between different tasks, which need to be collected and jointly offloaded. It is crucial to allocate the computing and communication resources reasonably due to the scarcity of satellite communication and computing resources. To address this issue, we propose a joint multi-task offloading and resource allocation scheme in satellite IoT to improve the offloading efficiency. We first construct a novel resource allocation and task scheduling system in which tasks are collected and decided by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) based aerial base stations, the edge computing services are provided by satellites. Furthermore, we investigate the multi-task joint computation offloading problem in the framework. Specifically, we model tasks with dependencies as directed acyclic graphs (DAG), then we propose an attention mechanism and proximal policy optimization (A-PPO) collaborative algorithm to learn the best offloading strategy. The simulation results show that the A-PPO algorithm can converge in 25 steps. Furthermore, the A-PPO algorithm reduces cost by at least 8.87 &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\%$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; compared to several baseline algorithms.

Leveraging the random blockage model, we model the LOS coverage area as Boolean models on these Cox point processes. The LOS coverage area is then evaluated by its area fraction. We show that relays can increase the area fraction of LOS coverage by nearly 50% even when RSUs and relays are spatially correlated.

However, the short battery life and moderate computational capability restrict UAVs to repeatedly execute the computation-intensive and energy-consuming search tasks. To address the issue, in this paper, we utilize edge computing to develop a continual and cooperative UAV search mechanism. Specifically, we first establish an edge computing enabled multi-UAV cooperative search framework, in which the mobility model of UAV, search task computing and offloading models are presented. An uncertainty minimization problem is then formulated, aiming to obtain a high-efficiency and high-confidence search result at the unpredictable uncertainty in search area. Considering that round-trip energy consumption, offloading decision-making, and trajectory planning may contribute to the reduction in uncertainty, we propose an uncertainty minimization-based cooperative target search (UMCTS) strategy. Finally, extensive simulation results validate that UMCTS can outperform the existing strategies and achieve at least 89% performance gain on average uncertainty. Based on the results, we also present a comprehensive analysis and discussion on how different parameters affect the search performance.},

As an integral part of the core network, NFV offers a fine-grained network capability to cellular operators by scaling out or scaling in network resources in an on-demand manner to meet the performance requirements. However, designing an autoscaling algorithm with low operation cost and low latency in non-standalone networks, where legacy network equipment coexists with a virtual evolved packet core (EPC), is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a dynamic NFV instance autoscaling algorithm that considers the tradeoff between performance and operation cost. Furthermore, we develop an analytical framework to assess the performance of the scheme by modeling the hybrid network as a queueing system that includes both legacy network equipment and NFV instances. The virtualized network function (VNF) instances are powered on or off according to the number of job requests. Numerical results based on extensive simulations validate the correctness of the model and the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

  abstract     = {With a growing demand for the development of smart ocean projects, the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) integrating multiple networks will gradually become the mainstream, particularly for civil, commercial, and military scenarios. During development, however, the security aspect cannot be ignored. Faced with possible future battles on the ocean, this study focuses on underwater source location privacy protection for both static and mobile sources. By combining the Ekman drift model, location privacy protection is converted into multi-round gaming between the source and adversary, in which two ways of gaming on nodes, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), and adversary are adopted to protect the static source location. Because the location of the mobile source, such as underwater intelligent agent, changes regularly, the protection for this type of source is focused on the trajectory, preventing the mobile source from being tracked. This paper aims to protect the location privacy of the static source first and then initial attempts to protect the dynamic source location privacy. By fuzzing the remaining semantic information after the mobile source passes by, the trajectory of the mobile source is protected, thereby protecting its location privacy. Compared with existing algorithms, the simulation results of the proposed scheme indicate the probability that the source has been captured. Furthermore, the results show that the period of safety of the proposed algorithm is longer than that of a multi-hop-based location privacy protection scheme but shorter than that of an autonomous underwater vehicle based scheme. Although the difference in the energy consumption of the nodes among the compared schemes is little increased, the delay varies significantly.},

  abstract     = {In vehicle edge computing network (VECN), a key issue for the roadside unit (RSU) is how to handle computationally intensive tasks timely and use energy efficiently. When an RSU cannot finish the task on time, computation offloading will be an effective approach. However, when offloading tasks most RSUs neglect the energy supply and do not consider computation requirement and energy supply jointly. In this paper, we consider a VECN where there are multiple RSUs. When an RSU has a computational task with latency constraint, it will offload the task to the nearby RSUs and/or cloud servers, and purchase electricity from the neighbors and/or power grid if it is also short of power. To conserve energy and reduce cost, not only the collaboration between the VECN and the cloud/grid, but also the collaboration of RSUs within the VECN is investigated. Specifically, we first formulate the information-energy collaboration problem, and study how the strategies of computation offloading and energy sharing interact with each other, where the RSU&#39;s individual revenue is considered. Next, since the problem is a mixed nonlinear programming problem that is hard to be solved, we reformulate it into a double-level coalition formation game, based on which an algorithm with low complexity is proposed. Finally, we prove theoretically that through finite iterations, the game-based algorithm can converge to a stable Nash equilibrium which is the solution to the original problem. Simulation results show that our scheme is superior to the existing ones in reducing edge network expenses while improving individual revenue.},

Assuming that each user equipment (UE) and access point (AP) employs finite resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) respectively, and by considering communication over spatially correlated Rician fading for the UE-AP channel, a novel Bussgang MMSE (B-MMSE) channel estimator for the 1 b-Q model is proposed. This approach leads to the derivation of generic spectral efficiency (SE) expressions using maximal ratio combining (MRC) and MMSE detections which are applicable also for the Mbits-Q case. In order to further improve the energy efficiency (EE) by using MMSE detection, two novel MMSE detectors, termed as low complexity local partial MMSE (LC-LP-MMSE) and LC-P-MMSE detectors, are proposed. Simulation results have shown that their SE performance is near to that of the optimal L-MMSE and MMSE detectors, while at the same time their EE performance is significantly improved as compared to the conventional LP-MMSE and P-MMSE detectors. Finally, a low complexity accessing scheme which jointly considers the competition-free cluster formation, pilot assignment, and power control, is proposed. Simulation results have shown that it outperforms the conventional random pilot assignment and user-group based pilot assignment schemes. Furthermore, in contrast to the equal power transmit strategy, it guarantees quality of service (QoS) fairness for all UEs.},

  abstract     = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) waveform has been considered as a potential candidate for affording a wide range of emerging communications and sensing applications in beyond 5G wireless technologies. OTFS takes advantage of both time and frequency selectivity of the doubly dispersive wireless environment, which has been considered as one of the limiting factors in classical wireless communication technologies. However, the performance of OTFS-based wireless systems is severely affected by fractional Doppler that arises due to inevitable and inherent characteristics of the wireless channel taps of not being always integer Doppler values in the delay-Doppler plane. Thus, this results in severe inter-Doppler interference (IDI) and a low channel sparsity in delay-Doppler (DD) domain. To this end, this work introduces a novel receiver (Rx) windowing technique to combat the impact of fractional Doppler on error performance of the OTFS-based transmission with practical pulse shaping filters at the transceiver. Specifically, we introduce a global cyclic prefix (CP) based raised cosine (RC) windowing at Rx in order to alleviate the effect of IDI on the received signal. To do so, the proposed scheme changes the pulse shape of the OTFS signal in DD domain that defines the IDI level and sparsity of the effective channel. Furthermore, we assess the performance of the proposed Rx windowed OTFS (RW-OTFS) scheme under various practical communication scenarios. The obtained numerical and simulation results validate the accuracy of the proposed IDI mitigator for OTFS systems in practical high-mobility scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-Reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) is a pivotal technique for enabling the wireless control over industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) devices. By deploying distributed access points (APs), cell-free massive multiple-input and multiple-output (CF mMIMO) has great potential to provide URLLC services for IIoT devices. In this paper, we investigate CF mMIMO-enabled URLLC in a smart factory. Lower bounds (LBs) of downlink ergodic data rate under finite channel blocklength (FCBL) with imperfect channel state information (CSI) are derived for maximum-ratio transmission (MRT), full-pilot zero-forcing (FZF), and local zero-forcing (LZF) precoding schemes. Meanwhile, the weighted sum rate is maximized by jointly optimizing the pilot power and transmission power based on the derived LBs. Specifically, we first provide the globally optimal solution of the pilot power, and then introduce some approximations to transform the original problems into a series of subproblems, which can be expressed in a geometric programming (GP) form that can be readily solved. Finally, an iterative algorithm is proposed to optimize the power allocation based on various precoding schemes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to the existing algorithms, and that the quality of URLLC services will benefit by deploying more APs, except for the FZF precoding scheme.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are viewed as key enablers for next-generation wireless communications. This paper investigates a multiuser downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO) system in which a multiantenna base station (BS) transmits information to multiple single-antenna users with the aid of both a half-duplex decode-and-forward (DF) relay and a full-duplex RIS. Active beamforming at the BS and the DF relay, as well as passive beamforming at the RIS, are jointly designed for system sum-rate maximization. The design problem is challenging to solve due to coupled beamforming variables. An alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm is proposed to tackle this complex co-design problem. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed hybrid relay–RIS system with a judicious joint beamforming design. Convergence and complexity analysis shows that the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm is dominated by the numbers of users and RIS elements, and the proposed scheme can converge in a few iterations even in the configuration of large numbers of users and RIS elements. Interesting tradeoffs posed in the joint design are discussed. An extension of the proposed design method to a related energy efficiency (EE) optimization problem is also outlined and implemented.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring that the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements are satisfied in wireless communications systems with high user density is challenging due to the limitations on the transmit power budget and the number of resource blocks. In this paper, we propose a QoS-aware joint user scheduling and power allocation technique to enhance the number of served users in the downlink of crowded extra-large scale massive multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) with minimum QoS requirements guarantee. The proposed technique is constituted by two sequential procedures: the clique search-based scheduling (CBS) algorithm for user scheduling followed by optimal power allocation with transmit power budget and minimum achievable rate per user constraints.We propose a generalized non-stationary multi-state channel model based on spherical wave propagation assuming that users under line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS (NLoS) transmission coexist in the same communication cell. This is done to accurately evaluate the proposed technique in realistic XL-MIMO scenarios. Numerical results reveal that the proposed CBS algorithm provides fair coverage over the whole cell area, achieving remarkable numbers of scheduled users with satisfied QoS requirements when users under the LoS and NLoS channel states coexist in the communication cell.},

The objective is to maximize the spectral efficiency by jointly optimizing the RIS&#39;s reflection coefficients and the hybrid precoder/combiner at the base station (BS)/mobile station (MS). By resorting to classical hybrid precoder/combiner optimization techniques, this joint beamforming problem can be converted into an optimization concerning only the design of the reflection coefficients. Nevertheless, the objective function of the resulting passive beamforming problem does not have an explicit expression of the reflection coefficients. To address this difficulty, the inherent structure of the effective channel is exploited, based on which an approximation of the truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) of the effective channel is obtained, and a favorable propagation environment can be realized by directly manipulating the singular values of the effective channel. Simulation results show that the proposed method can configure a favorable channel with a small condition number. Moreover, the proposed method presents a clear performance advantage over state-of-the-art algorithms, while with a low computational complexity.},

The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of an integrated Computed Vision (CV) approach for tuning the meta-atom states of a RIM structure working at mmWave frequency band, without estimating the interferes&#39; radio channel. In particular, the CV system will feed a logic unit running a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm to compute in real-time the coding schemes, namely the sequence of binary states associated to each unit-cell of the RIM, in order to obtain the target reconfigurable radiation pattern. Specifically, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is introduced to derive the most suitable radiation pattern for Beam Steering application, based on the input of a CV infrastructure. Results show the feasibility of such a kind of system, with an higher coverage achieved in dense scenarios, by improving the robustness against the potential blockages introduced by the mmWave technology.

The APR-EVD algorithm is computationally efficient and can be computed by making only one pass through the input matrix. We then develop two online algorithms based on APR-EVD for the dominant generalized eigenvectors extraction. Our proposed algorithms use the fact that GHEP is transformed into a standard eigenvalue problem, however to avert computations of a matrix inverse and inverse of the square root of a matrix, which are prohibitive, they exploit the rank-1 strategy for the transformation. Our algorithms are devised for extracting generalized eigenvectors for scenarios in which observed stochastic signals have unknown covariance matrices.

  abstract     = {The intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising technique in mmWave systems. However, most of the existing works on IRS-aided ISAC assume the availability of channel state information (CSI) along with high-overhead channel estimation. Besides, none has taken the impact of the echo interference from the communication user on the practical sensing performance into account. In this paper, we focus on the beamforming design in the presence of the destructive interference echo signal from the communication user and accordingly formulate a beam training problem for enhancing both sensing and communication performances. Considering that no CSI is available at the base station (BS), we propose a feedback-based joint active and passive beam training scheme by invoking a modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) method without requiring high-overhead cascaded channel estimation. Specifically, the BS updates the active and passive beams based on its received echo signal and user feedback information in the beam training period and then assigns them for more accurate sensing and more efficient communication in the ISAC period. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed feedback-based beam training scheme over the conventional beamforming schemes without considering the interference echo signal, in terms of both sensing and communication performances. Moreover, it is shown that the destructive echo interference from the communication user can be effectively mitigated by limiting the communication signal-to-noise ratio, thereby achieving better sensing performance.},

The designed metasurface can be simultaneously used as the radiation source of a wideband metasurface antenna, the surface waveguide of a surface-wave antenna and the frequency selective surface (FSS) of a circularly-polarized (CP) array. By placing a printed dipole below the metasurface, the linearly-polarized (LP) broadside radiation in the frequency band of 3.65∼4.58 GHz is realized. Besides, surface waves are excited and supported within the metasurface. Dual quasi-endfire patterns are then generated at two edges from 5.70 to 5.96 GHz due to the discontinuousness. In addition, the broadside CP radiation performance can be realized from 19.45 to 21.85 GHz by placing a CP array below the printed dipole. The designed antenna is simulated and measured. Measured results indicate that the proposed shared-metasurface antenna can be simultaneously applied to the vehicular terrestrial 5G, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) and vehicle-to-satellite (V2S) communications.},

This effect is already notable in 5G systems operating at 28 GHz and above with 400/800 MHz bandwidths, especially if broadband cancellation is needed between multiple beams. The wideband squinting effect reduces the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio of a multibeam system by changing the level and direction of the spatial null towards the interferer. This paper examines the effectiveness of the inter-beam interference (IBI) cancellation using crosscoupled signals for wideband arrays with visible squint effect. For a large relative bandwidth of the array, this paper presents a component carrier-based approach for interference cancellation between the beams of different users or data streams. Furthermore, as bandwidth and array size increase, the impact of squint increases, which is also examined for the cancellation of the IBI. Furthermore, an example scenario is simulated using standard 5GNR modulated waveforms.},

  abstract     = {The concept of Index Modulation (IM) has been actively researched as a benefit of its flexible trade-off between performance, achievable rate, energy efficiency, hardware cost and complexity. In order to fully exploit its the degrees of freedom, the concept of Multi-dimensional IM (MIM) has been developed in literature, where Compressed Sensing (CS) is often utilized to exploit the sparsity of the multi-dimensional transmitted signals. In this paper, we propose Deep Learning (DL) based detection for CS-aided MIM CS-MIM, where both Hard-Decision (HD) as well as Soft-Decision (SD) detection combined with iterative decoding are conceived. More explicitly, firstly, we propose learning aided hard and soft detection for CS-MIM. Secondly, two novel neural network aided methods are proposed for Iterative Soft Detection (ISD), where iterations are carried out between the CS-MIM detector and a channel decoder. The proposed learning-aided methods are capable of eliminating the overhead and complexity of Channel Estimation (CE), which results in an improved transmission rate. Explicitly, we develop an advanced DL architecture for blind-detection-aided MIM for the first time in the open literature, where the HD and SD CS algorithms are implemented by learning without the need for CE. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed learning techniques conceived for SD CS-MIM combined with iterative detection can achieve near-capacity performance at a reduced complexity compared to the conventional model-based SD relying on Channel State Information (CSI) acquisition.},

LensFD uses a low-cost lens array combined with transmit precoding to reshape the effective beam pattern of antennas in massive MIMO arrays to reduce self-interference. We tested three lens configurations in LensFD experimentally with a software-defined 40-antenna base-station and demonstrate a significant improvement in self-interference reduction and hence overall increased system capacity to 1.6× over the TDD counterpart.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the problem of robust beamforming for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) system, when there exist radar look direction mismatch and communication channel state information (CSI) error. To address these system imperfections, a region-of-interest (ROI) rather than a specific angle is considered for radar sensing, and the communication CSI is assumed to be available with a bounded unknown error. With these considerations, we design a robust dual-function beamformer through optimizing the radar sensing performance in terms of the energy radiated towards the ROI, while guaranteeing the communication quality-of-service (QoS) measured by the per-user signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as required. For this robust design, a max-min optimization problem is formulated and a semidefinite programming (SDP) reformulation based on the S-procedure is presented. The popular semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique is employed to solve the resulting non-convex problem, and the tightness of SDR is discussed. Further, we propose to incorporate an extra constraint of main beam control into the problem to achieve a flat magnitude response of the beampattern over the ROI. In addition, it is shown that the proposed approach is straightforwardly applicable to the scenario of multiple targets. Numerical examples are carried out to show the tightness, and demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MIMO-DFRC beamforming approach.},

We first establish a triple beam-based channel model using sampled steering vectors. Based on the presented channel model, we further develop a three-dimensional (3D) Markov random field (MRF) probability model to capture the structured channel sparsity. Then constrained Bethe free energy (BFE) minimization is introduced to provide a systematic theoretical framework for message passing. Under this framework, we derive a structured hybrid message passing (SHMP) algorithm to address the channel estimation problem. The proposed algorithm can significantly improve the estimation accuracy by exploiting the clustered sparse structure of channels with low complexity. Moreover, aiming at the fine factors of the triple beam-based channel model and the coupling parameter of the 3D-MRF sparsity model, we analyze the effect of their different settings in the numerical simulation. Finally, extensive simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed SHMP algorithm.},

  abstract     = {To realize the direction-of-arrivals (DoAs) estimation without the prior information about the multipath number, a novel method using the deep learning is introduced for the millimeter (mmWave) massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In particular, the DoAs estimation is decomposed into three sub-problems, which are solved by the corresponding convolutional neural network (CNN), respectively. The estimation of multipath number is achieved by a multi-label classification model using the proposed CNN-I. Then, the proposed CNN-II is introduced for the DoA estimation of the line-of-sight (LOS) path. Based on the predicted multipath number obtained by the CNN-I, a regression model using the proposed CNN-III is applied for the DoAs estimation of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) paths. The proposed DoAs estimation method is implemented by learning the non-linear relationship between the sample covariance matrix of the received signal and the angles, thus reconstructing the mapping model. A series of results validate the superiority of the proposed DoAs estimation method in low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regimes. The CNN-I is capable of achieving the good multipath number estimation performance across a range of SNRs. The classification model based on the proposed CNN-II and the regression model using the proposed CNN-III achieve the lower DoAs estimation root mean square error (RMSE) compared with some deep learning-based methods, estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) and Root-MUltiple SIgnal Classification (Root-MUSIC) methods. Remarkably, the proposed method using the CNN-II exhibits the good robustness in the DoA estimation of the LOS path. Furthermore, the low DoAs estimation RMSE is also achieved in the uniform planar array.},

It consists of a 33 × 33 HMS unit cells-based TA, a feeder horn, and a three-dimensional printed fixture to hold them. Each HMS unit cell has two identical metal patterns (MPs) of two symmetrical U-shaped patches and one H-shaped patch, which are distributed on both surfaces of the ultrathin substrate. A pair of top U-shaped patches form the first single-wavelength loop mode, and another pair of bottom U-shaped patches forms the second single-wavelength loop mode. Due to the different phases of the incident waves on the top and bottom U-shaped patches, the two loop modes are generated at different frequencies. A third half-wavelength dipole mode is provided by the H-shaped patch. The three modes correspond to three different frequencies, forming a wide transmission frequency band. Three near-unity transmission peaks are yielded to ensure high and stable aperture efficiency (AE). As well, the transmission phase of the HMS unit cell varies with geometric dimensions, and five unit cell types are quantized to obtain 360° phase range with a low loss of less than 2.6 dB. To verify the design concept, a prototype is fabricated. Measurements show a 3-dB gain bandwidth of 17.9%, a maximum gain of 30.5 dBi at 26.2 GHz, and a high AE of 41.9%.

  abstract     = {Configuring millimeter wave links following a conventional beam training protocol, as the one proposed in the current cellular standard, introduces a large communication overhead, especially relevant in vehicular systems, where the channels are highly dynamic. In this paper, we propose the use of a passive radar array to sense automotive radar transmissions coming from multiple vehicles on the road, and a radar processing chain that provides information about a reduced set of candidate beams for the links between the road-infrastructure and each one of the vehicles. This prior information can be later leveraged by the beam training protocol to significantly reduce overhead. The radar processing chain estimates both the timing and chirp rates of the radar signals, isolates the individual signals by filtering out interfering radar chirps, and estimates the spatial covariance of each individual radar transmission. Then, a deep network is used to translate features of these radar spatial covariances into features of the communication spatial covariances, by learning the intricate mapping between radar and communication channels, in both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight settings. The communication rates and outage probabilities of this approach are compared against exhaustive search and pure radar-aided beam training methods (without deep learning-based mapping), and evaluated on multi-user channels simulated by ray tracing. Results show that: (i) the proposed processing chain can reliably isolate the spatial covariances for individual radars, and (ii) the radar-to-communications translation strategy based on deep learning provides a significant improvement over pure radar-aided methods in both LOS and NLOS channels.},

The high demand on the fronthaul links and series cross-link interference (CLI) are the two main problems in cell-free massive MIMO with NAFD. Therefore, in our scheme, we propose a joint strategy of EH, fronthaul compression, and CLI cancelation to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the system under constraints of guaranteed quality-of-service (QoS), EH and compressed fronthaul requirements. A two-stage strategy of EH and transceiver design is proposed to solve the complicated optimization problem. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose an EH/information receiving (IR) antenna selection algorithm to design the operation mode of the antennas for uplink users and receiving APs. In the second stage, with the antennas selected in the first stage, we further attempt to solve the EE maximization problem. Furthermore, to solve the highly nonconvex EE maximization problem, we propose a fractional programming (FP)-based two-tier iterative algorithm in which a series of nonconvex–convex approximation methods, such as FP, iterative convex approximation and equivalent formulation, are used. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms yield a higher EE gain than the traditional time-division duplexing (TDD) and co-frequency co-time full duplexing (CCFD) schemes.},

Nevertheless, the covert communication process between Alice and Bob is vulnerable to various detections by illegal. In this paper, we propose the UAV-assisted covert communication game (UCCG) model that focuses on the covert communication countermeasure process assisted by the UAV. Specifically, we introduce the UAVs into covert communication to interfere with Willie&#39;s detection via disguising the interference signals of the UAV as ambient noise, analyze the interaction between Alice and Willie, and derive optimal strategies for both sides. We further prove the existence of Nash equilibriums (NE) in the UCCG model.

Moreover, the frequency-and-time resources are considered as indices to carry additional information bits. To simultaneously boost the bit error rate (BER) performance and reduce the system complexity, this paper proposes a new CTIM-DCSK signal based on the frequency-and-time resources, in which the time slots used by the selected subcarriers convey the same index bits. We employ a noise-reduction method at the receiver to further improve the BER performance of the proposed CTIM-DCSK system. We also derive the theoretical BER expressions of the CTIM-DCSK system over two different channels, i.e., additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and multipath Rayleigh fading channel. We analyze the data rate, complexity and spectral efficiency of the CTIM-DCSK system in comparison with the state-of-the-art counterparts. Analytical and simulation results verify the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and the advantage of the proposed CTIM-DCSK system.

The wireless nodes are assumed to be equipped with Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output antennas, hybrid precoder, combiner, and low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). We first derive the expression for the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the received and combined signal at the intended receiver under interference. By appropriate design of the hybrid precoder, combiner, and RIS phase settings, it can be shown that the MSE achieves the CRLB. We further show that minimizing the MSE w.r.t. the phase settings of the RIS is equivalent to maximizing the throughput and energy efficiency of the system. We then propose a novel Information-Directed Branch-and-Prune (IDBP) algorithm to derive the phase settings of the RIS. We, for the first time in the literature, use an information-theoretic measure to decide on the pruning rules in a tree-search algorithm to arrive at the RIS phase-setting solution, which is vastly different compared to the traditional branch-and-bound algorithm that uses bounds of the cost function to define the pruning rules. In addition, we provide the theoretical guarantees of the near-optimality of the RIS phase-setting solution thus obtained using the Asymptotic Equipartition property.

  abstract     = {Physical-layer network coding (PNC) has been proposed to double the throughput of a wireless two-way relay network (TWRN) and has been adapted so that it can be applied in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Deep neural network (DNN)-based physical-layer network coding (PNC) for the TWRN system has been studied in recent years, under the assumption that the channel state information (CSI) is available to the end nodes and the relay node. However, the state-of-the-art DNN-based PNC system was only feasible for theoretical simulations, and no practical system design has been studied. When moving from theory to practical wireless systems, there are two critical issues to tackle: 1) unlike conventional regularly shaped quadrature amplitude modulations (QAMs), the constellation points of a DNN-based PNC system&#39;s end nodes are irregular and unpredictable to the relay node; and 2) other than in high-precision simulations, the practical DNN-based PNC system&#39;s constellation points are not fixed, that is, there is usually a cluster of points that must be grouped together so that the transceiver&#39;s digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and analog-to-digital converter (ADC) can work properly. To solve the above issues, we proposed the DNN-PNC implementation that can be realized using the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) platform. The computational complexity of our simulated DNN-PNC is one order of magnitude smaller than that given in the literature, while maintaining a good bit error rate (BER). In the implementation phase, we find that the naturally-happened power imbalance between the two end nodes&#39; signals in our implementation can significantly boost the PNC constellation recovery, and hence reduce the system BER. Our experimental results showed that the BER of DNN-PNC can be lower than &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$10^{-4}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 16 dB for the 2-QAM case and 20 dB for the 4-QAM case, respectively. These results indicate that DNN-based PNC is feasible for VANET applications, where the CSI changes and is difficult to obtain.},

  abstract     = {Outdated channel quality indicator (CQI) feedback causes severe performance degradation of traditional link adaptation (LA) techniques in long term evolution (LTE) and new radio (NR) systems. This paper puts forth a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based link adaptation (LA) technique, referred to as deep reinforcement learning link adaptation (DRLLA), to select efficient modulation and coding scheme (MCS) in the presence of the outdated CQI feedback. The goal of DRLLA is to maximize the link throughput while achieving a low block error rate (BLER). We first give explicit definitions of state, action, and reward in DRL paradigms, thereby realizing DRLLA. Then, to trade off the throughput against the BLER, we further develop a new experience replay mechanism called classified experience replay (CER) as the underpinning technique in DRLLA. In CER, experiences are separated into two buckets, one for successful experiences and the other for failed experiences, and then a fixed proportion from each is sampled to replay. The essence of CER is to obtain different trade-offs via adjusting the proportion among different training experiences.

  abstract     = {Blockage in millimeter wave (mmWave) channels can severely degrade the efficiency of air-to-ground (A2G) communications between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and base stations (BSs). Although relay-aided transmission has proved to be effective in mitigating the negative impact of blockage on mmWave communications, how to efficiently select the optimal relaying UAV for A2G communications remains an open problem. To enable optimal relay selection, the UAV under blockage should probe neighboring UAVs for the quality of their A2G links, which incurs non-negligible beam training overheads. Moreover, most existing studies ignore the impacts of UAV orientations as well as the finite sizes of beam codebooks on the performance of relay selection. In view of these challenges, we study the design of relay probing strategies for UAV mmWave A2G communications to maximize the expected achievable throughput between the UAV under blockage and the BS. Different from existing work, we jointly consider beam training overhead, the limited number of neighboring UAVs, the finite sizes of UAV codebooks, and the orientation of neighboring UAVs in our schematic design. Besides, we derive the closed-form expression for the distribution of achievable throughput when a specific neighboring UAV is adopted as the relay, in order to facilitate the development of the optimal relay probing strategy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of our analysis and the superiority of the obtained relay probing strategy.},

A novel solution to the nonplanar multi-AUV formation reconfiguration control issue is presented by using the graph rigidity and affine transformation (GR-AT) method. Firstly, all AUVs cooperatively achieve a predefined initial cube formation by using the strategy of regulating the inter-AUV distances in a rigid graph. Then the proposed GR-AT method is used to reconstruct the formation shape in multi-obstacle underwater environments. A rigorous Lyapunov stability analysis shows that these distances converge to desired values. The efficiency of the formation reconfiguration control algorithm is confirmed by a series of simulation results. Finally, the corresponding 3-D realistic experiment based on bionic robot fish is carried out to validate the feasibility of the proposed formation control.},

Compared to the previous balance circuits, for the schedule of the proposed equalizer, only one winding and one diode are used for each battery. Meanwhile, one capacitor and two diodes are used for each supercapacitor, simplifying the balance circuit. This method has the advantages of low cost, suitable for cells with different voltage levels, multiplexed converter switches, and extremely simple structure. It does not have any active switch for the voltage balancing function. A prototype for four supercapacitor cells and four batteries is set up.

The dual-phase-shift control is employed with a semi-active rectifier (SAR) to reduce the current stress in the resonant network. To realize accurate ZVS operation, both the SCC control angle and the SAR phase-shift angle are used as the control variables. First, the conditions of ZVS operation and circulating reactive power minimization are derived based on the time-domain model. Then, the power losses in the resonant network, inverter and semi-active rectifier are analyzed and optimized under the constant voltage output. An optimal control strategy is further proposed to maintain the constant voltage output while maximizing overall system efficiency. It is worth mentioning that the proposed control strategy allows the decoupling of the ZVS control and the power regulation. Finally, the performance of the proposed control strategy is examined based on a 6.6-kW WPT prototype. The results show that all switches realize ZVS operation within the entire power range with a peak system efficiency of 95.1%, which exhibits a good agreement with the theoretical analysis.},

However, there is a huge gap between simulation and the real application of DRL-based methods due to its uncertainty and low converge speed. This paper proposes a supplementary learning controller (SLC) based on DRL to compensate for an existing rule-based EMS. The proposed SLC searches for an optimal solution for the action which works alongside the rule-based EMS. Due to the existing rule-based EMS, the SLC can get an optimal solution while reducing the uncertainty of algorithm to the system. In order to improve the converge speed, a distributed architecture is designed for the DRL-based HEV SLC at scale. The actor of SLC in each vehicle interacts with its own driving cycle by searching actions according to a shared neural network, and sends the experience to the cloud. The learner in the cloud replays samples of experience and updates the neural network. The performance of the proposed SLC for HEV EMS at scale was demonstrated in different conditions. The proposed HEV SLC is a good step for the DRL-based HEV EMS method transferring from simulation to real application.},

On the basis of the zero-crossing points extracted from the predicted acceleration, the inertial-triggered mechanism is established to reasonably configurate host vehicle&#39;s “accelerating-inertial driving-decelerating” logic. Then, within the framework of model predictive control algorithm, multiple objectives are optimized by properly releasing the kinetic energy stored in vehicle inertia. Verification results show that when the proposed control strategy is employed, fuel economy can achieve relatively evident growth while braking time is decreased by 16.4% to efficiently improve vehicle safety.},

The formulated problem is then transformed into a hybrid dynamical system, where the dynamics in driving and charging modes are modeled with different functions and with different state and control vectors. Moreover, to improve computational efficiency, we propose modeling the driving dynamics in a spatial domain, where decisions are made along the traveled distance. Charging dynamics are modeled in a temporal domain, where decisions are made along a normalized charging time. The actual charging time is modeled as a scalar variable that is optimized simultaneously with the optimal state and control trajectories, for both charging and driving modes. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed over a road with a hilly terrain, where two charging possibilities are considered along the driving route and the battery is soaked to the ambient before departure.

By taking advantage of accessible online computational resources from connected vehicles (CVs) and CV remote data center, CV-DMR can adapt the microscopic fuel consumption model to an unseen driving condition with limited training data. However, the computational complexity of obtaining the normalized feature map in CV-DMR during training is high. It can take long time to adapt the model to a new driving condition, especially when the new driving condition is considerably different from the pre-learnt driving conditions. To reduce the computational complexity of learning/training, we propose to apply deep neural networks as the model representation method and newly design efficient deep learning based CV-supported distributed meta-learning (CV-DML) algorithms for adaptive fuel consumption modeling. To further generalize the model and reduce model adaptation time, the concept of meta-suggestion is newly proposed in CV-DML. Substantial proof-of-concept experiments are conducted with steady-state and transient vehicle engine data to evaluate the model performance in terms of model prediction accuracy, model adaptation speed, and fuel saving. Compared to the physical model and non-CV-supported model adaptation, the prediction accuracy of CV-DML is improved by 34%–87% and 17%–30%, respectively. Due to the improved accuracy, up to 9.4% of fuel is saved. To achieve the same the prediction accuracy and fuel saving, the model adaptation of CV-DML is 18 to 1,300 times faster than that of CV-DMR.},

However, the interconnection of intelligent equipment and vehicles also brings many vulnerable interfaces, threatening the security of in-vehicle networks, e.g., controller area network (CAN) bus. For protecting the security of CAN bus, some researchers propose a data encryption and decryption protocol-based method. Note that due to the resource constraints of computing and bandwidth and the requirements for low-delay data transmission, the research on protocol-based data encryption and decryption method is progressing slowly. For this reason, more researchers study vehicle intrusion detection systems (IDSs) based on side channel analysis. It does not occupy the bandwidth of CAN bus, and detects intrusion by analyzing the physical characteristics of CAN bus. Nevertheless, most of the existing work either cannot locate the source electronic control unit (ECU) of the malicious data frames, or cannot detect malicious data frames from ECUs and external nodes simultaneously, which greatly limits their practical application value. Therefore, we propose a novel IDS based on vehicle voltage signals. Specifically, we map multiple identifiers (IDs) sent for each ECU without developer documentation. In addition, we creatively design FeatureBagging-CNN combined model to detect malicious intrusion. When the external nodes or compromised ECUs send malicious data frames, the system can accurately detect them and locate their sender.},

This study presents nonlinear model predictive control formulations for traction control and anti-jerk control in electric powertrains with central motor and open differential, and benefitting from the preview of the tire-road friction level.

  abstract     = {The overhead contact line is a tensioned cable structure erected along the railroad to power the electric train. Under the wind load, the galloping of OCL caused by aerodynamic instability may form a large amplitude, which is a big potential threat to the normal operation of the electric railway. In this paper, a wind tunnel test is performed to investigate the aerodynamic coefficients of the contact line with two levels of wear. The aerodynamic instability of the contact line can be observed on a worn contact wire at around an 8° wind angle of attack. Employing a nonlinear finite element model of the OCL, the galloping is reproduced and analysed via several numerical simulations. The effect of the wear level and angle of attack on the galloping response is analysed. The galloping amplitude of the contact line spikes at the angle of attack of 8° and 9° at 20% and 30% wear levels, respectively. Then damping dropper is included in the model, and its effect on the suppression of the OCL galloping is quantified. The results indicate that a damping dropper of 100 Ns/m is recommended to be mounted on the railway OCL to reduce the detriment of galloping under a strong wind field.},

  abstract     = {Regenerative braking is an important part of automotive energy-saving technology. Under different driving conditions and driving styles, the rules of the driver stepping on the accelerator pedal are different, which makes the regenerative braking intensity vary greatly. Different intensity of energy recovery is carried out under different driving conditions and driving styles, which is conducive to improving the efficiency of energy recovery. Therefore, we propose a regenerative braking control strategy (RBCS) based on an accelerator pedal for intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) considering the coupling effect of driving conditions and driving styles. Firstly, a modified method of driving style characteristic parameters considering the influence of driving conditions is proposed. Secondly, α′β and γ are defined as accelerator pedal travel, driving condition and driving style correction coefficient respectively. The regenerative braking control strategy based on an accelerator pedal is established, which corrects the regenerative braking intensity according to correction coefficients. Thirdly, the driving data are obtained through the driver-in-the-loop experiment. On this basis, the characteristic parameters of driving style are modified, and the values of α′β and γ are determined. Finally, the vehicle simulation model and hardware-in-the-loop experiment platform are established to verify the RBCS. The results show that the economy of the vehicle is further improved.},

In previous works that address the fault diagnosis of bogie of high-speed train (HST), only a single railway is adopted for modeling, which holds insufficient data characteristics and thus leads to poor model generalization ability. In this paper, an improved federated learning algorithm is proposed, which reduces the computation costs by wavelet packet decomposition and trains the local diagnosis models by SecureBoost in modeling. By aggregating model parameters of multiple railways in each iteration, the proposed method aims to establish a global model of bogie fault diagnosis on the premise of protecting the security and privacy of bogie data. Experimental results show that the proposed fault diagnosis method is able to identify the faults of bogie for railways that participate in the modeling procedure with an accuracy of more than 88%, and that for those which do not participate in, the fault diagnosis model is also with a remarkable generalization ability. This provides an effective idea for fault diagnosis of HST bogie with less high-quality labeled data, especially under the current “data island” situation of railway industry.},

Hence, the spatial confliction of conventional memory motors can be solved. Upon implantation of the proposed design, the winding utilization, torque/power density and fault tolerant capability are significantly improved. Based on the field modulation theory, the air-gap flux densities under different magnetization states are derived quantitatively to provide design guideline in initial stage. The integrated memory motor drive is presented systematically to consolidate the field and armature windings. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design, two other conventional memory motors are included for comparisons. It is revealed the presented memory motor with integrated winding concept exhibits 28% higher winding utilization, 43% higher torque/power density and 218% higher flux regulation capability than its counterpart with conventional separate windings. In addition, fault tolerant capability can be significantly improved by eliminating mutual coupling between two winding sets.

First of all, the “coarse-noise filter-fine” self-localization framework is proposed to establish the foundation of accurate and efficient localization. Then, the morphology-based trusted area selection is adopted to efficaciously extract the trusted area, in which the probability of appearing dynamic objects is low. After that, based on dynamic angular resolution filtering considering the trusted area, a robust point cloud generation is designed to generate trusted area information. Trusted area information contains dense reliable point cloud in the statice area and spares observation noise in the dynamic area, thus improving the performance of observation models and scan matching. Finally, the self-developed AGV is adopted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed self-localization system in real and simulated dynamic scenes.},

Specifically, we first propose a hybrid circular arc and line segments approximation approach to extract road-map information, which alleviates approximation errors in the procedure of road-map approximation. Then, we deduce the RA-GMLMB filter by integrating the extracted road-map information into the LMB filter with Gaussian mixture implementation.

This paper focuses on the efficient scheduling in mixed systems and proposes a two-stage decision framework that makes full use of the cooperation. First, a long-horizon self-organization policy is developed to optimize the passing order of cooperative vehicles in a distributed manner, which is proved convergent when inbound roads are sufficiently long. Then a short-horizon trajectory planning policy is proposed to improve the efficiency when an ego-vehicle faces both cooperative and non-cooperative vehicles, and its safety and efficiency are theoretically validated. Moreover, simulation results verify that the proposed policies can effectively reduce the scheduling cost and improve the throughput for cooperative vehicles.},

Following that, the reliability of NE scheme is analyzed through the NE-similarity measurement between the priori feature and the detected feature. In addition, the probability model of NEGL is proposed, which is a novel idea based on the priori feature map and simplified through the hierarchical clustering and distance-triggered multiple hypothesis tracking (DT-MHT). Finally, the correct global pose of the vehicle under ambiguous environments is gradually recovered. Comparative experiments using the publicly available datasets and our self-recorded datasets are conducted, and evaluation results show the superior performance of NEGL on success ratio, efficiency, running time and localization accuracy over the adaptive Monte Carlo localization (AMCL), NE+AMCL and Cartographer. Additionally, the experimental results of different FOVs demonstrate NEGL is independent on the range and the direction of the FOV.},

  abstract     = {Empowered by 5G communication technology, high-speed information exchange can be realized on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) for intelligent transportation applications. Since most applications require vehicles to report perceived information to nearby base stations, how to defend against malicious attacks and selfish behaviors of vehicles in reporting activities has become an essential security issue. Some researchers have attempted to encourage vehicles to actively report information by establishing reputations for them, but these efforts have some shortcomings. In model design, they neither verify the basis and process of reputation evaluation nor pay attention to the diversity and intelligence of vehicle behaviors. In system construction, they fail to meet the management needs of multi-party participation and provide verifiable reputation management services. In this paper, we propose &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathcal{R}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -tracing, a consortium blockchain-based vehicle reputation management scheme. The main contribution of our work lies in three points. First, a vehicle reputation model is designed with a reward and punishment mechanism and a regular tax mechanism. Second, a vehicle reputation management system is constructed by multiple organizations, in which all tasks of reputation update are abstracted into three types of transactions. Finally, the effectiveness of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathcal{R}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -tracing is verified by extensive simulations running on a large-scale traffic scenario and performance evaluation on a prototype system. Compared with the typical linear reputation model, our model not only resists the usual malicious attack and selfish behavior but also effectively deals with the on-off attack and rational selfish behavior. In the throughput test, &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathcal{R}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -tracing achieves 600 tps , outperforming two state-of-the-art schemes.},

  abstract     = {Hands on the steering wheel partial driving automation, in which the system controls the lateral and longitudinal vehicle motion while the driver holds the steering wheel, monitors the roadway, and intervenes when necessary, is an example of shared control driving. To insure mutual safety in shared control driving, the system also needs to guide the driver&#39;s interventions to avoid hazardous actions, such as risky lane changes. This study proposes three steering interventions that activate automatically when the system detects a lane change by monitoring the steering wheel angle inputted by the driver and road section and determining that the two vehicles are on a collision course. A driving simulation experiment with 80 drivers was conducted to compare four conditions: 1) no steering intervention; 2) a haptic steering intervention that increases stiffness against steering toward the lane where a collision may occur; 3) an automatic steering intervention that decouples the driver&#39;s steering input and autonomously steered the vehicle away from the hazard; and 4) multiple steering interventions that generate different degrees of haptic and automatic steering interventions based on the time headway and time-to-collision between vehicles. Analysis of driving performance and safety under conditions with and without steering interventions indicate that all participants, at some points, initiated lane changes that are likely to result in a crash during partial driving automation. However, the three interventions effectively reduced lane-change collisions compared to the baseline. While the automatic steering intervention avoided all collisions, the multiple steering interventions were determined to provide sufficient safety while being more thoroughly accepted by the drivers than the haptic and automatic interventions separately. These findings have implications for developing adaptive collision avoidance systems considering user preference and driving performance.},

  abstract     = {We consider encrypted guidance systems for straight-line path following. With cloud-computing technology, we can outsource computations in guidance systems to third-party providers, increasing scalability and enabling guidance-as-a-service. However, by remotely hosting a conventional guidance system on third-party infrastructure, we leak information such as the path of the vehicle. Potential customers may consider these leaks a serious breach of confidentiality, which limits the practical use of such systems. Therefore, to make cloud-based guidance systems viable, we would like to design guidance systems that we can host remotely without revealing confidential information to the host. To this end, we show that we can construct guidance systems that operate on encrypted position measurements, encrypted waypoints, and the bearing between each waypoint by using homomorphic encryption, effectively preventing the cloud host from identifying the vehicle&#39;s position. We show that the proposed guidance laws are locally exponentially stable and that the induced computational latency is appropriate for the real-time guidance of autonomous vehicles. Through field experiments, we demonstrate that an encrypted guidance system is practical and allows an unmanned surface vehicle to follow an encrypted path. The originality of this work lies in conceptualizing, designing, and experimentally validating an encrypted guidance system, unlike other studies that considered encrypted control systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a systematic decision-making and lateral control framework to realize cooperative obstacle avoidance (OA) of the guided vehicle platoons safely and integrally in multiple scenarios. In the control framework, a centralized decision-making strategy is developed to determine optimal overtaking maneuver (i.e., OA) in the dynamic driving environment, and a distributed lateral controller with a safe driving corridor planner is designed for lateral reference trajectories tracking. The proposed decision-making strategy formulates the influence mechanism between the controlled platoon and potential surrounding vehicles based on an interactive behavior model. Moreover, a game theory-based algorithm is applied to calculate safe timing of overtaking and select efficient overtaking mode while avoiding the negative impact on the surrounding vehicles. For the distributed lateral control strategy, the control problem is solved by a linear time-varying model predictive control (LTV-MPC) algorithm so as to reduce the computational burden. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of LTV-MPC algorithm in varying scenarios, a tailored iterative control logic is presented. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on the dSPACE hardware-in-loop platform. The results show that the proposed framework works well under various test scenarios involving multiple static and moving obstacles.},

  abstract     = {The hybrid-electric powertrain currently used in Formula 1 race cars draws its energy from the car&#39;s fuel tank and battery. The usable battery size is limited, and refueling during a race is forbidden by the regulations of the Formula 1 race series. From a strategic point of view, lap-by-lap targets for the fuel and battery consumption must be chosen and imposed on the energy management controller of the car. This task is non-trivial due to the influence of the on-board fuel mass on the achievable lap time, as well as the cross-couplings between the electric and the combustion part of the powertrain. A systematic approach is thus required to compute the energy allocation strategy that minimizes the total race time. In this paper, we devise an optimization framework in the form of a non-linear program, yielding the optimal battery and fuel consumption targets for each lap of the race. The approach is based on maps that capture the achievable lap time as a function of car mass and allocated battery and fuel energy. These maps are generated beforehand with a model-based single-lap optimization framework and fitted using artificial neural network techniques. To showcase the approach, we present three case studies: First, we compare the optimal strategy to a heuristic method. The improvement of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\text{2 s}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; over the entire race is substantial, given that the difference only lies in the energy allocation, but not in the overall consumption. It underlines the importance of optimizing the energy allocation. Second, we leverage the framework to compute the optimal fuel load at the beginning of the race. Finally, we apply the developed non-linear program in a shrinking-horizon fashion. Our simulation results show that the resulting model predictive controller correctly reacts to disturbances that frequently occur during a race.},

  abstract     = {The motion cueing algorithm (MCA) is used to reproduce the driving/flying motion sensation of the real land or air vehicles for the users of motion simulator. Highly accurate MCAs are required for the motion simulators to create realistic sensation for the simulator users, otherwise, they might cause motion sickness and user discomfort. Model predictive control (MPC) is a popular technique in development of the high-fidelity MCAs as it is able to consider the motion sensation as well as the workspace constraints of the simulator platform. Tilt coordination in MCA is in charge of creating sustained linear acceleration feeling through tilting the platform cabin and exploiting gravitational acceleration under human motion threshold, to not allow the user to perceive this as a rotational motion. However, the existing MPC-based MCAs have not considered the rate limit to constrain the tilt motion under human threshold which causes violations of the rotational sensation threshold during generating sustained acceleration feeling. Instead, some researchers increase the penalty weights of rotational motions in order to slow down rotational motions. Using this strategy slows down all the simulator rotational motions not only the ones coming from tilt coordination, to generate sustained acceleration feeling, but also from rotational channel (due to real vehicle rotation) which causes motion sensation error and consequently motion sickness. Therefore, as the existing MPC-based MCAs cannot differentiate the rotations of tilt coordination channel (due to sustained acceleration feeling generation), from rotational channel (due to vehicle rotational motions), they are not able to produce accurate rotational motion sensations because of insufficient rotational motions. In this research, a novel decoupled MPC-based MCA is developed to systematically address the issues related to the existing MPC-based MCAs, in terms of inaccurate motion generation, by redesigning the MPC-based MCA using a series of vestibular system-based MPC models and considering tilt rate limit in tilt coordination. The simulation study using MATLAB software is used to verify and validate the proposed MCA compared to the existing MCAs. The proposed decoupled MPC-based MCA is able to generate accurate motion cues compared to those of the existing MCAs.},

The first strategy involves establishing a reliable system based on the initial pose and ground truth. This study proposes the integration of an inertial navigation system and a global navigation satellite system. In the second proposed strategy, the point clouds in each partitioned scan area are processed according to the density ratio. The density ratio plays a crucial role in the analysis of NDT pose estimates, which enables a localization system to appropriately determine the uncertainty of the NDT. Preliminary results indicate that the proposed strategies not only can continually provide stable initial poses but also can be used for the reliable evaluation of NDT algorithms. Moreover, geometric information considerably influences the sensitivity on localization accuracy under the presence of sufficient appearance information regarding the environment in NDT pose estimation.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the optimal data transmission for collaborative driving in autonomous vehicular networks (AVNs). We consider that vehicles communicate with each other based on the definition of Robot Operating System (ROS), which is a pervasively adopted middleware operating system for autonomous vehicles such as Baidu Apollo. ROS defines a publish/subscribe scheme for inter-vehicular communications, in which vehicles subscribe to “topics” published by adjacent vehicles; a “topic” is related to the real-time sensing/computing data that a vehicle intends to share with nearby neighbors, e.g. , radar or camera images captured. By sharing various sensing data using different topics at the real-time, vehicles in the same area therefore can collaboratively drive with cooperative perception and computing. However, multiple data flows for different topics would coexist along overlapping transmission paths during this process. As a result, a fundamental issue raised is how to schedule the contending data flows in the mobile and bandwidth-constrained vehicular networks. In this paper, we model the ROS-based publish/subscribe scheme as an optimization problem which jointly considers the power allocation and conflict avoidance of the communication process in AVNs. By applying the Lyapunov Optimization, we decompose the model to calculate the power and sub-carrier proportion on each node while avoiding link conflicts, and finally obtain the optimal resource allocation strategy. By combining the corresponding link conflict constraints, we are able to encapsulate the optimization model in a stable set to efficiently avoid link conflicts, and thereby reduce the resource waste caused by the link interference and data flow conflicts. Using simulations, we show that our method has good advantages in resource optimization.},

The full use of observable information to continuously infer trajectories is an urgent issue in trajectory prediction tasks. In this paper, a neighboring vehicle trajectory prediction method based on graph neural networks (GNNs) is proposed, the lane line positions and attribute information in high-definition (HD) maps are extracted, and an ice and snow mask mechanism that simulates instances in which lane lines are covered is introduced. Because graph aggregation with a GNN enables information exchange between nodes, a graph query mechanism that integrates local graph information and guides prediction results based on the local states of the nearest observable nodes is proposed. In addition, a multihead attention mechanism projects neighboring states to the graph, describing interactions between vehicles and the state of the traffic flow, and a two-layer graph attention network (GAT) enables information aggregation and describes node correlations. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that our prediction method outperforms state-of-the-art prediction systems, including Traj++, SG-NET, and P2T, when lane lines are occluded. Vehicle trajectories on roads covered by ice and snow can be accurately predicted based on observable information.},

As a result, the centralized routing planner fails to scale out to accommodate the growing requests, causing a severe scalability issue. This paper presents a holistic solution for scalable CAV routing by enabling hierarchical cooperation and load balancing in the Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) environment. The proposed system cooperatively plans CAV routes and dynamically balances loads in MECs to handle massive requests. According to the experiments, our system has a 15.68X higher routing capacity than the centralized routing system, and load balancing reduces 14.51% computation time of routing.

Due to the increase in real-time data generated from the control modules and sensors, controller area networks (CANs) have a heavier burden to satisfy the strict delay bounds. Therefore, CAN with flexible data rate (CAN-FD) and Automotive Ethernet (AE) have drawn attention as promising IVNs. This paper provides an overview of the IVN transmission protocols, time delay characteristics, and analysis methods. Most of the existing IVN timing analysis studies assume the worst case and consider only the occurrence of periodic or aperiodic messages, however for more accurate control, the average time delay needs to be accurately estimated. In this paper, CAN, CAN-FD, and AE analytical models based on queueing analysis are proposed to estimate the average response time for mixed traffic. For CAN and CAN-FD systems, the network synchronization statuses are considered and AE with 1-level preemption to support deterministic delays is analyzed. The improved accuracy of the newly derived analytical models is verified based on comparison with existing CAN queueing models through simulation experiments.},

To enhance the security of computation offloading, we propose a novel physical layer security-assisted scheme, in which the PB can also play the role of a cooperative jammer by transmitting jamming signals to interfere with the eavesdroppers. The objective is to maximize secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) of the MEC system by jointly optimizing the transmit power for WPT, offloading, and jamming, the time allocated for WPT and offloading, and the computation task partition while satisfying the secrecy offloading rate constraint and the energy causality constraint. To deal with the highly non-convex problem, we develop an efficient two-layer algorithm by resorting to variable substitutions, successive convex approximation, and the Dinkelbach method. Simulation results demonstrate that our designed scheme yields a SEE performance enhancement as compared to benchmarks.},

In principle, a price will be determined for utilizing a base station (BS) based on its load, and users will react to the prices of available BSs. In this paper, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based dynamic pricing method is proposed for the fully-decoupled RAN (FD-RAN). The proposed method exploits the separate control channel provided by the control BS, and can reach overall equilibrium for data BSs, with multi-link cooperative transmission inherently supported.

  abstract     = {In vehicular networks, task offloading performance for mobile edge computing (MEC) is highly coupled with the mobility of vehicle terminal (VT), as the VT speed and arrival rate determine the number of VTs and their sojourn time on each road segment. Generally, the communication and computation resources of the MEC server are limited, and thus more VTs leads to less resources for each VT. In this paper, we develop an analytical non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted MEC model to characterize VT mobility and analyze the impact of VT mobility on task offloading performance. In this model, each VT with random speed starts its offloading at any time and hopefully completes the task offloading before leaving the current road segment. The expressions of average latency and task loss probability are derived and validated by simulation results. Furthermore, the impact of VT mobility, especially the average VT speed, on latency performances is analyzed. It is also shown that task loss probability is mainly affected by VT arrival rate, and is approximately independent of average VT speed.},

In this paper, we exploit the asynchronous non-orthogonal transmission for multi-satellite cooperative communication to improve the fairness-aware rate. The asynchronous capacity is extended to the multi-satellite cooperation scenario and then utilized to formulate the optimization problem, which jointly considers the satellite-to-terminal association, power allocation, and decoding order. To dissect those coupled variables, we propose a preference-list-based algorithm that iterates between the following two stages. First, the many-to-many two-sided matching is solved by a Gale-Shapley algorithm based strategy given prespecified preference lists. Then, transmit power and decoding order are jointly optimized by a Dinkelbach-like algorithm. Based on the above results, the preference lists are updated to reflect the inter-satellite interference for iterative refinement. Simulation results show that introducing cooperative transmission improves the fairness rate by 12%, and exploiting time asynchrony provides another 7% gain.},

In particular, considering a differential encoding scheme at the AmBC transmitter and an energy difference based detector at the AmBC receiver, we derive the bit error rate (BER) and the near-optimal detection threshold in closed forms. Since the near-optimal detection threshold requires a priori knowledge of the channel state information, the IQ imbalance parameters, the noise power and the transmit power of the ambient source, which is not readily known by the AmBC receiver, we propose a simple but practical method to estimate the near-optimal detection threshold by exploiting the received signal samples at the AmBC receiver.

  abstract     = {In wireless surveillance, the monitor (E) should be far away from the suspicious system to maintain concealment, leading to very poor eavesdropping performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose in this paper a novel simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-assisted proactive eavesdropping strategy. Specifically, a STAR-RIS is deployed between E and the suspicious system to implement reflection (R) and transmission (T) for the suspicious signal of the suspicious transmitter and the jamming signal of E, to concurrently vary the channel power gains of the suspicious transmission link and the legitimate eavesdropping link and then facilitate E&#39;s eavesdropping. Assuming that E can only access the global statistical channel state information, we aim to maximize E&#39;s average (ergodic) eavesdropping rate, by jointly optimizing the energy splitting ratio of the STAR-RIS and E&#39;s jamming power. With rigorous analysis, we reveal that only two cases should be considered to achieve the optimal eavesdropping rate: i) the STAR-RIS works in T&amp;R mode, and E does not conduct jamming; ii) the STAR-RIS only operates in T mode, and E interferes with the suspicious destination. In both cases, the optimal energy splitting ratio or jamming power is derived in (semi) closed form. Also, the eavesdropping energy (cost) efficiency is analyzed. Since our proposed strategy is adaptive, it can achieve significant eavesdropping performance gain compared to competitive benchmarks, as verified by numerical results.},

To ensure the accuracy of data aggregation, this paper presents a mean-squared error (MSE) minimization problem via jointly optimizing the normalization factor, power splitting ratios of backscatter devices (BDs), and phase shifts of IRS. Inspired by the block coordinate descent technique, we propose an alternating optimization method to solve the formulated non-convex problem. Specifically, we derive the optimal normalization factor and power splitting ratios in closed-form expressions, and exploit the variable substitution technique and semi-definite relaxation method to address the phase shift optimization subproblem. Simulation results demonstrate the significant MSE reduction achieved by the proposed method, in comparison with other benchmark methods.},

However, UAV networks, detached from the ground infrastructure, are usually constrained for traffic-intensive network-wide signal processing. This paper tackles this issue by considering the multi-user signal detection at the UAV swarm, where the uplink signals of multiple ground users are cooperatively recovered. In particular, to reduce the signaling exchange and the coordination latency, a two-stage distributed minimum mean squared error (MMSE) detection is proposed for the UAV swarm, which merges the local MMSE detections at each UAV with one-shot weighted combining at a central station. The combining weights only depend on the long-term statistical channel state informations (CSIs) and therefore, are suitable for distributed network with limited signaling exchange. Numerical results show that the proposed distributed MMSE detection achieves similar performance to the centralized MMSE detection.},

The relation between the MMF rate and blocklength, as well as the impact of cooperative transmission are investigated. Numerical results demonstrate that RSMA can achieve the same MMF rate as Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) and Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) with smaller blocklengths (and therefore lower latency), especially in cooperative transmission deployment.

  abstract     = {For polar-coded MIMO systems, separate detection and decoding (SDD) is the traditional scheme. In SDD systems, sphere decoding (SD) is one of the competitive MIMO detection schemes. However, SD may not utilize the coding information sufficiently in SDD systems, causing an error-correction performance loss. The existed joint detection and decoding using breadth-first SD (BSD) improves the performance than SDD, whereas the limited search space still causes a performance loss. In this paper, we propose joint detection and decoding based on SD (SD JDD) for polar-coded MIMO systems to reach maximum likelihood (ML) bound. Subsequently, two approaches are further proposed to reduce the computational complexity. The first approach reduces the layers of the SD search tree by exploiting symbol synchro sets, which could accelerate the convergence of SD JDD. The second efficient approach performs multiple tree searches. A small initial radius of the sphere for the first search is assigned to reduce the search space. The ML optimality could be preserved by the following multiple tree searches with increasing radius. It is shown from the numerical results that the proposed JDD outperforms SDD by 3.1 dB at FER &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$=10^{-3}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; for &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathcal {P}(64, 32)$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; polar-coded &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$4\times {4}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; MIMO system with 16-QAM modulation.

In this paper, we propose a novel RIS-JAPT scheme, named RIS-JAPT-DR, to meet the requirement of receiving the active and passive information in a distributed manner. In RIS-JAPT-DR, the whole RIS is virtually partitioned into two groups, one for facilitating the active transmission and the other for enabling the passive transmission by mapping the passive information to the antenna index of the passive receiver. Approximate bit error rate (BER) expressions are derived in closed-form for the active and passive receivers that use maximum-likelihood and energy detection, respectively, in the presence of inter-user interference (IUI). Furthermore, we conduct asymptotic analysis, from which the performance gap between the two receivers is minimized by optimizing the RIS partitioning (RP). Simulation results corroborate the BER analysis, the optimal RP, and the robustness of RIS-JAPT-DR against IUI.},

Here, the CRN coexisting with a primary network offers connection-centric services and content-aware services through space division multiple access and RIS-aided multicast technology, respectively. Using imperfect statistical channel state information, the RIS enhanced transmission scheme is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem with outage constraints. To address this intractable problem, we first use the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal distribution and Schur complement approaches to transform the non-convex outage constraints into solvable ones. Then, a robust BF algorithm integrating alternate optimization with semidefinite relaxation methods is proposed to obtain the active BF weight vectors at the cognitive base station and the phase shift matrix at the RIS. Our simulation results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed BF algorithm and the superiority of the RIS enhanced wireless transmission.},

However, the overhead to estimate the CCM is large. In this paper, a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) based TSB scheme is proposed without requirement of CMM. Particularly, the problem of the pre-beamforming matrix design is transformed into a CMAB problem. We consider the pre-beamforming matrix design in each slot as the arm selection in the CMAB, and convert the problem of the arm selection into a 0-1 integer linear programming problem, which can be solved by the branch-and-bound method. During the training process, the maximum likelihood method is used to detect the power of angle spectrum, and the angle range of each user is determined adaptively. We prove that the regret grows logarithmically with time, such that the proposed scheme converges towards the optimal action. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the spectral efficiency.},

Unlike conventional array, the UAVA can obtain extra degrees-of-freedom for beamforming by flexibly controlling the topology of UAVs, which motivates us to consider an off-grid array layout to improve the beamformer. To effectively control the load of UAVs, we incorporate the dynamic range ratio (DRR) of weighting coefficients of UAVA. On these basis, we formulate a new optimization model aiming to minimize the maximum sidelobe level under the constraints of mainlobe ripple, DRR, layout spacing and array aperture. However, the resulting NP-hard problem is quite challenging due to the exponential form of layout vector and the non-convexity of mainlobe ripple and DRR. In this respect, we reformulate this multi-constrained problem into a new iteration form of combining alternating direction penalty method and majorization-minimization via introducing a series of auxiliary variables. In each iteration, the tractable and small-sized subproblems can almost globally be solved. Numerical results confirm that our method is more suitable for deterministic beamforming of UAVA than the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In non-geostationary orbit satellite networks, the resource is limited and the traffic under each satellite is in variation due to the motion of satellites and the non-uniform traffic on the ground. Generally, the uplink communication is guaranteed by successful random access (RA) and sufficient data transmission (DT) resources for various traffic types. Different traffic types usually have different requirements for resources, and joint resource management for mixed traffic tries to meet the needs of various traffic types at the same time and may improve uplink resource efficiency. However, existing strategies have not given integrative consideration to jointly allocate resources for RA and DT under dynamic mixed traffic demands, which leads to inefficient network resource utilization. Considering such a problem, we propose an adaptive random access and data transmission scheme for NGSO satellite networks in the mixed traffic scenario, considering two types of users, i.e., real-time users and best-effort users. Specifically, the utility functions of different types of users are introduced, and a utility-based access control and resource allocation algorithm is developed by solving the network utility maximization problem. Our scheme aims to achieve optimal uplink network utilization by adaptively controlling random access and allocating resources according to the dynamic demands of mixed traffic. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms other methods in terms of network utility, and exhibits near-optimal performance.},

  abstract     = {Providing provable performance guarantees in vehicular network routing problems is crucial to ensure safely and timely delivery of information in an environment characterized by high mobility, dynamic network conditions, and frequent topology changes. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great promise in network routing, existing RL-based solutions typically support decision-making with either peak constraints or average constraints, but not both. For network routing in intelligent transportation, such as advanced vehicle control and safety, both peak constraints (e.g., maximum latency or minimum bandwidth guarantees) and average constraints (e.g., average transmit power or data rate constraints) must be satisfied. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework for RL-based vehicular network routing, which maximizes routing decisions under both average and peak constraints. The routing problem is modeled as a Constrained Markov Decision Process and recast into an optimization based on Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). We prove that the optimal policy of a given CSP can be learned by an extended Q-learning algorithm while satisfying both peak and average latency constraints. To improve the scalability of our framework, we further turn it into a decentralized implementation through a cluster-based learning structure. Applying the proposed RL algorithm to vehicular network routing problems under both peak and average latency constraints, simulation results show that our algorithm achieves much higher rewards than heuristic baselines with over 40% improvement in average transmission rate, while resulting in zero violation in terms of both peak and average constraints.},

  abstract     = {Edge computing is essential to enhance delay-sensitive and computation-intensive machine learning (ML) task inference services. Quality of inference results, which is mainly impacted by the task data and ML models, is an important indicator impacting the system performance. In this paper, we consider a quality-aware edge-assisted ML task inference scenario and propose a resource management scheme to minimize the total task processing delay while guaranteeing the stability of all the task queues and the inference accuracy requirements of all the tasks. In our scheme, the task offloading, task data adjustment, computing resource allocation, and wireless channel allocation are jointly optimized. The Lyapunov optimization technique is adopted to transform the original optimization problem into a deterministic problem for each time slot. Considering the high complexity of the optimization problem, we design an algorithm that decomposes the problem into a task offloading and channel allocation (TOCA) sub-problem, a task data adjustment sub-problem, and a computing resource allocation sub-problem, and then solves them iteratively. A low-complexity heuristic algorithm is also designed to solve the TOCA sub-problem efficiently. Extensive simulations are conducted by varying different crucial parameters. The results demonstrate the superiority of our scheme in comparison with 4 other schemes.},

  abstract     = {Facing the heavy traffic burden and data privacy, distributed machine learning (DML) has been envisioned as a promising computing paradigm to enable edge intelligence by extracting and establishing models collaboratively in wireless networks. Unlike centralized methods, DML involves frequent local model exchanging among distributed devices, which confronts low efficiency referring to the convergence rate and delay. To enable edge intelligence, how to train DML efficiently has recently attracted extensive interest in wireless networks. Rather than over a fixed or centralized topology, we study the convergence and system implementation of DML over a wireless device-to-device (D2D) network in this paper. First, we introduce the DML training process and system model in this network, where the total delay in reaching convergence is minimized. Second, we analyze the convergence rate to figure out the special effects of synchronization frequency and network topology. To improve the efficiency of DML training, we propose a system implementation approach to reduce the convergence rate and delay of one iteration, where the network topology and synchronization frequency are set, followed by an optimal resource allocation policy. At last, we perform experiments with an image classification task. Simulation results indicate that our proposed D2D framework can effectively reduce training delay and promote computation efficiency by 39 &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\%$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; in a heterogeneous environment, which is concordant with the theoretical analysis.},

Recent developments of autonomous vehicles enable a variety of applications that demand high computing resources and low latency, such as automatic driving, auto navigation, etc. However, the highly dynamic topology of vehicular networks and limited caching space at resource-constrained edge servers calls for intelligent design of caching placement and computation offloading. Meanwhile, service caching decisions are highly correlated to the computation offloading decisions, which pose a great challenge to effectively design service caching and computation offloading strategies. In this paper, we investigate a joint optimization problem by integrating service caching and computation offloading in a general VEC scenario with time-varying task requests. To minimize the average task processing delay, we formulate the problem using long-term mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) and propose an algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning to obtain a suboptimal solution with low computation complexity. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme exhibits an effective performance improvement in task processing delay compared with other representative benchmark methods.},

Due to limited resource configuration, it is hard for end users to deal with computing-intensive data analysis tasks by themselves. Therefore, outsourcing these tasks to nearby edge computing servers (i.e., multi-access edge computing) becomes a key step towards the next generation mobile networks. However, new challenges arise for designing cost efficient distributed system by jointly managing communication and computing resources with unpredictable tasks arrival mode in complex spatial and temporal domains. In this paper, based on the idea of network function virtualization (NFV), we distribute a series of operation functions of MapReduce framework on distributed edge computing servers to execute data analysis service and investigate how to dynamically minimize the overall operational cost with joint consideration of workflow scheduling, network function management, resource allocation, and system stabilization. Our method leverages Lyapunov optimization technique to make a tradeoff between the queue backlog and overall cost without using future information. Simulation results show that our method can effectively reduce computing and communication cost while guaranteeing quality of service for end users.},

Smartphone-based robots have the potential to provide high-precision indoor localization, and they are easy to promote and apply. In this paper, we propose a tight integrated positioning system based on Wi-Fi round trip time (RTT), encoders, and the inertial measurement unit (IMU) for robot indoor localization using smartphones. In our approach, we first design an error-state Kalman Filter (ESKF) to fuse the inertial information from the IMU with the measurements from the encoders to suppress the errors accumulated by the inertial navigation system (INS). Second, the Wi-Fi RTT-based localization method is implemented through an adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) to fuse the ranging information. Finally, to overcome the shortcomings of the long-time drift of the INS and the instability of the Wi-Fi RTT-based localization system, we implement a tight integrated positioning system, which obtains the optimal estimation of the INS positioning error by using the Wi-Fi RTT ranging values as filtering constraints and smooths the INS positioning error through the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) algorithm. Experimental results show that compared with the Wi-Fi RTT-based method under line of sight condition (LOS) and non-line of sight condition (NLOS), the mean positioning error of the proposed method is improved by 54.62% and 58.38%, respectively, while compared with the INS/Encoder method, those is improved by 57.48% and 33.04%, respectively.},

Furthermore, an energy efficiency maximization scheme is proposed in the user-dense scenario to improve the resource utilization when network resources may be insufficient to guarantee the QoS requirements of all the users.

Subsequently, the task scheduling problem of DRSN (TSPD) is regarded as a sequential decision-making problem and is optimized using a method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which overcomes the difficulty of designing heuristics with massive efforts. In this study, a mathematical model and corresponding Markov decision model based on our proposed scheduling framework are constructed, and for the first time, a policy network that includes one encoder based on the attention mechanism and two decoders is designed to solve the TSPD.

However, due to the nature of mobility, LSN networking pattern must be pre-configured. Compared with a fixed mode, dynamic networking for LSN will bring more benefits, but simultaneously confront more challenges. The two main issues in dynamic LSN networking are how to increase network transmission capacities (NTC) and how to maintain an excellent NTC performance during service duration. Motivated by these two issues, we firstly build a time-varying connected graph to formulate the changes of LSN features over time. Then a Support-Vector-Machine (SVM) based LSN networking scheme is proposed to improve the NTC performance. Each link type is predicted by SVM model at each time slot to prioritize transmission for the type matching tasks. Next, a network performance graph (NPG) is constructed to show potential NTC performances with different time slot divisions. The dynamic programming is utilized to find the time slot sequence with optimal LSN service continuity. Simulation results show that the proposed SVM-based transmission contact planning with dynamic programming (NSDP) scheme can achieve superior NTC performance and service continuity, compared with existing LSN networking schemes.},

The high-speed mobility of the UAV swarm belongs to a new clan of networks, termed flying ad-hoc networks (FANETs). How to design an effective routing mechanism in such a dynamic network is challenging. Traditional flooding searching algorithms (e.g., OLSR, AODV) lead to huge communication overheads, while greedy searching algorithms (e.g., Geolocation-Based Routing protocol) pose low routing efficiency. In this paper, we propose an adaptive communication-based UAV swarm routing algorithm. In our algorithm, we design the Multilayer Perceptron algorithm to learn when routing flooding is required among different UAVs, and design the Gate Recurrent Unit algorithm to greatly compress the volume of communication data. Besides, we further adopt the multi-agent actor-critic algorithm to learn how to integrate shared information for cooperative routing decision-making.

The robots form a multi-robot system (MRS), where one robot&#39;s decision or action relies on the others&#39;. This paper addresses the sequential decision problem of user association and resource allocation in a mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled, wirelessly-connected MRS to maximize the time-averaged completion rate of interdependent computing tasks. The problem is challenging due to the partial observability of the network environment, and the delicate delay requirements of interdependent computing tasks. A new decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) problem is reformulated, where edge servers act as intelligent agents and can make decentralized decisions about user association and resource management with their local information of the network state. By leveraging the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) theory, a new cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) model is developed to enable interdependent computing. Simulations show the merits of our approach in terms of task completion rate compared to existing techniques.},

  abstract     = {Since the traffic conditions change over time, machine learning models that predict traffic flows must be updated continuously and efficiently in smart public transportation. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning scheme that allows buses to receive model updates without waiting for model training on the cloud. However, FL is vulnerable to poisoning or DDoS attacks since buses travel in public. Some work introduces blockchain to improve reliability, but the additional latency from the consensus process reduces the efficiency of FL. Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) is a scheme that reduces the latency of aggregation to improve efficiency, but the learning performance is unstable due to unreasonably weighted local models. To address the above challenges, this paper offers a blockchain-based asynchronous federated learning scheme with a dynamic scaling factor (DBAFL). Specifically, the novel committee-based consensus algorithm for blockchain improves reliability at the lowest possible cost of time. Meanwhile, the devised dynamic scaling factor allows AFL to assign reasonable weights to stale local models. Extensive experiments conducted on heterogeneous devices validate outperformed learning performance, efficiency, and reliability of DBAFL.},

  abstract     = {Futuristic applications of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) highly rely on ad-hoc connectivity between the stochastic vehicular networks (ground and airborne). Message routing in ITS faces several challenges in the dynamic environment of highly mobile networks in the form of obstacles, propagation, and stability of the connection. Unlike vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs), flying ad-hoc networks (FANETs) have a flexible and robust configuration with line-of-sight links, and can provide message relaying services to VANETs. However, constant FANET usage depletes residual energy, leading to a shorter network lifetime. In this study, we propose UniFaVa, a routing scheme that considers a combined and unified paradigm of FANETs and VANETs, where a routing decision prefers a higher transmission rate of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with ample residual energy as a relay. The proposed scheme guarantees the reliability of a complete transmission by analytically predicting the connectivity time. Moreover, an analytical approach is formulated for the proposed multi-objective optimal routing using hypervolume. Our extensive simulation results using real traffic traces of Seoul and New York City from OpenStreetMap and simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) indicate significant achievements over the three existing contemporary routing methods. The proposed UniFaVa multi-objective optimal routing achieves a packet delivery ratio of 90% and a connectivity time of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$3\sim 6$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; sec for established multi-hop routes, and short hop distances for a reliable propagation with only one extra hop on average.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) with multi-modal transmission can achieve high efficient data collection for underwater sensor networks. However, multi-modal transmission and trajectory planning impose great challenges on data collection in complex underwater environments. Most prior studies focus on design of multi-modal architecture, but lack of available implementation and consideration of AUVs&#39; trajectory. Meanwhile, existing trajectory planning research cannot work well on data collection with multiple complex tasks simultaneously. In this paper, an efficient Data Collection scheme for Multi-modal underwater sensor networks based on Deep reinforcement learning (DCMD) is proposed to solve the above challenges. We first propose an optimal multi-modal transmission selection algorithm that provides an implementation to improve transmission efficiency. Then we propose a distributed multi-AUVs&#39; trajectory planning algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning by AUVs&#39; collaborations, considering transmission situation, ocean currents and underwater obstacles, to maximize collection rate and energy efficiency. In addition, we joint transmission and trajectory planning in a protocol to improve collection efficiency. Extensive experimental results show that DCMD achieves better performance on efficiency and reliability than four state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its great advantage on collecting data for USNs.},

  abstract     = {In knowledge-freshness-sensitive wireless networking scenarios, a major identified gap lies in overlooking the notable impact of physical link interference and the validity duration (i.e. deadline) of newly acquired knowledge on the network-wide achieved Age of Information (AoI). This paper aims at closing this gap not only through accounting for deadline and interference constraints but also through proposing efficient mechanisms leveraging inter-nodal cooperativeness to work around them and, indeed, migrate the achieved network-wide average AoI to its next lower level. First, a Deadline-constrained Interference-aware Cooperative data transmission Scheduling (DICS) framework is presented. This framework encloses a mathematical formulation of the cooperative data transmission scheduling optimization problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) that accounts for deadline and interference constraints and has the two-fold objective of: i ) investigating the impact of integrating auxiliary Secondary Nodes (SNs) in the network to assist Primary Nodes (PNs) in improving their overall achieved AoI, and ii ) evaluating the effect of altering various network-wide parameter values on the network&#39;s AoI performance. Owing to the ILP&#39;s remarkable complexity, a GReedy Algorithm (GRA) is proposed, which generates acceptable sub-optimal schedules (error of 5.222%) but is found to be non-scalable. To address GRA&#39;s scalability issue, a Reinforcement Learning Actor-Critic Algorithm (RL-ACA) is developed, which, is found to outperform GRA by 2.849% in terms of accuracy. Thorough simulations and numerical analyses are conducted to gauge the merit of the proposed DICS&#39;s RL-ACA and highlight its AoI performance improvement as compared to existing benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {In smart ocean, the Marine Internet of Things (M-IoT) is ubiquitously used for data acquisition, communication connections, task computation, and so on. However, high-efficient energy consumption and secure yet low-latency transmission is subject to IoT devices&#39; computation capacity and transmit power limitation, as well as wireless communication&#39;s broadcast characteristics. In this paper, we investigate the secure computation offloading in M-IoT with the assistance of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) subject to the eavesdropping attack. In particular, we consider a scenario in which USVs are firstly scheduled to set up a high-quality communication link to the high altitude platform (HAP) and then exploited to provide cooperative jamming for the communication security at the physical layer when the HAP is performing computation offloading. We jointly optimize the USVs&#39; positions, the duration of data uploading, the workload offloaded by HAP, the HAP&#39;s transmission power, and each USV&#39;s jamming signal power to minimize the system-wise energy consumption for completing the total workloads under the latency constraint. Despite the non-convexity, we decompose the problem vertically into a top problem that optimizes the USVs&#39; positions and a bottom problem that optimizes the other variables. The Polyblock outer Approximation and bisection Search based algorithm (PAS-Algorithm) is proposed to alternatively optimize the variables in the bottom problem. And the Code bAsed croSs Entropy algorithm (CASE-Algorithm) is proposed to obtain the suboptimal solution to the formulated joint optimization problem. Numerical results validate the accuracy and effectiveness of our algorithms as well as the performance of optimizing the total energy consumption compared with the benchmark algorithms.},

Existing solutions that offload computation tasks to the ground may suffer from long communication delays. To address this issue, the Networked Airborne Computing (NAC) is a promising technique, which offers advanced onboard airborne computing capabilities by sharing resources among the UAVs via direct flight-to-flight links. However, NAC does not exist yet and enabling it requires overcoming many technical challenges, such as the high UAV mobility, and the uncertain, heterogeneous, and dynamic airspace. This paper addresses these challenges by 1) developing a Dynamic Batch-Processing based Coded Computation (D-BPCC) framework for achieving robust and adaptable cooperative airborne computing, and 2) designing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based load allocation and UAV mobility control strategies for optimizing the system performance. As the first study to systematically investigate NAC, to the best of our knowledge, we evaluate the proposed methods through designing a NAC simulator and conducting comparative studies with four state-of-the-art distributed computing schemes.

These networks demand high aggregate throughput, increased energy efficiency, and high Random Access (RA) capability, i.e., the system&#39;s ability to allow new STAs to join the network quickly. WiFi-6 (also known as IEEE 802.11 ax) is the new generation WLAN standard proposed to meet these diverse system requirements. In this paper, we analyze the effect of Multi-User Multi-Input Multi-Output (MU-MIMO) &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\&amp;amp;$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; MU-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (MU-OFDMA)-based Hybrid Access (HA) mechanism of WiFi-6 systems.

We have studied the effect of the non-saturated traffic model driven by the Poisson and Pareto arrival processes. Further, we have modeled the buffer status-based dynamic scheduling of RUs for the MU-OFDMA-based HA mechanism. We have also analyzed the novel Multi-Traffic Identifier-based frame aggregation feature. Further, we have analyzed the hand-off mechanism for a multi-BSS (Basic Service Set) scenario using the Stochastic geometry-based mathematical tool.

  abstract     = {Emerging connected vehicular services, such as intelligent driving and high-definition (HD) map, are gaining increasing interest with the fast development of multi-access edge computing (MEC). For most time-sensitive and computation-intensive vehicular services, the data offloading process significantly influences the capacity and performance of MEC, especially when the number of connected vehicles is enormous. In this work, we consider data offloading optimization for a large-scale automotive MEC network. The problem is challenging due to the large number of connected vehicles and the complicated interaction between vehicles and edge servers. To tackle the scalability problem, we reformulate the original offloading optimization problem into a Mean-Field-Game (MFG) problem by abstracting the interaction among the connected vehicles as a distribution over their state spaces of task sizes, known as the mean-field term. To solve the problem efficiently, we propose a G-prox Primal-Dual-Hybrid-Gradient (PDHG) algorithm that transforms the MFG problem into a saddle-point problem. Based on our developed MFG model and G-prox PDHG algorithm, we propose the first data offloading scheme whose computation time is independent of the number of connected vehicles in automotive MEC systems. Extensive evaluation results corroborate the superior performance of our proposed scheme compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In many scenarios, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aka drones, need to have the capability of autonomous flight to carry out their missions successfully. In order to fly autonomously, drones need to know their location constantly. Then, based on their current position and the final destination, navigation commands will be generated and drones will be guided to their destination. Localization can be easily carried out in outdoor environments using GPS signals and drone inertial measurement units (IMUs). However, such an approach is not feasible in indoor environments or GPS-denied areas. In this paper, we propose a localization scheme for drones called PILOT (High-Precision Indoor Localization for Autonomous Drones), which is specifically designed for indoor environments. PILOT relies on ultrasonic acoustic signals to estimate the target drone&#39;s location. To obtain a precise final estimation of the drone&#39;s location, PILOT deploys a three-stage localization scheme. The first two stages provide robustness against the multi-path fading effect of indoor environments and mitigate the ranging error. Then, in the third stage, PILOT deploys a simple yet effective technique to reduce the localization error induced by the relative geometry between transmitters and receivers, which significantly reduces the height estimation error. The performance of PILOT was assessed in different scenarios, and the results indicate that it achieves centimeter-level accuracy for three-dimensional drone localization.},

  abstract     = {Road condition monitoring supports vehicles in acquiring real-time traffic information in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). However, malicious attackers may impersonate other vehicles to propagate forged traffic/road information. Therefore, authentication schemes based on the blockchain were proposed to check the legitimacy of vehicles. At first glance, these proposals can effectively accomplish the authentication process using smart contracts. However, these schemes have poor scalability. Specifically, with the certificate update and the number of revoked certificates growing, the blockchain state database storage continues to increase, which consumes additional computation and storage resources and affects the execution efficiency of smart contracts. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues by proposing a consortium blockchain-based source authentication scheme for road condition monitoring (ACRoM). In ACRoM, the traffic report is uploaded to the regional trusted authority (RTA) together with one transaction constructed based on the unspent transaction output (UTXO) model. The transaction is utilized to accomplish the source authentication process, which is achieved by verifying the legality of each input contained in the transaction. Moreover, based on the UTXO model, we propose a transaction update mechanism to keep the database storage curve at dynamic stability rather than unlimited growth, which guarantees the scalability of ACRoM. The simulations show that the retrieval time remains at about 0.28 ms while the storage cost is stable at about 29.46 M for the blockchain state database. Besides, benefiting from the efficient batch-verification mechanism, the computation cost of source authentication is about 0.362 ms on average, which outperforms the existing state-of-art schemes.},

  abstract     = {Wireless federated learning (FL) is envisioned as a promising paradigm of distributed learning in wireless networks without disclosing users&#39; data privacy. However, radio channel leads to a potential risk of eavesdropping attack when sending the trained model data in wireless networks. To address this eavesdropping attack, in this work, we propose an energy-efficient wireless FL by using artificial jamming. Specifically, the group of wireless devices (WDs) adopt the time division multiple access (TDMA) approach to send their locally trained models to the FL server for model aggregation subject to the eavesdropping attack of a malicious node. When one of the WDs sends its local model, all the other WDs send the artificial jamming signals to interfere with the eavesdropper, which helps increase the secrecy throughput of the targeted WD for uploading its local model. Different from many existing studies using stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we adopt the stochastic average gradient (SAG) method in the local training to improve the convergence of FL and derive the corresponding lower bound of the FL convergence rate via SAG. Furthermore, we formulate an optimization problem that aims at minimizing the energy consumption of the WDs by jointly optimizing different WDs&#39; local training time, their uploading transmission time in TDMA and the transmit-powers for providing artificial jamming, as well as the FL configurations of the local/global iterations. We also propose an efficient algorithm for solving this non-convex optimization problem. Numerical results are illustrated to validate the advantages of our design of wireless FL and the corresponding algorithms. In particular, the results demonstrate that our secrecy oriented energy-efficient FL can significantly outperform the other heuristic FL schemes.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is promising for future 6G wireless communications. However, the increased number of RIS elements results in the high overhead for channel acquisition and the non-negligible power consumption. Therefore, how to improve the system capacity with limited RIS elements is essential. Unlike the classical regular RIS whose elements are arranged on a regular grid, in this paper, we propose an irregular RIS structure to improve the system capacity. The key idea is to irregularly configure a given number of RIS elements on an enlarged surface, which provides extra spatial degrees of freedom compared with the regular RIS. In this way, the received signal power can be enhanced, and thus the system capacity can be improved. Then, we formulate a joint topology and precoding optimization problem to maximize the capacity for irregular RIS-aided communication systems. Accordingly, a joint optimization algorithm with low complexity is proposed to alternately optimize the RIS topology and the precoding design. Particularly, a tabu search-based method is used to design the irregular RIS topology, and a neighbor extraction-based cross-entropy method is introduced to optimize the precoding design. Simulation results demonstrate that, subject to the constraint of limited RIS elements, the proposed irregular RIS can significantly enhance the system capacity.},

Initially, the user equipment (UE) connects to an intermediate AP cluster, where a matched-decision among the APs and UEs establishes the best connection in terms of large-scale fading and prevents UEs from being dropped. Then, UEs can expand their AP clusters by connecting to more APs. We compare our method with baseline solutions considering different precoding techniques in centralized and distributed network implementations. We propose three strategies to fine-tune the AP clusters, reducing the number of UEs per AP without compromising the spectral efficiency (SE) or improving energy efficiency. The simulations comprise a range of UEs and APs, the number of antennas per AP varies, and each AP can serve a limited number of UEs. The results show that our solution improves up to 163% the SE of the 95% likely UEs compared with baseline solutions and that the number of UEs each AP serves is crucial for improving SE. Additional results indicate that our solution allows APs to save processing to enhance SE and evidence that the number of APs affects the SE differently in each network implementation.},

Weak turbulent channel is modeled using log-normal distribution while moderate and strong turbulence channels are modeled using gamma-gamma distribution. Rytov variance of Gaussian beam is derived analytically for oceanic turbulence optical power spectrum. Subsequently, scintillation index is calculated using the computed Rytov variance. Moreover, the closed-form expression of bit-error-rate (BER) for underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) systems using intensity-modulated/direct detection (IM/DD) implementation and on-off-keying (OOK) modulation scheme is obtained. Results show that the performance of wireless optical communication link between two platforms in underwater medium is degraded significantly due to turbulence, absorption and scattering. In fact, as the turbulence level increases, its effect becomes quantitatively comparable to those of absorption and scattering effects. The variation of both scintillation index and BER performance are presented for various underwater medium and communication system parameters, such as chlorophyll concentration, average temperature, average salinity concentration, temperature and dissipation rates, wavelength, link length and receiver aperture size.

The absence of knowledge of the characteristics of the target RF signals, the ground-to-air channels, and the potential geographical distribution of the RF emitter makes efficient trajectory planning (TP) and geolocating intractable. Since the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the signal captured by the UAV changes across the search area, state-of-the-art TP is inapplicable due to the assumption of a single problem domain, according to the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem. In contrast, we develop a cognitive multi-stage search and geolocation (CMSG) framework, which adjusts the adopted TP algorithms in various search stages. In the stage with extremely-low SNRs, a random-walk-based TP is proposed to avoid meaningless detours. For stages with higher SNRs, the TP follows policies optimized by a novel search method based on direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and reinforcement learning. To alleviate the impairment of unreliable DOA estimations, empirical emitter position estimations are exploited to find the best flight directions. Simulation results confirm the advantages of the proposed CMSG over various baselines in lowering both failure rate and time consumption.},

How to improve transmission efficiency and to reduce latency time in such a dynamic scenario is a challenging problem. In this paper, we formulate the joint optimization problem of relay selection and transmission scheduling, aiming to reduce transmission time while meeting the throughput requirements. To solve this problem, two schemes are proposed. The first one is the random relay selection with concurrent scheduling (RCS), a low-complexity algorithm implemented in two steps. The second one is the joint relay selection with dynamic scheduling (JRDS), which fully avoids relay contentions and exploits potential concurrent ability, to obtain further performance enhancement over RCS. Through extensive simulations under different environments with various flow numbers and vehicle speeds, we demonstrate that both RCS and JRDS schemes outperform the existing schemes significantly in terms of transmission time and network throughput.

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) emerged as a promising technology for programming the wireless propagation environment, ushering wireless networks into a new era of high connectivity, and better spectrum and energy efficiency. Research has gained momentum over the past few years to study the gains of RIS and the optimal configuration of its elements. This paper is concerned with the optimal configuration of RIS elements; we consider a single base station (BS) serving multiple single-antenna users and formulate the problem of minimizing the total transmit power while jointly optimizing the allocated power to users and the RIS phase shifts. In line with the existing literature, the problem is decomposed into power control and RIS phase shift sub-problems. The power control sub-problem is the conventional power problem which is solved optimally through closed-form expression. Then, we tackle the problem of RIS passive beamforming optimization and propose two solutions leveraging a linear transformation and element-wise Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT), respectively. The main idea of the linear transformation approach is to reduce the number of optimization variables to the number of users associated with the RIS from the number of its elements which is, in general, very large. On the other hand, the main idea of the element-wise KKT-based approach is to obtain a closed-form expression for the RIS phase shifts for a multi-user scenario, similar to the single-user case. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes have performance in total transmitted power close to the numerical solution and have much lower computational complexity than the baseline solutions. Moreover, simulation results show that the proposed solutions have a competitive performance in terms of optimality and complexity for large-scale RIS. Hence, our approach represents a general framework for configuring RIS elements in real scenarios.},

However, they generally cannot be simultaneously achieved. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental tradeoff between the age of information (AoI) and energy consumption (EC) for a generalized &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\ell$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; th best relay selection policy in two-hop cooperative status update systems with automatic repeat request (ARQ), where the source delivers the sensed status update to the destination through multiple decode-and-forward relays.

When a decoding failure occurs, we can either retransmit the old packet to save sensing EC or sense and transmit a new one to reduce AoI. Accordingly, the classical ARQ and truncated ARQ protocols are employed in the second hop. By considering short packet-based transmissions, the average AoI and average EC expressions are derived, and the weighted combination of them is minimized to attain the tradeoff.

  abstract     = {In the paper, a wideband GNSS antenna with wide-angle circular polarization and anti-multipath performance is proposed. By using the coupled feeding formed by arc-T-shaped patch, wide bandwidth is obtained. Eight short-circuit pins are loaded around the radiation patch for widening the 3-dB axial ratio (AR) beamwidth at the GNSS frequencies and reducing size. Furthermore, two groups of bent metal-branches are loaded on the slotted ground for front-back ratio (FBR) enhancement at the GNSS frequencies. To provide uniform circular polarized (CP) excitation with small occupied area, a compact wideband quadrature feed network with amplitude imbalances within 1 dB and phase imbalances within 5° is designed which covers the GNSS band. For validation, a prototype is fabricated. Measurement results show that an overlapped bandwidth of more than 45% is obtained for 10-dB return loss and 3-dB AR. At the frequencies of 1.207 GHz, 1.227 GHz, 1.247 GHz, 1.561 GHz, 1.575 GHz and 1.602 GHz, the measured 3-dB AR beamwidths and FBRs are all larger than 200° and 20 dB, respectively, which demonstrates the potential of high precision positioning at GPS L1/L2, BDS B1/B2, GLONASS L1/L2, and Galileo L1/E5b bands.},

Along with NOMA, hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) technique is used to enhance the reliability of communication system. Recently, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) are a futuristic transmission technology that can achieve high spectral and energy efficiency at low cost. In this paper, an IRS aided downlink NOMA-HARQ based Internet of Things (IoT) framework is proposed to enhance the IoT devices&#39; performance in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) region. Further, to enhance the performance of NLoS IoT device/users, two NOMA-HARQ aided IRS schemes are proposed namely: NOMA-selection combining (SC) with IRS and NOMA-maximum ratio combining (MRC) with IRS. This paper formulates and examines the IoT user/device performance in terms of the achievable data rates, outage probability, bit error rate (BER) and diversity order in IRS aided downlink NOMA-HARQ environment with variable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). With the help of the simulation results, it is demonstrated that in dynamic wireless channels, the proposed schemes outperform the conventional NOMA with HARQ (NOMA-HARQ) in terms of achievable data rates, outage probability, BER and diversity order.},

  abstract     = {With the emerging demands of new communication services, the contradiction between capacity demand and spectrum shortage of railway communication systems becomes more severe. How to provide broadband communication services has become the key goal of future smart high-speed railway (HSR) systems. Millimeter wave (mm-wave) frequency band has abundant spectrum resources and can provide communication services with large bandwidth. However, due to the high-speed of the train as well as the complexity and dynamics of environments, the communication link may be blocked randomly for a short time and will also lead to frequent handovers. In this paper, we adopt the promising intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) technology for a mm-wave HSR communication system. In order to improve system capacity, IRS is deployed to improve reflection transmission links, and optimization algorithms are designed for transceiver beamforming and IRS phase shift. In addition, given the specificity of the HSR scenario, we also formulate the average system ergodic capacity maximization problem and obtain upper bound on the average system ergodic capacity with statistical channel state information (CSI). Through extensive simulations, we verify that the proposed scheme performs significantly better than the other two baseline schemes in terms of average system throughput and average system ergodic capacity.},

However, the benefit of the SCMA-based SWIPT system has not been fully exploited yet, especially when the communications link is hostile. Fortunately, the propagation-induced impairment can be mitigated by the emerging technique of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS).

To secure the RIS-aided multiuser communications, we adopt friendly jamming techniques with the help of a RIS, and propose the random jammer selection and RIS aided user scheduling (RJSR-US), optimal jammer selection and RIS aided user scheduling (OJSR-US), as well as multiple jammers and RIS aided user scheduling (MJR-US) schemes. The non-jamming RIS-aided user scheduling (NJR-US) scheme is considered as a baseline. We conduct security-reliability trade-off (SRT) performance analysis of RJSR-US, OJSR-US, and MJR-US as well as NJR-US schemes in terms of deriving their closed-form outage probability (OP) and intercept probability (IP) expressions over spatially-correlated channels. Secrecy gain analysis further demonstrates that the RJSR-US, OJSR-US, and MJR-US schemes outperform the NJR-US scheme in terms of SRT. Additionally, we present a definition for the normalized intercept and outage probabilities (IOPs), based on which an optimization analysis of proposed jamming schemes is carried out for minimizing the IOP through an iterative search of power allocation between the scheduled user and jammers. Finally, simulations unveil the SRT benefit of the RJSR-US, OJSR-US, and MJR-US schemes compared with the conventional NJR-US scheme. Furthermore, the SRT performance can be improved by adjusting jamming power allocation for the RJSR-US, OJSR-US, and MJR-US schemes, especially in the high SNR region.},

This paper firstly examines and compares the error performance of uncoded OFDM-IM and OFDM under barrage jamming (BJ) and partial band jamming (PBJ) attacks. In addition, we propose a novel arbitrary jamming (AJ) model and extend our analysis to this attack. We demonstrate that uncoded OFDM-IM is more resistant against jamming attacks when compared to uncoded OFDM. In the OFDM-IM system, we derive an upper bound for the average bit error probability under AJ attack to verify our simulation results. The achievable rate of OFDM-IM under jamming attack is also investigated. We then apply low-density parity-check (LDPC) coding to further enhance the strength of the system under a heavy jamming attack. The optimum log-likelihood ratios for the OFDM-IM system in the case of jamming attack are calculated. We compare and analyze the bit error rate (BER) performances of LDPC coded OFDM and OFDM-IM for different jamming types, code rates, code block lengths, and code decoding algorithms through extensive computer simulations. At high code rates under jamming attack, we prove that the coded OFDM-IM has BER performance superiority. Moreover, we demonstrate that coded OFDM-IM is more resistant against imperfect channel state information than coded OFDM under BJ. We also compare the performances of LDPC coded OFDM-IM and the higher-order OFDM-IM (HO-OFDM-IM), an enhanced version of OFDM-IM.},

Meanwhile, in order to further enhance the bit error rate (BER) performance when using forward error correction (FEC) coding, the soft decision should be employed in CE-OFDM systems. However, due to the nonlinear noise in the phase of CE-OFDM, inaccurate log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) cause degradation of the decoding performance. To alleviate this problem, the systematic cause analysis of the phase noise is conducted followed by an efficient phase-noise oriented (PNO) algorithm for the phase demodulator in the CE-OFDM system. We further propose another stationary region Max-log-MAP (SR-MLM) algorithm with the phase unwrapper towards low implementation costs.

To this end, we derive new closed-form analytical expressions for the outage probability (OP) in WET under non-linear energy harvesting (EH) at the user for different channel fading scenarios. We also generalize our outage analysis to a scenario where all links via the direct path and via the cascaded paths along the two IRSs undergo Rician fading. This analysis involves developing a novel statistical model based on Gamma distribution for the sum of product of Rician fading envelopes corresponding to cascaded path. As benchmarks, we derive new closed-form mathematical expressions for the OP in WET for single IRS-assisted configuration and massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) configuration under non-linear EH at the user. We also study the impact of four communication links between source and user on OP. To this end, we develop two algorithms based on manifold optimization and alternating optimization to design the phase shift matrices at two IRSs, and then obtain OP. Furthermore, we determine the optimal number of IRS elements that minimizes the total power consumption for a given received power, thereby maximizing the power transfer efficiency (PTE) under double IRS-assisted configuration. As a baseline, we also derive the corresponding new closed-form expressions with single IRS-assisted WET and massive MIMO enabled WET. Through our extensive analysis and simulations, we elucidate that double IRSs aided WET 1) provides significant savings of power radiated by the source, and 2) requires fewer IRS elements in comparison to single IRS aided WET or antenna elements in massive MIMO enabled WET while keeping received power and OP fixed at a specific level. Furthermore, double IRSs aided WET provides 10x and 1000x improvement in PTE compared to single IRS and massive MIMO configurations, respectively.},

According to the characteristics of the high dimension of industrial scene data, the characteristics of the original physical layer channel information data are extracted. Using the characteristics of amplitude, phase, carrier frequency offset (i.e. phase change), and variance, the high-dimensional complex channel information matrix is transformed into a seven-dimensional feature set, which not only reduces the dimension but also retains the original complex information. Finally, the effectiveness of feature extraction was verified by using public data set collected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in a real industrial scene.

  abstract     = {Multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) systems are known to provide spatial multiplexing capabilities. For this reason, they are very important in 5G and will certainly have a key role in beyond 5G (B5G) systems. However, the precoding operation employed by many MIMO transmitters to compensate for the channel effects and/or separate users increases the envelope fluctuations of the transmitted signals, giving rise to a trade-off between linearity and energy efficiency. Commonly, nonlinear distortion is considered additional noise that severely affects performance. However, since the nonlinear distortion is a function of the transmitted signals, studies have demonstrated the potential of taking it as useful information for detection purposes. In this work, we followed this vision and consider the maximum likelihood (ML) detection to exploit the information of the nonlinear distortion term. We consider MIMO singular value decomposition (MIMO-SVD) systems impaired by bandpass nonlinearities and we derive the potential ML performance in independent and identically distributed (iid) Rayleigh fading channels through a theoretical study of the distribution of the normalized squared Euclidean distance (SED) between nonlinearly distorted quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signals. It is demonstrated that by using the nonlinear distortion as useful information, the ML detection of nonlinear MIMO-SVD not only can avoid the degradation associated with the conventional detection of nonlinear MIMO-SVD, but can even present performance gains over linear MIMO-SVD.},

Our aim is to achieve the maximum worst-case downlink secrecy rate via optimizing power allocation, RIS passive beamforming and UAV trajectory. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex and non-smoothness, which is quite hard to solve directly. Therefore, we divide the original optimization problem into three subproblems, power allocation optimization, passive beamforming optimization and UAV trajectory optimization, which can be solved by applying successive convex approximation (SCA), &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathcal {S}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -Procedure and semidefinite relaxtion (SDR).

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a revolutionary technology for sixth-generation (6G) networks owing to its ability to manipulate wireless environments. As a frequency-selective device, RIS can only effectively shape the propagation of signals within a certain frequency band. Due to this frequency-selective property, the deployment of RIS in cellular networks will introduce a complicated base station (BS)-RIS-user association issue since adjacent BSs operate at different frequency bands. In this paper, with the consideration of the frequency-selective characteristics of RIS, we aim to jointly optimize BS-RIS-user association, active beamforming at BSs, and passive beamforming of RIS to maximize the sum-rate of a RIS-assisted cellular network. We first leverage &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$l_{0}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -norm to efficiently integrate BS-RIS-user association with active and passive beamforming. Then, we adopt fractional programming (FP) and block coordinate descent (BCD) methods to deal with logarithmic and fractional parts and decouple the joint association and beamforming design problem into several sub-problems. Efficient algorithms which combine &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$l_{0}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -norm approximation, majorization-minimization (MM), and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) are developed to alternately solve the sub-problems.

  abstract     = {Hybrid precoding based on an adaptive-connected structure is one of the promising technologies for millimeter-wave communications, which achieves a good tradeoff between spectral efficiency and power consumption by deploying a switch-controlled connection between the antennas and radio frequency chains. To maximally enhance the energy efficiency while maintaining superior spectral efficiency of hybrid precoding, a novel deep learning-based optimization algorithm is presented for an adaptive fully-connected (AFC) structure in this paper. Firstly, two special convolutional neural network (CNN) frameworks are designed to optimize the phase shift precoding matrix and switch precoding matrix with hardware constraints, namely CNN-Fps and CNN-Fs respectively. Furthermore, a CNN-based joint optimization network is developed, named as CNN-JO network, which can simultaneously optimize the CNN-Fps and CNN-Fs subnetworks, such that the optimal analog precoding matrix is obtained. Then, using the fully digital optimal precoder as the training label, the proposed CNN-JO network can be trained to maximize the energy efficiency of the AFC structure. Finally, the well-trained CNN-JO model can accept the estimated channel matrix as the input and directly output the phase shift precoding matrix, switch precoding matrix, and digital precoding matrix. Simulation results and complexity analysis show that the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance than the previous works in terms of energy efficiency and spectral efficiency with a lower complexity.},

Furthermore, a novel hybrid successive interference cancellation (SIC) scheme is proposed so that the non-energy constrained IoT device can adaptively adjust the transmit power according to its channel fading gain. For the non-linear EH model, closed-form expressions of outage performance are derived, with the observation of the error outage floor at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region, and the asymptotic behavior of the error floor is derived by using the extreme value theory through increasing the number of IoT devices. For the linear EH model, the proposed hybrid SIC scheme can guarantee the uplink WPT-NOMA networks achieve full diversity gain for any target data rate of IoT devices. Simulation and analytical results verify that the proposed hybrid SIC scheme can overcome the existing works of the hybrid SIC scheme, where the error outage floor appears if the data rate of IoT devices is higher than a threshold value.},

It makes use of recent results for decomposing the patterns of any arbitrary ESPAR onto an orthogonal basis set using the Theory of Characteristic Modes (TCM). Leveraging this decomposition, OFDM symbols can be mapped into the beamspace domain so that the ESPAR can be used to transmit multiple streams of OFDM symbols using a single RF chain. In the proposed approach, we use the Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) algorithm to quantize the OFDM symbol vectors and form a codebook. A binary search tree is then utilized to efficiently find the reactive loads of ESPAR to excite the radiation patterns corresponding to the quantized symbols. It is shown by simulation that quantized codewords and the corresponding radiation patterns can be excited using ESPAR. In addition, the simulated bit error rate (BER) results of the proposed approach are shown to be close to that of conventional MIMO-OFDM systems, demonstrating the effectiveness of implementing a single-RF MIMO-OFDM transmitter.},

  abstract     = {The antenna phase calibration is critical for the millimeter wave (mmWave) hybrid beamforming communication system. Especially, with the increasing number of antennas being deployed in future massive MIMO systems, it is unrealistic to calibrate each antenna path in a microwave anechoic chamber. This work proposes a phase calibration based on over-the-air (OTA) scheme for mmWave hybrid beamforming systems, where the calibration process is performed automatically by the online signal transmission. The challenge for the OTA-based phase calibration is the imperfect channel estimation due to the phase error. To solve the challenge, we simplify the channel estimation process by integrating the beam alignment and phase calibration process. Consequently, the phase calibration is formatted to an MMSE-criterion based optimization problem solved by the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) with probabilistic conversion improved Gibbs sampling method. Furthermore, an alternating iteration algorithm is developed to calibrate phase deviation for both the transmitter and receiver. We also extend our method to solve the joint amplitude and phase calibration problem. According to the simulation result, the calibration results outperform existing methods when the signal-to-noise ratio is less than 15 dB. Besides, the proposed method exhibits a high beamforming gain during the calibration process, which paves the way for future massive device deployment in a practical system.},

Each layer of UDNet is designed according to the classical minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizer. Moreover, we consider the QPSK equalization as a four-classification task and adopt minimum Kullback-Leibler (KL) to achieve a smaller symbol error rate (SER) with the one-hot coding instead of the MMSE criterion. In addition, we introduce a sliding structure based on the banded approximation of the channel matrix to reduce the network size and aid UDNet to perform well for different-length signals without changing the network structure. Furthermore, we apply the measured at-sea doubly-selective UWA channel and offshore background noise to evaluate the proposed equalizer. Experimental results show that the proposed UDNet performs better with low computational complexity. Concretely, the SER of UDNet is nearly an order of magnitude lower than that of MMSE.},

A power allocation optimization problem is considered, where two conflicting metrics, namely the sum rate and fairness, are jointly optimized. As there is no closed-form expression for the achievable rate in terms of the large scale-fading (LSF) components, the sum rate fairness trade-off optimization problem cannot be solved by using known convex optimization methods. To alleviate this problem, we propose two new approaches. For the first approach, a use-and-then-forget scheme is utilized to derive a closed-form expression for the achievable rate. Then, the fairness optimization problem is iteratively solved through the proposed sequential convex approximation (SCA) scheme. For the second approach, we exploit LSF coefficients as inputs of a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3), which efficiently solves the non-convex sum rate fairness trade-off optimization problem. Next, the complexity and convergence properties of the proposed schemes are analyzed. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approaches over conventional power control algorithms in terms of the sum rate and minimum user rate for both the ZF and MRC receivers. Moreover, the proposed TD3-based power control achieves better performance than the proposed SCA-based approach as well as the fractional power scheme.},

Next, an optimal successive hybrid beamformer technique is proposed for unicast and multicast scenarios which relies on the optimal minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR). We demonstrate that it mitigates both the interuser and intergroup interference, while successively ensuring orthogonality to the previously scheduled users/user groups. Furthermore, it is shown theoretically that the proposed schemes are capable of supporting a large number of users. Subsequently, a Bayesian learning (BL) based method is conceived for jointly designing the RF and baseband precoders/combiners for the various scenarios considered. Furthermore, we also conceive the uplink counterpart of our HTBF scheme, which is based on maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus noise ratio (SINR) of each individual user. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed schemes is characterized by our extensive simulation results in terms of cancelling the interuser/intergroup interference, which improves the spectral efficiency.},

In order to theoretically analyze the SEE performance of CF-mMIMO systems, we first provide a lower bound on the ergodic secrecy rate. Meanwhile, a realistic model is used to measure the power consumption of CF-mMIMO networks, which takes into account the radio transmit power of all APs, circuit power consumption, and the power consumed by the backhaul link transmissions. Then, we develop a confidential and energy-efficient design for transmit power allocation subject to individual quality-of-service requirements for the users and total transmit power constraint of all APs. For the reason that the proposed SEE maximization (SEEM) problem is non-convex, we give a two-tier iterative power allocation algorithm, capitalizing on Dinkelbach&#39;s method and successive convex approximation approach. Simulation results show that the proposed SEEM algorithm converges fast and outperforms the conventional secrecy rate maximization and energy efficiency maximization strategies in terms of SEE performance.},

  abstract     = {The non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are recognized as a key component to provide cost-effective and high-capacity ubiquitous connectivity in the future wireless communications. In this paper, we investigate the secure transmission in a terahertz (THz)-empowered reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted NTN (T-RANTN), which is composed of a low-Earth orbit satellite transmitter, an RIS-installed high-altitude platform (HAP) and two unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) receivers, only one of which is trustworthy. An approximate ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) expression is derived when the atmosphere turbulence and pointing error due to the characteristics of THz as well as the phase errors resulting from finite precision of RIS and imperfect channel estimation are taken into account simultaneously. Furthermore, according to the statistical and perfect channel state information of the untrustworthy receiver, we optimize the phase shifts of RIS to maximize the lower bound of secrecy rate (SR) and instantaneous SR, respectively, by using semidefinite relaxation method. Simulation results show that both the approximate expression for the ESR and the optimization algorithms are serviceable, and even when the jitter standard variance of the trustworthy receiver is greater than that of the untrustworthy one, a positive SR can still be guaranteed.},

  abstract     = {Network densification is essential to enhance the areal capacity of future wireless networks, for which the user-centric network is a promising solution. In the perspective of network scalability, user association and cooperative beamforming (BF) among the base stations (BSs) should be designed elaborately to manage strong interference from nearby BSs. However, practical systems with hardware impairments including nonlinearity of power amplifiers may disturb these techniques and make the network difficult to be scalable. The nonlinearity of power amplifiers affects not only radio frequency (RF)-level signal but also performance according to the number of user equipments (UEs), resulting in necessity of re-designing network-level operations including BS-UE association. This paper proposes a deep learning-based cooperative BF framework for distributed networks with nonlinear power amplifiers. To optimize the cooperative BF for complicated nonlinear systems, we adopt unsupervised learning approach with constraints. To reduce the communication overhead of the network, we propose a novel neural network structure, from which the BSs can perform the cooperative BF in distributed manner. In particular, the information exchange between the central unit and the local BSs is reduced by designing neural network so that the local channel state information are utilized only in the local BSs while the central unit utilizes only covariance matrices. We show that the proposed scheme achieves a higher effective sum rate compared to the baseline schemes by adjusting the user association, BF, and power allocation to control interference and nonlinear distortion with reduced communication overhead.},

  abstract     = {In underwater acoustic communications, a hydrophone array is often used to receive the underwater acoustic signals to improve the gain of the received signal. The direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is a basic task in underwater acoustic array signal processing. In underwater signal transmission, due to the channel complexity, a large signal transmission loss, and heavy noise interference, the received signal is seriously distorted, and the DOA estimation is poor. In order to improve the accuracy of DOA estimation for underwater acoustic array signals, in this work, we propose continuous wavelet transform with convolutional neural network (CWT-CNN) method. We use a linear factor to improve the calculation process of continuous wavelet transform. The characteristics of time-frequency fusion of signals are calculated by constructing time-frequency array model with modified wavelet factors. The fused features are then used to train the proposed double branch CNN. As compared with other DOA algorithms based on neural networks, the proposed algorithm shows a 5%–20% higher accuracy and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$0.479^{\circ }\!-\!1.172^{\circ }$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; lower RMSE at 7 different values of SNR.

  abstract     = {Powertrain electrification is an effective solution to reducing emission of mobile machines. In this paper, an electric-hydraulic hybrid drive for wheel loader propulsion system is studied, where it combines high energy density of electric drive and high power density of hydraulic drive. The braking energy is captured hydraulically and stored in an accumulator. This reduces the peak power of electric drive due to large vehicle acceleration and deceleration, making the peak electric power reduction possible. The energy management strategy is essential for hybrid powertrain since it determines how efficiently the power is transferred between different sources. The existing control strategies such as thermostat strategy and power follower strategy are largely dependent on the cycles and it is challenging to achieve satisfactory results when the cycle changes. The wheel loader loading cycle is a characterized cycle consisting of multiple predictable operating modes, giving some opportunities to develop a mode-driven strategy. In this paper a mode-driven control strategy for electric-hydraulic hybrid wheel loader is proposed to achieve peak electric power reduction over power follower strategy (baseline strategy), without sacrificing electric energy use and vehicle operation hours. In the strategy four modes are defined and the expected hydraulic SOC (system pressure) profile in each mode is scheduled so that it can provide power assist and capture regenerative braking energy as much as possible. By setting the pressure profile, the hydraulic charge sustaining is guaranteed. The system operation with mode-driven strategy is compared with power follower strategy through simulation studies. Results show that peak powers of battery and electric motor with mode-driven strategy are reduced by nearly 30% compared to power follower strategy. Results also show that the vehicle operation hour has been slightly increased by 3% by using mode-driven strategy. These results verify the effectiveness of proposed strategy for electric-hydraulic hybrid wheel loader.},

The PMSDMs are designed based on the parameters and dynamic indicators of the vehicle. Thereafter, the PMSDMs are optimized from aspects of the rotor skewing angle and pole arc coefficient and verified by finite element analysis (FEA). Then the characteristic coefficient of PDGT is optimized through non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) combined with dynamic programming (DP). The economic performance improves by 5.0% and dynamic performance improves by 4.4% with the characteristic coefficient optimized from 3 to 1.65. Meanwhile, the economic performance of the novel dual-motor IWM shows significant improvement compared to the traditional single-motor IWM in simulation. Furthermore, a prototype is developed and tested. Both the simulation and experimental results reveal the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed novel IWM driving system.},

Then, to guarantee the transient and steady-state performance of steering tracking error within the quantitative boundary, a prescribed performance function is constructed by user-designed tracking accuracy and settling time. Finally, the controller is designed based on the backstepping scheme and the neural network with a composite learning scheme is proposed for the approximation of lumped uncertainty. The Lyapunov stability theory shows that the signals involved in the system are semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded and the tracking error converges to a preset range at finite time.

  abstract     = {According to recent works, a coordinated delivery strategy in which terrestrial and aerial electric vehicles work together effectively improves delivery throughput and energy efficiency. However, most research on logistics and transportation focuses on delivery performance and does not care about energy efficiency, with three main limitations: 1. Most of these works ignore geographic information along the delivery route, while road slope is one of the most critical energy consumption components. 2. Vehicle and drone power consumption models are simplified as driving mileage, while the delivery time is a significant concern. 3. The battery model is simplified as a linear model even though practical batteries have non-linearity properties. This work proposes a framework to provide energy- and time-efficient delivery schedules with a hybrid delivery service with terrestrial and aerial electric vehicles. We first implement accurate electric van and drone power models and a battery model based on manufacturers&#39; system specifications and experimental data. Then, we propose a heuristic delivery scheduling algorithm to determine the electric van and drone delivery schedule. We also introduce various cost functions to evaluate the delivery scheduling results regarding time, energy, the weighted sum of time and energy, and the economic model. The proposed framework is validated on randomly implemented delivery missions and delivery scenarios in existing cities. Results indicate that the coordinated delivery saves delivery costs up to 27.25% in terms of the economic model compared with the electric van-only delivery schedule.},

Next, a greedy integration based MFD algorithm is proposed, which separates the overall multi-frame joint maximization into two processes of confidence building and extended energy suppression. The proposed algorithm can eliminate the energy expansion intrinsically and achieve better detection performance with a lower implementation complexity. In addition, we extend the proposed algorithm to radar systems by deriving the accurate nonlinear conversion relationships between target states of Cartesian coordinates and echo measurements of polar coordinates. In radar scenarios, the proposed algorithm is capable to make detection adaptively after multi-frame integration through the use of traditional constant false alarm rate (CFAR) procedures.

To approximate unknown nonlinear functions of pneumatic actuator dynamic, neural networks are employed as a function approximator. The sensor fault is investigated while all system states of the controlled suspension are assumed to be unmeasurable. Then, a neural state observer is constructed to estimate unmeasured states and compensate for the partial loss of effectiveness of sensor failure simultaneously. An adaptive fault tolerant control is proposed via the command filter backstepping technique to alleviate the effects of sensor failure and solve the explosion of complexity problem. In addition, to improve the tracking accuracy and get the ride comfort, this study is concerned with a prescribed performance function so that the vertical displacement of sprung mass does not violate the predefined boundary. The Lyapunov theorem is then applied to demonstrate that all system signals are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded while error variables can converge to the small neighborhood of zero.

This article proposes a predictive energy management strategy (EMS) for connected PHEV based on real-time dynamic traffic prediction. First, the future traffic information is predicted by establishing a wavelet neural network (WNN). Thus, the global driving condition can be predicted. Then, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of WNN to plan a global battery state-of-charge (SOC) reference. Second, a long short-term memory-based velocity predictor is proposed for the predictive EMS, by planning SOC over a prediction horizon based on the global SOC reference. Finally, the performance of the proposed EMS with WNN and PSO-WNN is verified by the actual traffic data. The results show that it can improve the fuel economy by 17.57% and 28.19%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Online state-of-charge estimations are critical to lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles for safe and reliable operations. To ensure accurate online state estimations, an online battery parameter identification algorithm, such as the least square fitting approach, along with a shifting moving window, was developed and implemented, while the decision of the moving window size for general purpose is a technical issue not yet been well-addressed. This paper proposes an adaptive moving window size design methodology that adjusts the moving window size considering three important factors: load profile, state-of-charge to open-circuit voltage profile, and condition of data. The simulation results show that the proposed methodology helps to identify the parameters of the battery electric circuit model with high accuracy, where the results are compatible to the results using fine-tuned fixed window sizes. Also, the proposed methodology is general to driving profiles from moderate to severe without extra algorithm redesign. In the three standard driving profile cases, the parameter identification error is reduced by 59.15%, 69.02%, and 75.14%, respectively, compared to the worst case in experiments, which are compatible with the results after fine-tuning the fixed window sizes. With accurately identified parameters, the modeling error is minimized, and three typical linear SOC estimation algorithms thus render accurate SOC estimation, rendering an average of 13.4%, 64.43% 57.48% reduction from the worst case in experiments, respectively.},

  abstract     = {AC pulse heating is a promising preheating method for lithium-ion batteries due to its low energy cost and high efficiency. To avoid the lithium plating in the AC heating, upper bound of heating current (UBHC) should be obtained. In this paper, the dual RC model is developed, and coupled with the thermal model to predict the battery temperature and potential of negative electrode (PNE). PNE = 0 V is used as the lithium plating criteria. If the PNE falls to 0 V during the heating process, the lithium plating is triggered, and the corresponding pulse amplitude is the UBHC. Moreover, because the UBHC increases with the battery temperature, the pulse amplitude should be automatically raised to increase the heating efficiency. When the battery temperature is too low, the UBHC is so small that the AC pulse heating is inapplicable. Through the self-adaptive AC pulse based on the UBHC, the heat strategy is built, and the heating time is calculated. The total heating time reached by the proposed strategy increases with the increment of the initial SOC, and it falls with the decrease of the initial battery temperature. Moreover, the heating time has a temperature limit. If the battery temperature is lower than the limit, the battery cannot be heated to the target temperature in the required time. The proposed strategy is applied to heating the battery at the different SOCs, and its performance is compared to the constant amplitude pulse. In the same heating time, the battery temperature achieved by the proposed strategy is at least 7.6 °C higher than the constant amplitude pulse. Moreover, the UBHC is enlarged by 10% to prove the original UBHC can reduce the degradation. The cyclic heating experiment shows that the 110% UBHC reaches a capacity loss of 0.49 Ah after 60 heating cycles and that of the original UBHC is only 0.1 Ah.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we aim to exploit an effective way to solve the output multi-formation tracking problem of the networked autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) in a fast fixed time manner. Specifically, addressing the output multi-formation tracking problem implies that 1) the networked ASVs are divided into multiple interconnected subnetworks with respect to multiple targets; 2) for each subnetwork, the outputs of the networked ASVs form a desired geometric formation with exchanging the local interactions. Besides, solving the fast fixed-time tracking problem in this paper implies that 1) the convergence time is independent of the initial conditions; 2) the system states are forced to reach the employed nonsingular fixed-time sliding surface in a prescribed time, which thus called fast fixed-time control. Then, based on a time-related function and a nonsingular fixed-time sliding surface, a hierarchical fast fixed-time control algorithm is proposed to solve the aforementioned problem within a fast fixed time being independent of the initial conditions. Furthermore, by employing the Lyapunov argument and mathematical induction, we present the sufficient conditions for fast fixed-time convergence of the tracking errors with respect to multiple targets. Finally, numerous simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.},

  abstract     = {As an important part of intelligent and connected vehicles (ICVs) safety, driver authentication is a hot research direction in recent years. The existing driver authentication schemes in the industry are based on scret key, biometric characteristics or image characteristics, and these schemes always have efficiency and security problems in real-time driver authentication. In order to make up for these shortcomings, researchers propose driver authentication schemes based on driver behaviors and conduct in-depth explorations. However, the existing behavior-based schemes rely on a fixed number of drivers, when a new driver is added as an authorized user, existing schemes need to retrain the whole model to authenticate all drivers, cost many computing resources and can not meet the low latency requirements of ICVs. To solve the above deficiencies, we propose a growable driver authentication scheme based on incremental learning for the first time to improve authentication efficiency in dynamic scenarios where the number of drivers is constantly increasing. We extract driver behavior characteristic data from two real vehicles and design a growable model based on incremental learning for driver authentication. Besides these, we also use the support vector machine (SVM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and some other algorithms to make comparative experiments. The experimental results indicate that our scheme not only has high authentication accuracy, but also greatly reduces the time of model retraining.},

Second, we add line features on the basis of existing point features. To match line features in real time, we only select the best line features to participate in optimization. We combine line segments by their geometric relationship to reduce line segment splitting and representation redundancy in the LSD algorithm. We further predict line features by IMU-assisted optical flow tracking to achieve high precision matching. In the back-end optimization process, we used a redundant structure to avoid the failure of stereo constraints in a highly dynamic environment. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods (VINS-fusion and PL-VINS) on the EuRoC MAV dataset. The system also achieve good performance in a real environment.},

We present a deep reinforcement learning based method, where a multi-head heterogeneous attention mechanism is designed to facilitate learning a policy that automatically and sequentially constructs the route, while taking the energy consumption into account. In our method, two types of attentions are leveraged to learn the relations between monitoring targets and charging station nodes, adopting an encoder-decoder-like policy network. Moreover, we also employ a curriculum learning strategy to enhance generalization to different numbers of charging stations. Computational results show that our method outperforms conventional algorithms with higher solution quality (except for exact methods such as Gurobi) and shorter runtime in general, and also exhibits strong generalized performance on problem instances with different distributions and sizes.},

  abstract     = {The problem of charge scheduling of Electric Vehicles (EVs) at charging stations remains one of the significant challenges due to high charging time and insufficient charging infrastructure leading to unfulfilled demands. Moreover, most public charging stations (CSs) are equipped with charging ports that serve only a fixed charging rate. The installation of adaptable ports, that can vary their rate of charging with time, has been observed to alleviate these challenges. Hence, we propose an efficient EV charge scheduling plan, for a CS equipped with adaptable charging ports, to improve its performance. The CS aims at maximizing not only its profit but also its total customer satisfaction. Also, it is assumed that, upon being unable to fulfill their total energy demands, the CS pays an incentive to the EV owners. Such incentives reduce the profit margins of the CSs. Hence, we formulate a bi-objective optimization EV scheduling model that drives the CSs toward maximizing their profit and customer satisfaction. Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solver and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) evolutionary algorithm are used to obtain the optimal and approximate Pareto fronts respectively. We further propose a charging action replacement-based heuristic approach to speed up the process of obtaining an approximate set of non-dominated solutions. We run several simulations and observe that the proposed algorithm results in a near-optimal set of solutions compared to the actual Pareto front with a much less computation time.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the dynamic event-triggered adaptive neural coordinated disturbance rejection for marine vehicles with external disturbances as the sinusoidal superpositions with unknown frequencies, amplitudes and phases. The vehicle movement mathematical models are transformed into parameterized expressions with the neural networks approximating nonlinear dynamics. The parametric exogenous systems are exploited to express external disturbances, which are converted into the linear canonical models with coordinated changes. The adaptive technique together with disturbance filters realize the disturbance estimation and rejection. By using the vectorial backstepping, the dynamic event-triggered adaptive neural coordinated disturbance rejection controller is derived with the dynamic event-triggering conditions being incorporated to reduce execution frequencies of vehicle&#39;s propulsion systems. The coordinated formation control can be achieved with the closed-loop semi-global stability. The dynamic event-triggered adaptive disturbance rejection scheme achieves the disturbance estimation and cancellation without requiring the a priori marine vehicle&#39;s model dynamics. Illustrative simulations and comparisons validate the proposed scheme.},

Taking the steady-state gain matrix as a breakthrough, this paper firstly studies the influence mechanism of GNSS spoofing signals on the position output of INS/GNSS integrated navigation, and then deduces the feasibility of directional spoofing by using exponential spoofing signal with two adjustable parameters in INS/GNSS integrated navigation mode. Then, the influence of spoofing signals on the attitude and speed of the integrated navigation output is analyzed, and the relevant constraints of velocity and attitude errors are introduced to determine the exponential GNSS spoofing signals model that meets the requirements of covertness, and finally the task of covert directional spoofing of the target unmanned platform is realized.

  abstract     = {The emergence of the vehicular ad-hoc network (VANETs) could meet the need for an efficient and safe transportation. Vehicles wirelessly interact with nearby road-side units (RSUs) and send the data to the cloud servers (CS), but this approach has limitations (i.e., network congestion and privacy leakage). Edge computing can effectively solve problems of network congestion, feedback delay and privacy leakage during transmission caused by CS. Thus, this paper proposes a certificateless aggregate signcryption with online/offline encryption (CLOASC) based on edge computing (EDC). Correspondingly, certificateless signcryption (CLSC), online/offline encryption (OOE) and aggregate signcryption technology solve the key escrow problem, shorten the encryption time and realize the quick verification of multiple users, respectively. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the scheme we propose does not have any bilinear pairings or scalar multiplications in the online encryption stage, which greatly reduces the computational cost in the online stage. In the random oracle model, our scheme was proved to be existential unforgeability under adaptive chosen message attacks (EUF-ACM) and adaptive indistinguishability under chosen-ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2) security. Simulation results show that our scheme is computationally and communication based lightweight as compared to the related.},

The fusion of 4D Radar and LiDAR can boost the detection range and more robust. Nevertheless, different data characteristics and noise distributions between two sensors hinder performance improvement when directly integrating them. Therefore, we are the first to propose a novel fusion method termed &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$M^{2}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -Fusion for 4D Radar and LiDAR, based on Multi-modal and Multi-scale fusion. To better integrate two sensors, we propose an Interaction-based Multi-Modal Fusion (IMMF) method utilizing a self-attention mechanism to learn features from each modality and exchange intermediate layer information. Specific to the current single-resolution voxel division&#39;s precision and efficiency balance problem, we also put forward a Center-based Multi-Scale Fusion (CMSF) method to first regress the center points of objects and then extract features in multiple resolutions. Furthermore, we present a data preprocessing method based on Gaussian distribution that effectively decreases data noise to reduce errors caused by point cloud divergence of 4D Radar data in the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$x$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; - &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$z$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; plane.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel memory-enabled non-uniform sampling-based bumblebee foraging algorithm (MEB) designed for optimal channel selection in a distributed Vehicular Dynamic Spectrum Access (VDSA) framework employed in a platoon operating environment. Given how bumblebee behavioral models are designed to support adaptation in complex and highly time-varying environments, these models can be employed by connected vehicles to enable their operation within a dynamically changing network topology and support their selection of optimal channels possessing low levels of congestion to achieve high throughput. As a result, the proposed VDSA-based optimal channel selection employs fundamental concepts from the bumblebee foraging model. In the proposed approach, the Channel Busy Ratio (CBR) of all channels is computed and stored in memory to be accessed by the MEB algorithm to make the necessary channel switching decisions. Two averaging techniques, Sliding Window Average (SWA) and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), are employed to leverage past samples and are evaluated against the no-memory case. Due to the high variability of the environment (e.g., high velocities, changing density of vehicles on the road), we propose to calculate the CBR by employing non-uniform channel sampling allocations as well as evaluate it using both simplified numerical and realistic Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) computer simulations. The numerical simulation results show that gains in the probability of the best channel selection can be achieved relative to a uniform sampling allocation approach. By utilizing memory, we observe an additional increase in the channel selection performance. Similarly, we see an increase in the probability of successful reception when utilizing the bumblebee algorithm via a system-level simulator.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular communication has emerged as a powerful tool for providing a safe and comfortable driving experience for users. Long Term Evolution (LTE) supports and enhances the quality of vehicular communication due to its properties such as high data rate, spatial reuse, and low delay. However, high mobility of vehicles introduces a wide variety of security threats, including Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose effective solutions for real-time detection and localization of DoS attacks in an LTE-based vehicular network with mobile network components (e.g., vehicles, femto access points, etc.). We consider malicious data transmission by vehicles in two ways- using real identification (unintentional) and using fake identification (intentional). This paper makes three important contributions. First, we propose an efficient attack detection technique based on data packet counter and average Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). Next, we present an improved attack detection framework using machine learning algorithms. We use some ML-based supervised classification algorithms to make detection more robust and consistent. Finally, we propose Data Packet Counter (DPC)-based, triangulation-based and measurement report based localization for both intentional and unintentional DoS attacks. We analyze the average packet delay incurred by vehicles by modelling the system as an &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$M/M/m$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; queue.

It has a compact, low-profile, simple, and symmetrical structure, which consists of four identical quarter circular patches with a pair of crossed feeding lines symmetrically and orthogonally embedded. Good filtering performance with three radiation nulls (RNs) generated without extra filtering structure is achieved, and the production mechanisms of three RNs are studied numerically. To get a deep insight into its working mechanism, the proposed structure is analyzed, and the equivalent lumped circuit is modeled and simulated. The prototype antenna with low profile of 2.832 mm and average gain of about 9.1 dBi within the frequency band of 5.28–6.11 GHz is fabricated and measured. Moreover, the measured polarization isolation is more than 44 dB within the operating band and the measured cross-polarization level is less than −29 dB. Good agreement between simulated and measured results can be acquired. The proposed antenna is a good candidate for in-vehicle local area networks (WLAN), in-vehicle Wi-Fi 6E, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication and 5G vehicle-to-basestation communication applications.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has spurred research on radio air-to-ground (AG) channels. The research shows the AG channel can exhibit higher rates of change and more 3D effects than a terrestrial channel. A received-power model predicts the power that makes it from the transmitter (Tx) to the receiver (Rx) through the intervening environment. Received-power models are key to many RF localization schemes. However, many of the received-power models used for UAV localization are 1D or 2D; 3D effects such as ground reflection and polarization are oversimplified or ignored entirely. In this paper, we perform a comparative experimental analysis of various received-power models. The more sophisticated models account for range, Tx directionality, Rx directionality, polarization, and ground reflection. The models are applied to an AG link realized by a fixed-wing UAV in an open-field environment. Our results show that, on average, a 50% reduction in localization error can be achieved by including the polarization factor in the received-power model.},

Then, a rigorous analysis of interference is performed for two types of interference: intra-cell interference and inter-cell interference. The interference analysis results are then used to derive an upper bound of outage probability on the considered system. Using numerical results show that the analytical and simulation results match one another. The results show that, in the presence of UAV&#39;s fluctuations, optimizing radiation pattern shape requires balancing an inherent tradeoff between increasing pattern gain to reduce the interference as well as to compensate large path loss at mmWave frequencies and decreasing it to alleviate the adverse effect of a UAV&#39;s vibrations.},

While we have focused on the campaign description and the analysis of the dominant signal component in previous publications, we now concentrate on the detection and tracking of multipath components. In this paper, we present our data processing chain that allows a fast parallel processing of the measurement data, as data dependencies are reduced as much as possible. We furthermore introduce a path-based multipath component tracking approach and apply it to our measurement data. This tracking allows us to estimate the location of reflectors causing multipath component signals.

The chief probability functions of the received SNR in IFTR fading, including the PDF, CDF and MGF, are expressed in closed-form, having a functional form similar to other state-of-the-art fading models. Then, the IFTR model is empirically validated using multiple channels measured in rather diverse scenarios, including line of sight (LOS) millimeter-wave, land mobile satellite (LMS) and underwater acoustic communication (UAC), showing a better fit than the original FTR model and other models previously used in these environments. In addition, the performance of wireless communication systems operating under IFTR fading is evaluated in closed-form in two scenarios: ( i ) exact and asymptotic bit error rate for a family of coherent modulations; and ( ii ) exact and asymptotic outage probability.},

  abstract     = {We consider the cooperative detection for distributed sensing via low Earth orbit constellations. The source data gathered by the ground sensors are non-orthogonally sent to satellite access points, and then aggregated at a central satellite via inter-satellite links (ISLs). To overcome the intrinsic ISL bandwidth limitation, we consider the deep auto-encoding paradigm to jointly design the ISL transceivers among satellites, and propose a novel deep variational information bottleneck (DVIB) method which maximizes the end-to-end sensing accuracy under bandwidth constraints. Specifically, the mathematically untractable ISL bandwidth constraint is first transformed into an entropy-based format. Then a customized batch-norm layer is introduced, where the messages on ISLs are considered as latent variables and are regularized with entropy-constrained posterior for efficient compression. Compared to the benchmark, the proposed DVIB method is shown to simultaneously reduce the bandwidth overhead by 30% and enhance the sensing accuracy by 2–5 dB, validating the significance of relevant information extraction on ISLs.},

Specifically, the full-duplex (FD) UAV covertly relays data from each ground sensor to remote base station (BS) against a warden (Willie). Considering a noise uncertainty model, the minimum detection error probability (DEP) of Willie is first derived. Under the constraint of the derived DEP, the minimum average covert transmission rate (ACTR) is then maximized by jointly designing the sensor association, the UAV transmit power, and the UAV trajectory. A low-complexity algorithm based on the penalty successive convex approximation (P-SCA) is further invoked to achieve the locally optimal solution. Finally, numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework and reveal some insights, i.e., increasing uncertainty at Willie can improve the covertness performance.},

However, when combining blockchain into vehicular networks, there exist three challenges: 1) how to access pre-deployed blockchain when vehicles are disconnected from network infrastructures, 2) how to reduce the communication overhead caused by an increasing network scale while maintaining decentralization of blockchains, 3) how to balance limited vehicle&#39;s resources and high throughput of blockchain. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient Device-to-Device (D2D) Network-empowered blockchain framework to receive and process transactions from D2D vehicles. We then propose a grouped and leaderless consensus mechanism to reduce communication overhead as the network scale increases. We also propose an elastic resource allocation scheme using the Lyapunov optimization theory to achieve high throughput given limited resources. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed mechanisms achieve D2D interaction under different network conditions and better performance than existing approaches.},

In a TWRN, there exists a challenging problem that the two cascading channels from User1-to-IRS-to-relay and User2-to-IRS-to-relay and two direct channels from User1-to-relay and User2-to-relay interfere with each other. Via smartly designing the initial phase shifts of IRS and pilot pattern, the two cascading channels are separated over only four pilot sequences by using simple arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction. Then, the least-squares estimator is adopted to estimate the two cascading channels and two direct channels. The corresponding sum mean square errors (MSE) of channel estimators are derived. By minimizing Sum-MSE, the optimal phase shift matrix of IRS is proved. Then, two special matrices Hadamard and discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix are shown to be two optimal training matrices for IRS. Furthermore, the IRS with discrete finite phase shifters is taken into account. The Hadamard matrix requires only one-bit phase shifters to achieve the optimal Sum-MSE performance for specific numbers of IRS elements. Using theoretical derivation and numerical simulations, we find that 3 or 4-bit phase shifters are sufficient for IRS to achieve a negligible MSE performance loss for any number.},

By introducing a pair of ATSs, a linear cross polarization is generated with almost equal amplitude and quadrature phase relative to the original polarization, and a circular polarization is realized. Then the CP horn is longitudinally shortened by 33.3% for miniaturized dimension, but the circular polarization is deteriorated because the two linear polarizations are perturbed. Critically, three pairs of simple metal blocks introducing extra capacitances are loaded near the ATSs to enhance the cross polarization, so the two orthogonal linear polarizations are rebalanced and the circular polarization is reconstructed. Other two pairs of metal blocks are embedded on the throat of the horn to improve the impedance match on the operating band, achieving a 32.8% bandwidth of 11.35-15.8 GHz for both impedance and axial ratio bandwidths. The proposed antenna is easy to be fabricated by standard mechanical manufacture process, showing a compact and low-cost candidate for vehicular satellite communications.},

In this paper, we derive the closed-form expression of ER for each group based on the statistical CSI and show that the outage rate of a group is determined by the ratio between the number of the elements on the RIS and the number of the users in a group. Then, the problem of maximizing the ER of the system is modeled as mixed integer nonlinear programming, which is non-convex. We propose an alternative optimization method to solve it, which includes the heuristic algorithm to solve the subcarrier assignment and the gradient descent-based algorithm to realize power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that the ER of our proposed method in RIS-assisted MMS can achieve significant gain over that of the case without RIS and the scheme of random subcarrier assignment with average power allocation.},

It becomes challenging to determine which APs should serve which UEs with which pilots when the number of UEs approximates the number of APs and far exceeds the number of pilots. Compared to the previous work, a better compromise between spectral efficiency (SE) and implementation simplicity is needed in such massive access scenarios. This paper proposes an interference-aware massive access (IAMA) scheme realizing joint AP-UE association and pilot assignment for CF mMIMO by exploiting the large-scale interference features. We propose an interference-aware reward as a novel performance metric and use it to develop two iterative algorithms to optimize the association and pilot assignment.

To maximize the signal-to-noise ratio at the legitimate receiver and satisfy the covertness requirement, the transmit power at the source and the reflection coefficients at the IRS are jointly optimized. Since the optimization variables are coupled, an alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem. Specifically, in each iteration, the analytical expression of the optimal transmit power is obtained, and the penalty successive convex approximation algorithm is adopted to obtain the optimal reflection coefficients. Numerical results show the performance loss caused by hardware impairments. Besides, by comparing the values of Kullback-Leibler divergence, results also illustrate that the proposed transmission scheme is more robust to the hardware impairments, as the nonrobust designed parameters can not satisfy the covert constraint.},

Specifically, we ignore the channel gains of the IRS-user link, determine two low-cost sub-optimal active-beamforming vectors at the transmitter, and calculate the corresponding two passive-beamforming solutions at the IRS. Then, we calculate their total channel gains and the solution that yields a higher gain is selected as the final solution.

  abstract     = {This letter proposes a deep learning-based two-timescale channel state information feedback framework called RIS-CsiNet for beamforming (BF) design and discrete phase shift design in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted frequency-division duplexing systems, where the direct link between the base station (BS) and the user equipment (UE) is blocked. Given that the BS-RIS channel is quasi-static and the RIS-UE channel rapidly changes, the feedback is divided into two types: large-timescale and small-timescale feedback. At the beginning of the large-timescale feedback, the neural network (NN)-based encoder at the UE compresses and feedbacks the BS-RIS channel to the BS. On the basis of the received BS-RIS channel information, an NN-based hypernetwork adopted at the BS generates the weights of the NNs that directly produce the BF vector and RIS phase shifts according to the received feedback information of the RIS-UE channel. In the small-timescale feedback, only the RIS-UE channel is fed back by the encoder. The BF vector and phase shifts are produced by the NNs generated in the large timescale. Simulation results show that RIS-CsiNet considerably outperforms conventional algorithms in terms of achievable rate and complexity.},

Moreover, it maps additional information bits by full reflection passive beamforming to improve the system&#39;s spectral efficiency (SE).

To maximize the effective proactive eavesdropping rate, which is defined as the suspicious communication rate that satisfies the condition of successful eavesdropping, three strategies are presented, including Enhancing-Strategy , Jamming-Strategy and Hybrid-Strategy . For the first two, a semidefinite relaxation based algorithm is adopted to design the passive beamforming at IRS. For the last strategy, closed-form expressions of optimal solutions are derived. In addition to the passive beamforming design, the deployment of IRS is optimized by a simulated annealing algorithm. Finally, simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.},

The RIS is deployed to enhance the secrecy outage probability (SOP) of the data sent to a legitimate user. By deriving the distributions of the received signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) at the legitimate user and the eavesdropper, we formulate, in a closed-form expression, a tight bound for the SOP under the constraint of discrete phase control at the RIS.

With statistical channel state information (CSI) of eavesdroppers, the beamforming vector and trajectory of UAV as well as user scheduling are jointly optimized to minimize the weighted sum of UAV flight period and secrecy outage duration. The considered problem is a combinatorial optimization problem with complicated objective function, and thus difficult to be solved by convex optimization-based methods. To this end, we formulate this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based method to optimize all variables simultaneously.

  abstract     = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation constitutes a promising technology for high-mobility scenarios. However, the detection of OTFS systems imposes substantial complexity. Hence, we propose a novel orthogonal block (OB) based detection scheme for significantly reducing the OTFS detection complexity without any performance loss with integer Doppler shifts. This is achieved by recognizing that the received signal can be partitioned into multiple parallel orthogonal blocks. Therefore, the detection of data symbols within an orthogonal block only depends on the signals received within this orthogonal block with reduced dimension. Explicitly, we propose a graph theory based orthogonal block identification algorithm, which models the relationship between the received signal and the original information symbols as a bipartite graph, where a depth first search (DFS) algorithm is invoked for partitioning the received signals into orthogonal blocks. For each orthogonal block, the existing detection algorithms can be used. Since the size of orthogonal blocks may be much lower than that of the original received signals, the detection complexity can be significantly reduced. For example, the complexity of the OB based MMSE detector is approximately a factor 4096 lower than that of the traditional MMSE detector for a channel having two paths.},

In this paper, we propose a novel superimposed RIS-phase modulation (SRPM) scheme to transfer extra messages by superimposing information-bearing phase offsets to conventionally optimized RIS phases. The proposed SRPM is interpreted as a universal framework for RIS phase modulation. Theoretical union bound of the average bit error rate (ABER) of the proposed SRPM is also derived with the maximum likelihood (ML) detection.

Unlike the conventional passive IRS, which reflects signals without amplification, the active IRS can jointly amplify the amplitude and adjust the phase of the reflected signals to overcome the multiplicative fading effect. However, the additional noise introduced by the active IRS is not conducive to the signal demodulation at the destination and increases the detection probability by the warder. To overcome this problem and maximize the covert rate of the system, we jointly design the transmission power at the transmitter and the reflection coefficient of each reflection element at the active IRS. Since the optimization variables are coupled in the objective function and the constraints, an efficient semi-definite relaxation combined alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convex problem, where each subproblem is solved optimally. Numerical results demonstrate that the active IRS assisted system outperforms the passive one in term of the covert rate even when the number of reflection elements is large (such as ten thousand of elements), since the active IRS can amplify the incident signal to overcome the multiplicative fading effect.},

However, the extremely high front-haul and computational overhead of the original cell-free network with centralized or star topologies limits its practical adoption. In this work, we propose a novel non-linear sequential detection method based on the Gaussian message passing algorithm (GMP) for the sequential topology, i.e., radio stripe network, which requires constant front-haul signaling as the number of access points (APs) increases. Specifically, each AP iteratively calculates means and variances locally and fuses them with the received messages from the preceding AP based on the product principle of the multivariate Gaussian probability density function. The fused messages are forwarded to the next AP to calculate the a priori probability with constant front-haul signaling, which is independent of the number of APs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed sequential GMP detector achieves an attractive trade-off between bit error rate (BER) performance, computational complexity, and front-haul requirements.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the wireless surveillance with a legitimate monitor (E) over hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) based suspicious communications between a suspicious transmitter (S) and a suspicious destination (D). Specifically, with the HARQ protocol, S uses at most &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$L \geq 2$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; transmission rounds (TRs) for delivering the same message to D. Under this setup, E deliberately jams D at each TR to decrease its signal receiving quality, so as to induce S to consume more TRs for transmitting its message. Then, as a reward, E at these TRs can overhear the suspicious message from S more clearly . Our purpose is to maximize E&#39;s eavesdropping success probability, by allocating its jamming power at these &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$L$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; TRs, subject to its power budget constraint. The problem is highly non-convex. To solve it, we first exploit the general successive convex approximation (SCA) approach to determine the iterative solution. Considering the large complexity of the SCA-based approach, we further develop an easy-to-implement Lagrange multiplier method to find the sub-optimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes increase the eavesdropping success probability as compared with several benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Frequency-selective peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction is essential in networks such as 5G New Radio (NR) that support frequency-domain multiplexing of users and services. However, stemming from the frequency-selective shaping of the involved clipping noise, the relation between the intended PAPR target and the actually realized PAPR is known to be heavily nonlinear, which complicates the PAPR reduction. In this article, a novel machine learning (ML)-based solution, called PAPRer , is proposed to automatically and accurately tune the optimal PAPR target for frequency-selective PAPR reduction. This is achieved by utilizing the features related to the used clipping noise filter and minimization of the defined loss function, through supervised learning, which quantifies the PAPR target estimation accuracy. An analytical clipping noise power-based method is also devised for reference purposes. Extensive numerical evaluations in 5G NR context are provided and analyzed, showing that PAPRer can very accurately predict and tune the optimal PAPR target. These results, together with the provided complexity assessment, demonstrate that the proposed PAPRer offers a favorable performance-complexity tradeoff in choosing the optimal PAPR target for frequency-selective PAPR reduction.},

In this correspondence, we derive an analytical expression to determine if the 3GPP fairness is achieved in a given network configuration.

To alleviate the channel estimation overhead incurred by the IRS, a novel two-timescale scheme is proposed to maximize the ergodic sum-rate. Specifically, multiple IRS BF patterns are first optimized based on the statistical channel state information (CSI). Under the obtained IRS BF patterns, the transmit power and time allocation for devices in each channel coherence interval are optimized based on the instantaneous CSI. By characterizing the lower bound of the objective value, we further analytically quantify the performance degradation incurred by using less IRS BF patterns to shed light on the fundamental performance-overhead tradeoff. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed design and demonstrate that only 33% of the total IRS BF patterns are needed to maintain 95% of the maximum achieved ergodic sum-rate.},

Age of Information (AoI) quantifies the freshness of the received information or status update. This work considers a setup of deployed IoT devices in an IoT network; multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serve as mobile relay nodes between the sensors and the base station. We formulate an optimization problem to jointly plan the UAVs&#39; trajectory, while minimizing the AoI of the received messages and the devices&#39; energy consumption. The solution accounts for the UAVs&#39; battery lifetime and flight time to recharging depots to ensure the UAVs&#39; green operation . The complex optimization problem is efficiently solved using a deep reinforcement learning algorithm. In particular, we propose a deep Q-network, which works as a function approximation to estimate the state-action value function. The proposed scheme is quick to converge and results in a lower ergodic age and ergodic energy consumption when compared with benchmark algorithms such as greedy algorithm (GA), nearest neighbour (NN), and random-walk (RW).},

Specifically, first, the propagation paths of the electromagnetic waves in the L-shaped NLOS scenario are analyzed and a multipath echoes model for the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar is established. Then, the time of arrivals (ToAs) with respect to different paths are estimated by the matrix pencil algorithm.

In this paper, we propose a transfer double deep Q-network (DDQN) based DDoS detection method for IoV. By constructing a Kalman filter based reinforcement learning model, we can constantly improve the performance of DDoS detection in DDQN without depending on large labeled data. Furthermore, by utilizing the knowledge obtained by adjacent similar base stations, we design a transfer DDQN method based on traffic flow similarity to speed up the training of DDQN for a newly added base station. This enables the new base station to obtain DDoS detection policies quickly. We compare our proposed method with other popular machine learning based DDoS detection methods. The experimental results show that the transfer DDQN based DDoS detection method improves F1-measure and detection accuracy by 79.4% and 17.5% on average. Meanwhile, by means of traffic flow similarity based transfer learning, the time consumption and convergence time can be reduced by 41.3% and 31.1%, which makes our method adapt to the dynamic network.},

In the symbiotic relationship formed in this system model, the RIS devices&#39; PN signal backscattering not only provides multiple primary receivers with a spatial diversity gain but also supports the transmission of the RIS devices&#39; own data to their designated receiver. First, through investigation of a simple network configuration, we obtain insights into the impacts of various factors on the system performance, and thus, into the importance of radio resource allocation for CRN symbiotic operation. Then, we develop a resource allocation framework that maximizes the sum rate of the PN and SN by jointly optimizing the system resources for cases of devices with hardware imperfections. To reduce the complexity of solving this problem, we convert it into a convex weighted minimum mean square error problem. An iterative algorithm for finding the optimal NOMA power allocation for the PN and the reflection coefficients of the RISs is developed, and its overhead is analyzed.

Existing DV-Hop based range-free localization algorithms estimate the distance from an unknown node to an anchor node by the multi-hop forwarding principle and the location information of anchor nodes. However, they lack an accurate distance estimation model of anchor nodes under different hops, resulting in inaccurate localization. To address this issue, this paper proposes a distance estimation model (DEM) for DV-Hop localization in WSNs. Specifically, DEM mathematically derives the farthest distance detected by an anchor node under different hops. Then, the average distance is calculated by the upper and lower boundaries according to the derived farthest distance. Finally, the average distance is embedded into a multi-objective optimization to solve the DV-Hop localization problem. The simulation results show that the proposed model is significantly superior to the state of the art in terms of sensor localization accuracy and cost effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Due to the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) around the globe, Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) has emerged as one of the most promising technologies of the modern era in modern smart grid eco-systems. However, with an exponential increase in the number of EVs around the globe, it is challenging to assign a unique IP address to each EV for content delivery in V2G environment. Also, with an increase in the number of EVs, the traffic load on the network local area aggregator (LAG), which aggregates the data between Charging Stations (CS) and EVs and disseminates it among different participating entities increases manyfold. Most of the existing solutions reported in literature for the aforementioned problems are based upon traditional Internet Protocol (IP)-based protocol which may have a performance degradation with an increase in the number of nodes in the network. Also, it lacks in-network caching, which is pre-requisite to take efficient decisions for fast content delivery. Hence, to mitigate these issues, in this paper, we propose CCN-based secure content delivery scheme for V2G network. Our major contributions in this paper are summarized in three-fold. Firstly, to reduce the load on LAG, we propose in-network caching for fast content delivery in V2G network. Secondly, we propose a contract theory based incentive scheme to attract vehicles to participate in content delivery to the recipients. Thirdly, for secure content delivery and to achieve trust in the network, we propose the proof of authority (PoA) consensus algorithm among vehicles in V2G network. We evaluated the proposed scheme using various performance evaluation metrics compared to the existing state-of-the-art solutions. The performance of the proposed scheme illustrates that it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art schemes with respect to delay incurred, social welfare, throughput, and latency.},

  abstract     = {An irregular tiled array technique with the maximization of beam collection efficiency (BCE) for microwave wireless power transmission (WPT) is addressed in this paper, where the radiating elements are irregularly partitioned into multiple subarrays for reducing the number of radio frequency (RF) chain. The system architectures of WPT based on irregular tiled arrays are analyzed for the exhibition of its low-cost advantages. To achieve a good trade-off between the manufacturing cost and beampattern, a mixed-integer optimization problem (MIOP) accounting for the maximization of BCE satisfying the subarray tiling configuration, scanning direction and peak sidelobe level (SLL) constraints is established. By equivalently reformulating the beampattern, the MIOP in terms of subarray tiling configuration and subarray excitations is decoupled, and a two-stage solution method can be implemented. Firstly, resort to ‘generalized BCE’, the binary quadratic optimization problem (BQOP) for maximizing the BCE at considered scanning angles while guaranteeing the full aperture coverage is reduced to a binary second-order cone optimization problem. After the subarray tiling configuration is determined, the non-convex Rayleigh entropy maximization problem at a given scanning angle with respect to subarray complex excitations while satisfying peak SLL constraint is globally solved by using iterative convex approximation algorithm. Owing to the high efficiency of convex optimization, the BCE is able to monotonically increase to a stable value. Several numerical results with different array size and subarray shapes are provided to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing to the competitive counterparts in the open literatures.},

  abstract     = {Efficient edge server placement techniques select optimal locations for edge servers to improve network and energy performance. However, without prior knowledge of users&#39; resource demands, the possibilities of optimal location for these edge servers within a network are vast, which is a challenging problem. On the other hand, most existing techniques ignore the influence of user mobility on user&#39;s resources demand, violation of low-latency, and high energy consumption of 5G networks. Therefore, this article addresses the edge server placement problem using network traffic to estimate the user resource demands. We first use a network traffic prediction model based on Graph Convolution Network to generate network traffic distribution. Second, the problem of edge server placement is formulated as a constraint optimization problem that places edge servers strategically to balance energy and latency. Searching randomly through many possible solutions and selecting the most descriptive optimal solutions can be time-consuming. Therefore, we used the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize network delay and energy consumption, especially for high mobility areas. Experimental results are obtained to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with existing methods. We evaluate the algorithm based on the real dataset from Shenzhen, Futian District. The results show our proposed algorithm averagely reduces edge servers&#39; total cost and overloaded numbers by 23.98% and 52.71%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {New radio in unlicensed spectrum (NR-U) is an evolutionary extension of the existing unlicensed spectrum technologies, which allows New radio (NR) to operate in the shared and unlicensed frequency bands. However, in such bands, NR-U should coexist with other radio access technologies (RATs) in a commonly shared spectrum. As various RATs possess dissimilar physical and link-layer configurations, NR-U should comply with the requirements for harmonious coexistence with them. For this reason, the majority of the existing studies on NR-U are focused on fair coexistence. In contrast, the efforts on attaining efficiency of the spectrum and fairness concurrently have gained comparatively few interests as they exhibit an adverse feature. Motivated by this limitation, we propose an algorithm called Thompson&#39;s sampling-based online gradient ascent (TS-OGA), which jointly considers the fairness between NR-U and incumbents and, at the same time, the efficiency via pertinent idle period adjustment of the incumbents in the operating channel. Because NR-U deals with the two conflicting and competing objectives (i.e., fairness and efficiency), we model it as a multi-objective multi-armed bandit problem using the Generalized Gini Index aggregation function (GGAF). In the proposed scheme, TS-OGA, a Thompson&#39;s sampling (TS) policy is employed together with the online gradient ascent to address the multi-objective optimization problem. Through simulation results, we show that TS-OGA can significantly enhance overall channel throughput, while maintaining fairness. Further, TS-OGA provides the best performance compared to three different baseline algorithms such as &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\epsilon$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -greedy, upper confidence bound, and pure TS.},

LEO satellite networks have grown in importance as a complement to terrestrial networks aiming at delivering global, ubiquitous communication. However, due to the LEO network topology keeps changing dynamically, the development of efficient routing algorithms becomes one of the challenges in the LEO network. Traditional routing policies hardly solve the rerouting problem caused by link switchover and the high calculation cost caused by large-scale irregular satellite topology. In this paper, we propose a knowledge graph-aided representation of satellite network topologies and routing architecture to optimize path selection and calculation cost for lower packet loss ratio and average delay. Moreover, we generate a routing policy by predicting potential relations between data packets and nodes to select the best relay nodes with the maximum probability of forwarding relations.

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and network function virtualization (NFV) facilitate the deployment of multi-access edge computing (MEC). In the UAV-based MEC (UMEC) network, virtualized network function (VNF) can be implemented as a lightweight container running on UMEC host operating system (OS). However, UMEC network is vulnerable to attack, which can result in resource degradation and even UMEC service disruption. Rejuvenation techniques, such as failover technique and live container migration technique, can mitigate the impact of resource degradation but their effectiveness to improve the resilience of UMEC services should be evaluated. This paper presents a quantitative modeling approach based on semi-Markov process to investigate the resilience of a UMEC service chain consisting of any number of VNFs executed in any number of UMEC hosts in terms of availability and reliability. Unlike existing studies, the semi-Markov model constructed in this paper can capture the time-dependent behaviors between VNFs, between host OSes, and between VNFs and host OSes on the condition that the holding times of the recovery and failure events follow any kind of distribution. We perform the sensitivity analysis to identify potential resilience bottlenecks. The results highlight that migration time is the parameter significantly affecting the resilience, which shed the insight on designing the UMEC service chain with high-grade resilience requirements. In addition, we carry out the numerical experiments to reveal that: (i) the type of failure time distribution has a significant effect on the resilience; and (ii) the resilience increases with decreasing number of VNFs, while the availability increases with increasing number of UMEC hosts and the reliability decreases with increasing number of UMEC hosts, which can provide meaningful guidance for the UAV placement optimization in the UMEC network.},

  abstract     = {Using microgrids to charge Electric Vehicles (EVs) is a significant step toward achieving Electric mobility. The microgrids generate electricity for self-use and sell surplus energy locally in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) manner, where seller and buyer meet to trade electricity directly on agreed terms without any intermediary. The energy trading decision for the microgrid is a challenging issue due to uncertainty of renewable energy yield, the electric demands of EVs and without knowing the offers of other competitive microgrids together makes it hard to decide the selling price of energy per unit. Further, there is a need to audit and verify the energy trading and store energy transactions securely in distributed manner to avoid collapse of the system in case of single point of failure. In this context, this paper presents a Blockchain and Quantum Reinforcement Learning based optimized Energy Trading (BQL-ET) model for E-mobility. Firstly, a double-auction mechanism is proposed to set optimal market-trading price by observing the selling price of each microgrid and the demand of EV&#39;s. Secondly, using smart contracts, consortium blockchain is deployed for the evaluation of overall utility, which includes energy supply, demand, and cost for both microgrids and EVs. Finally, Utility maximization problem is transformed into a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and in order to develop the learning policy and maximize overall utility, a QRL optimization for solving the MDP problem is proposed. Convergence analysis and performance results attest that BQL-ET convergences faster, maximizes the utility of both microgrids an EVs with lower transaction confirmation time and setting of the optimal market-trading price compared to state-of-the art models.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) serve as crucial means to ensure safe transportation systems and enhance driving convenience. Ensuring authentication between vehicles and units is the most essential line of defense for VANETs systems. Various schemes of message authentication are put forward to realize safe communication in VANETs. However, these schemes mainly pay attention to privacy and security issues, and are not fit for high-density traffic environments where many messages should be verified by a roadside unit (RSU). At present, achieving the low-latency authentication under the security and privacy of messages remains a critical requirement and challenge. For addressing this problem, this study puts forward a novel low-latency message authentication scheme based on the distributed authentication and message priority (DPB-MA), which can minimize message verification latency through cooperation between the RSU and cooperative vehicles (CVs). In addition, a message priority strategy has been designed to ensure that urgent messages are preferentially verified. According to the security proof with tight reduction, the DPB-MA is existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen message attack (EU-CMA) in the random oracle model (ROM). Furthermore, our DPB-MA achieves full message aggregation, which also greatly optimizes the communication overhead and authentication efficiency. Performance analysis indicates that our scheme works well in high-density traffic scenarios and is more suitable for securing emergency messages with ultra-low latency requirements.},

Despite these benefits, riders risk the exposure of sensitive location data during ride requesting to an untrusted Ride-Hailing Service Provider (RHSP). Our motivation arises from repetitive matching, i.e., the same driver is repetitively assigned to the same rider . Meanwhile, we introduce a driver exclusion function to protect riders&#39; location privacy. Existing work on privacy-preserving RHS overlooks this function. While Secure &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; Nearest Neighbor (S &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; NN) facilitates efficient matching, the state-of-the-art neglects a collusion attack. To solve this problem, we formally define repetitive matching and strong location privacy, and propose Mnemosyne: privacy-preserving ride matching with collusion-resistant driver exclusion. We extend the simple integration of equality checking and item exclusion to a dynamic integration. We concatenate each prefix of an acceptable identity range to each location code when generating a ride request, i.e., secure mix index. We process each prefix of the driver identity to generate a ride response, i.e., a mix token. We build an indistinguishable Bloom-filter as an index to query the token. When matching riders with drivers, the colluding parties cannot distinguish identity prefixes from location codes. We build a prototype of Mnemosyne based on servers, smartphones, and a real-world dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that Mnemosyne outperforms existing work regarding strong location privacy and computational costs.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is a promising training paradigm to achieve ubiquitous intelligence for future 6G communication systems. However, it is challenging to apply FL in 6G-enabled edge system since decentralized training consumes considerable energy and mobile devices are mostly battery-powered and resource-constrained. The intensive computation and communication cost of local updates accumulated by hundreds of global rounds bring about the energy bottleneck, which is exacerbated when the data is non identically and independently distributed (non-IID). To address this issue, we propose FedRelay, a generic multi-flow relay learning framework in which local updates are performed relay-by-relay in the training flow via model propagation. We also present a decentralized relay selection protocol that takes advantage of the diversity of cooperative communication networks. Following that, we investigate a FedRelay optimization problem to simultaneously minimize the energy consumption of local updates and alleviate the global non-IIDness. Technically, an approximation algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize computation frequency and transmission power, thus reducing the local training overhead. We further regulate the training topology of each flow by proposing a greedy relay policy that encourages effective information exchange among devices. Experiment results show that, compared to state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms, our learning framework can save up to 5 times the total energy required to achieve a reasonable global test accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Driven by ever-increasing vehicular intelligent computation-intensive and delay-sensitive services, this paper investigates the computing offloading in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted vehicular networks. Due to the limited onboard energy and computational resources of the mobile entities (i.e., the vehicles and the UAV), it is significant to explore the collaborative computation among the vehicles, the UAV, and the terrestrial computing servers for improving energy efficiency (EE) while trading off the service delay. Unlike existing work in the literature that is based on offline settings with a global view, an online distributed mechanism is proposed to cope with the spatial and temporal variations of the networks. Specifically, upon the arriving tasks and the real-time channel conditions, mobile entities adaptively decide about the task offloading and computational resources allocation in parallel. Moreover, the UAV also designs its trajectory with the residual battery capacity taken into account. Theoretical analysis shows that the developed approach can achieve the EE-delay tradeoff as &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$[ {O(1/V),O(V)} ]$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; with &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$V$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; being a control parameter, and can strike a flexible balance between them by tuning &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$V$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; .

  abstract     = {5G networks provide higher flexibility and improved performance compared to previous cellular technologies. This has raised expectations on the possibility to support advanced Vehicle to Everything (V2X) services using the cellular network via Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) and Vehicle-to-Network-to-Vehicle (V2N2V) connections. The possibility to support critical V2X services using 5G V2N2V or V2N connections depends on their end-to-end (E2E) latency. The E2E latency of V2N2V or V2N connections depends on the particular 5G network deployment, dimensioning and configuration, in addition to the network load. To date, few studies have analyzed the capabilities of V2N2V or V2N connections to support critical V2X services, and most of them focus on the 5G radio access network or consider dedicated 5G pilot deployments under controlled conditions. This paper progresses the state-of-the-art by introducing a novel E2E latency model to quantify the latency of 5G V2N and V2N2V communications. The model includes the latency introduced at the radio, transport, core, Internet, peering points and application server (AS) when vehicles are supported by a single mobile network operator (MNO) and when they are supported by multiple MNOs. The model can quantify the latency experienced when the V2X AS is deployed from the edge of the network (using MEC platforms) to the cloud. Using this model, this study estimates the E2E latency of 5G V2N2V connections for a large variety of possible 5G network deployments and configurations. The analysis helps identify which 5G network deployments and configurations are more suitable to meet V2X latency requirements. To this aim, we consider as a case study the cooperative lane change service. The conducted analysis highlights the challenge for centralized network deployments that locate the V2X AS at the cloud to meet the latency requirements of advanced V2X services. Locating the V2X AS closer to the cell edge reduces the latency. However, it requires a higher number of ASs and also a careful dimensioning of the network and its configuration to ensure sufficient network and AS resources are dedicated to serve the V2X traffic.},

However, due to their resource-constrained nature, risky environmental application, and wireless way of communication, drones are not immune from cyberthreats. As a consequence, the security of drones (SUAVs) has recently gained significant attention by the research community. In particular, when it comes to inter-drone communication. Although traditional cryptographic techniques may provide a certain level of security, they actually constitute a heavy burden on SUAVs due to their resource-constrained nature. In the light of enforcing the security of inter-drone communications, this paper proposes a lightweight drone-to-drone authentication protocol, called D2D-MAP, that uses PUF (Physical Unclonable Function) technology. We design the protocol and evaluate its resilience against various attacks. We use resource-constrained hardware to implement the authentication protocol and perform an evaluation of its performance. We show that the protocol&#39;s security and the obtained performance are prominent compared to state-of-the-art authentication protocols, and that they conform to SUAVs security and performance requirements.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the joint sensor activation and mobile charging vehicle scheduling for wireless rechargeable sensor network (WRSN) based industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is studied. In the proposed framework, an optimal sensor set is selected to collaboratively execute a bundle of heterogeneous industrial tasks (e.g., production-line monitoring), meeting the quality-of-monitoring (QoM) of each individual task, and we consider that a mobile charging vehicle (MCV) is scheduled for recharging sensors before their charging deadlines, i.e., time instants of running out of their batteries, in order to prevent from any potential service interruptions (which is one of the key features of IIoT). Our goal is to jointly optimize the sensor activation and MCV charging scheduling for minimizing the system energy consumption, subject to tasks&#39; QoM requirements, sensor charging deadlines and the energy capacity of the MCV. Unfortunately, solving this problem is nontrivial, because it involves solving two tightly coupled NP-hard optimization problems. To address this issue, we design a novel scheme integrating reinforcement learning and marginal product based approximation algorithms, and prove that it is not only computationally efficient but also theoretically bounded with a guaranteed performance in terms of the approximation ratio. Simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed scheme and demonstrate its superiority over counterparts.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a relay-based UAV-assisted cooperative communication for emergency applications is proposed for rural and semi-urban scenarios. 3-D deployment of multiple UAVs is resolved by jointly optimizing the height and transmit power of cluster UAVs and the optimal trajectory of relay UAVs is perfected by using the graph theory approach. While the majority of works in literature use UAVs as aerial base stations or as relays, this paper proposes to use UAVs as both relays and aerial base stations. Furthermore, this is one of the few works where UAVs are used as both static base stations (cluster UAVs) and mobile base stations (relay UAVs). The proposed 3-D deployment and trajectory planning algorithm is implemented at the ground base station ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${\text {GBS}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ) and the resultant parameters will be distributed to cluster UAVs either directly or through relay UAVs. A four-step approach is proposed to solve the 2-D location coordinates of cluster UAVs, to find the location of the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${\text {GBS}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , the power-height optimization of cluster UAVs, and to optimize the trajectory of relay UAVs. The number of users served, channel capacity achieved, power saved due to optimal deployment, latency reduced, and power saving by optimal trajectory are some of the performance metrics used to evaluate the proposed algorithms. The simulation results are validated to show that the proposed solutions outperform existing similar approaches.},

  abstract     = {New features brought by 5G New Radio V2X (NR-V2X) support multiple vehicular communication types (unicast, groupcast, and broadcast) to coexist in road scenarios. However, the current standard does not specify the resource scheduling approach for groupcast to support such a new feature, which may severely degrade its packet delivery performance impacted by other communication types. In this paper, we investigate the scheduling and resource allocation approaches for a groupcast-based application, vehicle platooning, under the environment characterizing this new feature. We first analyze two baseline resource allocation approaches, i.e., Semi-persistent Scheduling (SPS) stated in the 3 rd generation partnership project (3GPP) and Random Selection (RS), based on the metric of packet collision probability. Subsequently, considering the issues from baseline approaches, we develop an Improved Random Selection (IRS) scheme to decrease the collision probability. We further propose to employ Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to overcome the impact of inter-vehicle collaboration in the platoon based on local information. A Monte Carlo simulator is then used to verify the analytical models&#39; results. The numerical results show that IRS significantly mitigates the packet collision probability compared with the baselines. Meanwhile, DDPG outperforms IRS in terms of the packet collision probability as well as average scheduled delay and is more robust to the change in the environment.},

  abstract     = {In the radio access network domain, novel applications&#39; requirements and network dynamics claim scalable processing capabilities, decentralized architecture, and on-demand resource allocation. Due to the intrinsic heterogeneous nature of the network resources, a fully context-aware fronthaul management is extremely complex to design. Operators have a high level-of-abstraction of the infrastructure&#39;s resources, which limits their decision-making capabilities. In this paper, a novel radio access network orchestrator is proposed, which jointly combines network function placement and resource allocation techniques in a single optimization framework. Given the infrastructure and users&#39; delay constraints, we formulate a constrained linear maximization problem to determine the optimal timing parameters of the downlink hybrid automatic repeat scheme for each user. At inter-slice layer, our proposed resource allocation method is modelled as a Markov decision process, where the resources&#39; sharing policy is tailored according to the real-time slice traffic load. At the intra-slice level, under mild conditions the radio resources are strategically prioritized, following a game theoretic model. Simulation results show that our method performs the hybrid automatic repeat request response 37%–88% compared to the classical LTE schemes. The dynamic allocation method at the inter-slice level improves the resource&#39;s utilization up to 50% compared to static network slicing. Moreover, at the intra-slice, the under and over resource provisioning has been decreased by 21.35% and 60.08%, respectively, compared to the classical fair resource allocation schemes.},

However, with the increase in user data leakage incidents, the existing task assignment methods are no longer sufficient to meet the privacy requirements of users. In the existing VANET-based spatial crowdsourcing, task assignments are usually performed by a trusted third party based on the real locations of tasks and drivers (task performers), which may lead to the leakage of the users&#39; locations. Furthermore, the drivers usually prefer to query the nearest tasks to them in a geometric range, at this point sending query requests to remote crowdsourcing servers increases unnecessary response delays. To assign tasks securely and efficiently, we propose a privacy-preserving task assignment scheme based on OT and edge computing (PriTAEC), which is the first to apply Oblivious Transfer (OT) and edge computing to preserve the location privacy of VANET-based spatial crowdsourcing. In the scheme, we first utilize Hilbert Curve and Bloom Filter to implement location range queries. Then, we use geohash location encoding and Oblivious Transfer to achieve fine-grained location matching. In particular, we design a task assignment algorithm with an offline-online phase to improve the efficiency of task assignments. Finally, we prove the security of the scheme and evaluate its performance, which shows our scheme is secure and efficient.},

  abstract     = {Deploying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as mobile edge computing (MEC) servers has been attracting significant attention, since the UAVs&#39; inherent maneuverability and mobility can further reduce the distance between the users and computational functionalities. In the UAV-assisted MEC systems, the caching and offloading decision optimization, subject to the computation and energy constraints of the UAVs, is one of the key design issues. Against this backdrop, in this paper, we propose a novel cloud-edge framework to facilitate MEC in the UAV networks. Specifically, in our framework, the edge UAVs (EUAVs), together with the cloud, provide caching and computing services for the terrestrial users. In order to minimize the weighted sum cost of latency and energy consumption, we jointly optimize the caching and offloading decisions, the EUAV deployment, the radio and computation resource allocation, while simultaneously satisfying the UAVs&#39; cache and computation capacity constraints, as well as the users&#39; latency and energy consumption constraints. To solve this NP-hard problem, we propose a sequential convex programming (SCP) and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) based deep Q-learning (SS-DQN) algorithm. The proposed algorithm allows the system to adaptively adjust caching and offloading decisions with the EUAV deployment scheme and the resource allocation scheme obtained by SCP and SQP algorithms, respectively. Simulation results verify the superiority of our proposed algorithm compared to two benchmark schemes, and demonstrate how the combination of DRL and convex optimization can improve the system performance significantly.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) technology can reduce the computational burden of Internet of Things (IoT) devices by offloading computationally intensive tasks to physically proximate edge servers. The combination of millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique has draw significant attention for its high spectral efficiency. This paper merges the computation offloading and mmWave massive MIMO-NOMA communication to seek energy efficient performance for IoT devices in MEC network. First, we propose an IoT device clustering algorithm to schedule all IoT devices into limited beams. Following this, we minimize the total energy consumption of computing and offloading in the NOMA-MEC network by jointly optimizing hybrid beamforming, offloading task assignment (OTA) ratio and power allocation. Then, the non-convex joint optimization problem is solved by proposing a suboptimal solution with two stages. In the first stage, a cyclic block-coordinate update algorithm is proposed for analog beamforming design, and then the digital beamforming vectors are obtained by zero-forcing method. In the second stage, an alternating minimization algorithm is proposed to optimize the OTA ratio and power allocation.

  abstract     = {Deep learning models for scheduling of potentially-interfering communication pairs, in device-to-device (D2D) settings, require large training samples in the order of hundreds to thousands. Some of the dynamic networks, such as vehicular networks, cannot tolerate the waiting time associated with gathering a large number of training samples. Spatio-temporal correlation among communication pairs in such networks can be utilized to reduce the learning phase. In this paper, we propose a Riemannian-geometric recurrent neural network (R-RNN) method based on statistical recurrent unit (SRU) for wireless link scheduling. First, we represent local graphs around each D2D pair in any finite time frame as a sequence of points on Riemannian manifold thanks to representing its topology as a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix. We compute the Riemannian metric, i.e., Stein metric, which are suitable measures of time-dependence among D2D pairs. Then we use the Stein metric in the proposed R-RNN method to forecast the link scheduling decisions for a finite number of successive time slots ahead. Simulation results reveal that the proposed method achieves promising performance against the state-of-the-arts with only 45 training samples.},

  abstract     = {Tunnel construction is a dynamic excavation process that requires a variety of construction machinery and workers to cooperate according to standard procedures. However, due to insufficient information sharing and inefficient construction situation awareness, the operation efficiency cannot be largely enhanced, and the safety of workers cannot be guaranteed. To deal with the problem, it is imperative to establish a wireless communication system for construction machinery and workers. In this paper, we propose a wireless communication architecture for tunnel construction to carry multiple services including video, voice and sensor data with different quality-of-service (QoS) provision. A resource block (RB) allocation and power control scheme is developed for uplink transmission, where the long-term energy consumption is minimized and the transmission performance is optimized. As a discrete time-constrained stochastic optimization problem, it can be modeled as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). Furthermore, the dueling deep Q-network (Dueling-DQN) is utilized to obtain the scheduling policy based on the wireless fading characteristics of tunnels and network queues state. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves better performance in a variety number of user equipment (UE) scenarios. The scheme gives priority to VoIP and sensor services in the limited bandwidth, which can provide efficient information sharing for tunnel construction.},

  abstract     = {Spectrum congestion has motivated the recent introduction of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems where radar and communications functionalities co-exist and share the same spectrum. This is accompanied by extensive research in the area of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), thanks to their ability to improve the ISAC systems. In this paper, the physical layer security of a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) ISAC system is investigated when the system is subject to eavesdropping by a malicious unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In particular, we propose using an active RIS to maximize the achievable secrecy rate of the system through jointly designing the radar receive beamformers, the active RIS reflection coefficients matrix and the transmit beamformers at the dual-function base station of the ISAC system. This is done while taking into account a minimum radar detection signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and total system power budget constraints. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is tackled by exploiting fractional programming (FP) and majorization-minimization (MM) techniques to achieve a solution. Our numerical results show the superiority of active RIS to achieve the goal when compared with passive RIS or with an ISAC without an RIS. Results also show that passive RIS could still be a viable solution to achieve this goal but at the expense of a much larger needed size especially when lower power budgets are available.},

The traditional message passing (MP) scheme is to detect message symbols individually. Due to a large number of loop nesting calculations in the process of MP symbol detection, the overall calculation time of the detection is relatively long, and its efficiency is lower. In the PMP scheme, all symbols are detected synchronously. This scheme optimizes the structure of the symbol detection algorithm, and can significantly shorten the detection time. A non-sparse channel coefficient matrix representation is revealed by us to achieve parallel detection. We derive the expression for the PMP algorithm, and then simulate the algorithm by two different mapping methods. Furthermore, we explore the symbol detection time required by the PMP algorithm in continuous multi-frame data and single-frame data transmission modes. The data shows that the performance of the PMP algorithm is more prominent when multiple data frames are transmitted continuously.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates secure computation offloading in device-collaborative mobile edge computing (MEC) networks, where mobile users (MUs) can process a part of their tasks locally and offload the other part to the MEC server or other idle paired MUs. All the transmission links are exposed to a potential eavesdropper. To prevent information leakage, artificial noise (AN) is employed and the secrecy capacity is considered. For such a system, we formulate a weighted latency-energy-aware cost minimization problem by jointly optimizing the subchannel allocation, the offloading proportions, the MUs&#39; transmit powers, the MUs&#39; and the MEC server&#39;s CPU frequencies, and the AN power while guaranteeing the secrecy capacities of all transmission links. Since the variables are multi-dimensional and coupled, the formulated problem is challenging to solve with the traditional optimization method. We first propose a swap-matching-based algorithm to achieve the optimal subchannel allocation. We then propose a two-layer asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm to optimize the rest of the resource variables. Specifically, in the inner layer, by utilizing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, we derive the optimal CPU frequency with semi-closed-form expressions. In the outer layer, we propose an A3C-based algorithm to achieve near-optimal solutions with fast convergence speed based on the obtained optimal CPU frequency. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can decrease the latency-energy-aware cost compared with other learning-based algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Given the explosive growth of wireless devices ranging from the 2D ground to the 3D space, the first task preceding any form of dynamic spectrum management for the smart city infrastructures is the sensing of heterogeneous spectrum situation in wireless environments. However, challenge arises when increasing wide bandwidth and enormous geographic space meet power-limited CR receivers with constrained hardware capability. In this paper, a 3D compressed wideband spectrum mapping model is established by exploiting the underlying sparse nature of wideband spectrum situation based on compressed sensing, where joint time-frequency-space compression is executed at sub-Nyquist sampling rate. Due to the ineffectiveness of traditional algorithms, a novel two-phase 3D compressed wideband spectrum mapping scheme is proposed which is composed of sampling points optimization and 3D wideband spectrum situation recovery. Therein, quadrature and right-triangular (QR) block pivoting based spatial sampling matrix optimization algorithm considers every frequency priority of each location jointly to select dominant sampling locations. Alternating direction method of multipliers is further applied to iteratively solve the situation recovery. Lastly, in-depth numerical simulations demonstrate the spectrum situation recovery performance, which proves the proposed 3D compressed wideband spectrum mapping scheme greatly reduces the number of measurements, while achieving a high level of wideband spectrum mapping accuracy.},

Due to the correlation of target echo, adaptive clutter cancellation will influence the target steering vector and cause direction of arrival (DOA) estimation bias. To solve this problem, we establish the array signal model where the target signal in the reference channel and surveillance channels is partially correlated and analyze the influence of the adaptive clutter cancellation on the target steering vector. Then, a DOA estimation method suitable for this scenario is proposed to correct the DOA bias.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a new decision method based on a support vector machine for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) to improve the bit error rate (BER) performance of QAM for arbitrary complex impairments when both modeled and unknown impairments exist simultaneously. To do this, we first propose an algorithm for assigning bit decision boundaries corresponding to each quadrant for M -ary QAM, considering the asymmetry of the QAM constellation caused by the impairments. Then, we determine the optimal decision boundaries by learning a linear classification model for each bit decision region from I and Q values of received QAM signals as two-dimensional support vectors. Finally, the decision rules for each bit are presented based on the obtained optimal decision boundaries, and the bit decisions are performed using the decision rules. Based on the above process, we can effectively demodulate QAM signals for arbitrary complex impairments without compensation processes. Through computer simulations, we show the proposed method outperforms conventional model-based compensation schemes in BER performance under the condition of complex impairments.},

The proposed array antenna has the advantages of low cost, low profile, and low manufacturing difficulty. The proposed array antenna uses a split-ring resonator as a radiating element coupled from a microstrip line. The split-ring resonator has the advantage of suppressing cross-polarization due to feed phase errors. To reduce the surface wave through the ground edges and enhance the beamwidth, we added the mushroom-shaped electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structure. Amplitude tapering to reduce the SLL was implemented by adjusting the distance between each element and the microstrip line. The prototype SCSRRA antennas operating at 79 GHz were fabricated, and the characteristics of the wide fan-beam pattern and low SLL were experimentally verified.},

  abstract     = {Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) has been continuously evolving since Release 14 of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for future autonomous vehicles. Apart from automotive safety, 5G NR further bring new capabilities to C-V2X for autonomous driving, such as real-time local update, and coordinated driving. These capabilities rely on the provision of low latency and high reliability from 5G NR. Among them, a basic demand is broadcasting or multicasting environment update messages, such as cooperative perception data, with high reliability and low latency from a Road Side Unit (RSU) or a base station (BS). In other words, broadcasting multiple types of automotive messages with high reliability and low latency is one of the key issues in 5G NR C-V2X. In this work, we consider how to select Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), RSU/BS, Forward Error Correction (FEC) code rate, to maximize the system utility, which is a function of message delivery reliability. We formulate the optimization problem as a nonlinear integer programming problem. Since the optimization problem is NP-hard, we propose an approximation algorithm, referred to as the Hyperbolic Successive Convex Approximation (HSCA) algorithm, which uses the successive convex approximation to find the optimal solution. In our simulations, we compare the performance of HSCA with those of three algorithms respectively, including the baseline algorithm, the heuristic algorithm, and the optimal solution. Our simulation results show that HSCA outperforms the baseline and the heuristic algorithms and is very competitive to the optimal solution.},

In this paper, we investigate how to exploit the inherent interference from strong radar signals to ensure the physical layer security (PLS) for the considered multi-user multi-input single-output (MU-MISO) communication and colocated multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar coexistence system. In particular, with known eavesdroppers&#39; channel state information (CSI), we propose to jointly design the transmit beamformers of communication and radar systems to minimize the maximum eavesdropping signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) on multiple legitimate users, while guaranteeing the communication quality-of-service (QoS) of legitimate transmissions, the requirement of radar detection performance, and the transmit power constraints of both radar and communication systems. When eavesdroppers&#39; CSI is unavailable, we develop a joint artificial noise (AN)-aided transmit beamforming design scheme, which utilizes residual available power to generate AN for disrupting malicious receptions as well as satisfying the requirements of both legitimate transmissions and radar target detection. Extensive simulations verify the advantages of the proposed joint beamforming designs for ISAC systems on secure transmissions and the effectiveness of the developed algorithms.},

To make the best use of NOMA as an enabler for cell-free massive MIMO systems, user pairing should be employed effectively. Random user pairing naturally leads to a non-optimal solution, whereas an exhaustive search approach is unfavorable for practical systems owing to the high complexity. In this study, we propose an optimal user pairing strategy to group users that jointly optimize the minimum downlink rate per user and power allocation at an acceptable cost of complexity. To address this problem, we first relax the binary variables to continuous variables and then develop an iterative algorithm based on the inner approximation method, yielding at least one locally optimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed user pairing algorithm outperforms existing counterparts, such as conventional beamforming, random pairing, far pairing, and close-pairing strategies, while it can be performed dynamically, that is, two arbitrary users satisfying the formulated problem can be paired regardless of geographical distance. Finally, our approach demonstrates that the combination channel estimation-based NOMA-assisted cell-free massive MIMO achieves the best result in terms of the downlink rate per user when associated with the proposed algorithm.},

In this scheme, QR-decomposition-based detection is used to decode user signals of each group under imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). In the uplink, transmitted signals are encoded with the constellation of a symmetric quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), and SIC residual errors are generated from symbol demodulation. The statistics of the SIC errors are derived, with which expressions of approximate SIC-residual-power coefficient and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) are developed. Consequently, the effect of the SIC errors can be explicitly addressed in the precoder design for minimizing the total transmit power subject to users&#39; symbol error probability (SEP) constraints. A suboptimal design algorithm with efficient “logarithmic” golden-section search is developed. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the design criterion and algorithm, and validate the detection error analysis. Unlike the conventional fractional-SIC-error model that suffers from underestimation/overestimation of SIC errors and infeasibility, our SIC error model can provide accurate effect of the SIC errors in the SINR analysis and enable the proposed method to give design solutions to satisfy the SEP constraints.},

Our aim is to minimize the user delay, which is decomposed into three sub-problems, i.e., UAV deployment, hybrid beamforming and power allocation. Firstly, to improve the user rate, we apply K-means to reduce the distance between UAVs and users and propose a user pairing method to maintain the channel gain gap in each pair. Then, for increasing UAV hit probability, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and zero forcing are used for analog beamforming and digital beamforming, respectively. Finally, to further improve the user data rate, the genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to calculate the optimal NOMA power allocation factors.

In this paper, we first explore the structure of difference co-array generated from array motion, and propose a hole-free motion strategy that can fill all the holes in difference co-array of coprime arrays, and resulting increased number of uDOFs as well as array aperture. Secondly, based on the analysis of hole positions, we propose another motion strategy that needs only one step motion of CADiS to generate a difference co-array with no holes in the central part. We find all the qualified steps length of the one-step motion method and provide the closed-form expression of the corresponding achievable number of uDOFs. Finally, the number of uDOF and DOA estimation accuracy of the proposed motion strategies are compared with several state-of-the-art motion methods.

Multiple simultaneous faulty GNSS measurements can result in traditional fault detection and exclusion (FDE) methods finding a consistent but erroneous group of satellites. This paper describes a novel distributed FDE method based on cooperative reliability message (CRM), which is suitable for cooperative positioning system in connected vehicles. The idea is to take into account not only the consistency check on raw GNSS measurements, but also the prior knowledge about the quality of GNSS measurements offered by nearby cooperators so as to improve the ability to exclude multiple GNSS faults. The line-of-sight (LOS) satellites identified by cooperators are stored in CRMs, which will be shared to the host vehicle to generate the candidates for the set of LOS satellites observed locally. Based on the candidates, a bottom-up searching strategy is designed to find the healthy satellites and isolate the faulty ones precisely. Several experiments involving four moving vehicles were conducted in dense urban areas. Results indicate the superiority of CRM-based method in excluding multiple faults over existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Received signal Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation represents a significant problem with multiple applications, ranging from wireless communications to radars. This problem presents significant challenges, mainly given by a large number of closely located transmitters being difficultly separable. Currently available state of the art approaches fail in providing sufficient resolution to separate and recognize the DOA of closely located transmitters, unless using a large number of antennas and hence increasing the deployment and operation costs. In this paper, we present a deep learning framework for DOA estimation under Line-of-Sight scenarios, which able to distinguish a number of closely located sources higher than the number of receivers&#39; antennas. We first propose a formulation that maps the received signal to a higher dimensional space that allows for better identification of signal sources. Secondly, we introduce a Deep Neural Network that learns the mapping from the receiver antenna space to the extended space to avoid relying on specific receiver antenna array structures. Thanks to our approach, we reduce the hardware complexity compared to state of the art solutions and allow reconfigurability of the receiver channels. Via extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art deep learning-based DOA estimation methods, especially in demanding scenarios with low Signal-to-Noise Ratio and limited number of snapshots.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we target at improving the downlink user sum rate in satellite integrated terrestrial network (SITN). Wherein, the densely deployed low earth orbit (LEO) satellites provide backhaul to terrestrial base stations (TBSs) and TBSs serve the ground users (GUs) over different bands. Note that the user sum rate is dependent on the user association and backhaul capacity. Moreover, the backhaul capacity is determined by multi-connectivity feature between the TBSs and LEO satellites. However, the densification and high dynamics of SITN aggravate the inter-satellite interference, which degrades the backhaul capacity. To this end, we propose a joint interference management and user association (JIMUA) scheme, which exploits collaborative computing to enhance the backhaul capacity and satisfy the user demands. The service demands of GUs and dwell duration of LEO satellites can be captured by introducing a collaborative computing coefficient. With this aid, the TBSs can predict the highly dynamic trajectory of dense deployed LEO satellites. Accordingly, the searching space of satellites can be reduced, the interference can be mitigated and backhaul capacity can be improved with high time efficiency. Moreover, the user association is achieved by dividing GUs into different groups, while the required user demands can be satisfied. Considering the dense deployment of LEO satellites, the user sum rate of SITN could be enhanced by JIMUA compared with the benchmark. With the well tuned collaborative computing coefficient, the backhaul capacity can be increased over 12%. Consequently, the user sum rate can be improved over 7%. Moreover, with the increasing user density, the gap between the user sum rate of JIMUA and the optimal solution can be reduced to less than 4%.},

Our objective is to minimize energy consumption for communication and computation at the user terminal and the relay subject to a given task executing delay constraint. To this end, a novel protocol is first proposed to enable the user terminal and the relay to fully utilize the high passive beamforming gain provided by RIS and the high spectral efficiency offered by OFDM and NOMA techniques for task offloading. Then, under the newly proposed protocol, a resource allocation optimization problem is formulated, where RIS reflection coefficients, task offloading and computing time allocation, subcarrier and power allocation, task partition, and CPU frequency of the MEC server are jointly optimized. Because the numerous optimization variables are coupled with each other and integer programming is involved for subcarrier allocation optimization, the formulated problem is a mixed integer programming and highly non-convex problem that is hard to tackle. To address this problem, an efficient algorithm is devised to achieve its solution by employing alternating optimization, layer optimization, big-M formulation and successive convex approximation techniques. Simulation results validate that substantial energy savings can be achieved by employing RIS and OFDM-NOMA techniques in wireless relaying-based MEC systems.},

The algorithms adopted in the existing literatures for user scheduling in MIMO system are greedy algorithm essentially, which needs to repeatedly calculate the achievable data rate (or its low complexity characterization) of each user during the user selection. Due to the large number of IoT terminals, the existing methods will generate huge computational load. In this paper, we propose a multiuser scheduling algorithm for 5G IoT systems based on reinforcement learning. The user terminal&#39;s action-value, which denotes the expectation of user terminal&#39;s achievable data rate, is obtained through Q-learning. We define the Q-value as the upper bound of the confidence interval of the user terminal&#39;s action-value and the proposed algorithm selects users on the basis of the Q-value. The proposed algorithm does not need to try different user combinations to maximize the throughput, and it is unnecessary to repeatedly calculate user&#39;s achievable data rate, so that the computational load is reduced. Simulation and numerical results show that the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is lower than that of existing algorithms. At the same time, the system throughput achieved by this algorithm is not lower than that of greedy algorithms.},

In this paper, an analytical model for SPS is presented, based on which the impacts of beacon rate, range settings and system configuration on access collision probability and delay outage probability are quantified. The analytical model provides important insights and guideline to adapt and optimize protocol parameters including the sensing range, transmit power and resource reservation. The enhanced MAC protocol can maintain high-reliability and low-latency services with a wide range of vehicle density.

Specifically, we first obtain the closed-form expression of the COOP. Then we derive an asymptotic COOP expression at the high transmit power region and minimize the COOP in the single-smart device (SD) scenario. Finally, aiming at ensuring fairness among SDs in the multi-SD scenario, we propose an alternating optimization-based COOP min-max fairness (AOCMMF) algorithm to obtain the suboptimal solution of the nonconvex min-max problem. The simulation results verify that our closed-form and asymptotic expressions depict the COOP correctly. The proposed AOCMMF scheme can reduce the maximum COOP by 42.23% compared with the equal edge computing resource scheme, and the min-max fairness among SDs is realized.},

A simplified analysis in the high-SNR scenario along with an asymptotic analysis is also provided.

Such problems include minimum-weighted and weighted-sum rate maximization, total power minimization for a target rate, minimum-weighted energy efficiency (EE) and global EE maximization. The framework may be applied to any interference-limited system with hardware impairments. For the sake of illustration, we consider a multicell MIMO RIS-assisted broadcast channel (BC) in which the base stations (BSs) and/or the users may suffer from IQI. Since IQI generates improper noise, we consider improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) as an interference-management technique that can additionally compensate for IQI. We show that RS when combined with IGS can substantially improve the spectral and energy efficiency of overloaded networks (i.e., when the number of users per cell is larger than the number of transmit/receive antennas).},

  abstract     = {Ultra reliable low latency communications (uRLLC) is a new service category for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. The security and confidentiality of information transmission faces more challenges in the context of uRLLC because of the openness nature of wireless medium. By using the inherent characteristics of wireless medium, physical layer security (PLS) can be used as a promising solution to ensure the security of wireless communications. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications is frequently characterized by line-of-sight (LoS) and dynamic propagation conditions. Since UAV can provide a strong line-of-sight link with strong reliability and speed, it is widely used in various wireless communication scenarios. Much previous work ignored the role of UAVs in PLS research in uRLLC. In this paper, we consider the line-of-sight/non-line-of-sight (NLoS) path-loss model for UAV-aided air-to-ground (A2G) wireless channel. Furthermore, massive MIMO technology is adopted in the deployment of transmitter-receiver pairs. In terms of performance measurement, we introduce the network insurance framework for network users. Under this framework, this paper deduces the closed expressions of connection outage probability (COP) and secrecy outage probability (SOP) for the above UAV-enabled network scenarios. Finally, the secrecy guard zone is proposed to further protect the confidentiality. Simulations validate our derived theoretical results, and indicate that communication security increases with the radius of the guard zone, while eavesdropper density has a detrimental effect.},

Furthermore, a detailed frame structure design is described, and theoretical performance analysis models of the proposed scheme in different traffic scenarios are investigated. Finally, simulations and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can reduce packet collisions and increase the packet delivery ratio compared to the conventional distributed scheme, and outperforms some existing schemes in cluster stability.},

Since peak power cannot be satisfied only by generator, hybrid energy storage system (HESS) should be well sized to match their energetic performances versus instantaneous power requirement and improve reliability of electrical power system. To deal with these challenges, a sizing optimization for HESS with considering energy management strategy (EMS) based on virtual-droop control in aircraft is proposed in this paper. By analyzing the spectrum characteristics of HPPL profile, splitting frequency between different types of energy storage devices is specially analyzed and designed to give full play to HESS. HESS weight, loss and parameters in EMS are taken into account in this multi-objective optimization based on Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms II (NSGA-II). Series of Pareto fronts can be obtained through the optimization process, and the most suitable solutions of different HESS combinations are selected by a decision-making means which combines subjective and objective weighting methods. Finally, optimization results of four different combinations are compared. Simulation results are obtained in MATLAB/Simulink environment to prove the rationality and applicability of the optimal sizing tool. The research has resulted in a solution of HESS and EMS optimization for HPPL used in aircraft.},

  abstract     = {With the development of the sixth-generation (6G) network, virtualization remains critical. The key to future virtualization lies in the service provisioning capability of the network and the service requirements of end users, which will lead to virtualization of the network and end users. Therefore, this paper proposes a holistic network virtualization architecture that integrates digital twin (DT) and network slicing to achieve the network management of service-centric and user-centric. With the explosive growth of latency-sensitive and computing-intensive in-vehicle applications, limited in-vehicle computing resources are difficult to meet diverse network requirements, and vehicle edge computing (VEC) has become a potential solution. However, computation offloading may face the dilemma of excessive upload traffic and unbearable upload time. Therefore, in order to minimize the overall response time (ORT) of the system, this paper proposes a new environment aware offloading mechanism (EAOM) based on the integrated sensing and communication system (ISAC) to solve the joint optimization problem of task scheduling and resource allocation. Considering the mobility of vehicles and the time-varying of environment, the optimization problem is modeled as a Markov decision process, and an improved algorithm combining Shapley-Q value and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is used to solve it. The simulation results indicate the effectiveness and superiority of the scheme proposed in our work.},

  abstract     = {Authentication for controller area network (CAN) buses in an intra-vehicular network involving electronic control units (ECUs) is a challenging factor. The Society of Automotive Engineers standard (SAE J1939) incorporating the ISO 11898-1 specification for the data link and physical layers of the standard CAN and CAN-flexible data rate (CAN-FD) handles communication among ECUs. The SAE J1939 is vulnerable to replay, masquerading and machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. To prevent such attacks, there exist protocol suites for resource-constrained and resource-unconstrained nodes proposed in the literature which are not formally analysed. We formally analyse one of the comprehensive protocol suites using the state-of-the-art Tamarin automated validation tool. To mitigate the identified attacks, we propose two new authentication protocols. At first, we propose one pass authentication protocol for computationally restricted nodes. For nodes that are not restricted computationally, we present a certificateless signature-based authentication protocol. Additionally, we present a new certificateless key insulated manageable signature (CL-KIMS) scheme for signature-based authentication protocol. CL-KIMS ensures key insulation and random access key update properties, and assures self-healing property. The security of the proposed protocol suite and signature scheme is formally analysed using the random oracle model (ROM). Especially, CL-KIMS scheme is provably secure in the ROM against Type-I and Type-II adversaries. A detailed performance comparison and simulation study show that the proposed protocol suite has lesser communication overhead and ensures robust security as compared to the existing protocol suites.},

The proposed approach is based on the conjunction of a Higher-Order Sliding Mode (HOSM) observer with two Generalized Super-Twisting (GST) observer-based identification algorithms. The HOSM observer provides an exact estimation of SOC, while the two identification algorithms guarantee the finite time estimation of the battery capacity and the battery inner resistance. Thanks to the relationship between the battery capacity and the SOH, an accurate estimation of this latter is obtained. The proposed approach has two main advantages: it ensures SOC estimation using only one observer and estimates the battery parameters without requiring any assumption on the system states. Experimental results using the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test procedures (WLTP) are used to illustrate the high efficiency of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {With the development of vehicle navigation, autonomous driving and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), increasing spoofing attacks of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have emerged towards vehicles, which can mislead users by false position, velocity and time (PVT) solutions, resulting in serious consequences. Spoofer localization is a necessary step to fundamentally address the spoofing attacks. Most of the conventional spoofer localization methods are based on time of arrival (TOA) or time difference of arrival (TDOA), where time synchronization is indispensable and therefore is hard to apply to the existing vehicles equipped with independent commercial receivers. To cope with this problem, in this paper we develop a flexible method for vehicles to locate a stationary spoofer based on Doppler and clock drift double difference (DCDD). DCDD is calculated using Doppler measurements and clock drift solutions of one vehicular receiver and another reference receiver. Generally, Doppler frequency of GNSS signals changes slowly with time, which releases the restriction for high-precision time synchronization. DCDD represents the Doppler frequency caused by the vehicle motion, from which the spoofer position can be estimated. Utilizing DCDD, an iterative weighted least squares (WLS) algorithm is used to solve the spoofer position, and a closed-form initial value is given to improve the convergence rate. We evaluate the localization performance by the derived Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) in the presence of vehicle position and velocity errors. Simulations and field vehicle experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility and effective of the proposed method.},

First, clustering analysis is applied to the operation data of drivers for learning the subjective assessment of risky scenes of different drivers and generating the corresponding risk label for each scene. Second, the graph representation model (GRM) is adopted to unify and construct the features of dynamic vehicles, inter-vehicle interactions, and static traffic markings in real driving scenes into graphs. The driver-specific risk label provides ground truth to capture the risk evaluation criteria of different drivers. In addition, the graph model represents multiple features of the driving scenes. Therefore, the proposed framework can learn the risk-evaluating pattern of driving scenes of different drivers and establish driver-specific risk identifiers. Last, the performance of the proposed framework is evaluated via experiments conducted using real-world urban driving datasets collected by multiple drivers. The results show that the risks and their levels in real driving environments can be accurately recognized by the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Modern autonomous emergency braking (AEB) system is a typical safety-critical cyber-physical system (CPS) synthesizing the vehicular communications, control, and proception technologies. However, the control performance of braking can be easily deteriorated by the road adhesion saturation in physical environment and the multi-hop communication network-induced delays in cyber systems. Motivated by this, a new multi-hop loop delay analysis method and its associated upper-bound expression is proposed to scrutinize the system uncertainties, within the scope of CPS. Following this endeavor, a hierarchical cyber-physical control scheme for the AEB system is proposed to mitigate the adverse effects of road adhesion saturation and multi-hop communication network-induced delays. At the upper layer, a μ-adaptive time-to-collision (TTC) planning strategy is adopted to generate the desired acceleration for collision risk avoidance considering the road adhesion saturation.

First, a vehicle state prediction module is established to predict vehicle yaw and roll stability and to generate three reference vehicle states, i.e., the desired roll angle, yaw rate and longitudinal velocity. Then, a decentralized event-triggered discrete sliding mode control scheme is developed to track these reference states by coordinating the X-by-wire subsystems based on their respective effective working areas. For yaw rate control, dynamic torque regulation factors are introduced to prevent wheel slip and lock-up based on real-time slip ratio feedback. Under longitudinal driving conditions, a robust sliding mode control and a hybrid control-based method are used under emergency acceleration or braking conditions. The hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests under the slalom, double lane change and fish hook tests show that the proposed chassis coordinated control scheme can comprehensively improve vehicle ride comfort, handling performance, longitudinal and lateral stability, and rollover prevention ability.},

For such power conversion, multilevel rectifiers (MLRs) offer advantages compared to a two-level rectifier, such as reducing voltage ratings of power switches and yielding high-quality input voltage waveform. In MLRs, one of the most challenging aspects is balancing the capacitors’ voltages. This article proposes a self-balancing five-level PFC rectifier with the possibility of single/multiple outputs. The proposed rectifier performs buck operation and offers a wide output voltage regulation, which is suitable for EV battery charging. The five-level operation of proposed buck rectifier with continuous conduction mode (CCM) leads to elimination of the inductive filter on the DC side and the capacitive filter on the AC side.

The experiment proves that the priority experience replay speeds up the convergence of the algorithm, and the scalability of the algorithm is verified within 10-180 UAVs.

  abstract     = {Vehicle re-identification (ReID) technology has played a more and more important role in Intelligent Transport System (ITS), which aims at searching the same query vehicle identity from a large amount of gallery datasets under different non-overlapping camera views. Current related researches mainly focus on discriminative feature mining of vehicle images and train the model in a fully supervised manner which highly relies on the manual annotations of training data. However, it is labor-consuming and impractical to generate the annotation for each sample image in real-word applications especially for those large-scale transport systems with tons of surveillance data. To this point, we propose in this paper a multi-level progressive learning (MLPL) method for unsupervised vehicle ReID, which gives a good performance by only utilizing the unlabeled target domain images. We firstly introduce a multi-branch architecture to explore the vehicle representations in different level, which consists of one branch for global feature and two branches for local feature learning. A density-based clustering method is employed to generate pseudo labels. Combining with the unique model, we propose a novel re-clustering method to better mine the labels with high reliability. Then a dynamic progressive contrast learning (DPCL) strategy is carefully designed to train the network based on these clustered labels. DPCL could dynamically adjust the training process to maximally strengthen the multi-level feature learning. Moreover, we further propose a self-adaptive loss balance method to automatically compute the weights of different losses during each training iteration. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on several mainstream evaluation datasets, including VeRi776, VehicleID and CityFlowV2-ReID. Compared to other existed unsupervised methods, our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {Obstacle avoidance problem for the autonomous vehicle has received more and more attention these years, especially for the autonomous heavy vehicle, which has the high gravity center, large carrying capacity and promising commercial prospect. However, the vehicle dynamic properties have been rarely considered for path planning, which is a crucial factor for driving safety. An integrated collision avoidance framework that consists of a new path planner and a tracking controller considering multiple dynamic constraints is proposed for an autonomous multi-axis distributed vehicle. In the upper level, a new optimal path generator based on the B-splines is designed for safety and stability purposes, and the collision avoidance path is optimized considering multiple dynamic constraints, including the tire nonlinear dynamic, lateral stability limits and the anti-slip constraints. Meanwhile, a safety assessment evaluator according to the time to collision calculation is designed for risk level recognition and path planning weight determination. In the lower level, a path tracking controller based on the nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is designed to improve the control accuracy, and a high-fidelity nonlinear dynamic predictive vehicle model with 16 degrees of freedom is established to depict the vehicle dynamic properties comprehensively. To solve the nonlinear optimization problem and get the optimal control steering angle output, an adaptive weight adjustment strategy and a varying predictive duration method are formulated. The optimization constraints related to steering actuator ability, plane stability limits, rollover prevention thresholds and tire adhesion requirements are constructed and converted as the bounds of the vehicle dynamic states. To verify the proposed framework, the simulation and HIL test platform are built and different driving scenarios are validated. The test results show the satisfactory performance of path planning and path tracking considering the dynamic constraints for safety and stability.},

  abstract     = {The growing number of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications brings with it, a rising number of privacy concerns. The high availability of commercial drones is also increasing the need for strict regulations. As far away as we are from establishing such protocols to ensure that the most basic human right to privacy is not exploited, we are further away from enforcing them. Thus, there is a need for a generalised drone detection system to detect different drones operating in a broad range of Radio Frequencies (RF). Previous attempts to tackle this problem have been made using audio, video, radar, WiFi and RF signals. While all these methods have their own benefits and drawbacks, RF has various characteristics which make them suitable for practical applications on a large scale. In this paper, we propose a novel technique called the ConvLGBM model which combines the feature extraction capability of a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with the high classification accuracy of the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). We develop and evaluate the classifications done by an optimal CNN and the LightGBM model and then compare both models with the ConvLGBM.},

This paper explains the development of a scaled roller-rig test bench which emulates the rail and the wheel of a train. The final purpose of the developed roller-rig test bench is twofold: to study the theory/behaviour of existing anti-slip strategies and to test new designs, before their implementation in the real system. Estimation of adhesion coefficient using a disturbance observer method is explained and tested under various conditions. Anti-slip control is implemented in wheel drive using a direct method by adding a slip speed controller. The tests are conducted using both fixed roller speed and variable roller speed, i.e. dynamic roller. In this second case, train inertia emulation will be key. Two methods are proposed to emulate train inertia, being this the main contribution of this paper. Both methods are verified in simulation first, and further confirmed experimentally in the test bench.},

  abstract     = {Urban autonomous driving is a difficult task because of its complex road scenarios and the interaction between multiple vehicles. Autonomous vehicles need to balance multiple objectives in these complex scenarios, e.g., safety and speed. Traditional reinforcement learning methods deal with the multi-objective problem by optimizing agents with a single objective reward. However, these methods are sensitive to the reward scale and require huge experiments to design reward weights. In this paper, we propose the Lexicographical Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (LPPO), which can express people&#39;s preference relationship through the lexicographical ordering between objectives. The proposed method has two main advantages. On the one hand, LPPO has a smaller parameter adjustment space, which makes it easy to find the optimal solution that satisfies the actual problem preference. On the other hand, the proposed method is less affected by the reward scale and easy to deploy in various driving scenarios. We evaluate our algorithm in two driving simulation environments, and the results show that the proposed method has better performance in urban driving tasks than previous reinforcement learning algorithms. In addition, we illustrate that the proposed method has better stability even if the reward scale changes.},

Stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) strategy is employed at the high-level, the performance of which highly depends on the prediction accuracy of future driving information. To establish a position-dependent stochastic velocity predictor using limited amount of historical data, two improved approaches are developed: 1) Predictor using multiple features; 2) Predictor combining data and model.

Firstly, a new reward function and update rule of the Q-Learning algorithm, considering the influence of obstacle crossing parameters and modification of path energy consumption, is presented to ensure the path shortening and energy consumption reduction. Secondly, the future energy consumption is introduced into the modification of path energy consumption. It evaluates the potential energy consumption between each state reached by the vehicle and the target state. The priority sequence of Q table update is provided, which greatly speeds up the convergence speed of the algorithm. Finally, the proposed strategy is verified on different size maps with 0-1m obstacle height. Results show that, in the complex map, the proposed strategy is effective to shorten 7.6m distance compared with the wheeled driving strategy and to reduce energy consumption by 31% compared with the wheel-legged obstacle crossing strategy. It has a faster convergence speed. Compared with the A * -based and Dijkstra-based strategies, their planning effect is approximately the same, but the energy consumption using the proposed strategy can be reduced by 3.5%.},

  abstract     = {The automotive industry is facing an unprecedented technological transformation towards fully autonomous vehicles. Optimists predict that, by 2030, cars will be sufficiently reliable, affordable, and common to displace most current human driving tasks. To cope with these trends, autonomous vehicles require reliable perception systems to hear and see all the surroundings, being light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors a key instrument for recreating a 3D visualization of the world. However, for a reliable operation, such systems require LiDAR sensors to provide high-resolution 3D representations of the car&#39;s vicinity, which results in millions of data points to be processed in real-time. With this article we propose the ALFA-Pi, a data packet decoder and reconstruction system fully deployed on an embedded reconfigurable hardware platform. By resorting to field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology, ALFA-Pi is able to interface different LiDAR sensors at the same time, while providing custom representation outputs to high-level perception systems. By accelerating the LiDAR interface, the proposed system outperforms current software-only approaches, achieving lower latency in the data acquisition and data decoding tasks while reaching high performance ratios.},

A novel Integral Barrier Lyapunov Function (IBLF) is applied for the first time to solve the control problem of the UAV with the asymmetric time-varying full state constraints, which reduces the conservativeness of the conventional IBLF-based method. Furthermore, a continuous switching function is introduced to solve the singularity problem which typically appears in the fixed-time control methods when tracking errors approach to zero. It is rigorously proved that all the states are forced in the asymmetric time-varying bounds and the tracking errors of velocity and attitude converge to a residual set around origin within fixed time.

The study leverages high-fidelity experimental data collected over three standard drive cycles, UDDS, HWY and US06, intended to simulate a wide range of operating conditions. A method is developed to estimate the measurement uncertainties in fuel consumption for a test cycle, which occur due to the accumulation of measurement uncertainties propagated through the system. The uncertainty determination model uses statistical analysis and standard propagation techniques to evaluate and combine the uncertainties introduced from various sources (including the vehicle, chassis dynamometer, driver, and instrumentation). The analysis also examines three different experimental methods for determining the fuel consumption: 1) carbon mass balance, 2) volumetric fuel scale and 3) gravimetric fuel scale, and takes into consideration the properties of the instrumentation used. The results show that the most significant influence on the determination of the emissions comes from the concentration measurement, and similarly the biggest impact on the total fuel consumption uncertainty comes from the uncertainty in the determination of the carbon dioxide mass, due to the large presence of this pollutant in the overall emissions. It was found that the fuel consumption uncertainties are in the range of ±1-2% for all three methods analyzed, with the lowest values being obtained for measurements performed using the gravimetric method for all three drive cycles considered.},

However, the widely deployment of millimeter automotive radars may cause serious mutual interference among vehicles, thus degrading radar ranging performance severely. In this article, we analyze the mutual interference among multiple Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars. On one hand, we model the interference precisely by employing Matern Hard-Core Process (MHCP) model to characterize the distribution of vehicle nodes in practical bidirectional two-lane and multi-lane scenarios. Besides, the interference is analyzed in terms of the channel fading, the directional antenna pattern and the fluctuation of the target Radar Cross-Section (RCS) in two-lane and multi-lane scenarios. Besides, we analyze the reflected interference in detail. On the other hand, we evaluate the interference mitigation performance of the Random Frequency Division Multiplexing (RFDM) and Frequency Hopping (FH) approaches in terms of the probability of false detection and miss detection, effective detectable density and maximum number of interference-free radar. Finally, a novel AFH-PM mitigation approach is proposed to further improve the interference mitigation performance, which combines the adaptive FH technology with the binary phase modulation. Simulation results verify the proposed framework for interference analysis by employing Monte Carlo method, and the performance improvement of RFDM, FH and AFH-PM is 6.7 dB, 7.6 dB and 8.2 dB, respectively.},

This is realized by combining reasonable decision making based on driving primitives transition and efficient motion control under critical driving conditions. For decision making, the driving primitives including braking, lane changing, and accelerating are generalized to perform a complete emergency avoidance maneuver through the Minimum Safety Spacing analysis, which is numerically executed as a mapping function of the host vehicle&#39;s speed and the road adhesion coefficient. For motion control, the quintic polynomial-based path planning is formulated as solving a minimum lane changing duration problem. Moreover, the Linear Time-Varying Model Predictive Control combined with the Direct Yaw-moment Control is put forward to realize accurate path tracking control for emergency avoidance. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is examined under various scenarios based on comprehensive Hardware-in-Loop tests.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of the 5G network and the promising of 6G network, vehicles can report a large amount of real-time traffic information to Road-Side Units (RSUs). However, due to the large communication cost, limited computing resources, and privacy leakage risks, centralized data processing by RSUs is not efficient and not secure. Thereby, federated learning is introduced to enable vehicles to train local models and send the model parameters to the RSUs, without the need for revealing their personal data. Nevertheless, without an efficient incentive mechanism, the vehicles, as data owners, may be unwilling to join the federated learning task. In this paper, we adopt contract theory to design an incentive mechanism with asymmetric information and continuum of types for interaction between the RSU and vehicles. The designed mechanism satisfies the incentive compatibility, individual rationality and also maximizes the RSU&#39;s profit. The technical challenge is to solve a non-quadratic functional optimization in continuous space with coupling constraints among the vehicles. To address this challenge, we propose two iterative algorithms to find the RSU&#39;s optimal strategies as the functions of vehicles&#39; types. In the first algorithm, a combination of the calculus of variation and dual decomposition methods is utilized to achieve an analytical solution for the optimal strategy of RSU, while in the second one, a combination of approximate dynamic programming and neural networks is used to estimate the optimal strategy of RSU.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle platooning systems (VPSs) can significantly not only increase traffic capacity but also benefit vehicle safety by exchanging vehicle information over vehicular networks. Vehicular networked systems (VNSs), however, are often subject to the denial of service (DoS) jamming attacks and interference, which inevitably compromises the vehicle safety. This paper focuses on resilient event-triggered control (ETC) for VNSs under DoS jamming attacks. Firstly, VNSs under DoS jamming attacks are modeled as Markovian jump systems. Secondly, a novel dynamic ETC for each vehicle is proposed to reduce interference by reducing triggered times. By using Lyapunov stability theory, then, sufficient conditions of stochastic &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathscr{L}_{2}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; string stability are provided considering time-varying partly known transition probabilities matrix for DoS jamming attacks, meanwhile, the resilient controller design method is given to guarantee the stability and a scheduling algorithm is proposed to adaptively adjust controller during the moving of vehicle platoon, which can match the vulnerable network environment. Finally, a numerical example is used to verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed methods.},

Vehicular communication standards have been supporting railway use cases and T2T communications. It is essential to consider the propagation characteristics of railway environments with dedicated T2T channel models for simulation and testing of vehicular communication standards. In this paper, we propose six tapped delay line (TDL) channel models for T2T communications in Hilly Terrain and Railway Station. The measurement based proposed channel models consider different T2T distances and relative speeds of up to 50 km/h with trains moving in an approaching maneuver. Also, a study about the Doppler-delay behavior in the considered scenarios is presented using the scattering function. The proposed TDL channel models as well as the measured propagation characteristics are used in a 802.11bd simulation framework. Both simulation results, which are based on the TDL channel models or on the measurements, are compared to each other. The results show a very good match between the TDL channel models and the measurement data and indicate a good accuracy of the theoretical derivations and the simulation method.},

  abstract     = {Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication with a low bit error rate depends upon the availability of accurate Channel State Information (CSI) at the base station. The massive MIMO systems can be either deployed using time division duplexing with channel reciprocity assumption or by availing frequency division duplexing, which requires closed-loop feedback for CSI acquisition. The channel reciprocity simplifies transmission in time division duplexing; however, it suffers a bottleneck due to pilot contamination, whereas transmission in frequency division duplexing is challenged by channel estimation complexity, CSI feedback, and overall delay in CSI transfer. This paper proposes a simplified parametric channel model, its deep neural network aided estimation along with pilot decontamination for time division duplexing and a low rate parametric feedback and improved precoding for frequency division duplexing based massive MIMO systems. This novel framework integrates the massive MIMO parametric estimation and deep learning for improved estimation and precoding. Our proposed model also offers a unified approach for CSI acquisition with a performance bound on channel correlation in fast time-varying conditions. A theoretical model has been presented using Gaussian assumptions and validated by Monte-Carlo simulations. The results show total nullification of pilot contamination and high-performance gains when the proposed technique is employed for estimation.},

Different from conventional massive MIMO BDCMs which assumed the far-field plane wavefront effect, the proposed BDCM considers more realistic spherical wavefront caused by near-field effect. We transform a massive MIMO geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) from the antenna domain to the beam domain through specific algorithms to obtain the novel BDCM. The space-time-frequency correlations of both the GBSM and BDCM are studied, and the correlations for both models at the cluster level are similar. We also compare the quasi-stationary distance (QSD), computational complexity, and channel capacity for both models. Results show that in comparison to the GBSM, the novel BDCM has lower complexity and similar accuracy if the number of beams is sufficiently large. Furthermore, we compare the singular value spreads (SVSs) of both channel models with channel measurements under the same conditions. Both the novel BDCM and GBSM are close to the measurement. Through the above analysis, the novel BDCM is proved to be more convenient for information theory and signal processing researches than the conventional GBSMs.},

Asynchronous FL overcomes the straggler issue in synchronous FL. However, asynchronous FL incurs the staleness problem, which degrades the training performance of FL over wireless networks. To tackle the staleness problem, we develop a staleness compensation algorithm to improve the training performance of FL in terms of convergence and test accuracy. By including the first-order term in Taylor expansion of the gradient function, the proposed algorithm compensates the staleness in asynchronous FL. To further minimize training latency, we model the client selection for asynchronous FL as a multi-armed bandit problem. We develop an online client selection algorithm to minimize training latency without prior knowledge of the channel condition or local computing status. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithms in both test accuracy and training latency.},

Meanwhile, the transmission performance of a terrestrial user in a secondary network is expected to be enhanced without affecting the satellite user. Furthermore, the impact of imperfect channel state information is also reconsidered due to the amplifying effect of active RIS. Accordingly, we focus on minimizing the transmit power at the ground BS while guaranteeing the achievable secrecy rate of the satellite user and the achievable rate of the terrestrial user. Based on the non-convex cooperative beamforming problem, an efficient alternating optimization scheme is developed.

To address this issue, a new RIS architecture, named active RIS, is proposed which can not only reflect but also amplify the incident signals using reflection-type amplifiers embedded in RIS elements. This however may lead to higher energy consumption in practice due to the signal amplification. Motivated by this, we investigate the energy efficiency (EE) in an active RIS-assisted multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) communication system. Joint transmit beamforming and energy-included RIS reflection matrix design algorithm is proposed to maximize EE by using quadratic transform based fractional programming (FP) technique.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the multi-channel access (MCA) problem for vehicular networks in presence of illegal operators and users. Due to the limited spectrum resource, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links need to reuse the frequency spectrum allocated for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links in networks. For high-mobility environments of vehicular networks, the fast-varying channel conditions will inevitably lead to the significant uncertainty of the acquired channel state information (CSI). Hence, the traditional centralized MCA methods, which rely on the CSI, could not be performed in a timely manner. We formulate the MCA of the vehicle users as a distributed optimization problem, by maximizing the sum capacity of V2I links while guaranteeing the reliability of V2V links as well as reducing the cost due to frequency hopping. A Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) framework is introduced to tackle this problem, where each vehicle user, connecting with either a V2I or V2V link, acts as a learning agent to make spectrum access decisions rapidly and locally to meet the latency requirement. In order to adapt to the dynamic environment, we further propose a delayed interaction aided MADDPG algorithm, which enables online training for the distributed MCA problem. Moreover, to guarantee the proposed algorithm to converge stably, we optimize the selecting weights of experience traces and propose a Batch Prioritized Experience Replay (BPER) strategy to ensure that the high priority traces can be learned timely. Compared with baselines, simulation results showcase remarkable performance gain of our proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing shortage of satellite spectrum resources, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme is applied to satellite communication (SatCom) networks, which is regarded as one of the key technologies to improve spectrum efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the joint impact of non-ideal limitations, i.e., channel estimation errors, co-channel interference and imperfect successive interference cancellation on the performance of NOMA-based SatCom networks. To evaluate the performance improvement under practical scenarios, we obtain a closed-form expression for the outage probability (OP) in the presence of non-ideal limitations. To investigate the effect of non-ideal factors at high signal-to-noise ratios, an asymptotic analysis for the OP is also presented. Besides, an optimal power allocation scheme based on the non-ideal limitations is proposed to minimize the OP of the system. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations corroborate the correctness of the presented theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {A swarm of unmanned vehicles can provide fine-grained spatial-temporal information acquisition and monitoring in comparison to a single agent, which is beneficial in terms of environment mapping, terrain exploration, and target hunting. However, the cooperation of single type of unmanned vehicles may be not qualified for fulfilling complex underwater tasks considering the motion constraints. In this paper, a joint design of the unmanned aerial/surface/underwater vehicle (UAV-USV-UUV) network, also referred to as 3U network, is proposed for cooperative underwater target hunting. We first introduce the advantages of this 3U heterogeneous system in multi-task cooperation and portray its system model. Moreover, we propose an energy-oriented target hunting model by jointly optimizing the UAV&#39;s position, the UUV&#39;s trajectory as well as their inter-connectivity. Finally, DQN algorithms are conceived to solve the proposed target hunting problem. Simulation results show the proposed scheme is suitable for underwater target hunting with a high success rate considering a trade-off between the system energy consumption and inter-connectivity.},

  abstract     = {Covert communication is crucial to preventing the warder&#39;s detection of wireless transmission. In general, small transmit power is required to satisfy the covertness requirement, which limits the system performance between the transceivers. To overcome the limitation, a multi-antenna relay is utilized and the coordinated direct and relay transmission (CDRT) is proposed in this paper. Since both the direct link and the relay link impact the system performance, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the covert rate, where the beamforming vectors at the source and the relay are coupled. To address this problem, a semidefinite relaxation based line search method is proposed to obtain the globally optimal beamforming vectors, which balances the direct and the relay link to satisfy the covertness requirements and achieve the maximum covert rate simultaneously. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority and robustness of the proposed CDRT scheme compared with the systems without the direct or the relay link, especially when the warder-related links are highly correlated with the direct or the relay link. Besides, the CDRT scheme also outperforms the cooperative jammer assisted covert system even when the transmission power is high since the covertness requirements can be satisfied by joint beamforming in the CDRT scheme.},

Most existing IRS studies focus on simple cooperative systems which usually have a single frequency band. In realistic non-cooperative multi-band networks, however, the existing IRS designs may be not applicable or have severe performance degradation. Thus, in the complex network environment, it is more rational to consider IRSs as public resources to be dynamically allocated to appropriate users. In this paper, we first introduce the auction theory to tackle the resource management problem for a multi-IRS-assisted non-cooperative network. An efficient auction algorithm framework is introduced to sub-optimally solve this non-convex problem. Simulation result illustrates that the significant performance improvement can be achieved by applying the auction algorithm in the complex multi-IRS-assisted non-cooperative network.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising technology to boost the efficiency of wireless energy transfer (WET) systems. However, for a multiuser WET system, simultaneous multi-beam energy transmission is generally required to achieve the maximum performance, which may not be implemented by using the IRS having only a single set of coefficients. As a result, it remains unknown how to exploit the IRS to approach such a performance upper bound. To answer this question, we aim to maximize the total harvested energy of a multiuser WET system subject to the user fairness constraints and the non-linear energy harvesting model. We first consider the static IRS beamforming scheme, which shows that the optimal IRS reflection matrix obtained by applying semidefinite relaxation is indeed of high rank in general as the number of energy receivers (ERs) increases, due to which the resulting rank-one solution by applying Gaussian Randomization may lead to significant loss. To achieve the multi-beam gain, we then propose a general time-division based novel framework by exploiting the IRS&#39;s dynamic passive beamforming. Moreover, it is able to achieve a good balance between the system performance and complexity by controlling the number of IRS shift patterns. Finally, we also propose a time-division multiple access (TDMA) based passive beamforming design for performance comparison. Simulation results demonstrate the necessity of multi-beam transmission and the superiority of the proposed dynamic IRS beamforming scheme over existing schemes.},

This paper aims at minimizing the multi-UAV parallel data collection completion time in a wide area without precise CE location information. Different with the existing works, we propose a coarse multi-UAV trajectory design solution without repeated edges, in which each UAV follows a closed-loop trajectory to reduce the data collection time. To facilitate the UAV control and guarantee the data collection of edge CEs, four flight rules are set up. Then a division unit structure with four stay points is proposed to partition the wide area. We prove that a closed-loop trajectory exists for any area that consists of division units with the proposed structure. In the high signal to noise ratio case, the optimal area partition that minimizes the data collection time is obtained. The closed-loop trajectory for each UAV is constructed to minimize the data collection completion time. Simulation results show that the proposed coarse closed-loop trajectory design method is approaching the lower bound of the data collection completion time with a loss less than 10%.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, ultra-dense relay network (UDRN) has become a hot research topic. Mobile edge computing (MEC) can improve the performance of intelligent interactive applications in terms of time delay and energy consumption. In traditional MEC, MEC server in the base station (BS) is responsible for all the computing in the network. However, the MEC deployed in the BS may lead to huge computation burden on the BS and heavy traffic load through the network. Deploying MEC server in the relays of the network, which helps computing and caching for the users, will lower the burden of the BS, reduce the demand for traffic transmission through the network and improve the quality of service for users. This paper studies the problem of task caching, offloading and stable matching (SM) in UDRNs with MEC deployed in the relays, which is formulated as a multi-variable integer programming problem. To enable task caching and offloading, we propose an improved branch-and-bound algorithm and a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm to obtain the optimal and suboptimal schemes, respectively. Then, according to the principle of minimizing individual costs, the mutual preference lists between the users and relays are established. Based on the mutual preference lists, we propose an improved SM algorithm to obtain the user-relay SM results. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can bring considerable performance gains compared with conventional algorithms.},

A target problem of joint considering task offloading scheduling, resource allocation and time-varying channel in VEC is formulated. The goal is to minimize the delay and energy consumption of tasks to guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS) of VEC. Constraints on the completion time, the energy consumption, and the computing capability are considered for each task. The resulting mixed integer optimization problem is decomposed into a two-layer optimization problem. In the upper layer, we use a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to solve the task offloading scheduling problem. In the lower level, the CPU frequency allocation is determined using the Gradient Descent (GD) method. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can minimize the delay and energy consumption of VEC for different network parameter settings.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) is a wireless network of intelligent and autonomous vehicles and Roadside Units (RSUs), which work together to improve transportation services. On the one hand, this revolutionary mode of transportation optimizes traffic efficiency and reduces congestion and accidents; on the other hand, it raises security and privacy concerns. As a result, keeping the security and privacy aspects of such vital systems should be a top concern, as security and privacy flaws can have devastating implications. In addition, each vehicle&#39;s on-board unit (OBU) has a certain amount of processing and storage power. As a result, in areas with high traffic density, vehicles that need to verify messages have a very high computational overhead. In this article, we propose a conditional privacy-preserving heterogeneous signcryption scheme for IoV utilizing Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) operation. The security robustness of the proposed scheme has been evaluated with the Random Oracle Model (ROM), a formal security evaluation method. In addition, relevant existing schemes are compared to the proposed scheme in terms of computation and communication costs. The findings demonstrate that the proposed scheme is both efficient and secure, validating its viability.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles (EVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) show great potential in modern transportation and communication networks, respectively. However, with growing demands for such technologies, the limited energy infrastructure becomes the bottleneck for their future growth. It might be of high cost and low energy efficiency for all the operators to each have their own dedicated energy infrastructure, such as charging stations. In this paper, we analyze a wireless charging infrastructure sharing strategy in UAV and EV-involved networks. We consider a scenario where UAVs can charge in EV charging stations and pay for the sharing fee. On the EVs&#39; side, sharing infrastructure can earn extra profit but their service quality, such as waiting time, might slightly reduce. On the UAVs&#39; side, if renting EV charging stations can achieve an acceptable system performance, say high coverage probability, while considering the cost, they may not need to build their dedicated charging stations. In this case, we use tools from stochastic geometry to model the locations and propose an optimization problem that captures the aforementioned trade-offs between cost or profit and quality of service. Our numerical results show that sharing infrastructure slightly increases the waiting time of EVs, say within 5 min, but dramatically decreases the waiting time of drones, say more than 50 min, and deploying more charging stations do achieve better performances, but all these better performances are expected to cost more.},

In this paper, a multi-UAV enabled IoT is proposed, where the UAVs as base stations send information to the ground IoT nodes via downlink within the flight time. And a fair energy-efficient resource optimization scheme for the IoT is studied to ensure fair energy consumption of multiple UAVs. The optimization problem seeks to maximize the minimum energy efficiency of each UAV by jointly optimizing communication scheduling, power allocations and trajectories of the UAVs. We decompose the non-convex optimization problem into three sub-optimization problems and solve them by Dlinkelbach method and successive convex approximation (SCA). Then a joint optimization algorithm is put forward to obtain the global optimal solutions by iteratively optimizing the three sub-optimization problems. The simulations results show that the multi-UAV enabled IoT can achieve significant performance improvement, and the energy efficiency between UAVs can achieve relative fairness by the fair resource optimization.},

  abstract     = {Hierarchical edge-cloud systems collaboratively utilize the resources of both the edge server and central cloud, enabling deep neural network (DNN) partition between the edge and cloud to accelerate the inference. However, the limited energy budgets of both the edge server and central cloud restrict them from providing optimal DNN inference services. Moreover, considering the high dynamics in stochastic environments, the long-term system performance should be optimized under long-term energy constraints. How to improve the long-term DNN inference performance in such energy-constrained hierarchical edge-cloud systems is less studied by existing related works. In this paper, we aim to jointly optimize DNN partition and computing resource allocation to minimize the long-term average end-to-end delay of multiple types of deep learning (DL) tasks while guaranteeing the energy consumption of the edge server and central cloud within their energy budgets. Based on the Lyapunov optimization technique and reinforcement learning, we design a novel deep deterministic policy gradient based DNN partition and resource allocation (DDPRA) algorithm to train policy to decide DNN partition dynamically by observing the environment. Moreover, the DDPRA algorithm is embedded with a heuristic computing resource allocation (HCRA) algorithm, which effectively reduces the complexity of policy training by decoupling and optimizing the computing resource allocation separately. We analyze the complexity of our algorithms and conduct extensive simulations. The numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm in comparison with 5 other schemes in multiple scenarios.},

Mobile nodes have been used as relays to connect partitioned networks. However, mobile nodes have the problem of not being able to move or moving slowly when encountering obstacles. In order to tackle this issue, three types of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm modes are proposed, and UAV swarm assisted connectivity enhancement algorithms (UsCE) are designed. A UAV swarm with high degree of freedom and flexibility provides a new way in IoT for solving the above connectivity problem. Our target is to find an optimal solution that minimizes the number of UAVs in the swarm and maximizes the connection time of MISN. We divide the working modes of a UAV swarm into hovering and flying. Firstly, the ground sink nodes are classified by a MISN&#39;s sink node classification algorithm to generate hovering points for the UAV swarm. Secondly, the results are optimized and adjusted by a minimum UAV swarm hovering connection algorithm to obtain an optimal solution under the hovering mode. Finally, we achieve an optimal connectivity when the UAV swarm works in flying mode through the UAV swarm flight connectivity algorithm and compare it with two previously proposed algorithms. Simulation results show that the complexity of the algorithms is low, the connection time of MISN increases significantly, and the number of UAVs is small. An optimal UAV swarm assisted connectivity enhancement scheme for MISN of different scales is derived.},

In this paper, we design and implement an access authentication scheme to simultaneously and efficiently provide anonymity and accountability without relying on any trusted third party by utilizing a permissionless blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin or Ethereum) and Intel SGX. Inspired by the recent progress on Bitcoin techniques such as Colored Coins, we utilize the unmodified Bitcoin blockchain as the powerful platform to manage access credentials without introducing any trusted third party. We leverage SGX-based mixer to allow users to anonymously exchange their access credentials and design the verification path of access credentials to support blacklisting misbehaving access credentials without compromising users&#39; anonymity. By integrating with the anti-double-spending property of the Bitcoin blockchain, our scheme can simultaneously provide users&#39; accountability and anonymity without involving any trusted third party. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme is compatible with the current Bitcoin system or other permissionless blockchains, and is highly effective and practical for public Wi-Fi hotspot access control systems.},

  abstract     = {Due to the limited resources and data privacy issue, last decade witnesses the fast development of Distributed Machine Learning (DML) at network edges. Among all the existing DML paradigms, Federated Learning (FL) would be a promising one, since in FL, each client trains its local model without sharing the raw data with others. A community of clients with the same interest can join together to derive a high-performance model by periodically synchronizing the parameters of their local models under the help of a coordination server. However, FL will encounter the straggler problem at network edges, and hence the synchronization among clients becomes inefficient. It slows down the convergence speed of learning process. To alleviate the straggler problem, we propose a method named Chronos that accelerates FL with training volume tuning in this paper. More specifically, Chronos is a resource aware method that adaptively adjusts the amount of data used by each client for training (i.e., training volume) in each iteration in order to eliminate the synchronization waiting time caused by the heterogeneous and dynamical computing and communication resources. In addition, we theoretically analyze the convergence of Chronos in a non-convex setting and utilize the results for the algorithm design of Chronos in return to guarantee the convergence. Extensive experiments show that compared with the benchmark algorithms (i.e., BSP and SSP), Chronos significantly improves convergence speed by up to 6.4×.},

Unlike conventional methods, this protocol investigates beacon transmission from a perspective of information loss, and adopts different beacon rates for different vehicles. First, we design an information loss factor to quantify the information deviation between the original information generated by a vehicle and the actual information received by its neighbor vehicles. Then, based on the information loss factor, we transform the beacon rate adjustment problem into an information loss minimization problem, which is addressed by a greedy beacon-rate adjustment algorithm. In addition, based on the derived different beacon rates, we design a periodicity-based time-slot selection scheme to allocate idle time slots to different vehicles, in order to alleviate transmission collisions.

  abstract     = {Long-range autonomous valet parking (LAVP) is a current trend, partly due to traffic congestion and parking headache. For large-scale parking demands, reservation is introduced to effectively manage valet parking. However, existing schemes focus on parking request verification and parking check-in, which aren&#39;t applicable to LAVP because they ignore identity legitimacy and communication security in the phase of picking up as well as dropping off passengers. One viable solution is authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol. Generally, due to low entropy of passwords and dictionary attacks, three-factor (i.e. passwords, biometrics, and smart card) AKA is more secure than single- and two-factor AKA. Unfortunately, known attacks and high overheads hinder the application of three-factor AKA in real-world environments. Hence, one of the most tough tasks is to balance security and availability, especially how to address the potential threats introduced by each factor while taking full advantage of three factors. Inspired by the above challenges, we propose a provably secure three-factor AKA protocol for reservation services in LAVP, namely SecLAVP. Specifically, the passenger and the autonomous vehicle ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$AV$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ) complete mutual authentication with the assistance of drop-off/pick-up point ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$DP$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ). After successful authentication, the session key is generated between the passenger, &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$DP$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$AV$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; for secure communication. In the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, we formally prove SecLAVP satisfies session-key security. Then, we apply AVISPA to simulate our proposed protocol, to demonstrate that SecLAVP can resist man-in-the-middle attacks. Additionally, informal security analysis indicates that SecLAVP satisfies our defined 16 design goals concerning security. Finally, we evaluate performance of SecLAVP in terms of communication overheads, computational overheads, and scheduling, to manifest the feasibility.},

  abstract     = {Disruption of the ground communication infrastructure in emergency scenarios makes post-disaster rescue operations very complicate. This paper proposes to use edge intelligence to support rescue operators in managing these emergency scenarios. A set of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), organized as Flying Ad-Hoc network (FANET), autonomously takeoff and land to provide emergency operators with edge computing services. A charging station for batteries is supplied by a renewable-energy generator. The FANET Controller applies model-based Reinforcement Learning to decide how many UAVs have to take off, according to the current edge-computing service requests and the power availability, and a forecast of them. The optimal management policy has to provide the necessary level of edge-computing avoiding wide use of satellite channels in a short-time horizon during low green-energy generation and high service request periods. Results highlight that the optimal policy is an efficient modification of the greedy one, i.e., the policy enabling the takeoff of all the necessary UAVs without being care of challenging events in the future. A deep analysis has revealed that the level of modification depends on the combination of the edge-computing service request and the green power availability.},

However, joint optimization of communication and computation resources becomes a great challenge considering dynamic network environment, large-scale coverage and battery energy backup constraint. Hence, in this paper, we propose a SAG-integrated heterogenous computation offloading architecture for the deep integration of communication and computation resources in order to maximize the sum-rate of all AIoE users. Moreover, we propose a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm with the aid of Lyapunov-based profile to solve the task scheduling and HAP selection. And a convex optimization based communication and computation resource allocation scheme processes the CPU-cycle frequency and transmission power. The battery energy backup is tackled via the linear programming policy. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines in terms of convergence speed, average sum-rate and battery backup level of AIoE users.},

  abstract     = {Various Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices and their compelling applications have witnessed exponential growth over the past few years. Compared to the consumer internet, the industrial IoT often faces tough communication latency boundaries and low packet loss. Recently, time-sensitive networks (TSN) technique has been considered the most promising solution to tackle these issues, providing deterministic communication guarantees for time-sensitive applications. In TSN, to achieve bounded low latency, it introduces the Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF) mechanism to shape and regulate the transmission selection to provide the protected transmission window for time-triggered (TT) flows. Currently, a considerable amount of literature has explored traffic scheduling with the CQF mechanism in TSN. However, these methods ignore the impact of routing policy on scheduling optimization. In this paper, we design two algorithms to tackle the problem of joint routing and scheduling optimization with the CQF mechanism for TSN. We propose a TT flow sorting algorithm (JDPS) to measure the scheduling priority weight of each TT flow, which uses the normalization method to calculate the weight based on the flow&#39;s deadline, period, and size. Then, we propose a joint routing and scheduling optimization with load balance algorithm (JRS-LB) to improve the scheduling success radio and the network resource utilization, which jointly considers the injection time slot offset, scheduling, and routing of TT traffic. The evaluation results mainly focus on the scheduling success ratio, execution time, and resource utilization for the proposed algorithm compared to the Tabu and Naive algorithms. Extensive simulations indicate that the proposed JDPS and JRS-LB algorithms can improve the scheduling success radio compared with the other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that auto insurance companies (ICs) use personalized car insurance (PCI) to continuously track drivers&#39; behavior to determine their auto premiums. However, drivers inevitably have concerns about the transparency of data collection/processing and the potential privacy leakage. In this paper, we propose a new PCI scheme to achieve privacy preservation and transparency with the assistance of a consortium blockchain. Specifically, a blockchain is first established by a group of consortium members, and each IC can deploy insurance contracts on the blockchain to support public verification of data collection/processing and thus fulfill the transparency requirement. Then a verifiable and privacy-preserving driving behavior evaluation protocol is designed by tailoring partially homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proof techniques. Drivers can use the protocol to interact with ICs through the contracts, and ICs can learn drivers&#39; behavior and set corresponding auto premiums by analyzing encrypted driving data. Furthermore, a third-party auditor (TPA) is authorized by drivers and ICs to audit encrypted driving data on the contracts and resist fraud attacks. We model the contract-based auditing as a recursive inspection game where TPA can minimize the number of audits to detect data fraud and penalize malicious drivers according to Nash equilibrium. Therefore, the proposed PCI scheme can guarantee that most of the collected driving data are not biased. Formal simulation-based security analysis is given to prove the security of the proposed scheme, and a proof-of-concept prototype is also developed on an open-source blockchain to demonstrate the feasibility.},

  abstract     = {In Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), vehicular networks are enabling technologies for onboard data services such as traffic safety, user infotainment, etc. Vehicular networks face many challenges when it comes to providing satisfactory quality of service, mainly because of issues that arise from unreliable communication in unfavorable propagation conditions. One prime example is Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication in the presence of big vehicles that present obstacles in the communication path of smaller vehicles, where the signal strength decays drastically due to the big vehicle shadowing. As a result, the communication range is shortened, and the safety message dissemination capability is reduced. In this paper, we analyze the impact of big vehicle shadowing on V2V communications, taking into account Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) networks. A geometric as well as a stochastic approach is employed to analyze the length of shadow regions for conventional cars and big vehicles on the road in different scenarios. This paper analyses the effect of large vehicles shadowing on a V2V communication link as a function of the shadow region length. A beamforming-based signal reception technique is proposed in order to mitigate packet collisions caused by hidden nodes. Considering relaying operation by big vehicles, three relaying schemes are proposed to improve the V2V message dissemination performance. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.},

However, the potential broadcast storm caused by Interest packet flooding and return path failures caused by vehicle mobility can significantly degrade the content delivery performance. Existing forwarding strategies based on outdated position information cannot address these issues well. In this paper, we propose a novel predictive forwarding strategy (PRFS) for V-NDN. In PRFS, long short-term memory (LSTM) is employed to amend the neighbor table (NBT) for preciser neighboring vehicles&#39; positions. In addition, the next-hop forwarder is selected among the neighbors, taking into account the link reliability and the distance along the road (DR) in both directions. Furthermore, a new mechanism is designed to notify the selected next-hop forwarder by embedding the forwarder identity in the Interest packet header, so as to accelerate the forwarding process. Finally, extensive simulations are carried out, and experimental results demonstrate that PRFS can reduce the number of forwarded Interest packets and data packets by 21.29% and 25.75%, respectively, and improve the success ratio of satisfied Interest packets by 35.1% compared to the existing baseline algorithms.},

Because of these benefits, UAV-BSs can easily be deployed at high altitudes to provide more line of sight (LoS) links than GBS. Therefore, users on the ground can obtain more reliable wireless channels. In practice, the mobile nature of the ground user can create uneven user density at different times and spaces. This phenomenon leads to unbalanced user associations among UAV-BSs and may cause frequent UAV-BS overload. We propose a three-dimensional adaptive and fair deployment approach to solve this problem. The proposed approach can jointly optimize the altitude and transmission power of UAV-BS to offload the traffic from overloaded UAV-BSs. The simulation results show that the network performance improves by 37.71% in total capacity, 37.48% in total energy efficiency and 16.12% in the Jain fairness index compared to the straightforward greedy approach.},

To characterize the reward function, we take into account both the routing metric design and the candidate UAV selection optimization. The routing metric jointly captures the achievable rate and the residual energy of UAV. Besides, under the location, arc, and direction constraints, the circular sector is modeled by properly choosing the central angle and the acceptable signal-to-noise ratio for UAV to optimize the candidate UAV selection.

Efficient resource allocation is critical for improving the timeliness of information. This paper investigates how to allocate bandwidth and configure the transmission in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based IoT systems for timely status updating. Specifically, a general resource allocation problem is formulated using age of information (AoI) as the timeliness metric. We first consider a static channel case where we propose a fixed time slot length policy, a fixed blocklength policy, an iterative optimization algorithm, and an approximate optimal policy to address the optimal resource allocation and transmission configuration. Then, we extend the study to quasi-static fading channel cases. In particular, sticking to the transmission rate and spectral efficiency, the four policies designated for static channel case are tailored for the quasi-static fading channel case. We show that the iterative algorithms can improve the timeliness of the system significantly. Besides, the approximate optimal policy achieves an AoI performance competitive with the iterative algorithm, while reduces the computation complexity in both channel cases.},

  abstract     = {With the ever-growing demands of communication quality and rate, the combination of terrestrial networks and space networks is becoming the next recognized solution. The space-ground integrated network (SGIN) is a massive Internet of Things (IoT) network that accommodates large amounts of mobile terminals. The interactivity of information between those terminals will request higher communication rates and lead to more frequent handovers, which will increase the network burden and degrade the user&#39;s experience, especially in ultra-dense Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks. In this article, a modified matching algorithm is proposed to get the optimal association matrix between users and base stations. Based on the results, the sum rate of users and the handover rate are calculated. A modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) method is also proposed to generate the special-shaped beams on the satellites to deal with the complex optimization problems. By combining the MPSO-based beamforming algorithm and the modified matching algorithm, the non-convex sum-rate optimization problem is decomposed into two optimal subproblems, which are solved separately. The simulation results demonstrate that the SGIN significantly outperforms the non-integrated ones in terms of the sum data rate and backhaul capacity. The handover performance under the user mobility model is also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Correlation based detectors are very popular for spectrum sensing. In these detectors, temporal correlation is often employed to discriminate the signals of primary users from noises. However, large channel delay spread can significantly decrease the correlation of neighbouring samples of received signals, inducing severe performance degradation of temporal correlation based detectors. In this work, we show that the power spectral densities of different delayed versions of a primary signal have high correlation, despite unknown delays. Then, by exploiting the correlation of power spectral densities of received signals, we propose a spectral-correlation detector. To facilitate the practical application of the proposed detector, we also derive a theoretical expression for its decision threshold to achieve a given false alarm probability. Furthermore, in order to handle the case of channels with unknown delay profile, we employ the OR rule to combine the temporal- and spectral-correlation detectors, leading to a temporal-spectral-correlation detector. An expression for its decision threshold is also derived. Extensive numerical simulations are provided to verify the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superior performance of the two proposed detectors compared to state-of-the-art temporal correlation based detectors.},

Towards maximizing the communication efficiency, the associations with orbiting SATs and the trajectories of UAVs should be optimized, which is challenging due to the time-varying network topology and a huge number of possible control actions. To overcome the difficulty, we lift this problem to multi-agent deep reinforcement learning with a novel action dimensionality reduction technique. Simulation results corroborate that our proposed SAT-UAV integrated scheme achieves 1.99x higher end-to-end sum throughput compared to a benchmark scheme with fixed ground relays. While improving the throughput, our proposed scheme also aims to reduce the UAV control energy, yielding 2.25x higher energy efficiency than a baseline method only maximizing the throughput. Lastly, thanks to utilizing hybrid FSO/RF links, the proposed scheme achieves up to 62.56x higher peak throughput and 21.09x higher worst-case throughput than the cases utilizing either RF or FSO links, highlighting the importance of co-designing SAT-UAV associations, UAV trajectories, and hybrid FSO/RF links in beyond-5 G NTNs.},

The large coverage area and significant computational capability of HAPS systems enable many areas of utilization in 6G and beyond applications, including Internet of Things (IoT) services, augmented reality, and connected autonomous vehicles. In addition, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a cutting-edge technology that can be utilized to enhance spectral efficiency in HAPS systems. In this paper, we exploit NOMA-based HAPS communications and multiple antennas to meet the connectivity, reliability, and high-data-rate requirements of 6G and beyond applications. We propose a user selection and correlation-based user pairing algorithm for a NOMA-based multi-user HAPS system. Moreover, we investigate the codebook design for HAPS communication and adapt the polar-cap codebook (PCC) to the HAPS channel which shows Rician fading propagation characteristics dominated by the line-of-sight (LOS) component. Performance evaluations show that the proposed user selection algorithm is perfectly suited to the HAPS channel and that the PCC provides a remarkable spectral efficiency.},

Nevertheless, the flexibility of access control and authenticated key management (AKM) has not been properly guaranteed. Particularly, exclusive V2V connections without third-party intervention or remote surveillance are crucial for privacy protection, while the non-repudiation and authenticity properties may be compromised in this case. In the proposed design, the attribute-based secret sharing scheme is adopted so that the flexible authentication mechanism with a dynamic access policy is provided. Moreover, independent V2V connections with anonymity are achieved. The vital vehicular data are autonomously stored in local storage, while the remote trusted authority (TA) maintains its ciphered form simultaneously. Therefore, repudiation on the historical transmissions can be prevented whenever a dispute occurs. The proofs and discussions regarding vital security features are presented, while the performance analysis follows.

  abstract     = {Existing millimeter-wave beamforming network-based multibeam antennas usually suffer from complex configuration and bulky size, which limit their applications on a vehicle. To address these issues, in this paper, a symmetrical series-fed array topology is proposed for eliminating the conventional beamforming network. The topology is constructed by applying two unequal main transmission lines (TLs) to symmetrically feed a linear antenna array in series. To effectively suppress the mutual coupling between two TLs, an antenna element exhibiting co-polarized in-band full-duplex performance is implemented. When the four terminals are excited, respectively, four groups of excitation signals with different phase differences will be delivered to antennas to implement the desired beam steering characteristics. For validation, an antenna array operating at 28 GHz is designed, fabricated, and measured. Thanks to the simplicity of topology, the overall size of the proposed multibeam antenna is only 5.57 λ 2 with a radiation efficiency of 85.6%. Meanwhile, a comparable performance is obtained when compared to a conventional beamforming network-based multibeam antenna. All of these results demonstrate the potential of the proposed topology in miniaturized millimeter-wave vehicular communication.},

State-of-the-art radar and Wi-Fi based human sensing systems utilize high bandwidth and require high computational burden. In this paper, a machine learning (ML) framework is proposed for device-free through-the-wall (TTW) human detection using narrow-band continuous RF signals that are transmitted and captured by low-cost software-defined radio (SDR) modules. To be more realistic the double TTW scenario, where both transmitter and receiver are placed outside the walls of the monitored area, is considered. Three different classes are defined as empty (human-free), moving human, and additionally the static human (only breathing, not moving) which addresses the unconscious or sleeping person. In this framework, the variance of the respiratory rate (RR) estimates of the subject and overall signal variances are used as distinguishing features. RR estimates are obtained using nonlinear least-squares (NLS) approach. It is shown in the experiments conducted with real measurements from different environments that the proposed ML framework achieves over 99% classification accuracy using a Decision Tree (DT) classifier. In addition, it is also shown that the proposed framework achieves over 95% accuracy in a completely different environment where the model is not trained. This indicates that the proposed ML framework can be applied generally without requiring specific re-training for different environments and conditions.},

  abstract     = {Future vehicular wireless applications, such as autonomous and remote driving, will demand High Throughput Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (HT-URLLC) unsupported by current wireless standards. Hybrid network designs that combine Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) and Sub-6 GHz communications were recently proposed to establish HT-URLLC in Vehicle-To-Everything (V2X) networks. To enable such integration, new Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols must be developed. As such, we consider a linear vehicular network, in which vehicles driving closely in the same lane utilize both front and rear directional mmWave antennas to form a Lane Cluster (LC). Data packets, then, propagate forwards and backwards along the LC towards its terminals in a multi-hop fashion. In turn, the LC terminals utilize omnidirectional antennas at Sub-6 GHz frequencies to disseminate the cluster&#39;s packets to nearby LCs, Road Side Units (RSUs), and cellular base stations. To resolve the channel contention between subsequent LC members, we devised a two-timeslot MAC scheme with a schedule alignment mechanism. Additionally, we developed centralized and distributed schedule coordination protocols aligning the schedules of adjacent LCs to mitigate cross-lane interference due to antenna beam misalignment. The proposed protocols were evaluated using VEINS (extension of OMNET++ network simulator) and compared against the CSMA-CA scheme of IEEE 802.11p under different parameters and scenarios. The results show that the proposed linear topology along with the scheduling protocols can potentially achieve HT-URLLC while addressing the mmWave practicality issues.},

This work improves trade-off between the freshness and fidelity of status updates at periodical decision epochs by selecting appropriate transmission time and quantization precision. Specifically, the age of information (AoI) metric is used to assess data freshness, while distortion that consists of both static and dynamic parts is used to characterize the fidelity of status updates. We first formulate a joint AoI and distortion optimization problem. Then, the optimal transmission time and quantization precision are theoretically analyzed. We further minimize the sum of AoI and distortion by using power allocation strategy which selects a proper budget SNR of the wireless channel. Numerical results show that by using the optimized transmission time, quantization precision, associated with transmit power allocation, the overall freshness and fidelity of status updates can be improved remarkably.},

In such a cellular system, the intercell and intracell interferences coexist and limit the link capacity. In this study, a 2-layer interference coordination (IC) framework that can effectively mitigate the two types of interferences simultaneously is proposed. In the 1st layer, the intercell IC is performed in a centralized manner by the non-real-time (non-RT) radio access network intelligent controller (RIC), and then in the 2nd layer, under the condition of the results in the 1st layer, intracell IC is done by each near-RT RICs in a decentralized manner. Furthermore, a restricted conditional graph coloring algorithm (RCGCA) suitable for this 2-layer IC framework is proposed. The proposed RCGCA is designed to be applied on a partial pre-colored graph, such that when it is applied in the 2-layer IC framework, it satisfies the requirement that the 2nd layer coloring must be applied under the condition of the pre-coloring results of the 1st layer. In addition, by restricting the total number of colors, the RCGCA can tradeoff between improving the capacity due to interference mitigation and degrading the capacity due to bandwidth partition, thereby maximizing the link capacity. We compare the link capacity achievable by the proposed 2-layer IC framework based on RCGCA with that achievable by the well-known fractional frequency reuse (FFR) scheme, no interference coordination case, fully centralized framework, and fully decentralized framework. Computer simulations confirm that our proposed 2-layer IC framework based on RCGCA can significantly improve the link capacity.},

To this end, most of the emerging SC works focus on specific data types and employ sophisticated machine learning models including deep learning and neural networks. However, they could be impractical for multi-modal data possibly within a real-time constraint, relative to the purpose of the communication. A notable difficulty of existing SC frameworks lies in handling the discrete constraints imposed on the pursued semantic coding and its interaction with the independent knowledge-base, which makes reliable semantic extraction extremely challenging. Therefore, we develop a new hashing-based semantic extraction approach to SC framework, where our learning objective is to generate one time signatures (hash codes) using supervised learning for low latency, secure and efficient management of the SC dynamics. We first evaluate the proposed semantic extraction framework over large image data sets, extend it with domain adaptive hashing and then demonstrate the effectiveness of “ semantics signature ” in bulk transmission and multi-modal data.},

However, the limited energy budget of UAV constrains its development. In this paper, a dual-UAV-assisted IoT using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is proposed to improve IoT capacity. To reduce energy consumption of the UAVs while ensuring a certain throughput, a joint resource optimization problem of communication scheduling, transmit power and motion parameters of UAVs is formulated to maximize energy efficiency of UAVs. To solve the proposed non-convex optimization problem, we present an alternating iterative optimization algorithm to alternately optimize three sub-problems: communication scheduling optimization, UAV transmit power optimization and UAV motion parameters optimization, each of which can be converted into convex optimization and solved using Lagrange multiplier method, subgradient descent method and successive convex approximation (SCA). The numerical results show that optimizing UAV motion parameters can effectively improve energy efficiency of UAVs, and the proposed dual-NOMA-UAV assisted IoT can achieve higher energy efficiency than the orthogonal multiple access (OMA)-UAV assisted IoT.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we discuss general data-framing and optimization, parallel frequency-phase estimation, and powerful frequency estimator for satellite communications. Based on the standard pilot-symbol-assisted-modulation (S-PSAM) frame, we design a general PSAM (G-PSAM) frame, whose corresponding data-aided &amp; non-data-aided Cramér-Rao bound (DA&amp;NDA CRB) is derived with respect to carrier frequency offset, time delay and phase offset, followed by its approximate form. Also, we provide a simple solution to the G-PSAM frame optimization by means of the approximate DA&amp;NDA CRB and the control-variate method. With an unbiased auto-correlation (AC) value, we then propose a frequency-phase decoupler and develop a parallel frequency-phase estimation (PFPE) mode in terms of the serial frequency-phase estimation (SFPE) mode, where a serial-to-parallel estimation conversion can be implemented. Furthermore, we extend the AC frequency estimator in the PFPE mode as a powerful stepwise correlation-based one aiming at the target performance. Theoretical analysis and numerical results are provided to show the superiority of the optimized frames, the robustness of the PFPE mode, and the adaptability of the proposed frequency estimator with the optimized frames under different transmission systems.},

  abstract     = {The dynamic radio resource management technology is an essential technology in high throughput satellite (HTS) communications. Aiming at the problem that the traditional static radio resource allocation is difficult to meet the dynamic traffic, the dynamic radio resource allocation based on the meta-heuristic algorithm has been extensively studied. Since wireless channel conditions, differentiated services have stochastic properties, and the environment&#39;s dynamics are unknown in HTS, the dynamic radio resource allocation based on model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method was used to learn the optimal policy through interactions with the situation. However, the generalization ability of the existing DRL cannot fully meet the great dynamic change in HTS. To address this issue, we explore an advanced heuristic learning approach that combines DRL with one heuristic algorithm. In the proposed approach, we apply the DRL to accelerate the convergence of the heuristic algorithm and verify the proposed method in the dynamic power allocation (DPA) in HTS. Compared with the traditional methods, the simulation results show that the proposed approach can accelerate the convergence of the heuristic method for the allocation of power in HTS and has a low time complexity of the decision. Compared with the traditional methods, our proposed method can reduce the computational overhead by 6.2–94.8%.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of high-speed railway systems and railway wireless communication, the application of ultra-wideband millimeter wave band is an inevitable trend. However, the millimeter wave channel has large propagation loss and is easy to be blocked. Moreover, there are many problems such as eavesdropping between the base station (BS) and the train. As an emerging technology, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can achieve the effect of passive beamforming by controlling the propagation of the incident electromagnetic wave in the desired direction. We propose a RIS-assisted scheduling scheme for scheduling interrupt flows and improving quality of service (QoS). In the propsed scheme, an RIS is deployed between the BS and multiple mobile relays (MRs). By jointly optimizing the beamforming vector and the discrete phase shift of the RIS, the constructive interference between direct link signals and reflected link signals can be achieved, and the channel capacity of eavesdroppers is guaranteed to be within a controllable range. Finally, the purpose of maximizing the number of successfully scheduled flows and satisfying their QoS requirements can be practically realized. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme has superior performance regarding the number of completed flows and the system secrecy capacity over four baseline schemes in literature.},

However, most of the solutions available today face scalability issues when considering many slices, due to centralized controllers requiring a holistic view of the resource availability and consumption over different networking domains. In order to tackle this challenge, we design a hierarchical architecture to manage network slices resources in a federated manner . Driven by the rapid evolution of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) schemes and the Open RAN (O-RAN) paradigm, we propose a set of traffic-aware local decision agents (DAs) dynamically placed in the radio access network (RAN). These federated decision entities tailor their resource allocation policy according to the long-term dynamics of the underlying traffic, defining specialized clusters that enable faster training and communication overhead reduction. Indeed, aided by a traffic-aware agent selection algorithm, our proposed Federated DRL approach provides higher resource efficiency than benchmark solutions by quickly reacting to end-user mobility patterns and reducing costly interactions with centralized controllers.},

In this paper, we address the deployment problem of decentralized FL and the secrecy rate maximization problem in fog-assisted IoD networks. In particular, we leverage the overlapped zones of drones to spread their local aggregated models to the network. As such, the global model aggregation is achieved without any participation from the fog. Then, aiming to secure the proposed decentralized FL-based framework, we consider the secrecy rate maximization problem, which can be addressed by scheduling users to drones and their available radio resource blocks (RRBs). This coordinated scheduling problem of users-drones/RRBs is NP-hard. To efficiently solve it using graph theory techniques, we construct a centralized conflict clustering graph and reformulate the considered scheduling problem as a maximum-weight independent set (MWIS) problem in the constructed conflict graph. To alleviate the need for the coordinated scheduling policy at the fog, we propose to solve the coordinated scheduling problem in a distributed manner. We conduct extensive simulations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes over existing schemes. Selected numerical results show that the proposed distributed scheduling schemes provide similar performances in terms of secrecy rate and energy consumption as compared with the centralized scheme, with reasonable amount of information exchanges among the drones.},

However, in the existing works, since the impact of link attributes on the satellite topology has not been well investigated, it is difficult to avoid the loss of topology information for the transmission path selection, which may aggravate the unreliability of routing path. In this paper, we propose a novel time-varying topology model for the LEO satellite network, to improve the adaptability of the satellite routing. Firstly, the weighted time-space evolution graph based on the link attributes is established to construct the time-varying topology model of LEO satellite networks. Then, the utility function of the link attributes is modelled and the multi-attribute decision-making is introduced to calculate the weight of each link attribute for the quantification of the link utility. Finally, based on the topology model, the inter-satellite link utility-based dynamic routing algorithm is proposed to improve the adaptability of satellite routing. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed routing algorithm outperforms the existing routing algorithms in terms of packet drop rate, end-to-end delay and throughput.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a compact dual-band filtenna with controllable radiation nulls for Shark-Fin scenarios. The proposed filtenna is composed of three quarter-wavelength dual-band resonators. The resonator in the middle is fed by the probe. The other resonators on both sides of the middle resonator are coupled by the mixed electromagnetic (EM) field. Since the electric and magnetic couplings can be cancelled, the mixed EM coupling can be used to obtain more radiation nulls with less order than the other coupling mechanisms. Thus, the proposed antenna is straightforward and compact. Furthermore, the dual-band Quasi-elliptical responses are realized. Four radiation nulls are realized on both sides of two pass-bands, and the positions can be flexibly adjusted in dual bands. Without extra filtering circuits, high radiation efficiency can be achieved. To analyze and guide antenna design, the RLC equivalent circuit and extraction method are provided. For demonstration, the proposed filtenna is implement-ed. Radiation efficiency is about 64% and 83% within 2.4–2.5 GHz and 5.0–5.88 GHz, respectively. Moreover, the out-of-band supp-ression is over 20 dB. Compared with the traditional antenna, the in-band radiation performance of the proposed antenna is almost maintained, whereas out-of-band suppression is significantly enhanced. The proposed filtenna is suitable for Shark-Fin scenar-ios where multiple antennas operating at different frequency bands coexist. The interference from antennas at adjacent bands is reduced significantly due to the out-of-band suppression. Specially, the isolation between the proposed dual-band filtenna and antennas operating at the other bands can be improved by about 21 dB.},

We have exploited channel diversity by assigning multiple subchannels to various MC-NOMA users (NUs), while allowing multiple NUs to use the same subchannel. We formulate a joint NU clustering, and power and subchannel allocation problem for system&#39;s energy efficiency (EE) maximization under the constraints of minimum quality of service (QoS) requirement, maximum allowable transmit power for each NU, and successive interference cancelation. The formulated problem is non-convex with fractional objective function, and therefore, to convert it into a tractable from, it is divided into two subproblems, i.e., subchannel allocation and NU clustering subproblem, and power allocation subproblem. The subchannel allocation and NU clustering subproblem is solved through a suboptimal algorithm, which exploits the channel diversity by maintaining maximum possible difference in transmit power levels of clustered NUs. Whereas for the power allocation subproblem, the EE optimization problem is convexified through Dinkelbach and successive convex approximation techniques and a closed-form suboptimal solution is obtained. The simulation results show that the proposed energy efficient algorithm outperforms the existing NOMA and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) algorithms. The proposed approach also guarantees user fairness by giving priority to the NUs with unfulfilled throughput requirements.},

To demonstrate the advantages of MDD-CF, we firstly study the spectral-efficiency (SE) performance in terms of one coherence time (CT) interval associated with access point (AP)-selection, power- and subcarrier-allocation. Since the formulated SE optimization is a mixed-integer non-convex problem that is NP-hard to solve, we leverage the inherent association between involved variables to transform it into a continuous-integer convex-concave problem. Then, a quadratic transform (QT)-assisted iterative algorithm is proposed to achieve SE maximization. Next, we extend our study to the case of one radio frame consisting of several CT intervals. In this regard, a novel two-phase CT interval (TPCT) scheme is designed to not only improve the SE in radio frame but also provide consistent data transmissions over fast time-varying channels. Correspondingly, to facilitate the optimization, we propose a two-step iterative algorithm by building the connections between two phases in TPCT through an iteration factor. Simulation results show that, MDD-CF can significantly outperform in-band full duplex (IBFD)-CF due to the efficient interference management. Furthermore, compared with time-division duplex (TDD)-CF, MDD-CF is more robust to high-mobility scenarios and achieves better SE performance.},

To be specific, a total transmit power constraint (TTPC) and two per-beamforming power constraints (PBPC) are considered. We first propose a suboptimal PA algorithm for the TTPC-PA aided ESDIM scheme using a powerful solver based on advanced algebra theories, which only considers the PA aspects for a given selected beamforming pair. Then, we extend the TTPC-PA aided scheme to the average per-beamforming power constraint (APBPC)-PA aided scheme and the strict per-beamforming power constraint (SPBPC)-PA aided scheme.

  abstract     = {Many advancements are being made in vehicular networks, such as self-driving, dynamic route scheduling, real-time traffic condition monitoring, and on-board infotainment services. However, these services require high computation power and precision and can be met using mobile edge computing (MEC) mechanisms for vehicular networks. MEC operates through the edge servers available at the roadside, also known as roadside units (RSU). MEC is very useful for vehicular networks because it has extremely low latency and supports operations that require near-real-time access to rapidly changing data. This paper proposes an efficient computational offloading, smart division of tasks, and cooperation among RSUs to increase service performance and decrease the delay in a vehicular network via MEC. The computational delay is further reduced by parallel processing. In the division of tasks, each task is divided into two sub-components which are fed to a deep neural network (DNN) for training. Consequently, this reduces the overall time delay and overhead. We also adopt an efficient routing policy to deliver the results through the shortest path to improve service reliability. The offloading, computing, division, and routing policies are formulated, and a model-based DNN approach is used to obtain an optimal solution. Simulation results prove that our proposed approach is suitable in a dynamic environment.

We further derive the optimal power allocation for a given quality-of-service (QoS) for the GSIC receivers. Based on random matrix theory, the corresponding asymptotic approximations of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) for the system and the power allocation are derived for both perfect and imperfect CSI. The derived approximations are verified and shown highly accurate, providing fast characterization of the performance and near-optimal resource allocation for different system parameters. The numerical and approximation results both indicate that power allocation improves the overall energy efficiency (EE), while the GSIC receiver can yield a high EE with a very small number of groups. Besides, the EE of the system can be improved with intermediate-resolution ADCs and ordered SIC (OSIC).},

  abstract     = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a recent technology garnering lots of attention amongst the wireless communication research community due to its ability to improve the channel conditions extravagantly. The main feature of IRS technology is its capability to tune the phases of the reflecting elements to trigger a cohesive amalgamation of various multipath. IRS can easily co-exist with almost all technologies, thereby offering flexibility to the designers to come up with attractive systems. Further, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is a recent 2D modulation technique that can mitigate the drawbacks of the traditional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for fifth generation (5G) and beyond networks, especially in high Doppler wireless environments like vehicle-to-everything (V2X) and millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. This paper presents the system architecture of the IRS-assisted OTFS scheme in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, including the modulation, demodulation, and detection methods. The selection of the reflection coefficients play the most vital role in the IRS-OTFS system, like any IRS system. IRS reflection optimization cannot perfectly line up all multipath with the same phase in the frequency-selective channels. We adopt an IRS phase optimization method where only the strongest delay-Doppler path is phase-aligned, while the paths with lesser strengths will be out of phase with the direct path. This reconfigurability of IRS elements enhances the OTFS modulation scheme, thereby significantly mitigating the multipath fading effects in high Doppler channels. Additionally, we propose a channel estimation for the IRS-OTFS system where both data and pilots are embedded in the same OTFS frame with minimal guard-band overhead. The paper presents extensive simulation results on the error-rate performance of the proposed system over Rayleigh and Rician fading channels. The effects of the number of IRS elements, the phase selections, and the channel estimation method on the system&#39;s performance are investigated. The comprehensive simulation study demonstrates that by exploiting the features of both OTFS and IRS, the proposed approach can provide impressive performance in high Doppler environments.},

However, the complexity HSR environment lead unstable communication links and low quality of service. Therefore, this paper studies a RIS-aided hybrid precoding for anti-blocking HSR network to enhance the sum rate of mobile relays when signal blocking. To describe the blocking scenes clearly, the blocking model is established and the closed form of the blocking probability is derived. Based on the blocking model, the non-convex blocking optimal problem is decoupled by the block coordinate descent method with the jointly optimization problem about hybrid precoder and reflect angle matrix of RIS. Then, the successive convex approximation and prox-linear method are utilized to solve the constant modulus constraint of RIS and hybrid precoding constraints. Simulation results show that the proposed RIS-aided anti-blocking hybrid precoding scheme can achieve higher sum rate than the traditional methods in blockage scenarios. Moreover, the proposed algorithm brings better performance of blocking probability and outage probability in high-speed scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new preamble waveform design and a corresponding minimum-point processing algorithm at receiver are proposed to perform radar sensing of communication signal echoes. In our design, we consider the millimeter wave (mmWave) 802.11ad/802.11ay communication frame format as a reference. Our proposed new preamble replaces the second pair of single-carrier (SC) Golay complementary code (GCC) used in the preamble of IEEE 802.11ad/802.11ay by orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) GCC waveform, resulting in a SC-OFDM GCC preamble waveform. At the receiver, a point-wise minimum operation is performed on the separate radar ambiguity functions (AF) of the SC-GCC and OFDM-GCC to improve the overall quality of the preamble AF. Furthermore, point-wise minimum processing is applied to fuse the communication data AF and the preamble AF, so as to further enhance the radar sensing quality of the entire communication frame. In addition, theoretical analysis of the performance gain of such radar AF fusion is provided. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the newly proposed SC-OFDM GCC preamble design and the minimum-point fusion of data AF and preamble AF provide a significant performance improvement for automotive radar sensing. Specifically, the proposed SC-OFDM GCC preamble with minimum-point processing algorithm improves the peak-to-max-sidelobe ratio (PMSR) of radar AF over the conventional 802.11ad/802.11ay preamble. Moreover, the proposed preamble-data AF fusion technique further enhances the PMSR as well as the Doppler resolution over the existing joint radar communication systems (which process either the preamble echo or the data echo only). Finally, the proposed minimum-point processing and data AF fusion are extended from single-frame to multi-frame processing to further improve the Doppler resolution.},

The problem is challenging to solve due to the highly coupled mixed-integer variables and the complicated expressions of the constraints. To tackle the difficulty, we decompose the problem into two sub-problems: the power and computational resource allocation sub-problem and the user-BS-subchannel association sub-problem. For the first sub-problem, we derive the optimal computational resource as a function of the optimal transmission power. Then the power optimization problem is distributed to each cell, and the local-optimal power solution within each cell is derived in closed-form expressions. For the second sub-problem, we design an optimal modified-cutting-plane (MCP) algorithm with exponential time-complexity. A polynomial-time near-optimal pivoting-and-subgradient (PS) algorithm is further proposed to reduce the complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the PS algorithm achieves comparable performance to the optimal MCP algorithm, while they both outperform the benchmark schemes in most cases.},

  abstract     = {5G networks may not be competent in fully supporting the high data rates, system capacity, and spectral efficiency expected in the upcoming 6G networks. An enabling factor to achieve these requirements is the adoption of the Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA), which is one of the most promising code-domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) techniques. Nowadays, there are two major challenges for the implementation of SCMA in practical networks. First, the design of a near-optimal codebook set at the transmitter, which heavily impacts the network performance. Second, an efficient decoding algorithm at the receiver, which dominates the computational complexity of the system. The two aspects are not independent from each other; therefore the optimization of an SCMA network should address jointly both the Encoder and the Decoder side. However, most of the works available in the literature address only one aspect and also are not tailored for a given radio channel. In this paper, we design an end-to-end SCMA en/deconding structure based on the integration between a state-of-the-art AutoEncoder (AE) architecture and a novel Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN). The aim is to jointly create a near-optimal codebook design and a non-computationally heavy Decoder that are robust to the given channel statistics. Finally, we trained our model to be flexible to support different channel conditions and compared its performance against the state-of-the-art AE and the best conventional Decoders. The simulation results show that our innovative design exhibits decoding performance very similar to conventional Decoders with a reduced decoding latency.},

Though 5G+ communications target to operate in sub-6 GHz as well as millimeter wave range (mmWaves), sub-6 GHz being already congested, mmWaves are seen as a viable technology that can support high data rates. To this end, in this paper, we study the feasibility of using UAVs at mmWaves deployed at low altitudes to serve a user population higher than the number of RF chains available at the UAV. Since the UAVs are energy constrained devices, solar harvesting is considered for the UAVs to act as access nodes for an extended period of time. Practical 3-dimensional antenna array radiation pattern and the resulting inter-beam interference from the sidelobes are taken into account in the analysis. We devise a sub-array hybrid precoder that provides minimum rate support to all users across the wideband mmWave channel. The RF precoder is designed according to the users&#39; locations. In addition, we propose a low complexity iterative joint subcarrier allocation and baseband precoder optimization algorithm with faster convergence. In the proposed algorithm, we employ weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) to design baseband precoder to reduce inter-beam interference while jointly optimizing subcarrier allocation to maintain minimum user rate constraint. Next, we determine the optimal number of beams at UAV to optimize throughput while guaranteeing minimum user rate support for energy sustainable UAV operation. Finally, we compare the performance gain achieved by low-altitude UAV deployed at mmWaves over the UAV deployed at sub-6 GHz frequency range.},

Moreover, the development of technologies such as the Internet of things (IoT) and massive machine-type communications (mMTC) are also fueling the rapid increase in the number of communication devices. It is anticipated that through 6G, the wireless communication networks will move in the direction of ultra-dense distribution of enormous devices with assorted service and rate requirements. This requires a huge network energy, capacity, and efficient deployment of the spectrum. This paper employs the massive multi-input multi-output (mMIMO) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques that increase the multiplexing gain and network capacity. This paper utilizes the benefits of millimeter Wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) channels that poseess considerably higher communication capacity. However, these schemes are highly complex. To mitigate this problem, we use BS caching as diverse applications in 6G will have varied rate requirements. In addition, we propose an application-specific channel selection (ASCS) scheme with a cache-enabled two-tier 6G Heterogeneous Network (HetNet). In the proposed scheme, bestowing to the application requirement of the small cell users, the small cell base station (SBS) switches downlink channels dynamically. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed ASCS scheme can achieve higher spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and throughput for the cache-enabled two-tier 6G HetNet.},

  abstract     = {The emerging joint sensing and communication (JSC) technology is expected to support new applications and services, such as autonomous driving and extended reality (XR), in the future wireless communication systems. Pilot (or reference) signals in wireless communications usually have good passive detection performance, strong anti-noise capability and good auto-correlation characteristics, hence they bear the potential for applying in radar sensing. In this paper, we investigate how to apply the positioning reference signal (PRS) of the 5th generation (5G) mobile communications in radar sensing. This approach has the unique benefit of compatibility with the most advanced mobile communication system available so far. Thus, the PRS can be regarded as a sensing reference signal to simultaneously realize the functions of radar sensing, communication and positioning in a convenient manner. Firstly, we propose a PRS based radar sensing scheme and analyze its range and velocity estimation performance, based on which we propose a method that improves the accuracy of velocity estimation by using multiple frames. Furthermore, the Crámer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the range and velocity estimation for PRS based radar sensing and the CRLB of the range estimation for PRS based positioning are derived. Our analysis and simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of PRS over other pilot signals in radar sensing. Finally, some suggestions for the future 5G-Advanced (5G-A) and 6th generation (6G) frame structure design containing the sensing reference signal are derived based on our study.},

The coarse alignment is one of the crucial technologies of underwater navigation and determines whether SINS can work normally. However, the traditional coarse alignment methods suffer from the complicated noises hidden in the inertial sensors’ outputs.

On the other hand, the proposed approach makes up for the drawbacks of the Optimal-REQUEST algorithm which has a conservative covariance matrix and scalar gain.

  abstract     = {The large misalignment errors of horizontal and azimuthal angle cannot be converged rapidly on the sea surface due to extra disturbance of linear and angular motions caused by wind and waves, which increases the time cost of marine vehicles alignment process and ultimately limits the SINS quick working capability. In order to solve the above problem, an adaptive multiple backtracking UKF method based on Krein space theory is proposed in this paper. Firstly, considering time-varying calibration errors of inertial sensors, a novel robust posterior filtering equation in Krein space is designed to improve the matching degree between the physical process and the mathematical model. Moreover, combined with the multiple forward and reverse navigation processes, an adaptive calculation times control method in backtracking UKF based on the innovation is constructed to solve the nonlinear fast alignment problem in the case of large misalignment angle errors with the purpose of further intelligently shortening the alignment time and ensuring alignment accuracy simultaneously in different periods and working environments. The physical experiment results demonstrate that the horizontal and azimuthal alignment accuracy of the proposed algorithm are improved compared with standard CKF alignment algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Energy consumption prediction is increasingly important for eco-driving, energy management, and charging scheduling of electric vehicles. Detailed knowledge of the rolling resistance and road grade, combined here in a road-resistance profile, improves the accuracy of these predictions. This paper presents a recursive method to identify the position-dependent road-resistance coefficient using GPS position, powertrain power, and vehicle speed. The calculations make explicit assumptions regarding the spatial continuity of both road gradient and rolling resistance by defining road segments. A recursive least-squares method with Gaussian basis functions allows the estimates to be updated whenever a route segment is traversed anew. The method is tested on data gathered by a 12 m battery electric bus. The resulting road-resistance profile shows a strong resemblance to the road slope and captures changes in rolling resistance well, including a dependency on ambient temperature, which is in accordance with literature on tire rolling resistance. Including the resistance profile in a vehicle model reduces the error of the predicted powertrain power by 1.7 percent point compared to a conventional method, without the limitation of requiring a high-resolution digital elevation model.},

  abstract     = {Dual-functional radar communications (DFRC) systems, which jointly design radar and communication functionalities on one common platform, have been recognized as an attractive approach for leveraging the scarce spectral efficiently in diverse applications, such as autonomous driving. Index modulation (IM), a promising communication technique with high energy utilization and spectral efficiency, has been successfully integrated into DFRC systems. Most existing IM-based DFRC schemes utilize the degrees of freedom (DoFs) from one or two domains for separate information embedding, without utilizing the full diversity of the integrated waveform. In this paper, we propose a novel DFRC scheme, referred to as hybrid index modulation (HIM), operating on frequency hopping multiple-input multiple-output (FH-MIMO) radar. The HIM embeds communication information into the index of the 3-tuples in the hybrid dictionary, which is the outer product of DoFs from the frequency, phase, and antenna index of the integrated waveform. Since the HIM entwines waveform diversities from different domains, it increases the communication rate by multiples. We also apply the HIM to the non-orthogonal FH-MIMO radar to improve spectral efficiency, in addition to the conventional orthogonal case. Furthermore, we propose a constrained HIM scheme to enhance the radar detection performance, where the FH pattern has been optimized in terms of ambiguity function. System performance is evaluated both theoretically and experimentally in metrics of communication rate, ambiguity function and symbol error rate.},

  abstract     = {This research presents a current sensorless dynamic direct voltage method based on the maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) technique to control the rotor speed of interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) for electric vehicle (EV) applications. It considers the dynamic model of the machine and generates a particular pair of voltage amplitude and its angle to track the speed profile of the driving cycle. The proposed control strategy contributes by eliminating the need for a current sensor, avoiding cascaded PI controllers, and overcoming the limitations of transient states. Consequently, the measurement noise and equipment failure do not affect the control loop, the tuning of a single PI controller becomes much simpler than two cascaded PI controllers, and the absence of MTPA tracking and current or voltage overshooting at transient states cannot limit the performance of the control technique. Additionally, the aforementioned modifications improve the response time of the proposed strategy and make it nimble enough for EV applications. A comparative analysis is carried out on the proposed current sensorless dynamic direct voltage MTPA control, simplified dynamic direct voltage control (S-DDVC), and the field oriented control (FOC) models. The outcomes confirm that the introduced model substantially reduces the inrush current and voltage. Experimental results with quantitative tracking and energy consumption assessments reveal that the proposed method demands 9.7% lower energy than the FOC counterpart in urban driving plans by operating IPMSM in high efficiency region.},

To this end, the driving data of skilled drivers operating manual transmission vehicles are collected. The shift boundary points of each gear under the target driving condition are obtained through data preprocessing, data cleaning, outlier processing, and boundary points extraction. Thereafter, the gear decision strategy of skilled drivers is established by fitting the shift boundary points.

  abstract     = {Renewable energy sources (RESs) and electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) have been extensively incorporated into distribution systems. Due to the stochastic nature of RES generation and electric vehicles (EVs), risky operational challenges might impact the grid. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-objective planning framework to optimally allocate EVCSs in conjunction with RESs. Specifically, the proposed RESs and EVCSs planning framework considers three sub-objectives to be minimized, i.e., voltage deviations, energy losses, and EVs owners’dissatisfaction. Further, active power curtailment of RESs is precluded while considering the diverse operational constraints of the grid, RESs, and EVCSs. To provide further benefits, advanced control schemes of the interconnecting RES inverters, grid-to-vehicle (G2V), and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) schemes are considered in the proposed framework. A two-level approach is developed to solve this holistic framework with competing sub-functions to obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions. The outer optimization level precisely optimizes the RES locations and sizes, along with the optimal places of the EVCS. On the other hand, the inner level determines the optimal EVCS charging considering stochastic EV power, RES inverter reactive power, and the time-of-use energy tariff. The proposed framework has been tested on the 69-bus distribution system. The simulation results reveal the efficacy of the proposed RES and EVCS planning framework. The total voltage deviation and energy losses achieved by the proposed framework are reduced by 96% and 74%, respectively, with respect to the uncontrolled charging of EVs, while the owners’ satisfactions are met.},

Therefore, the current control for LR OW-PMSM becomes challenging. The main objective of this research is to provide a current harmonic control strategy for LR OW-PMSM by the nonlinear lumped disturbance observer (NLDO) combined with improved space vector modulation (SVM) scheme. The existence of nonlinear, unknown, unmodeled factors has been confirmed by current measurement and harmonic analysis in full operation range, and thus is considered in proposed controllers. The NLDO is designed for all the three axes under the dq 0 frame. The SVM algorithm is adjusted to two switching patterns in order to get widened linear voltage modulation range. In addition, in the 3-D voltage space is the possible modulation area investigated. Ultimately, the target LR OW-PMSM has been designed, prototyped, and tested. The proposed NLDO, juxtaposed with ordinary PI and deadbeat controllers, reduces current harmonics on both the motor and inverter sides, possesses high robustness, and is practical for LR motors, according to experimental results.},

Then, the vehicle stability controller is designed based on the sliding mode control (SMC), in which the tire force saturation constraint and the relative weight of yaw rate and sideslip angle are considered. Furthermore, a weight adaptive criterion with normalized stability index is defined to develop the cooperative strategy of trajectory tracking and stability control. The feasibility and adaptability of the proposed method to different extreme conditions are verified by hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test and CarSim-Simulink co-simulation.

  abstract     = {World Endurance Championship (WEC) racing events are characterised by a relevant performance gap among competitors. The fastest vehicles category, consisting in LMP1 race hybrid vehicles, has to respect energy usage constraints set by the technical regulation. Considering absence of competitors, i.e. traffic conditions, the optimal energy usage strategy for lap time minimisation is typically computed through a constrained optimisation problem. To the best of our knowledge, the majority of state-of-the-art works neglects competitors. This leads to a mismatch with the real world, where traffic generates considerable time losses. To bridge this gap, we propose a new framework to offline compute optimal strategies for the powertrain energy management considering competitors. Through analysis of the available data from previous events, statistics on the sector times and overtaking probabilities are extracted to encode the competitors&#39; behaviour. Adopting a multi-agent model, the statistics are then used to generate realistic Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of their position along the track. The simulator is then adopted to identify the optimal strategy as follows. We develop a longitudinal vehicle model for the ego-vehicle and implement an optimisation problem for lap time minimisation in absence of traffic, based on Genetic Algorithms. Solving the optimisation problem for a variety of constraints generates a set of candidate optimal strategies. Stochastic Dynamic Programming is finally employed to online choose the best strategy at the beginning of each lap, considering the competitors&#39; initial position and their forecast future motion provided by the MC simulator. Our approach, validated on data from a real stint of race, allows to significantly reduce the lap time.},

However, in the introduced design process, the overheating problem is considered of the motor that occurs in a faulty operation mode in an integrated electric brake (IEB) system. In the design process, the faulty operation mode is investigated in the system level. The design variables are selected as the main components of the IEB system such as the motor and pump piston. Then the selected design variables are optimized to operate without performance degradation even in the faulty operation mode. To analyze the coil temperature rise during the faulty operation mode of a dual winding motor by motor and pump piston size, a lumped-parameter thermal network with piecewise stator-housing modules (LPTN with PSMs) is utilized. In addition, to conduct the optimal design, latin hypercube sampling (LHS), kriging modeling, and a genetic algorithm (GA) are utilized. A prototype of the optimized model is manufactured and tested for verification of design results.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a hierarchical architecture is presented on the longitudinal control of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). A terminal constraint-free model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is developed as the upper controller to calculate the desired acceleration. For the lower controller, through modeling experiments, we establish a driving force table (DFT) to represent the relationship among throttle opening, speed and driving force of UGVs. Moreover, in order to improve the disturbance rejection capability, a DFT-based feedforward controller is proposed to convert the desired acceleration into the expected throttle opening. The modeling errors and external disturbances are integrated and an extended state observer (ESO) is designed for estimation. Besides, the recursive feasibility and stability of the MPC without terminal constraint are guaranteed through rigorous proof. Several experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are becoming more prominent in our society (for example, in smart cities), although a number of challenges remain to be (fully) addressed (e.g., high vehicle mobility). In this paper, we propose a scheme that combines both a cluster algorithm and a Multi-Objective Task Distribution algorithm based on Differential Evolution (MOTD-DE), designed to ensure stability and reliability in vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) deployments. Specifically, we use Kubernetes container-base as the cluster algorithm to select various vehicles that fulfill the algorithm&#39;s conditions. Hence, this allows us to perform complex tasks on behalf of data owner vehicles. In our approach, the vehicles&#39; information will be available on the master vehicle (data owner vehicle) when the vehicle joins the cluster, and a deep learning model is used to define the fit complexity of sub-tasks. The proposed MOTD-DE distributes sub-tasks between vehicle clusters to reduce the execution time and the resources (vehicles) used to perform a task. We also assume the sub-tasks to be independent. To evaluate our work, we propose scenarios with varying number of tasks, vehicles, CPU and memories values, and distances between cluster vehicles and data owner vehicle. A comparative summary of the evaluation findings between MOTD-DE and four other widely used approaches (i.e., Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant-Colony algorithm (ACO), and Artificial-Bee-Colony (ABC) algorithm) shows that MOTD-DE outperforms these competing approaches.},

In this paper, we apply a value decomposition-based MDRL approach (QMIX) to control various CAVs in mixed-autonomy traffic of different densities to efficiently and safely pass the non-signalized intersection with fairish fuel consumption. Implementation tricks including network-level improvements, Q value update by TD ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\lambda$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ), and reward clipping operation are added to the pure QMIX framework, which is expected to improve the convergence speed and the asymptotic performance of the original version. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated by several evaluation metrics: average speed, the number of collisions, and average fuel consumption per episode. The experimental results show that our approach&#39;s convergence speed and asymptotic performance can exceed that of the original QMIX and the proximal policy optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning baseline applied to the non-signalized intersection. Moreover, CAVs under the lower traffic flow controlled by our method can improve their average speed without collisions and consume the least fuel. The training is additionally conducted under the doubled traffic density, where the learning reward converges. Consequently, the model with maximal reward and minimum crashes can still guarantee low fuel consumption, but slightly reduce the efficiency of vehicles and induce more collisions than the lower-traffic counterpart, implying the difficulty of generalizing RL policy to more advanced scenarios.},

The existing matching area selection methods ignore the high-resolution characteristics of the gravity gradient, resulting in inaccurate selection. Therefore, a frequency domain matching area selection method based on the high-resolution characteristics of the gravity gradient is proposed. The high-frequency information of gravity gradient reference map is extracted by wavelet transform, and the gravity gradient wavelet transform model is established. The morphological image texture segmentation method is proposed to extract the densely textured areas from the gravity gradient high-frequency image as the matching areas. Simulation results show that the proposed method can obtain the texture density, texture amplitude and texture direction in the matching area while obtaining the matching area with a matching rate higher than 90%. Compared with the existing methods, the matching areas obtained by the proposed method are more accurate and the calculation burden is reduced to less than 10% of the existing algorithm. Moreover, the more the trajectory is perpendicular to the texture inside the matching area, the higher is the matching rate.},

Compared with traditional SLAM-based and reactive obstacle avoidance-based approaches, the proposed navigation method can map the raw sensing information into navigation signals, and the learned policy deployed to the UAV can avoid the memory occupation and computational consumption required for real-time map building.

Firstly, a position and orientation (PAO)-based event-triggered mechanism is designed to decrease the frequency of data transmission through the wireless network. According to the PAO information at the event-triggered time, an event-triggered high-gain extended state observer (EHGESO) is developed to remove the demand of velocity information in conventional backstepping technique and eliminate the requirement of continuous PAO information in traditional HGESO design. Under the developed EHGESO and the PAO-based event-triggered mechanism, planar vehicles can cooperatively move along the parameterized path, and can transmit information with their neighbor vehicles only if the designed event-triggered mechanism is violated. The stability is proved by employing input-to-state stability (ISS) and semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) stability theory. Eventually, a simulation of three-degree-of-freedom surface vehicle models is offered to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed control method.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) has been widely considered as a potential solution for reducing traffic congestion, increasing road capacity, reducing fossil fuel consumption and improving traffic safety. Traditional CCAC methods rely heavily on the vehicle-to-vehicle communications to achieve cooperation. However, in the real-world scenarios, unreliable communication will degrade CACC to adaptive cruise control, which may bring negative influences on safety (i.e., increase the risk of collisions). To overcome this drawback, this paper innovatively applies a spring damping energy model to construct a robust autonomous vehicle platoon system. The proposed design of the energy model ensures that the stability and safety of the platoon system be maintained in the event of such sudden degradation. Based on this technique, a distributed control protocol which only utilizes local information from neighbors is then proposed. Furthermore, some practical constraints such as the connectivity of the vehicle platoon system and the bound of the control inputs are guaranteed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed CCAC strategy is validated by multiple simulation experiments in Unreal Engine.},

To address the hard constraints caused by the vehicle physical limitations and the coupled safety constraints among adjacent vehicles explicitly, the distributed model predictive control (DMPC) problem for CAVs is formulated. By virtue of the Lagrangian multiplier method and the dual decomposition technique, the DMPC problem subject to coupled constraints is recast into a distributed dual variable consensus optimization problem comprised of a series of subsystems with local copies of the dual variables, which is then cooperatively solved in parallel based on the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) under the distributed information exchange mechanism. In addition, the disturbance is dynamically mitigated by the feedback control, and its influence on the vehicle status is quantified by the associated robust positively invariant set. Robust cooperative control protocols are proposed to regulate the cooperative operations of CAVs, and the recursive feasibility and the closed-loop stability are theoretically proved.

  abstract     = {Citywide traffic flow prediction is a basic but challenging task in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Most existing traffic flow prediction methods require historical traffic data of all the target roads in both training and application stages. However, it is not easy, and usually costly, to collect real-time traffic data across the entire road network. Therefore, many existing methods have to narrow down the scope of their prediction on the parts of road networks. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning model, named Limi-TFP, which has the ability to identify a limited number of monitored roads, and achieves citywide traffic flow prediction by using the historical traffic data of these selected roads. Specifically, an embedding module is proposed to capture the spatial context (road topology structure) and the attributes (e.g., road type, length, lanes, etc.) of each road by embedding all road segments into vectors. A road ranking method is then developed for selecting a limited number of roads to be monitored. A group of multi-head attention mechanisms is exploited for capturing the dynamic correlations with each monitored road. Meanwhile, the fusion with external factors, including the point of interests (POIs) and weather data, is also taken into account to further improve the prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on the real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the superior performance and is robust with the presence of noise compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, with only 5% roads being monitored.},

  abstract     = {Human driving decisions are the leading cause of road fatalities. Autonomous driving naturally eliminates such incompetent decisions and thus can improve traffic safety and efficiency. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential in learning complex tasks. Recently, researchers investigated various DRL-based approaches for autonomous driving. However, exploiting multi-modal fusion to generate perception and motion prediction and then leveraging these predictions to train a latent DRL has not been targeted yet. To that end, we propose enhancing urban autonomous driving using multi-modal fusion with latent DRL. A single LIDAR sensor is used to extract bird&#39;s-eye view (BEV), range view (RV), and residual input images. These images are passed into LiCaNext, a real-time multi-modal fusion network, to produce accurate joint perception and motion prediction. Next, predictions are fed with another simple BEV image into the latent DRL to learn a complex end-to-end driving policy ensuring safety, efficiency, and comfort. A sequential latent model is deployed to learn more compact representations from inputs, leading to improved sampling efficiency for reinforcement learning. Our experiments are simulated on CARLA and evaluated against state-of-the-art DRL models. Results manifest that our method learns a better driving policy that outperforms other prevailing models. Further experiments are conducted to reveal the effectiveness of our proposed approach under different environments and varying weather conditions.},

The rigid Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of Emergency Messages (EMs), the varied QoS tolerant degrees of Service Messages (SMs), and the complex transmission environment in urban scenario pose great challenges. In this paper, a Cluster-based Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) approach for Mixed Data Dissemination (CMDD) is proposed to tackle the aforementioned challenges in urban scenario of IoVs. The proposed approach consists of two main algorithms: the bus-based clustering and the mixed data scheduling. To deal with the complex and harsh transmission environment in urban scenario, we propose to use buses, which have fixed driving routes and schedules as well as sufficient resources, to act as cluster heads. Meanwhile, multiple characteristics are deeply analyzed and artfully utilized in the design of the clustering algorithm, to achieve efficient data dissemination from buses to ordinary vehicles. To meet the rigid and personalized QoS requirements of EMs/SMs under stringent resources, a new priority calculation method is proposed and mixed data are scheduled accordingly. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves remarkable performance advantage in terms of data download delay, emergency warning ratio and service response ratio.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar is critical to the emerging automatous driving. As one important step to estimate the range/velocity of unknown targets, constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) techniques should be firstly applied. Most CFAR methods focus on the point -based target model (i.e. each target is represented as one point), which may be inadequate for the highly accurate detection scenarios. Owing to the largely improved temporal/spatial resolutions of mmWave radars, each target is now dispersed to many reflection points, covered by a certain area on Range Doppler Map (RDM). In this work, we fully utilize such new information provided by mmWave radars, and develop an area -based CFAR framework by fully exploiting the potential diversity gain, with which the detection signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is substantially improved. Theoretical analysis suggests the achieved SNR gain of our method over traditional algorithms grows as the area size &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$S$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; of each target on RDM, i.e. &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$ {\mathcal {O}}(S)$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; . As demonstrated by numerical simulations and real experiments, our method dramatically improves the detection probability of both single-input and single-output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems, also greatly enriching the output point-cloud information for other sophisticated inference tasks. Our method has great potentials in the emerging automotive mmWave radars for highly accurate targets detection.},

  abstract     = {The navigation and localization of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) face many challenges. In surface missions, AUV typically relies only on Global Positioning System (GPS) to perform navigation. However, the GPS data output frequency is low, usually only 1 Hz. Meanwhile, the navigation system is susceptible to interference from GPS measurement outliers. For underwater missions, without the assistance of additional underwater absolute positioning measurements, the unknown errors introduced by the navigation system modeling process and state estimation process will affect the navigation accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an integrated navigation method for small-sized AUV in shallow-sea applications. Firstly, a robust GPS/Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS)/Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) navigation method for surface missions is proposed to maintain high-frequency output and robustness. Secondly, a Multiple Model (MM) integrated navigation method is proposed for AUV underwater missions. An AHRS/DVL/NavNet sub-model is proposed to perform measurement correction to correct the unknown errors. At the same time, an adaptive AHRS/DVL sub-model based on Variational Bayesian (VB) is presented to estimate the time-varying measurement noise covariance to improve the state estimation accuracy without the extra external observations. Two sub-models run parallel based on the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM). The effectiveness of the proposed integrated navigation method is verified by actual sea trial data from Sailfish 210 AUV.},

We develop a novel DoS-attack-aware event-triggered mechanism for each vehicle to determine whether the MPC problem should be solved or not at each sampling time instant. If the MPC problem is solved, the constructed vehicular beacon information will be transmitted to its neighbouring vehicles through the vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET). In the DoS-attack-aware event-triggered condition, the dynamic threshold adjusts adaptively according to DoS attack durations, local vehicular data, and beacon information from its neighbours. Then, an exponential-type robustness constraint is introduced in the MPC problem to deal with external disturbances. Subsequently, sufficient conditions are given to guarantee the recursive feasibility of the MPC algorithm and closed-loop platoon system stability. Finally, extensive simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of communication efficiency and platoon resilience control performance.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of autonomous driving vehicles on roads has increased the importance of research on autonomous driving in mixed-autonomous traffic. In mixed-autonomous traffic scenarios, it is necessary to comprehend the instability of autonomous vehicles and traffic flow corresponding to the uncertainty level in human-driven behaviors. However, studies of stability analysis in deep reinforcement learning are limited. This study focuses on the impact of deep reinforcement learning based autonomous vehicles in mixed-autonomous traffic from the stability perspective. We define the policy instability and traffic flow instabilities using the entropy of the velocity distributions to quantitatively measure the instability of an autonomous vehicle. Subsequently, we provide mathematical analyses to explain logarithmic growth patterns of instability. Moreover, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach that jointly determines discrete and continuous actions under partial observation. To verify the proposed solution, we perform extensive simulations of various traffic scenarios (e.g., increasing traffic volumes, increasing the number of autonomous vehicles on the road, and setting the multiple uncertainty levels for human-driven behaviors) with ablation studies on reward function. Moreover, we analyze instabilities when human-driven vehicles are modeled using the human-like noisy controller and a policy that imitates actual human-driving data based on imitation learning. The simulation results support the theoretical analysis and confirm that the proposed method is stabler compared to a conventional control-theoretic approach.},

It requires the planner to be capable of responding to the changes in driving scenarios in real-time. This paper proposes a hybrid trajectory planning framework by combining the sampling- and numerical optimization-based approaches to cope with the complex driving scenarios. First, a risk field model is introduced to assess the risks with the static and moving obstacles. Then, the sampling-based approach is used to generate collision-free trajectory candidates via the Path Velocity Decomposition method. Thus, the optimal behavior trajectory can be obtained by considering curve smoothness, collision risk, and travel time. The optimization-based method is adopted to optimize the behavior trajectory to guarantee safety, vehicle dynamics stability, and driving comfort using the Sequential Quadratic Programming within the spatio-temporal boundaries. Finally, the proposed framework is examined in typical dynamic driving scenarios through simulation, and the results verify its competency in generating high-quality trajectories in real-time.},

This method can cope with the highly dynamic network environment, and adapt to both active routing and table-driven routing protocols. The method considers the channel model of the signal and investigates the impact of UAV communication range on link maintenance. We can get an agent by perceiving the degree of changes in the number of neighbors in a dynamic environment. The optimal broadcast cycle was obtained to maximize the energy of the node to send and receive task data. We substituted the single-output network model with a competitive network to overcome the reward overestimation problem, which also improves the convergence speed of the algorithm. Simulation results showed that DRL-MLsA can reduce the communication overhead for link maintenance, while at the same time increase the throughput of the network and decrease the packet loss of transmission.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a compact, wideband Yagi-Uda antenna and its phased array antenna is optimized by a multi-objective antenna for the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band of fifth generation (5G) communication systems. Ten geometrical parameters of a single Yagi-Uda antenna are selected to widen the 5G operating bandwidth (BW) and increase the gain together using the Kriging model builder and pipeline sequential design (PLSD) in combined sampling strategy. The single antenna element provides a wide impedance bandwidth (IBW) from 26 to 34 GHz with 20% and a peak measured gain of 5.5 dBi at frequency 28 GHz. The optimized antenna provides a high growth of 27.7% and a 2 dB increase in peak gain over the reference antenna without any effect on the structure design. Then, a low-bit phased array antenna with the optimized 5G Yagi-Uda antenna is designed and optimized with directional radiation in the horizontal plane for the 28 GHz base-station (BS) 5G applications. The array antenna consists of three sections: the Yagi-Uda antenna elements, Wilkinson power divider, and two bits phase shifters. The total size of the proposed array antenna is &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$60 \times 47\ \text{mm}^{2}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; and it operates in a measured frequency range of 26.2 to 29.1 GHz around an operating frequency of 28 GHz which provides 10.3% IBW, and a maximum measured gain is 14 dB. Finally, two analog and hybrid precoding methods are considered to evaluate the performance of the proposed 5G phased array antenna. In the analog precoding, gain patterns are nearly constant in the range of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$[-45^{\circ }, 45^{\circ }]$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; with variations around 1 dB and the range for hybrid precoding, is &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$[-60^{\circ }, 60^{\circ }]$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; with a very low sidelobe level (SLL).

This paper considers that the receiver of relays, users, and an eavesdropper have non-identical channel estimation error. To assess the secrecy rate, this work derives new analytical expressions for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) of the received signal to noise ratio (SNR) using infinite series for maximal-ratio combining (MRC) and selection combining (SC) receivers. Using the CDF for the received SNR, we derive new exact analytical expressions for the secrecy rate with non-identical channel estimation error for four scenarios. Further, using the PDF for the received SNR, we derive the asymptotic analytical expressions for the secrecy rate and quantify the high SNR slope and the high SNR power offset for four scenarios. From the numerical results, we observe that the relay and user selection has the high SNR power offset gain compared to the non-selection. The secrecy rate of the proposed system can be improved according to legitimate receiver&#39;s parameters such as the number of receive antennas and channel correlation coefficient and can be degraded according to eavesdropper&#39;s parameters. The superiority of the secrecy rate of the MRC receiver and the SC receiver depends on the channel estimation accuracy of the MRC receiver.},

To address such two problems, this paper focuses on the massive-multiple-input single-output (mMISO) BC transmission, which is a common scenario in cellular networks. With regarding the massive-antenna, we derive a precise approximation of the system capacity for all possible power splits, and its expression is as simple as the formula of Shannon capacity. It is proved that the derived approximation is a lower-bound of the system capacity and asymptotically approaches the system capacity with respect to the number of transmit antennas. Thus, the derived approximation is valuable in the massive-antenna cases. Based on the approximation, we show how to jointly employ the massive-antenna and superposition coding to approach the system capacity with a low computational complexity. The simulations validate the correctness of the derived outcomes in mMISO-BC. Consequently, the aforementioned two complicated problems are effectively circumvented in this paper.},

To meet such demands, the Terahertz (THz) band, with abundant spectrum resources, is envisioned as a promising solution. However, a premise problem is channel modeling for THz V2I communications. In this paper, ray-tracing (RT) techniques are utilized to analyze the V2I channel in an urban scenario at 300 GHz. Channel statistics, including path loss, shadow fading, etc, are thoroughly characterized. The parameters of multi-path components (MPCs) and similarity of MPCs existing on identical streets are analyzed and modeled. Furthermore, the birth and death processes of MPCs are carefully characterized and modeled. A new criterion, namely, the virtual transmitter position scheme, is proposed to determine the birth and death of MPCs and the evolution of MPCs during their lifetime. Based on this, a ray-tracing assisted stochastic channel model (RTA-SCM), is proposed, which combines the RT technique and stochastic processes. The effectiveness and accuracy of RTA-SCM are validated by comparing it against RT data and geometry-based stochastic models. The proposed model can be utilized in time-varying THz V2I communications.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and simultaneously wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) are two promising approaches to address the spectrum and energy supply problems. However, most existing works studied these two techniques separately, and how to effectively realize them simultaneously is non-trivial, because the power allocation of DSA and time splitting of SWIPT will influence both data transmission and energy harvesting performance. Hence, a sophisticated joint design is necessary, which, however, is challenging considering the uncertain dynamic spectrum environment. In this paper, we propose a joint power allocation and time splitting scheme to facilitate devices to implement both DSA and SWIPT simultaneously, which aims at maximizing the long-term throughput while ensuring the interference limitation and energy supply requirements. Considering the environmental uncertainty, we develop a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning solution to make each device autonomously select the best decision that could optimize the whole network performance based on its local observations. Simulation results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {In the next-generation wireless networks, full-duplex, relaying, and random linear network coding (RLNC) are popular techniques to enhance the network performance such as efficiency and reliability. For full-duplex relay networks, a perfect RLNC scheme known as FBPF (Fewest Broadcast Packet First) was recently proposed and demonstrated a better throughput, or equivalently, expected completion delay performance than the Automatic Repeat Request scheme. However, the original FBPF scheme assumes unlimited buffer and does not take the buffer size into consideration. In this paper, we generalize the FBPF scheme to consider the buffer size as a new parameter. Based on a novel Markov chain model, explicit formulae to characterize the expected completion delay are deduced. Moreover, we present a criterion on the optimal selection of the buffer size under a quality of service constraint, so that the selected buffer size is significantly reduced while the completion delay performance is comparable to the original FBPF scheme with unlimited buffer.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the privacy-preserving power control problem for over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL), which features “one-shot” aggregation and significantly reduced communication latency. In Air-FEEL, the inevitable random perturbation encountered in the aggregation process due to the corruption by channel fading and noise poses a fundamental trade-off between the privacy and accuracy, as larger perturbation may harm the accuracy but benefit the privacy, and vice versa. Therefore, power control in Air-FEEL, as the main approach to regulate the said random perturbation, needs to be judiciously designed for balancing the accuracy-privacy trade-off. This, however, is a largely uncharted area. To bridge the research gap, we first analyze the convergence behavior (in terms of the optimality gap) and the differential privacy (DP) performance of Air-FEEL with respect to the power control policy at different iterations. Then, to achieve the maximized training accuracy under given DP guarantee requirement, we minimize the optimality gap by jointly optimizing the power control at edge devices and the denoising factors at the edge server, subject to a set of power constraints at individual edge devices and the DP constraint. Experimental results validate that the proposed power control policy for Air-FEEL achieves a better privacy-accuracy trade-off compared with the benchmarks.},

However, the practical implementation of NOMA faces several challenges, including radio frequency impairments, such as power-amplifier (PA) nonlinearity, which can limit its performance. In this paper, we study the impact of PA nonlinearity on the detection performance of PD-NOMA, and propose a random Fourier feature (RFF) based solution to mitigate the effects of such imperfections. Computer simulations carried out assuming different PA nonlinearity types demonstrate that the proposed RFF based algorithm considerably improves the BER performance and achieves results that are close to the ideal case. Lastly, the analytical proof of our proposed algorithms performance is provided to support our simulation results.},

In CD-GFRA, MTDs with angle-dependent LOS channels access the network directly, while NLOS-channel MTDs transmit with the assistance of random relays. Moreover, an angle of arrival (AOA) based channel estimation is further proposed to improve the access capacity of LOS-channel MTDs.

Therefore, a crucial feature for a macro base station (MBS) is to accurately obtain the angle of arrival (AoA) of OAM beams from the small base stations (SBSs) in the system. Considering the limitations of existing OAM-based AoA estimations, we propose a novel super-resolution AoA estimation method, denoted as the recursive estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) method. The proposed technique is fundamentally different from traditional ESPRIT algorithm: It is not based on the displacement-invariant array structure, but on the recursive characteristic of Bessel functions in OAM signals. With this method, the inter-mode interference of the LoS MU-OAM system can be significantly suppressed by less training overhead, and the performance is close to that of the ideal system.},

  abstract     = {Combining rate splitting (RS) with cooperative relay, cooperative RS (CRS) can reduce the interference and improve the sum rate of conventional RS networks. However, since the common message can be decoded by both users, how to prevent the untrusted relay from eavesdropping the other user&#39;s private message remains a challenge. In this correspondence, we propose a two-slot CRS scheme to guarantee the security of the far legitimate user from the other untrusted relay. The problem is a non-convex joint optimization of the precoding matrix, slot allocation and rate allocation, which is approximated as a convex one. Then, an iterative algorithm is designed to solve the problem. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively guarantee the security of the far user towards eavesdropping.},

Accordingly, this letter explores an alternative to traditional optimization driven design (ODD) techniques available in literature for beamformer design in IBFD radios. In particular, we consider a generalized spatial modulation (GSM) based bi-directional IBFD system, that provides the flexibility of choosing active antennas among a set of antennas for the spatial symbol. We propose a run-time data-driven prediction approach to solve the multiple multivariate regression problem of detection of the transmitted signal in this GSM based IBFD system in the presence of residual SI arising from non-ideal SI cancellation. We compare the performance of the proposed detector with respect to conventional detectors under several communication parameters that are of practical interest. The proposed DNN-based detector learns the deviations from a standard model without SI and achieves performance that is superior to zero forcing and minimum mean squared error detectors and very close to maximum likelihood detector at faster computation time.},

Considering that PT occupies the spectrum in a random manner, inevitable packet collisions occur when ST is transmitting while PT also starts to occupy its spectrum. To address this issue, we jointly optimize the block-length and the transmit power of ST&#39;s transmission to strike a balance between the packet collision and the decoding error subject to a covertness constraint. In particular, we first derive the packet collision probability, the covertness constraint, and the average packet error probability, characterizing the analytical expression for the average effective spectral efficiency (AESE). To further improve the system performance, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize AESE and the corresponding optimal block-length and transmit power are obtained for different kinds of channel information available at ST. Simulation results show that there is an optimal block-length to reduce the packet collision and decoding error in the interweave covert CRN.},

Specifically, monostatic sensing aims for extracting target-orientation information from the line of sight (LoS) channel between the transmitter and the target, since the Non-LoS (NLoS) paths only contain clutter or interference. By contrast, in wireless communications, typically, both the LoS and NLoS paths are exploited for achieving diversity or multiplexing gains. Hence, we shed light on the NLoS exploitation vs. reduction tradeoffs in a monostatic ISAC scenario. In particular, we optimize the transmit power of each signal path to maximize the communication rate, while guaranteeing the sensing performance for the target. The non-convex problem formulated is firstly solved in closed form for a single-NLoS-link scenario, then we harness the popular successive convex approximation (SCA) method for a general multiple-NLoS-link scenario. Our simulation results characterize the fundamental performance tradeoffs between sensing and communication, demonstrating that the available DoFs in the ISAC channel should be efficiently exploited in a way that is distinctly different from that of communication-only scenarios.},

However, the commonly adopted Shannon-type achievable rate is only valid in the long block length regime that is not applicable to the emerging short-packet communication. To realize ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) in cell-free massive MIMO systems, we optimize the precoding vector at the access points (APs) to maximize the minimum user rate in both the centralized and decentralized fashion. The design takes into account the impact of URLLC and we propose path-following algorithms (PFA) to address the considered problem which generates a sequence of advanced feasible points and converges to at least a locally optimal solution of the design problem. Moreover, we investigate the requirement of the precoding schemes, the length of the transmission duration, the number of antennas equipped at each AP, and the size of each AP cluster on the URLLC rate. Numerical results show that the decentralized PFA precoding can achieve 80% of the 95%-likely URLLC rate of the centralized precoding and 89% of the average URLLC rate with only 12% computational complexity of the centralized precoding.},

A transmission power minimization problem is formulated to optimize the beamforming vectors under the premise of guaranteeing the requirements on transmission latency, reliability and the target user rates, which is non-convex. To solve it, we first reformulate the problem into a tractable form by using the convexity and concavity of asymptotic capacity in the finite blocklength regime, then adopt S-Procedure to convert the infinite constraints into finite ones. Finally, the Gaussian randomization method and the penalty function method are utilized to generate a feasible solution to the original optimization problem and to provide a good rank-one approximation, respectively.

Specifically, we first propose a sample filter method for discrete soft actor-critic, which improves the sample efficiency and stability of the algorithm via enhancing the utilization of effective samples. Subsequently, we construct the discrete decision-making strategy for autonomous driving based on the DSAC-SF algorithm, and further design the area observation method and the multi-objective reward function to improve the driving safety and efficiency. Finally, we carry out comparison and ablation experiments on the the scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning training school (SMARTS) simulation environment. Experimental results indicate that our strategy obtains a high success rate and a fast vehicle speed in the decision-making tasks on freeways. Moreover, our DSAC-SF algorithm also achieves improved performance in training efficiency and stability compared to the commonly used discrete reinforcement learning algorithm.},

In this scenario, in the presence of multiple no-fly zones, an UAV starts from the point of departure, collects the items from ground users, and finally delivers the collected items to the destination. We mathematically characterize the item delivery scenario. Then, we formulate a problem of item value maximization to jointly optimize the UAV trajectory and item pick-up design. The formulated problem is a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. Through some equivalent transformations, we convert the original problem into an equivalent problem with a difference-of-convex structure. Using the penalty convex-concave procedure method, we devise a low-complexity algorithm with promising performance. The numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Stereo matching is a classical problem in computer vision. It has been widely used in many fields, especially autonomous driving in recent years. Two key aspects of speed and accuracy are both desirable but conflicting characteristics in autonomous driving. In this paper, we present CMNet, a lightweight stereo matching architecture for improving the trade-off between speed and accuracy on resource-limited devices. A novel feature extraction network consisted of a patch embedding layer and a ConvMLP-mixer is proposed. The patch embedding layer enhances the receptive field and makes the feature vectors compact. The accuracy of the disparity map is increased by mixing the spatial information in the channel dimension through the ConvMLP-mixer. The absolute difference volume is concatenated with the group-wise correlation volume to provide multi-dimensional matching cost information for the cost aggregation stage. Being evaluated on KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015 stereo matching datasets, the inference time of CMNet on NVIDIA GTX 2080ti GPU is 8.7 ms. While realizing fast predictions beyond real-time, the results of D1-all are 3.41% on KITTI 2012 and 3.84% on KITTI 2015, achieving state-of-the-art result between speed and accuracy. Besides, the lightweight architecture of CMNet enables a fast inference time of 40.7 ms on Nvidia Jetson Nano to realize real-time applications on edge devices.},

  abstract     = {Omni-directional pathloss, which refers to the pathloss when omni-directional antennas are used at the link ends, are essential for system design and evaluation. In the millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) and beyond bands, high gain directional antennas are widely used for channel measurements due to the significant signal attenuation. Conventional methods for omni-directional pathloss estimation are based on directional scanning sounding (DSS) system, i.e., a single directional antenna placed at the center of a rotator capturing signals from different rotation angles. The omni-directional pathloss is obtained by either summing up all the powers above the noise level or just summing up the powers of detected propagation paths. However, both methods are problematic with relatively wide main beams and high side-lobes provided by the directional antennas. In this correspondence, directional antenna based virtual antenna array (VAA) system is implemented for omni-directional pathloss estimation. The VAA scheme uses the same measurement system as the DSS, yet it offers high angular resolution (i.e. narrow main beam) and low side-lobes, which is essential for achieving accurate multipath detection in the power angle delay profiles (PADPs) and thereby obtaining accurate omni-directional pathloss. A measurement campaign was designed and conducted in an indoor corridor at 28-30 GHz to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The software-defined vehicular networking (SDVN) paradigm alleviates the deficiencies brought on by distributed vehicular. The separation of the control plane and the data plane allows the controller to manage the network based on global information. Most existing routing schemes in SDVN obtain the link-state through which vehicles periodically send beacon messages to the controller. However, due to the high mobility of the vehicles and the dynamic communication environment, the link-state changes within the beacon interval. In this case, the controller may select an expired link to transmit data during routing calculation, which will undoubtedly result in packet loss. Therefore, it is important for the controller to timely obtain the link-state during the beacon interval. If the controller can timely obtain the information after a link becomes unavailable, the risk of selecting unavailable links can be significantly reduced. In this paper, we propose an a daptive l ink-state p erception s cheme (ALPS) for SDVN, which enables the controller timely obtain the link-state within the beacon interval. We obtain the link-state by detecting the loss of packets on a link. A link quality evaluation method based on fuzzy logic is present to evaluate the possibility of link failure. After the link evaluation, we present an adaptive threshold adjustment method to dynamically adjust the detection range to decrease the detection cost. Simulation results demonstrate that ALPS can effectively reduce the packet loss ratio at a low cost.},

  abstract     = {Fog radio access networks (F-RANs) have been regarded as a promising paradigm to support latency-sensitive and computation-intensive services by leveraging computing and caching capabilities of fog access points (F-APs). To execute offloaded computation tasks, it is essential to pre-store necessary programs and databases at F-APs, referred as service caching. However, due to system dynamics and the coupling of decisions, cache, radio, and computation resource management at F-RANs is a challenging problem. In this paper, a joint multi-dimensional resource optimization problem is formulated, aiming at minimizing the weighted sum of expected latency cost and caching cost, which is featured by a two-timescale structure. For radio and computation resource allocation on a small timescale, a coalitional game based approach is proposed under given caching decisions. On a larger timescale, services are cached at each F-AP using a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. The advantage of the proposed algorithms is that they can implicitly take the impact of small timescale resource allocation into account while adapting to the long-term statistics of channel coefficients and user service requests. We analyze the proposed algorithms with respect to their convergence, optimality, and complexity, and validate their performance with extensive simulations, where superior performance is observed over several baseline schemes.},

  abstract     = {5G New Radio (NR) technology operating in millimeter wave (mmWave) band is expected to be utilized in areas with high and fluctuating traffic demands such as city squares, shopping malls, etc. The latter may result in quality of service (QoS) violations. To deal with this challenge, 3GPP has recently proposed NR unlicensed (NR-U) technology that may utilize 60 GHz frequency band. In this paper, we investigate the deployment of NR-U base stations (BS) simultaneously operating in licensed and unlicensed mmWave bands in presence of competing WiGig traffic, where NR-U users may use unlicensed band as long as session rate requirements are met. To this aim, we utilize the tools of stochastic geometry, Markov chains, and queuing systems with random resource requirements to simultaneously capture NR-U/WiGig coexistence mechanism and session service dynamics in the presence of mmWave-specific channel impairments. We then proceed comparing performance of different offloading strategies by utilizing the eventual session loss probability as the main metric of interest. Our results show non-trivial behaviour of the collision probability in the unlicensed band as compared to lower frequency systems. The baseline strategy, where a session is offloaded onto unlicensed band only when there are no resources available in the licensed one, leads to the best performance. The offloading strategy, where sessions with heavier-than-average requirements are immediately directed onto unlicensed band results in just &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$2\!-\!5\%$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; performance loss.

  abstract     = {With the prosperity of Internet of Things, a large number of heterogeneous wireless devices share the same unlicensed spectrum, leading to severe cross-technology interference (CTI). Especially, the transmission power asymmetry of heterogeneous devices will further deteriorate this problem, as the high-power devices (like WiFi) always corrupt the ongoing transmissions of low-power devices (like ZigBee), because the energy of the ZigBee signal perceived by WiFi is too weak to achieve the CCA (Clear Channel Assessment) threshold and the channel is considered to be idle. This paper proposes an enhanced CCA (E-CCA) mechanism to mitigate CTI in WiFi and ZigBee coexistence networks. E-CCA contains ZShark which can identify signals within a tolerable time duration. It also contains a MAC layer design, with which a WiFi device can still determine the channel to be busy when the detected energy is below the CCA threshold while a ZigBee signal is identified, thus to avoid CTI to ZigBee transmissions. We set up a testbed based on USRP B200 and TelosB to collect data and evaluate the performance of ZShark. We further evaluate the performance of E-CCA through both theoretical analysis and simulations on NS-3. The results show significant performance improvement of ZigBee.},

The advent of 6G networks plays a crucial role in increasing the feasibility of the IoD ecosystem. This ecosystem&#39;s sheer size and low computational efficiency create challenges in maintaining compliance and control. The 6G IoD ecosystem can incorporate a blockchain-based multi layered compliance and control system to solve the significant trust and authentication issues. Implementing authentication mechanisms and UAV-user identity data in the blockchain layer can preserve the integrity of these authentication mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel Multi Layered Blockchain assisted 6G Internet of Drones (MLB-IoD) ecosystem that augments the IoD ecosystem with secure control and compliance mechanisms. The MLB-IoD ecosystem consists of the novel Global Compliance System (GCoS) and the Swarm Security (SSe) system as its constituents. The GCoS assures drone takeoff compliance and optimally permissible route planning, while the SSe system provides intelligent swarm access control mechanisms. The analysis of the proposed MLB-IoD ecosystem reveals it to be highly secure against authentication based and cryptological attacks. Further, the simulation results show that the location-compliance based path planning module in the GCoS reduces the average flight time for UAVs by 18.37%.},

  abstract     = {In applications for automatic guided vehicle (AGV) navigation , the positioning system based on the time-of-flight (TOF) measurements between anchors and tags is confronted with the problem of insufficient measurements caused by blockages to radio signals or lasers, etc. Mounting multiple tags at different positions of the AGV to collect more TOFs is a feasible solution. Vehicle localization by exploiting the measurements between multiple tags and anchors is a rigid body localization (RBL) problem. However, to the best of the authors&#39; knowledge, the state-of-the-art RBL solutions do not deal with missing measurements, and thus will result in degraded localization availability and accuracy in harsh environments. In this paper, we model this problem as a sensor network localization problem with missing TOFs and propose a new efficient RBL solution based on Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) completion, abbreviated as ERBL-EDMC. Firstly, we develop a method to determine the bounds of the missing measurements to complete the EDM reliably, using the known relative positions between tags and the statistics of the TOFs. Then, based on the completed EDM, the global tag positions are obtained from a coarse estimation followed by a refinement step assisted with inter-tag distances. Finally, the optimal results are obtained iteratively based on the estimated tag positions from the previous step. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the ERBL-EDMC method effectively solves the RBL problem with incomplete measurements. It obtains the optimal positioning results while maintaining low computational complexity compared with the existing RBL methods based on semi-definite relaxation (SDR).},

In this paper, we study the efficient caching mechanism to minimize the acquisition delay of the supporting data. Firstly, with the software defined network (SDN) based VEC framework, we analyze the acquisition ways of the supporting data and the caching collaboration between VEC servers. Then, according to the density of the requesting vehicles, we divide the VEC coverage into dense and ordinary areas. With the consideration of the similarity of the requested data and the distance between edge servers, the edge servers are clustered into multiple groups based on K-mean++ algorithm. Finally, each server&#39;s storage space is divided into three partitions, and the most beneficial data for itself, its group and the whole system are respectively stored in these partitions. Based on service area dividing, server grouping and storage space partitioning, we propose an efficient edge-cloud collaborative caching strategy, which can reduce the delay of data migration while task execution. Simulation results show that, compared with other schemes, the proposed caching strategy has better performance in terms of average data migration delay and application QoS.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have received significant research interest from academia due to their on-demand content distribution capabilities using mobile edge computation and the next-generation Flying Ad-hoc Network (FANET). With the addition of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and network virtualization, these UAVs have transformed into three-dimensional distributed heterogeneous networks. However, the softwarized UAV-based communication is prone to high latency, energy consumption, resource constraints, and link failures. Hence, content orchestration has become a significant challenge. Information-Centric Networking (ICN) uses content-based rapid data dissemination in the dynamic wireless scenario. However, ICN-based content discovery and distribution have not been explored extensively for UAV-assisted networks. In this work, we propose a UAV-assisted multi-layer IC-SDN solution to tackle the content distribution challenges using distributed controllers placed hierarchically in the edge and cloud tiers. Besides, we formulate the traffic optimization problem into a joint forwarding and flow scheduling problem using M/M/1 queueing allocation model and propose a heuristic edge-cloud traffic flow assignment solution that allocates requests based on the service type and device location. We evaluate the proposed solution in a simulation environment considering the mobility principle of FANET nodes. Besides, the effectiveness of the optimization solution and the performance gains are evaluated analytically. The simulation and numerical results show that the proposed optimization model is efficient as compared to other solutions, in maximizing throughput and minimizing computational latency, delay, and packet loss.},

  abstract     = {Jamming attack is one of the serious security breaches in the upcoming fifth-generation heterogeneous networks (5G HetNets). Most of the existing anti-jamming techniques, such as frequency hopping (FH) and direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) lack in self-adaptive capabilities to mitigate the security and privacy issues in highly dynamic 5G HetNet environment. In literature, although reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored a lot in designing various anti-jamming techniques to address the aforementioned problems, but these techniques suffer from the issue of large network resource consumption and slow convergence rate. To mitigate these issues, we propose a federated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based anti-jamming technique for two-tier 5G HetNets. In the proposal, each femtocell of 5G HetNets is assumed to have multiple single antenna femto users (FUs) and a multi-antenna jammer used to jam the downlink signals from femto base station (FBS) to FUs. Aiming to improve the achievable rate at FUs in the presence of jammers, a joint optimization problem of beamforming and power allocation at FBSs is formulated by considering the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of FUs. Due to the non-convex nature of the aforementioned optimization problem, we have used the Markov decision process (MDP) to transform the optimization problem into a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem. Then, to solve this MDP with large number of states and action spaces, a federated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheme is proposed to maximize the achievable rate at FUs. The proposed scheme uses federated learning and dueling architecture of dueling double deep Q network (D3QN) to optimize the beamforming vectors and power allocation jointly at FBSs. The achievable rate performance of the proposed federated DRL scheme is compared with double deep Q network (DDQN) and deep Q network (DQN). Simulation results show that the proposed federated DRL scheme achieves 19.39% and 23.85% better achievable rate in comparison to DDQN and DQN schemes.},

  abstract     = {Wireless powered communication (WPC) is able to provide wireless devices (WDs) practically infinite energy by using the radio frequency energy harvesting technique. The electricity of WDs for the wireless information transmission (WIT) is converted from the received electromagnetic signals of wireless energy transfer (WET). Power beacon (PB) is usually deployed as the dedicated energy source in WPC networks and the performance of WET is sensitive to the path-loss effect. Thus, both WET and WIT are significantly influenced by the locations of the PBs. To enable efficient transmission in WPC, this paper analytically investigates the impact of the PB deployment strategies on the WPC performance when WDs are clustered around the access points (APs). Specifically, we propose the PB deployment strategy based on the truncated Poisson cluster process (PCP) model. The distribution of PBs is correlated to the locations of WDs by choosing APs as their common parent points. Then, we derive the semi-closed form expressions for the energy outage probability and the transmission success probability. We further present the expressions of the meta distributions of WET and WIT, and investigate the proportion of the WDs in one cluster that achieves successful transmission while satisfying the reliability constraint. Moreover, the distance distribution between the WD and the intra-cluster PBs is analytically derived for the proposed correlated PCP model. By comparing the performance with other deployment strategies, it is shown that the preference of the PB deployment strategy depends on the PB density. The analytical and numerical results can provide insightful guidelines for designing practical WPC systems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an application customized network slicing mechanism to cope with dynamic traffic in future networks and various service requirements for network users, namely, context-aware network slicing (CANS). The resource allocation is carried out in frequency (f), space (s) and time (t) domains (referred to as three domains (3D) resource allocation) while the customization targets at low latency and high reliability, characteristic for IoT applications. We first formulate CANS as a two-step matching game with unknown preferences for access and back-haul networks. To dynamically resize mobile users&#39; network slices (NSs), we propose application customized CANS++ method based on a coalition game to minimize the hand-off risk in the network. We then develop two-step stable matching (TSSM) and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\epsilon$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -Pareto stability techniques to find the solutions to CANS and CANS++, respectively. To improve energy and cost efficiency, an artificial intelligence-based Dynamic Network Architecture (DNA) with ON/OFF scheduling (AI-DOS) is proposed to dynamically maximize NS utilization. Finally, we carry out extensive numerical analysis and demonstrate that context-aware 3D network slicing and resizing schemes can improve at least three times the users&#39; utilities. These utilities are enhanced up to 180% by minimizing their hand-off risk. Furthermore, NS shrinking technique can reduce the number of active nodes (controlled in the s-domain) by factor five while the average utility of macro base stations, controlled in the t-domain, is improved between 70% and 500%.},

  abstract     = {Space-air-ground-sea integrated network, as a promising networking paradigm for the sixth generation (6 G) communications, connects satellite networks, aerial networks, terrestrial networks, and marine networks. As a fundamental application of marine networks, efficient target localization in the ocean is significant for many marine and underwater applications, including oceanic environmental monitoring, subsea resource exploration, and navigation safety. In this paper, to bring more scalability and feasibility of underwater localization, a mobile underwater acoustic array network is utilized to locate underwater moving targets by leveraging linear frequency modulated (LFM) signals. In the mobile underwater acoustic network, one node is constantly broadcasting LFM signals. Based on the reflected signals received by other nodes, a method that jointly utilizes the propagation delay and the Doppler effect is proposed to simultaneously estimate the position and the velocity of the moving target. Specifically, a two-phase iterative algorithm with low computational complexity is designed to improve the estimation accuracy. Closed-form expressions of positioning and velocity estimation error are also presented. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed method clearly outperforms the least squares based approach. Moreover, the estimation accuracy of the proposed method can approach the Cramér-Rao low bound (CRLB) within two iterations. Decently good localization and velocity estimation error performance can be achieved even with an array network formed by a small number of nodes.},

  abstract     = {In emerging 5G networks, User Equipment camps traditionally on 4G network. Later, if the user requests a 5G service, it can simultaneously camp on 4G and 5G using EUTRAN New-Radio Dual-Connectivity (EN-DC) approach. In EN-DC, poor radio-conditions in either 4G or 5G network can be detrimental to user Quality-of-Experience (QoE). Although operators want to maximize EN-DC activation to fully utilize the 5G network, sub-optimal parameter configuration to turn on ENDC can compromise key-performance-indicators due to excessive radio-link-failures (RLFs) or voice-muting. While the need to maximize the EN-DC activation is obvious for maximizing the 5G network&#39;s utility, RLF and mute avoidance are vital to maintain the QoE requirements. To achieve aforementioned tradeoff, this paper presents the first solution to optimally configure the EN-DC activation parameters. We collect two datasets from real network to develop machine-learning-models to predict RLF and muting, respectively. We also investigate and compare the potential of various under-sampling, oversampling, and synthetic data generation techniques including Tomek-Links and Generative Adversarial Networks for their potential to address the data imbalance problem inherent in the real network training data. Leveraging these models, we formulate and solve two QoE-aware optimization problems that can maximize EN-DC activation while minimizing RLF or voice-muting. System-level simulation-based results show that compared to state-of-the-art solution that does not take into account RLF or voice-muting risk in EN-DC activation, the proposed solution can intelligently determine ENDC activation criteria that minimize the risk of RLF and voice muting while giving the operator&#39;s desired level of priority to maximize 5G network utilization.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative visual sensing among multiple vehicles has raised increasing concern with the development of connected vehicular systems. However, it remains challenging for effective cooperative sensing under communication constraints due to the lack of theoretic basis and efficient design for communication resource allocation in visual sensing networks. This paper establishes an information-based bit allocation framework for cooperative visual sensing in vehicular networks, where visual observations captured by on-board cameras are quantized before transmitted to the fusion center for 3D environment model estimation. Our aim is to allocate the quantization bits among observations in the network to minimize the overall estimation error. Specifically, we first design a Fisher information matrix (FIM)-based metric to evaluate the cooperative visual sensing error, and characterize the impact of quantization on sensing with geometric interpretations based on the relation among the 3D physical space, the quantization modulation space and the information eigenspace. Then we present closed-form investigations for the optimal bit allocation among observations in the network, and derive its dependence on network topology and communication constraints. Moreover, we propose a hierarchical bit allocation scheme and a convex relaxation-based scheme for cooperative visual sensing, and compare their performance with the generalized Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, and Stone (GBFOS) algorithm and the uniform allocation scheme. Numerical results validate that our schemes achieve near-optimal sensing performance under communication constraints with a significant reduction of computation load.},

However, most of the existing studies consider the scenario of one task requester (TR) and ignore the fact that multiple TRs may concurrently request their model training tasks in the HetVNets. In this paper, we consider the scenario of multi-TR and multi-RU and propose a digital twins (DT) enabled on-demand matching scheme for multi-task federated learning to address the two-way selection problem between TRs and RUs. Specifically, by jointly considering the diversified requirements of the TRs and the differentiated training capabilities of the RUs, we first design a DT enabled on-demand matching architecture to facilitate the multi-task federated learning in the HetVNets. Then, based on the personalized requirement of the DT of each TR (DT-TR), a marginal utility based vehicle selection mechanism is proposed to enable the DT of each RU (DT-RU) to determine the customized model training strategy. With the determined strategies, the two-way selection problem between the DT-TRs and the DT-RUs is formulated as an on-demand matching game in DT networks, where a matching algorithm is designed to obtain their optimal strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional schemes in terms of training accuracy, performance-cost ratio (PCR), and task completion rate (TCR).},

However, choosing an appropriate caching policy and content placement poses another significant issue that has been acknowledged in this research. Conventional caching policies that are experimented with at the edge do not consider the dynamic and stochastic characteristics of edge caching. As a result, we have proposed a cooperative deep reinforcement learning algorithm that deals with the dynamic nature of content demand. It also ensures efficient use of storage through the cooperation between nodes. In addition, previous works on cooperative caching have assumed the users to be static and didn&#39;t consider the mobile nature of users. Therefore, we have proposed UAVs as aerial Base Stations (UAV-BS) to assist in peak hours where a ground base station is insufficient to support the surge in user requests. In this novel research, we have demonstrated the cooperation between aerial and Ground Base Stations (GBS) and aimed at maximizing the global cache hit ratio. Simulations have shown that our proposed Cooperative Multi-Agent Actor-Critic algorithm outperforms conventional and reinforcement learning based caching methods and achieves a state-of-the-art global cache hit ratio when there is a surge in user requests. Thus, it opens the door for further research on cooperative caching in joint air and ground architecture.},

  abstract     = {5G has been designed to support applications such as connected and automated driving. To this aim, 5G includes a highly flexible New Radio (NR) interface that can be configured to utilize different subcarrier spacings (SCS), slot durations, scheduling, and retransmissions mechanisms. This flexibility can be exploited to support advanced V2X services with strict latency and reliability requirements using V2N2V (Vehicle-to-Network-to-Vehicles) communications instead of direct or sidelink V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle). To analyze this possibility, this paper presents a novel analytical model that estimates the latency of 5G at the radio network level. The model accounts for the use of different numerologies (SCS, slot durations and Cyclic Prefixes), modulation and coding schemes, full-slots or mini-slots, semi-static and dynamic scheduling, different retransmission mechanisms, and broadcast/multicast or unicast transmissions. The model has been used to first analyze the impact of different 5G NR radio configurations on the latency. We then identify which radio configurations and scenarios can 5G NR satisfy the latency and reliability requirements of V2X services using V2N2V communications. This paper considers cooperative lane changes as a case study. The results show that 5G can support advanced V2X services at the radio network level using V2N2V communications under certain conditions that depend on the radio configuration, bandwidth, service requirements and cell traffic load.},

  abstract     = {Owning to the powerful support of 5G/B5G technologies, it is promising that, in a vehicular network, the ever-increasing demands for artificial intelligence applications along with privacy concerns can be fulfilled by introducing federated learning (FL) into vehicular networks. However, in such a 5G/B5G cellular-based vehicular network, distributed clients, i.e., vehicles, usually suffer from intermittent connectivity to the uplink base station (BS) due to the small cell networking and their mobility, and thereby the FL execution time and the learning performance cannot be guaranteed. In order to ensure a required execution time and the FL performance, we propose to investigate the client selection schemes in the uplink-downlink decoupled 5G/B5G networks. Due to the bursty feature of uplink transmissions, we first incorporate a flexible delay analytical tool, i.e., martingale theory, to characterize the access delay of each vehicle, and represent it in the form of delay violation probability. Then, given an energy budget, adjustable parameters are optimized to maximize the global learning performance. Supposing that all the clients participate in the FL and they can outperform the systematic FL performance requirement, the client selection methods under different criteria are further investigated. Especially, we propose a low-complexity algorithm to select clients in terms of enhancing energy efficiency. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed client selection method in both guaranteeing the FL execution time and meeting the systematic learning performance. The energy efficiency of the vehicular FL system can also be enhanced by employing the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The hidden node problem is one of the most challenging issue in Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS). The system models adopted by the existing Deep Learning-based spectrum sensing methods have not focused on modeling the hidden node scenario in cognitive radio networks. Further, these methods are unable to adapt to the dynamic channel conditions in the wireless environment since they have not considered the effect of fading environment. Motivated from these limitations, we propose GCN-CSS, a novel Graph Convolution Network (GCN) based cooperative spectrum sensing methodology which adapts to the dynamic changes in the Cognitive Radio Network. To the best of the author&#39;s knowledge, this is the first work to apply GCN for solving CSS problem. We have considered a practical system model which handles the dynamic channel condition i.e. SUs with multiple antennas experiencing different fading models with different fading severity. We have also catered the scenario of imperfect reporting channel between the SUs and the fusion centre along with the imperfect sensing channel to prove the robustness of the proposed model. With sufficient simulations, the superiority of the proposed methodology is proven in different dynamic scenarios of the wireless environment.},

  abstract     = {In the mega constellation, hundreds of satellites are launched into space to provide global coverage and high-quality service. The number of served user terminals (UTs) can be large-scale under such a dense distribution of satellites, which may lead to severe intra-constellation interference in uplink communications. Hence, it is quite necessary to analyze the intra-constellation interference and deduce analytical expressions of uplink performance in mega constellations to provide design principles for the constellation construction. In this paper, we investigate the uplink performance of mega constellations in terms of outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC) with actual antenna patterns under the poisson point process constellation model. The expressions that reveal the relationships between the uplink performance and network parameters are derived, by which the constellation scale that satisfies the demand of EC can be obtained. The accuracy of the analytical results is verified through extensive simulations. Our results indicate that the EC first increases but then diminishes as the scale increases if there is enough UTs to be served, which may provide an insight on the scale construction of a mega constellation.},

  abstract     = {Since security has been one of the crucial issues for high-yield communications such as 5G and 6G, researchers continuously come up with newer techniques to enhance the security and performance of these progressive wireless communications. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is one of those techniques that artificially rearrange and optimize the propagation environment of electromagnetic waves to improve both spectrum and energy efficiency of wireless networks. Besides, in underwater communication, underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) is a better alternative/replacement for conventional acoustic and radio frequency (RF) technologies. Hence, mixed RIS-aided RF-UOWC can be treated as a promising technology for future wireless networks. This work focuses on the secrecy performance of mixed dual-hop RIS-aided RF-UOWC networks under the intercepting effort of a probable eavesdropper. The RF link operates under generalized Gamma fading distribution; likewise, the UOWC link experiences the mixture exponential generalized Gamma distribution. The secrecy analysis subsumes the derivations of closed-form expressions for average secrecy capacity, exact and lower bound of secrecy outage probability, strictly positive secrecy capacity, and effective secrecy throughput, all in terms of Meijer&#39;s &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$G$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; functions. Capitalizing on these derivations, the effects of heterodyne and intensity modulation/direct detection systems, underwater turbulence resulting from air bubble levels, temperature gradients, and salinity gradients, are measured. Unlike conventional models that merely deal with thermally uniform scenarios, this proposed model is likely to be unique in terms of dealing with secrecy analysis of a temperature gradient RIS-aided RF-UOWC network. Lastly, the derivations are validated via Monte-Carlo simulations.},

We assume that the source node (secondary user) sends data to the destination node (secondary user) by means of multiple relay nodes (secondary users), and that the source and relays simultaneously share the same frequency band with primary users. Unlike previous research, this paper assumes the inputs to be practical finite-alphabet signals, such as phase shift keying (PSK). Our objective is to maximize the mutual information of the overall system by optimizing the precoders at the source and relays under the constraints of the transmit power at each node and the interference power to the primary users. The precoder designs in two channel state information (CSI) cases, where the nodes know the perfect or statistical CSI, are both investigated. The formulated optimization problems are nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard and nonconvex, so the global optimal solution cannot be found within the polynomial time. However, by exploiting the structures of the optimization problems, we develop a new framework, which combines the iterative rank penalty (IRP) algorithm with the customized Uzawa algorithm, to solve them. Simulation results are provided to verify the efficacy of the proposed precoding algorithms.},

We formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINIP) problem to maximize the sum achievable rate of all subcarriers by jointly optimizing the passive beamforming and subcarrier matching. To solve this problem, we first develop a branch-and-bound (BnB)-based alternating optimization algorithm for attaining a near-optimal solution. Then, a low-complexity difference-of-convex penalty-based algorithm and learning-to-optimize approach are also proposed. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the RIS-assisted OFDM relaying system achieves a substantial achievable rate gain as compared to that without RIS since RIS recasts the subcarrier matching and balances the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among different subcarrier pairs.},

Then, with this model, we propose a joint optimization problem to minimize the task execution delay of user equipments (UEs). Considering the trade-off between low delay and fairness of collaboration, we propose a historical cumulative contribution based inter-node collaboration algorithm (HCCCA) to derive the optimal task offloading and resource allocation decisions for FNs.

An iterative algorithm is proposed to solve these three subproblems.

  abstract     = {Spectrum sharing between radar and communication systems has attracted substantial recent research attention. In order to avoid the mutual interference, source separation of the aliasing signal is a promising solution for joint communication and radar (JCR) sensing. However, most of the existing source separation methods are very sensitive to wide-band signals with rapidly varying instantaneous amplitude (IA) and not applicable to scenarios with complex overlapping subsignals. To overcome the above limitations, a data-driven sparsity-based source separation method is proposed. Without depending on signal parameters, a sparse signal observation model of the received signal is established. Then, source separation is transformed into estimation of the IA and instantaneous frequency (IF), and an iterative method is developed. Moreover, the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the source separation error (SSE) variance is derived based on the CRLB of IA and IF. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method is superior to the benchmark schemes and is robust to noise and initial IF errors.},

  abstract     = {The novel concept of joint Compressive Sensing (CS) and Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) coding is conceived for Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) supporting a massive number of signals. More explicitly, we demonstrate this concept for a specific scheme, which supports a massive number of signals simultaneously, using a small number of Internet of Things Nodes (IoTNs) based on the concept of CS. The compressed signals are LDPC coded in order to protect them from poor transmission channels. We also propose the new iterative joint source-channel decoding philosophy for exchanging soft extrinsic information, which combines CS decoding and LDPC decoding by merging their respective factor graphs. We then characterize this scheme using Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart analysis. Our BLock Error Rate (BLER) results show that the proposed iterative joint LDPC-CS decoding scheme attains about 1.5 dB gain at a BLER of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$10^{-3}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; compared to a benchmarker, which employs separate CS and LDPC decoding. Naturally, this gain is achieved at the cost of approximately doubling the complexity of the proposed iterative joint LDPC-CS decoding scheme.},

By leveraging network functions virtualization (NFV) and software defined networking (SDN) technologies we provide a suitable environment for at-edge programmability to customize network functionalities for low latency services in multi-platooning systems for vehicular networks. We develop a responsive edge system by implementing control plane over pre-established access points (e.g., road-side units), allocating redundant resources, and utilizing an adaptive service migration mechanism in order to avoid any degradation of the quality of edge services. We design a robust double Knapsack (RDK) framework, where a spare knapsack of redundant resources is allocated to each plane to cope with the uncertainties of vehicle-provided resources.

  abstract     = {The world is moving towards a fully connected digital world, where objects produce and consume data, at a sultry pace. Autonomous vehicles will play a key role in bolstering the digitization of the world. These connected vehicles must communicate timely data with their surrounding objects and road participants to fully and accurately understand their environments and eventually operate smoothly. As a result, the hugely exchanged data would scramble the network traffic that, at a given point, would no longer increase the awareness level of the vehicle. In this paper, we propose a vision-based approach to identify connected vehicles and use it to optimize the exchange of collective perception messages (CPMs), in terms of both the CPM generation frequency and the number of generated CPMs. To validate our proposed approach, we created a Cartery framework that integrates SUMO, Carla, and OMNeT++. We also compared our solution with both baselines and European Telecommunications Standards Institute solutions, considering three main KPIs: the channel busy ratio, environmental awareness, and the CPM generation frequency. Simulation results show that our proposed solution exhibits the best trade-off between the network load and situational awareness.},

  abstract     = {Channel state information (CSI) estimation is part of the most fundamental problems in 5G wireless communication systems. In mobile scenarios, outdated CSI will have a serious negative impact on various adaptive transmission systems, resulting in system performance degradation. To obtain accurate CSI, it is crucial to predict CSI at future moments. In this paper, we propose an efficient channel prediction method in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which combines genetic programming (GP) with higher-order differential equation (HODE) modeling for prediction, named GPODE. In the first place, the variation of one-dimensional data is depicted by using higher-order differential, and the higher-order differential data is modeled by GP to obtain an explicit model. Then, a definite order condition is given for the modeling of HODE, and an effective prediction interval is given. In order to accommodate to the rapidly changing channel, the proposed method is improved by taking the rough prediction results of Autoregression (AR) model as a priori, i.e., Im-GPODE channel prediction method. Given the effective interval, an online framework is proposed for the prediction. To verify the validity of the proposed methods, We use the data generated by the Cluster Delay Line (CDL) channel model for validation. The results show that the proposed methods has higher accuracy than other traditional prediction methods.},

  abstract     = {The physical layer security (PLS) is investigated for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted wireless networks, where a source transmits its confidential information to a legitimate destination with the aid of a single small RIS in the presence of a malicious eavesdropper. A new joint RIS location and passive beamforming (J-LPB) optimization scheme is proposed for the sake of maximizing the secrecy rate under the RIS location constraint and the constraint that the modulus of the reflecting coefficient at each RIS&#39;s unit is not larger than 1. Specifically, we analyze the optimal location of the RIS, and conclude that the product involving the source-RIS distance and the RIS-destination distance should be minimized. Since the product minimization problem is nonconvex, we then propose a two-tier optimization algorithm for solving it. Based on the near-optimal RIS 3D location obtained, we further formulate the passive beamforming optimization problem, and then propose to apply the Charnes-Cooper transformation along with the sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SROCR) algorithm to solve it. Our numerical results show that the secrecy rate of the proposed J-LPB optimization scheme is higher than that of the benchmarks. Explicitly, we use the following benchmarks: the near-source-based RIS location and passive beamforming (NSB-LPB) optimization scheme, the near-destination-based RIS location and passive beamforming (NDB-LPB) optimization scheme, and the random RIS location and passive beamforming (R-LPB) optimization scheme. Finally, the benefits of our J-LPB scheme are further increased with the number of RIS units.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have been proposed as a promising technology to enhance signal transmissions in high-frequency bands. Up to now, the research on the performance of large networks with IRSs is still in its infancy. In this article, we study a Poisson bipolar network with line segment blockages and reflectors. By deriving the probability that an IRS can successfully reflect a signal from a transmitter to a receiver and the distribution of the distance traveled by the reflected signal, the performance impact of deploying IRSs on the signal propagation is investigated. The aggregated interference through reflective paths via IRSs is derived by modeling the IRSs as additional interfering sources with non-uniformly distributed interfering power in different directions. With these results, the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) and the achievable rate are further derived, where a characteristic function and the inverse theorem are adopted to handle the complicated channel fading of reflective signals. From the analysis, IRSs have a great potential to enhance the network performance, but the tradeoff between signal enhancement and reflective interference is important. That is, the performance gain suffers from a diminishing return with a large IRS fraction due to the growth of reflective interference.},

The algorithms are sensitive to channel estimation error, which makes the rate performance under imperfect channel state information (CSI) conditions become unsatisfactory. To deal with this, a relay assisted signal to interference plus noise ratio maximization (Relay-Max-SINR) algorithm is proposed in this work to improve the robustness of Max-SINR in MIMO ICs. Different from the traditional relay assisted using beamforming and forward transmission, we mathematically equivalent the signal processing process of relay to the receive filtering and transmit precoding, and design the relay processing matrix. In real communication process, the relay processing matrix is directly used for the signal processing at relay. Using the channel reciprocity, the receive filtering matrix at relay, the transmit precoding matrix at relay, the relay processing matrix, the receive filtering matrix at destination and the transmit precoding matrix at source are optimized iteratively according to the nature of generalized Rayleigh quotient. With the help of additional transmission links provided by the relay, interference is more effectively suppressed and the power loss of the desired signal is reduced. Simulations show that the proposed Relay-Max-SINR algorithm can significantly increase the capacity and the robustness of MIMO ICs.},

  abstract     = {Next-generation wireless networks are expected to support delay-sensitive applications such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). In AR/VR applications, computational jobs are offloaded to the edge computing server. Such offloading process requires transmissions of large data packets with low latency. Terahertz (THz) band can provide hundreds of GHz bandwidth and thus is promising in enabling ultra-high speed data transmissions. However, THz transmission distance is limited due to its inherently severe propagation loss. This paper considers to improve THz transmission distance with the help of mobile computing. The key idea is that, if mobile devices can handle partial computational jobs, the data transmission rate requirement is lowered, which in turn helps to improve THz transmission distance. Specifically, we aim to maximize THz transmission distance by jointly optimizing users&#39; job offloading decisions and transmission carrier frequencies. To that end, we first introduce a delay-violation probability to characterize the delay constraints for delay-sensitive services. Based on the derived delay-violation probability, we formulate a THz transmission distance maximization (THz-TDM) problem. This THz-TDM problem is non-convex. To solve this issue, we derive in closed-form the expression of the achievable transmission distance with respect to carrier frequency and data rate. Subsequently, we propose a Hungarian-ADMM based iterative algorithm (HAB) and a low-complexity Rearrangement Inequality-like algorithm (RIL). The proposed RIL involves no iterations but only applies to the case where the edge computing server queue stability constraint is relaxed. Numerical results show that the developed schemes can effectively improve THz transmission distance.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes Kalman combining-based iterative detection and decoding (KC-IDD) schemes for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). The conventional Kalman filtering (KF) operation for Kalman combining performs the linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) detection with symbol-level combining (SLC), but it is unable to utilize a priori information of retransmitted symbols. Therefore, a new KF operation is derived, wherein an observation adjustment is employed to adjust the observation for a given state of the state-space model with the a priori information instead of directly utilizing it into the KF operation. Based on the modified KF operation, two KC-IDD schemes are developed: i) KC-IDD with the single-state observation adjustment, i.e., the observation adjustment for the current HARQ round, and ii) KC-IDD with multi-state observation adjustment (KC-IDD-MS), i.e., the observation adjustments throughout the HARQ rounds of a packet. Therefore, the proposed schemes can perform SLC-based LMMSE-IDD, where the complexity for a given number of turbo iterations is similar or smaller to that of the conventional LMMSE-IDD scheme with bit-level combining (BLC). Furthermore, the simulation results show that regardless of the retransmission strategy, the proposed schemes, especially the KC-IDD-MS scheme, outperformed the conventional LMMSE-IDD scheme in terms of error performance and decoding convergence speed for retransmissions.},

UAVs can typically be adopted as aerial base stations to collect data from ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, the Ground-to-Air link of UAV-based IoT communications is prone to be interfered by surrounding WiFi devices in the Industrial, Scientific, Medical (ISM) band. This paper aims to enable reliable uplink communications for IoT devices in 5 GHz ISM bands, thereby reducing the hover time and energy consumption of the UAV. To this end, we first study and design suppression frames suitable for WiFi devices. Then a suppression method is proposed, which is shown to be effective for all the tested devices, based on emulation performance verification of the frames for multiple commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) WiFi devices. Moreover, by taking the energy consumption of the UAV and multiple transmission parameters of the suppression method into account, we formulate an optimization problem for the desired uplink, which is designed to minimize the energy consumption of the UAV, under the constraints of satisfying the link channel capacity. Given that the optimization problem is non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming, this paper proposes an efficient algorithm that takes advantage of the suppression performance of the utilized frames. Numerical simulations demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of the WiFi device density, UAV weight, channel capacity requirement and parameters of the suppression method. The communication quality of the desired Ground-to-Air link is shown to be significantly improved, while the consumed energy is demonstrated to be obviously reduced.},

In this article, we study the sum spectral efficiency (SE) of a multi-user communication system aided by an RIS. As opposed to previous works that assume independent and identically distributed block-fading channel models, we focus on a realistic scenario with the impact of channel aging due to user mobility and the spatial correlation among the reflecting elements of the RIS. Particularly, we first present a joint pragmatic model which encompasses the impact of channel estimation error and channel aging that facilitate the analytical derivations for the sum SE of the RIS-aided system. On this basis, we formulate the joint transmit beamforming and phase shift design as a nonconvex optimization problem to maximize the system sum SE. To address the design problem, we propose an efficient suboptimal channel aging-aware precoding (CAP) algorithm to obtain efficient suboptimal solutions for the considered problem capitalizing on the generalized fractional programming, the alternating direction method of multipliers method, and the alternating optimization method. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and illustrate the impact of key system and channel parameters on the system performance. Our analysis unveils that a higher transmit power at the base station, a larger value of temporal correlation coefficients, a larger number and the size of RIS elements are beneficial to the system performance.},

  abstract     = {With the development of the new generation communications, unmanned aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BSs) have been widely used to enhance the terrestrial communications. Because of the increasing demand for communication, the scale of the networks is constantly expanding. This paper investigates a joint channel access and power control optimization in large-scale UAV coverage networks, and proposes a hierarchical mean field game approach. Firstly, considering the quality of service (QoS) requirement and energy consumption, the cost function of UAV-BSs is designed. A joint channel access and power control optimization framework is built to improve the efficiency of resource utilization by minimizing the cost function. Then, the joint optimization problem is formulated as a hierarchical game model whose exterior is a channel access game and interior is a multiple mean fields game (MMFG). The channel access game is proved to be a potential game and have at least one Nash Equilibrium (NE). As feedback for channel access optimization, power control policy is obtained by MMFG. A near-optimal algorithm for joint optimizations is designed to achieve the NE. Besides, aiming to the networks with limited computing capability, we also propose a fast optimization approach. The original optimization problem is divided into two independent sub-problems. The channel optimization sub-problem is formulated as a local altruistic game model, then the power policy sub-problem is solved by MMFG. A distributed algorithm based on spatial adaptive play and better response is proposed. Finally, the simulation results verify the validity of the proposed algorithms. The near-optimal optimization method has a better performance while the fast optimization method has a higher speed of the convergence. Compared with the traditional approaches, both of them improve resources utilization efficiency greatly.},

  abstract     = {A new hybrid dynamic mode decomposition (HDMD) algorithm is proposed to estimate the azimuth and elevation angles of multiple independent sources for two-dimensional (2D) massive MIMO systems with the uniform rectangular array (URA). To this end, the proposed hybrid scheme integrates the modified DMD with the augmented DMD. By treating the received data as spatial-spatial correlated signals, the modified DMD is first used to decompose these signals into spatial DMD spectrum and corresponding spatial dynamic modes. The obtained spatial DMD spectrum directly yields the electrical angle in the y-direction. Then, the corresponding electrical angle in the x-direction is computed using augmented DMD on the spatial dynamic modes. Finally, the azimuth and elevation angles are extracted through the inversion relationship within the URA. This correlated decomposition method automatically matches estimated azimuth and elevation angles. Moreover, the spatial DMD spectrum can determine the number of signal sources, enabling the method to be used without prior knowledge of the source number. Some numerical examples are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. It is found that compared with other similar methods, the proposed method has better performance in 2D angles estimation. Therefore, our work provides an efficient source localization technique for massive MIMO systems.},

To this end, a multicarrier-division duplex (MDD) mMIMO scheme associated with two types of well-designed frame structures are introduced for combating channel aging when communicating over fast time-varying channels. For comparison, the corresponding TDD frame structures related to the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards and their variant forms are presented. The MDD-specific general Wiener predictor and decision-directed Wiener predictor are introduced to predict the channel state information, respectively, in the time domain based on UL pilots and in the frequency domain based on the detected UL data, considering the impact of residual self-interference (SI). Moreover, by applying the zero-forcing precoding and maximum ratio combining, the closed-form approximations for the lower bounded rate achieved by TDD and MDD frame structures over time-varying channels are derived. Our main conclusion from this study is that the MDD, endowed with the capability of full-duplex but less demand on SI cancellation than in-band full-duplex (IBFD), outperforms both the conventional TDD and IBFD in combating channel aging.},

Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) and Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing are considered vital mechanisms of upcoming NG systems as they allow creation of end-to-end isolated RAN slices and increase of serving mobile data traffic on edge. The efficient deployment of RAN functions promises flexible and disaggregated architectures for the diversified needs of NG networks. In this work, we propose a novel optimization approach that minimizes RAN/MEC economic costs and maximizes served traffic. This framework creates isolated RAN slices by optimal placement of RAN and MEC functions per slice, which solves the problem of operating cost-efficient edge networks and increases the served traffic with diverse QoS requirements. We first formulate our framework as a convex and linear problem and then decompose it using a distributed method that accelerates the performance and guarantees the optimal global solution. Our results show that our proposed work better uses the spectrum, and there is a trade-off between the achieved throughput and the cost incurred to the network.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided downlink cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is studied, wherein the baseband unit (BBU) pool communicates with the users through multiple remote radio heads (RRH). Specifically, the IRSs are deployed to assist both the wireless fronthaul link and the user access link. Due to the limitation of the fronthaul capacity, the BBU pool deals with the baseband signals by point-to-point compression or multivariate compression and sends the quantization bits to the RRHs via the fronthaul link. Considering the imperfect channel state information (CSI) for both the conventional direct channel and the IRS cascaded channel, we investigate the robust design by jointly optimizing the transmit beamformers for BBU pool and RRHs, the passive beamformer for IRSs and the fronthaul compression under point-to-point compression and multivariate compression, respectively. Specifically, we derive the closed-form user downlink rate and the achievable rate for the wireless fronthaul under imperfect CSI. To tackle the non-convex problem, we adopt the successive convex approximation (SCA) approach and transform it into a tractable form. Then utilizing the alternating optimization (AO) approach, we divide the transformed problem into three sub-problems which can be efficiently solved. Furthermore, since the fronthaul link and access link work on time division duplex (TDD) mode, we also discuss the joint optimization taking the time allocation into consideration. Finally, via numerical results, the effectiveness of the proposed robust design is verified.},

  abstract     = {Unlicensed spectrum offers opportunities for cellular mobile network operators, where traffic can be offloaded from licensed to unlicensed bands. Modern heterogeneous technologies such as 5G and WiFi can simultaneously operate on ISM and UNII bands under strict coexistence rules. While satisfying harmonious coexistence has largely been studied in LTE/4G, an emerging issue for future deployment is to reduce latency and to guarantee reliable communications, in the direction of achieving URLLC. This work mainly focuses on the critical issues arising in the coexistence of LBT systems, sharing common infrastructure of 5G NR-U and WiFi when operating under imperfect energy detection sensing. We consider the application of short, concatenated and product erasure correcting codes to recover missing data due to collisions in LBT-based systems. The goal is to enhance spectrum utilization with reduced delay and to achieve reliable communications under various sensing impairments, with code parameters such as block length, rate and minimum distance. Using concatenation, we construct a series of sophisticated erasure block codes with less decoding complexity. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression using Gaussian approximation of spectrum utilization efficiency. The results are compared with the various LDPC correcting ensembles under various levels of user activities. We provide detailed comparisons of global throughput and failure probability of codes under varied number of coexisting users. Our results show that the proposed codes can achieve over 20% higher efficiency at 0.1 false alarm probability and 30% less failure probability under high contention scenarios.},

This paper studies a RIS-assisted generalized spatial modulation (GSM) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system to improve the signal quality and spectral efficiency. Due to inter-channel interference, signal detection in GSM becomes a critical issue. Therefore, we propose a low complexity block deep neural network (DNN) detector for the RIS-GSM MIMO system to detect the active antennas and the transmitted symbols at the receiver. In order to optimize the phase shifts at the RIS elements, we propose cosine similarity-based and semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithms. Further, conventional signal detectors such as maximum likelihood (ML), block zero-forcing (B-ZF), and block minimum mean square error (B-MMSE) are applied. In addition, we explore and analyze the performance of the proposed framework in terms of bit error rate (BER) and time complexity. Numerical results reveal that both optimize-phase-shifts algorithms assisted DNN signal detector has almost the same BER performance as ML, but it is four times faster than the linear detector (B-ZF and B-MMSE), and seven times faster than ML. Clearly, this scheme outperforms the alternative traditional signal detectors with the least time complexity.},

The proposed scheme, namely Turbo DSIC, is practical in terms of training and computational complexity thanks to its two-stage structure such that complex nonlinear parameter learning (NPL) is conducted very rarely in the first stage, and linear processing is performed adaptively at symbol-rate in the second stage, where SoI is iteratively estimated at each data block and eliminated from the received signal to improve SI channel estimation accuracy.

The spatial &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\Sigma -\Delta$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; structure is one important manner that can recover the amplitude information from one-bit quantized signals. In this paper, we demonstrate that the upper bound of the spatial degree of quantization noise reduction (DQNR) is 3 for the considered spatial &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\Sigma -\Delta$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; structure. However, the upper bound is hard to be achieved via the zero forcing (ZF) or the maximum ratio combination (MRC) schemes, and the achieved spatial DQNR is even not greater than 1 in the worst case. Thus the distortion suppression is inefficient. To address this issue, we propose a random beam shaping (RBS) scheme and prove it can achieve the spatial DQNR of 3. Through the random beam shaping, the beams are smeared into the whole beamspace. Meanwhile, the random beam shaping results in the power leakage of the beams and it may limit the distortion suppression when considering the additive noise. To reduce the power leakage, we further propose an accurate beam shaping (ABS) scheme, in which the vector for the beam shaping is optimized through the alternative minimization algorithm and the beams are concentrated around the region with low power of quantization noise. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed beam shaping schemes can more efficiently exploit the large-scale antenna array to recover the amplitude information.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates user scheduling and trajectory optimization for a network supported by an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The IRS is powered via the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) technique. The IRS boosts users uplink signals to improve the network longevity and energy efficiency. It simultaneously harvests energy with a non-linear energy harvesting circuit and reflects the incident signals by controlling its reflection coefficients and phase shifts. The trajectory of the UAV impacts the efficiency of these operations. We minimize the maximum energy consumption of all users by joint optimization of user scheduling, UAV trajectory/velocity, and IRS phase shifts/reflection coefficients while guaranteeing each user minimum required data rate and harvested energy of the IRS. We first derive a closed-form solution for the IRS phase shifts and then address the non-convexity of the critical problem. Finally, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to optimize the remaining variables iteratively. We demonstrate the gains over several benchmarks. For instance, with a 50-element IRS, min-max energy consumption can be as low as 0.0404 (Joule), a 7.13% improvement over the No IRS case (achieving 0.0435 (Joule)). We also show that IRS-UAV without EH performs best at the cost of circuit power consumption of the IRS (a 20% improvement over the No IRS case).},

However, IM significantly increases the complexity of the receiver and needs accurate channel estimation to guarantee its performance. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we design a deep learning (DL) based detector for the IM aided MIMO (IM-MIMO) systems. We first formulate the detection process as a sparse reconstruction problem by utilizing the inherent attributes of IM. Then, based on greedy strategy, we design a DL based detector, called IMRecoNet, to realize this sparse reconstruction process. Different from the general neural networks, we introduce complex value operations to adapt the complex signals in communication systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt that introduce complex valued neural network to the design of detector for the IM-MIMO systems. Finally, to verify the adaptability and robustness of the proposed detector, simulations are carried out with consideration of inaccurate channel state information (CSI) and correlated MIMO channels. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed detector outperforms existing algorithms in terms of antenna recognition accuracy and bit error rate under various scenarios.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the joint problem of recursive channel estimation and robust beamformer design in peer-to-peer communication through a network of relays over time-varying radio channels. Using observed signal samples at the relay and receiver nodes, the Channel State Information (CSI) is estimated centrally by taking advantage of a Markov model for the transmitter-relay and relay-receiver channels, and employing either the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or the Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF). Based on the estimated CSI, two robust approaches are conceived for designing the relay beamforming where the aim is to minimize the total transmission power of the relays subject to Signal-to-Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) constraints at each of the receiver nodes. Furthermore, the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) approach for mixing non-stationary and stationary Markov models is employed to extend the time-varying robust beamforming design to non-stationary environments. Through numerical simulations, the recursive CSI estimation methods are shown to be efficient, i.e., unbiased and converging to the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). Furthermore, the results confirm the better performance of the proposed robust relay beamforming design algorithms compared to existing methods in terms of relevant transmission metrics, including relay power consumption and spectral efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Satellite communication is capable of supporting seamless global coverage. However, owing to the reliance on limited-duration solar power, the high power amplifier (HPA) is often driven close to its saturation point, which leads to severe nonlinear distortion in satellite channels. Thus, mitigating the effect of the nonlinear distortion becomes essential for reliable communications. In this article, we propose an efficient joint channel estimation and data detection method based on message passing within the associated factor graph modelling the HPA employed in nonlinear satellite channels. Then, we develop a combined belief propagation and mean field (BP-MF) method to cope with the hard constraints and dense short loops on the factor graph. In particular, the parametric message updating expressions relying on the canonical parameters are derived in the symbol detection part. To alleviate the impact of dense loops, we reformulate the system model into a compact form within the channel estimation part and then reconstruct a loop-free subgraph associated with vector-valued nodes to guarantee convergence. Furthermore, the proposed BP-MF method is also extended to the realistic scenario of having unknown noise variance. To further reduce the computational complexity of the large-scale matrix inversion of channel estimation, the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm is employed to decouple the vector of channel coefficient estimation into a series of scalar estimations. Simulation results show that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art benchmarks both in terms of bit error rate performance and channel estimation accuracy.},

  abstract     = {To estimate the master cylinder pressure of the electro-hydraulic brake system (EHB) accurately and robustly, this paper proposes a master cylinder pressure estimation method (MCPE) based on modeling and fusion of the friction character and the pressure-position character of EHB. First, the kinetic equation of EHB is established based on Newton&#39;s Law. Second, the sliding friction in EHB is theoretically analyzed and tested under multi conditions (e.g., rack speed, individual difference, wear and temperature). Test results show that the sliding friction is stable except for conditions below −25 °C. The static friction in EHB is derived from EHB&#39;s kinetic equation. Based on the above, a novel robust Karnopp friction model is established. Third, the pressure-position relationship of EHB is tested under multi conditions (e.g., rack speed, brake circuit, parking brake state, brake pair wear and temperature). Test results show that the pressure-position relationship is susceptible to all the tested conditions. The influence of rack speed on pressure-position relationship is further analyzed and a novel dynamic pressure-position model is established, which incorporates a static term and a dynamic term. Vehicle test verifies the superiority of the dynamic pressure-position model in terms of response speed and accuracy. Furthermore, a robust MCPE is proposed by combining the kinetic equation of EHB, which incorporates the proposed novel friction model, and the dynamic pressure-position model based on recursive least square algorithm with a forgetting factor. Finally, the accuracy and robustness of the proposed MCPE is demonstrated by vehicle test under multi braking conditions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the adaptive clustering quasi-line search path planning algorithm (ACPP) is proposed from the viewpoint of non-convex optimization in an artificial potential field (APF). In ACPP, the initial path is the trajectory of the optimization process from the initial point to the target one. In a complex environment, the drivable area is divided by the edges into many relatively isolated regions, which leads to a non-convex path planning problem. Therefore, the clustering based on path nodes is set adaptively to make the potential function of each isolated region convex in the potential field. In each isolated region, the environment can be perceived by updating the parameters with sampling based on probability distribution functions, and these functions have similar influence to the cost function in optimization. Inspired by convex optimization, the quasi-line search algorithm is proposed for sampling points. Therefore, ACPP reduces the number of samples, dramatically, and has advantages of both sampling-based and APF-based algorithms in path planning. Based on the line segment based map which can be obtained from sensors readily, a gridding strategy is used to further reduce the time complexity. A series of simulation and experiential results validate the effectiveness of ACPP in virtual and real-world environments, respectively.},

The Formula-Student competition was chosen as testing environment because of direct access to a real car and, hence, to all the data needed for this study, which can be fully disclosed at the same time. To estimate the optimum braking point, a simulation of the track section ahead is performed using a multidimensional approach to model not only longitudinal and lateral acceleration, but also combined acceleration scenarios. A lap identification system as well as live track analysis tools were developed in order to obtain track data that cannot be measured directly. To evaluate the overall grip conditions, a tire model, using both a wheel load and a two-track model, is implemented, which includes a dynamic calibration feature designed to adapt the system to the changing conditions of the circuit. It can be seen that the simulation provides a detailed profile of the maximum permitted velocities for every point in front of the real vehicle, and that this can be used to create a reliable prediction of the braking points along the track. Furthermore, a concept based on physiological fundamentals was developed and investigated in terms of human reaction times in order to meet the requirements of an intuitive human-machine interface. Our results demonstrate that it can be successfully used to automatically compensate for driver delays, improve the trust in the system and ensure safe operation. We conclude that our new system can reduce lap times, depending on the length and number of curves, by a significant amount of time (tens of a second).},

To pursue accurate state-of-charge estimation, battery electric circuit model-based algorithms demand minimized modeling error from accurate parameter identifications. Typical online parameter identification algorithms: least square fitting approach and recursive least square fitting are commonly adopted but have their limitations and issues with continuously providing accurate identification results. To overcome their problems and utilize their strengths, this paper proposes a condition-based parameter identification switching algorithm. The proposed algorithm accurately and robustly identifies the lithium-ion batteries&#39; parameters based on the battery data condition and the adoption of Bollinger bands. By minimizing the modeling error, the accuracy of the state-of-charge estimation is thus improved. The electric vehicle simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm can improve the parameter identification accuracy by an average of 70.80% and 44.95% reduction in the mean absolute parameter identification error, compared to typical least square fitting and recursive least square fitting approaches. With the help of the minimized modeling error, the state-of-charge estimation accuracy can thus be improved, rendering an average of 62.44% and 21.49% improvement.},

A controllable inerter is designed and its nonlinearity is identified based on the bench experiment to realize the proposed impedance-based control. The hybrid weighting coefficient of the skyhook and groundhook in impedance-based control is determined via the 95th percentile aggregate fourth-power force. The numerical analysis demonstrates that the proposed impedance-based control in the ideal model and the nonlinear model can both enhance the suspension performance in ride comfort and road friendly significantly. Furthermore, the impedance-based control can be surprisingly simple as the traditional skyhook damper control and much easier for realization than the feedback-based control strategies. In addition, the influence of nonlinearity and sprung mass on suspension performance verifies that the designed suspension can maintain stability under different working conditions. In conclusion, the impedance-based control manifests a great prospect in vibration control and provides a new design principle for the vibration control system.},

  abstract     = {In order to reduce the driving cost of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, a novel energy management strategy integrating deep reinforcement learning and rule based on condition identification is proposed. Firstly, principal component analysis is used to reduce the dimension of kinematic sequences features, and fuzzy clustering is used to classify the kinematics sequences, and then the working conditions are reorganized according to the classification results to obtain the three kinds of training conditions, and learning vector quantization neural network is used to train and identify the type of working conditions. Then, the rule taking engine torque, state of charge, and motor torque as control variables and driving mode as output is designed, which is integrated into the agent of deep reinforcement learning. Combined with the designed energy management strategy trained under three working conditions, the numerical simulation is carried out under the verification working condition based on condition identification, the simulation results are systematically analyzed to show the effectiveness of the designed energy management strategy.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a hypothesis test-constrained robust Kalman filter for INS/GNSS (inertial navigation system/global navigation satellite system) integrated navigation in the presence of measurement outliers. This method estimates measurement noise covariance by combining hypothesis test with the maximum likelihood theory to handle measurement outliers. A chi square test and an improved sequential probability ratio test are established to characterize abrupt and slow-growing measurement outliers, respectively. Subsequently, these two hypothesis tests are used to constrain the maximum likelihood estimation of measurement noise covariance to accommodate measurement outliers. Based on the hypothesis test-constrained maximum likelihood estimation of measurement noise covariance, a robust Kalman filter is developed for INS/GNSS integrated navigation in the presence of measurement outliers. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively deal with measurement outliers. The resultant navigation accuracy is about 46% and 30% higher than that of the Kalman filter and maximum likelihood-based robust Kalman filter for INS/GNSS integrated navigation.},

  abstract     = {Configuration design, component sizing, and energy management are intertwined. However, the full potential of hybrid powertrains has not yet been thoroughly investigated due to the multi-dimensional design space. Therefore, in this paper, a joint optimization method combining particle swarm optimization (PSO) and convex programming (CP) is proposed for the first time. In the outer loop, the PSO algorithm searches for the optimal design for the powertrain configuration. In contrast, the component size and power management are simultaneously optimized by the CP algorithm in the inner loop. A combined driving cycle is designed to integrate both acceleration and energy-saving performance, where an extreme acceleration driving process is intended to act as the acceleration constraint. The results show that, compared to Prius 1st, the acceleration and total cost-saving of the optimal 1-PG (planetary gear) powertrain are improved by 13.09% and 11.08%, respectively. In particular, the acceleration and total cost-saving of the optimal 2-PG powertrain (MG2-RSG) are upgraded by 34.23% and 15.18%, respectively. Finally, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are verified by comparing it with dynamic programming (DP) and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on the decomposition (MOEA/D) method.},

Simulation results indicate that the performance of our method is much better than some other methods in lane-changing gap choice and trajectory execution. Moreover, the traffic system controlled by the evolutionary algorithms reaches the highest capacity and safest level when all vehicles are equipped with cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) systems. On the contrary, the scenario with 50% CACC vehicles shows the lowest travel efficiency and the worst safety because of the CACC vehicles’ degradation. Furthermore, three iterations and 500 vehicle trajectories at each optimization cycle are recommended for the application in the off-ramp traffic control.},

This paper develops a reduced order Thau observer by only considering the uncertain rotational dynamics, which are re-constructed as the dominant linear and non-linear for the design purpose. Therefore, the proposed Thau observer is just third order and can reveal a rotational state estimation error in the presence of the quadrotor faults. This paper also equips the proposed Thau observer with a simple online adaptive fault estimation law, which is able to recognize up to two faulty actuators instantly using the estimated rotational state error. Lyapunov analysis confirms the error convergence in both the Thau observer states and the adaptive fault estimates. In addition, this paper constructs a batch type least-squares projection approach to quantify the magnitude percentages of the actuator failures. Moreover, to show the feasibility of the proposed algorithm, this paper extensively analyses the fault detection and diagnosis results performed in the simulation and real-time environments. Finally, to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm, it is compared with a recent Kalman filter based quadrotor fault estimation research under the equal conditions.},

As a supplement, a customized dynamic programming (DP) method for the problem is introduced to verify the validity of the proposed solution framework.

  abstract     = {Complex traffic scenarios pose a challenge to the cooperation control of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Conventional platoon control or advanced driver-assistance systems only provide an isolated solution due to their inadequacies in systematic perspective. To this end, a multi-agent system (MAS) based distributed control architecture together with a hierarchical controller is proposed for the CAVs cooperation control system. The upper layer considers the potential states of a CAV in the platoon evolution (i.e., vehicle-cruising maneuver and vehicle-following maneuver) and elaborates the transition rules for discrete maneuvering behaviors. The lower layer includes the corresponding motion controller for each CAV. Artificial potential field (APF) combined with the distributed model predictive control algorithm is adopted to realize the integrated longitudinal, lateral and yaw motion control of CAVs. Next, inspired by the Pareto-optimal method for tackling the MAS-cooperation system, an optimal solution strategy is introduced to solve the CAVs cooperation problem from the viewpoint of the control theory. Furthermore, multi-constraints are designed to ensure a safety inter-vehicle spacing between CAVs, while the vehicle stability can also be guaranteed. The simulation results demonstrate that the MAS-based hierarchical control architecture can effectively handle the cooperation control of CAVs in the typical traffic scenarios. The real-time implementation of the proposed controller also proves the feasibility.},

Subsequently, based on the integration of disturbance observer, high-order sliding mode and backstepping technologies, distributed and decentralized continuous fixed-time formation tracking control schemes under actuator faults are developed of the HMASs in the X-Y axis and Z axis, respectively. The proposed algorithm can not only handle time-varying formation in a timely manner, but also provide continuous control action under fixed and switching topologies.

  abstract     = {In the context of automotive applications, complex tasks such as automatic driving of electric vehicles are handled through the composition of several components, each offering a different service. Such component composition is not straightforward and is often subject to bugs that might stem mainly from the incompatibility of services. In other words, in this context, which includes critical services and in which people&#39;s life is at stake, detecting and eliminating bugs early at the design stage is crucial and even mandatory. To remedy this issue, we propose in this paper a formal approach for modeling and verifying the reliability of electric self-driving vehicles that are continuously communicating with off-road infrastructures. First, for the modeling phase, SysML language is used to model the system architecture and to specify the connections between its embedded components. Second, we present a formal verification approach based on the extended interface automata formalism to verify the compatibility between the interacting components, and to check whether this set of components achieve their required tasks. This formalism allows to specify component interfaces that exhibit component protocols and system non-functional constraints. The proposed approach permits an algorithmic verification to decide whether a set of components, when assembled together, fulfill compatibility conditions. Results in this paper show, on one hand, that SysML and extended interface automata formalism are relevant to model and capture component features in the context of automotive systems, on the other hand, that our methodology allows to develop autonomous electric vehicle systems correct-by-design, regarding to component compatibility.},

  abstract     = {Traffic prediction plays an essential role in many real-world applications ranging from route planning to vehicular communications. The goal of making accurate prediction is challenging due to the dynamic and various spatial-temporal correlations in traffic network. Numerous methods have been proposed to capture the spatial-temporal correlations, however, there are two major challenges: i ) The task of synchronously capturing dynamic and various spatial-temporal correlations has not been fully explored yet. ii ) Lack of an adaptive mechanism to model different influences caused by different external factors. To overcome these challenges, we propose a unified spatial-temporal attention network entitled USTAN. First, it constructs the spatial neighbor graph and the temporal neighbor array to describe the spatial and temporal correlations respectively. By expanding the spatial neighbors in temporal perspective according to the temporal neighbor array, all the spatial-temporal neighbors can be gathered together.

  abstract     = {In this paper, the predictive data-driven control of Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) systems is investigated to improve the energy efficiency of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Algorithms in AVs are expected to autonomously adapt and optimize themselves with different drive cycle conditions using the collected data during driving operation. We propose a Data Driven Control (DDC) framework for the speed ratio of CVTs in AVs which can learn the optimum pattern from archived real data. It includes a data archiving cycle in which the required DDC input/output signals of the vehicle are recorded. A DDC framework then runs in the driving cycle which includes a rolling optimization problem. More specifically, we use a predictive DDC algorithm to learn the optimal CVT speed ratio during the driving cycle instead of using the traditional pre-defined mapping. Using this framework, the CVT controller can adapt itself to any drive cycle by appropriately collecting data during the archiving cycle. The proposed control framework shows a satisfactory performance in HWFET and NEDC drive cycles. It reduces energy consumption by 1–5% compared to the pre-defined mappings.},

This article formulates such a lane-free crossing of intersections as a multi-objective optimal control problem (OCP) that minimises the overall crossing time, as well as the energy consumption due to the acceleration of CAVs. The constraints that avoid collision of vehicles with each other and with road boundaries are smoothed by applying the dual problem theory of convex optimisation. The developed algorithm is capable of finding the lower boundary of the crossing time of a junction which can be used as a benchmark for comparing other intersection crossing algorithms. Simulation results show that the lane-free crossing time is better by an average of 40% as compared to the state-of-the-art reservation-based method, whilst consuming the same amount of energy. Furthermore, it is shown that the lane-free crossing time through intersections is fixed to a constant value regardless of the number of CAVs.},

Most current autonomous driving algorithms make braking and stopping decisions in a traffic emergency. However, such decisions may not be optimal. In this paper, we study the optimal collision avoidance decision-making method for emergencies. To address this challenge, we propose a cooperative decision-making scheme for CAVs in an emergency. Unlike previous decision-making methods, our scheme enables vehicles to avoid collisions by indicating the optimal emergency destinations, which leads to a new task: the prediction of the optimal collision avoidance destination. In the proposed scheme, the potential collision avoidance destinations are evaluated based on a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model, and we propose a safety evaluation map (SEM) to describe the evaluation results. The cooperative ability of CAVs is considered in the proposed scheme, and a well-designed reward function is applied to train the DRL model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately evaluate potential collision avoidance destinations and is effective in reducing traffic accident rates and accident damage in various traffic emergencies compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the rise of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has driven the broad development of intelligent transportation and smart cities. In order to promote the computing power of mobile vehicles and decrease the content delivery latency of suppliers, mobile edge computing (MEC) is recognized as a promising computational paradigm and used in vehicular networks. However, there are some essential issues to be considered: 1) privacy and authenticity of data transmission in IoV, and 2) reasonable resource allocation for collaborative computing and caching. In this paper, to solve above issues, blockchain technology is introduced and adopted to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data transmission and interaction. Meanwhile, we develop an intelligent framework of resource allocation about computing and caching for blockchain-enabled MEC systems in IoV. Through jointly considering and optimizing offloading decision of computation task carried by vehicle, caching decision, the number of offloaded consensus nodes, block interval and block size, the weighted consumption costs of energy consumption and computation overheads can be decreased, and the transactional throughput of the blockchain can be increased. Moreover, due to the continuity and dynamic of the available resources of mobile vehicles and computing servers, the optimization problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). Facing the large-scale and dynamic characteristics of the system, the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) approach is introduced to deal with the optimization problem.

In the first case, a Gaussian error function (GEF) is applied to replace the nonsmooth actuator saturation of each vehicle in a smooth way. Then, a finite-time prescribed performance function (FNPPF) is proposed, which guarantees the tracking error of the platoon system converges to a predetermined region in a defined time. Subsequently, by combing the fuzzy-logic system (FLS) and parameter learning algorithm, an adaptive control scheme is developed in the context of sliding mode control, which guarantees all signals in the closed-loop system are practically finite-time stable. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out for a six-vehicle platoon to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

However, to the best of our knowledge, such a topic is yet to be investigated in depth. This work aims to fill such a gap by introducing a new range estimation method. The method takes only 3 samples from the rising edge of the received pulse and combines two simple estimation techniques: time-domain edge detection and frequency-domain phase estimation. The proposed method was demonstrated over a dynamic range of 45 dB, proving to be robust over the entire interval. Sub-centimeter precision and accuracy were achieved over a dynamic range of 24 dB. The obtained estimations are bounded by a derived theoretical limit that is identical to a Cramér-Rao lower bound of a phase estimator.},

The realization of future intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) will require V2V communication technology, which in turn relies on accurate V2V channel estimation. As the possibilities that 5G technologies can be used for V2V communications are increasingly being explored, corresponding channel models used to describe the characteristics of V2V channels are also being updated, so the new channel estimation algorithms needed to be developed. Although the channel estimation method based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has achieved remarkable success in communication problems in recent years, it cannot be well adapted to V2V channels under different scenarios and different modeling methods. In this article, a method is proposed for learning and estimating the channel structure in the 5G NR downlink that can adapt to the V2V channel under multi-scenes. The inherent block sparsity characteristics of the channel structure is adopted to combine the group lasso Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm with CNN, and residual dense network is employed to estimate and refine the V2V channel structure. Furthermore, the classifier and interpolation with pooling method are used to estimate the V2V channel structure under multi-scene and multi-resolution. Simulation results show that the performance of this method is better than other deep learning based estimation algorithms.},

In order to improve the long-term cache-hit-ratio (CHR), a federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL) framework is proposed, in which multiple fog access points (FAPs) adjust their caching strategies under the coordination of a central server (CS). Owing to the non-i.i.d data acquired over different FAPs, the traditional federated learning (FL) method may suffer from performance loss due to maintaining a global model at the CS. To address this shortcoming, a partially collaborative caching (PCC) algorithm is proposed by switching the data training between two models that are maintained at each FAP, to achieve a balance between the users&#39; specific local characteristics and holistic global characteristics. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that significant performance gains are achieved by the proposed FDRL in terms of CHR. Furthermore, with an appropriate switching factor, the proposed PCC algorithm outperforms FL with full collaboration among FAPs.},

Most existing works largely ignore spot access spectrum resource availability when considering computing cooperation among ESs. In this paper, we present a general cooperative MEC framework to enable network-wide cooperation of ESs by leveraging a multi-hop task relaying strategy. Under this framework, we can maximize overall throughput (task completion rate) by balancing the workload for both spot communication and computing through task routing. To address the problem, we formulate an optimization problem and apply matching theory to find a task offloading scheme with low-complexity. Finally, we conduct numerical analysis to show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme and the superiority of our multi-hop relay-assisted MEC systems.},

To eliminate the SNR-wall effect, we propose a combined convolutional neural network and long short-term memory (C-CNN-LSTM) aided spectrum-sensing scheme. Specifically, the CNN and the LSTM are concurrently utilized, where the CNN extracts relationships among spectrum-sensing data (SSD) received at different satellites, and the LSTM excavates time-domain relationships among SSD from one satellite.

But in the context of non-uniform array structures it leads to intractable signal processing. Based on such an array structure at the base station, this paper investigates a joint active user detection (AUD) and channel estimation (CE) scheme based on compressive sensing (CS) for application to the massive Internet of Things (IoT). Specifically, by exploiting the structured sparsity of mmWave/THz massive IoT access channels, we firstly formulate the multi-panel massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO)-based joint AUD and CE problem as a multiple measurement vector (MMV)-CS problem. Then, we harness the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to learn the prior parameters (i.e., the noise variance and the sparsity ratio) and an orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP)-EM-MMV algorithm is developed to solve this problem. Our simulation results verify the improved AUD and CE performance of the proposed scheme compared to conventional CS-based algorithms.},

Firstly, a maximizing sum rate method based on successive convex approximation (Max-SR-SCA) is proposed to jointly optimize the PA factors of user1 ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$U_{1}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ), user2 ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$U_{2}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ) and relay station (RS).

Simulation results show that the proposed three PA methods not only outperform the equal power allocation (EPA) method, but also the sum rates corresponding to the three PA methods are slightly lower than that of optimal exhaustive search (ES) method. Especially for Max-SR-RC method, its rate gain over EPA is up to 64.7% and its sum rate gap with optimal ES is less than 0.1bits/s/Hz.

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm (named Turbo-QISTA) by properly incorporating Turbo principle into quantized iterative shrinkage threshold algorithm (QISTA). Our major contribution is to design two key metrics (i.e., extrinsic and a priori information) of Turbo principle suitable for one-bit CS-MMV problem. Via simulations, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Turbo-QISTA.},

  abstract     = {The grant-free random access (GFRA) has been the mainstream access scheme in the massive ultra-reliable low-latency communications (mURLLC). Device activity detection is the foremost issue in GFRA. Most of previous works assume unique non-orthogonal pilot sequence assignment in device activity detection which brings about severe inter-device interference and requires high-complexity access point (AP) coordination to eliminate interference. Taking advantage of the good cross-correlation characteristic of orthogonal pilot sequences and the sparsity in power domain of cell-free (CF) distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems, this paper proposes a novel orthogonal pilot sequences based activity detection (OPSAD) algorithm to alleviate inter-device interference and thus improve device activity detection performance. In the proposed OPSAD algorithm, the min-max covariance interference (MMCI) pilot assignment algorithm considering AP selection and power control is introduced and a new interference metric is defined to efficiently capture the inter-device interference in this algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reduces computational complexity and achieves better performance than the benchmark algorithm utilizing non-orthogonal pilot sequences in practical mURLLC scenario.},

In order to fully realize the benefit of DL-aided wireless system, we need to collect a large number of training samples. Unfortunately, collecting massive samples in the real environments is very challenging since it requires significant signal transmission overhead. In this paper, we propose a new type of data acquisition framework for DL-aided wireless systems. In our work, generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to generate samples approximating the real samples. To reduce the amount of training samples required for the wireless data generation, we train GAN with the help of the meta learning. From numerical experiments, we show that the DL model trained by the GAN generated samples performs close to that trained by the real samples.},

In this correspondence, we propose to exploit the spatial sparsity structure of the channel to detect the DMRS spoofing, which is motivated by the fact that the spatial sparsity structure of the channel will be significantly impacted if the DMRS spoofing happens. We first extract the spatial sparsity structure of the channel by solving a sparse feature retrieval problem, then propose a sequential sparsity structure anomaly detection method to detect DMRS spoofing. In simulation experiments, we exploit clustered delay line based channel model from 3GPP standards for verifications.

In this paper, we propose RAPP, a radio tomography-based method enabling performance parameterization to achieve parameter adjustment of localization accuracy without dense deployment of passive UHF RFID devices. The reader antenna takes a rapid-moving system as the carrier and generates virtual antenna elements to inventory received signal strength (RSS) of the pre-deployed tags. To eliminate the impact of the lack of tag backward signals during the mobile process and supplement the link distribution for each segment of the monitored platform, the Cubic Spline Interpolation algorithm (CSIA) is proposed to homogenize the spacing of the virtual antenna elements by preprocessing the measurements. Then the optimized link information is adopted to perform radio tomographic imaging to recognize the locations of targets. Theoretical analysis on ill-condition is derived to analyze how the number of virtual interpolation elements affects the localization accuracy. Further derivation about the relationship between the Bayesian Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) and the link density provides a solution to influence the localization performance through parameter adjustment. Extensive simulation and experiment show that RAPP outperforms on multiple targets localization and behaves robustly in a multipath environment.},

However, such devices normally suffer from constraints in terms of battery capacity and processing power, limiting the range of applications supported or lowering Quality of Experience. One effective way to address these issues is to offload the computation tasks to the edge servers that are deployed at the network edges, e.g., base stations or WiFi access point, etc. This communication fashion, also named as Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), is proposed to overcome the limitations in terms of long latency due to long propagation distance of traditional cloud computing approach. XR devices, that are limited in computation resources and energy, can then benefit from offloading the computation intensive tasks to MEC servers. However, as XR applications are comprised of multiple tasks with variety of requirements in terms of latency and energy consumption, it is important to make decision whether one task should be offloaded to MEC server or not. This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based offloading scheme for XR devices (DRLXR). The proposed scheme is used to train and derive the close-to optimal offloading decision whereas optimizing a utility function optimization equation that considers both energy consumption and execution delay at XR devices. The simulation results show how our proposed scheme outperforms the other counterparts in terms of total execution latency and energy consumption.},

However, effective load balancing routing strategies for LEO satellite networks need to be designed, due to the bursty characteristic of the network traffic and imbalanced regional communication load. To achieve that, we propose a Distance-based Back-Pressure Routing (DBPR) strategy for LEO satellite networks. DBPR calculates the link weights based on a novel distance-based metric, which can select uncongested short-distance paths to the destinations and distribute network traffic dynamically with low delay. To control the number of forwardings in the network, we restrict the transmission range to a rectangle region between each source-destination pair. We design DBPR in the distributed fashion without collecting the global network load information, which is suitable for LEO satellite networks with limited resources, long propagation delay, dynamic topology, etc. We analyze the network stability and prove the throughput optimality of DBPR. Simulation results demonstrate that DBPR can achieve higher throughput and lower delay, compared with the state-of-the-art strategies, especially in the environments with limited cache resource.},

  abstract     = {Base stations (BSs) are the most energy-consuming segment of mobile networks. To reduce the energy consumption of BSs, inactive components of BSs, with a certain activation/deactivation time, can sleep. In this study, we model the problem of BS energy saving utilizing multiple sleep modes as a sequential MDP and propose an online traffic-aware deep Q-learning approach to maximize the long-term energy saving. However, there is a risk that BS is not sleeping at the right time and incurs delays to the users. To tackle this issue, we propose to use a digital twin model to encapsulate the dynamics underlying the investigated system and estimate the risk of decision-making (RDM) in advance. We define a novel metric to quantify RDM and predict the performance degradation. Mobile operators can compare the RDM with a tolerable threshold to decide on deactivating SMs, re-training, or activating SMs. We trained an agent using real traffic, obtained from an operator&#39;s BS in Stockholm. The data-set contains data rate information with very coarse-grained time granularity. Thus, we propose a scheme to generate a new data-set using the real network data-set which 1) has finer-grained time granularity and 2) considers the bursty behavior of traffic data. Simulation results show that using proposed methods, considerable energy saving is obtained at cost of negligible number of delayed users. Moreover, the proposed digital twin model can predict the performance of the DQN proactively in terms of RDM hence preventing the performance degradation in the network in anomalous situations.},

Considering the practical difficulty of deploying multiple territorial base stations (TBSs) in a wide range, unmanned aerial vehicle base station (UAV-BS) can fly to a specific point and hover above there to collect data traffic from gateways. In this paper, we aim to maximize the UAV-BS energy efficiency under the constraints of total serving delay, UAV-BS flying speed, and the maximum available transmitting power of gateways, etc. Firstly, we propose a distributed gateway cluster (GC) algorithm to group gateways into multiple GCs based on the distances among gateways. Next, the UAV-BS flies and hovers above each GC, where the gateways in the GC simultaneously transmit data to the UAV-BS by non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). By analyzing the NOMA feature, we propose theorems optimizing the UAV-BS hovering height to minimize the transmitting power of the gateway with the maximum transmitting power among the gateways in a GC. Based on the proposed theorems, we formulate the joint optimization problem to maximize the UAV-BS energy efficiency with only the variables of UAV-BS flying speed and the serving time for each GC. The optimization problem is effectively solved by the geometric programming (GP) method. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms by extensive simulation results.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies optimum deployment design and radio resource allocation in a coordinated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs)-assisted vehicular communication network. The scarcity of radio resources and the lack of appropriate communication paths have been challenging in the existing vehicular networks. Although employing UAVs with well-designed deployments can support vehicular communications by providing line-of-sight (LoS) links, however, limited energy and spectrum scarcity issues motivate us to apply non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with successive-interference-cancellation (SIC) as a solution to enhance radio resource efficiency for downlink infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) links. Meanwhile, due to the high complexity of the overall optimization problem that jointly handles deployment design and resource allocation for the studied UAVs-assisted vehicular network, we propose a low-complexity hierarchical suboptimal solution method. First, to efficiently find the optimum deployment of UAVs, we propose Stackelberg game with competitive nature as a game theory-based method, where UAVs are divided into leaders and followers groups that compete with each other to obtain the optimal position. Subsequently, we perform a low-complexity dynamic method in which radio resources are allocated in a sub-channel assignment algorithm and in a power allocation problem, respectively. Finally, the closed-form expressions of the optimal power allocation are derived using the KKT optimality conditions. Simulation results demonstrate improved performance for deployment design using the Stackelberg game. It is shown that NOMA improves the achievable sum rate compared to conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA). Also, fast convergence of the proposed resource allocation and deployment design is obtained.},

  abstract     = {Due to increase in real-time mobile applications and Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) devices, the edge computing paradigm provides a systematic and eccentric platform for real-time Internet-of-Things applications. Though the paradigm provides an effective infrastructure, however the resource requirements of IIoT devices change radically with time, which is described as a resource-agnostic property. Therefore, the estimation of resource requirements of IIoT devices is a critical and resilient assignment. In addition, it requires an extensive amount of resources to process the data traffic flows and microservice offloading. Hence, we present RAISE, a novel resource-agnostic microservice offloading scheme for mobile IIoT devices. RAISE efficiently estimates the resource-agnostic nature of IIoT devices to maximize their resource utilization in the network. Based on the estimated resource requirement, we propose a resource-agnostic microservice offloading scheme to maximize the success rate. Extensive experiments show that RAISE provides better performance in terms of network throughput and Quality-of-Service (QoS) than the other existing methods, SDTO and DTOS, in terms of cost and reliability.},

  abstract     = {Edge computing can be used as a distributed counterpart of the cloud computing, and task offloading with much shorter delays can be achieved. In general, edge servers are resource-limited, but the services are becoming further diversified to meet the ever-increasing user demand. When an edge server cannot process the received service request of a particular service type for not locally having the corresponding service execution image, the request needs to be forwarded to another on which the particular image is installed. In this article, an optimal scheduling method that forwards such requests is proposed by using the variant multiple-knapsack framework. Then, to find the optimal solution, we propose to reformulate it as an integer linear program. As the problem size increases, however, the problem easily becomes intractable, so we propose a distributed solution by using both Lagrangian relaxation and decomposition theory. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, we carry out simulations with different network layouts and with different request arrival scenarios. The evaluation results show that the centralized Lagrange dual solution can yield near-optimal solutions. In addition, the decomposed distributed solution can significantly reduce the computational and operational complexity at the expense of the total reward.},

In this system, the transmitters can be easily deployed on the sidewall or the ceiling indoors, and the receivers can be easily integrated or placed on moving targets, such as trailers, badges and helmets. In addition, this system has a better ability to assist the localization drift caused by Doppler shift by relying only on acoustic signals. To fully evaluate the performance of the proposed system, such as the positioning accuracy, coverage and robustness, experiments were conducted in a field environment, and a comparative experiment based on an ultra-wideband solution was presented. All experimental results show that the proposed prototype positioning system can achieve decimeter-level localization accuracy, a stable 4 Hz update rate and good robustness with less infrastructure, which is sufficient for mobile device positioning and tracking in actual indoor environments.},

Nevertheless, FL still faces challenges such as core network congestion, UDs&#39; limited resources and less efficient mapping between devices and cyber systems. Therefore, in this article, we integrate the digital twin (DT) and the mobile edge computing (MEC) technologies into a hierarchical FL framework in the heterogeneous cellular network scenario. When the UDs are not in the service range of the small base stations (SBSs), the framework allows macro base stations to assist UDs&#39; local computation, thus reducing the transmission delay. It also protects the user privacy and allows more users to join in the training in order to improve the FL accuracy. In addition, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based scheme to solve the joint optimization problem of dynamic UDs-stations association and resource allocation, thereby minimizing the energy consumption within a limited time delay. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme not only effectively reduces the task transmission failure rate and energy consumption compared with the baseline scheme, but also saves the communication cost through the DT network.},

  abstract     = {To support the emergent freshness-critical applications in the satellite-integrated IoT, information must be transmitted timely and reliably. A significant limitation of the upcoming satellite-integrated IoT era is the non-trivial propagation latency because of long-distance communication. To realize timely information delivery, the hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) strategy with frequent feedback is not fit anymore, since the reliability of the HARQ strategy needs multiple retransmission of the obsolete packets, which inevitably result in information staleness in the satellite-integrated IoT. In this paper, we design a two-layer coding strategy that uses error-correction codes within each packet in the physical-layer (PHY) and erasure-correction codes across the packets in the packet-layer. Then, we formulate an AoI-optimal redundancy-allocation problem to find the redundancy compromise between error-correction codes and erasure-correction codes. By solving the redundancy-allocation problem for the designed two-layer coding strategy, we derive explicit expressions of the AoI-optimal two-layer coding rates. Inspired by this, we explore the optimal reliability of the physical channel. Numerical results and analysis prove that making the physical channel suitably unreliable is beneficial to the timeliness of the system. And the simulation results indicate that the combination of erasure-correction codes and relative lossy error-correction codes achieves AoI-improvement over the ultra-reliable PHY-only coding scheme. The simulation results also show that the choice of AoI-optimal coding rates depends heavily on the channel characteristics, such as the signal-to-noise ratio, fade duration and channel fading parameters.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) has received significant attention as a practical alternative to traditional cloud-centric machine learning (ML). The performance (e.g., accuracy and convergence time) of FL is hampered by the selection of clients having non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. In addition, a long convergence time is inevitable if clients with poor computation or communication capabilities participate in the FL procedure (i.e., the straggler problem). To minimize convergence time while guaranteeing high learning accuracy, we first formulate an optimization problem on client selection. As a practical solution, we devise a data distribution-aware online client selection (DOCS) algorithm. In DOCS, the FL server finds several clusters having near IID data and then uses a multi-armed bandit (MAB) technique to select the cluster with the lowest convergence time. The evaluation results demonstrate that DOCS can reduce the convergence time by up to &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$10\% \!\sim\! 41\%$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; and improve the learning accuracy by up to &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$4\% \!\sim\! 13\%$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; compared to the traditional client selection schemes.},

Due to the high computational complexity of the image-processing task, the strict latency requirement of the tracking task, and the shortage of batteries and computational capability of UAVs, the UAVs can offload the computing-intensive task to the edge computing server (ECS) to reduce the task latency and energy consumption. Even though, the large latency and energy consumption brought by some high-definition image-processing task still make some visual tracking difficult to perform. We first investigate the impact of video frame resolution on computing task size and detection accuracy, and further on task latency and energy consumption. In addition, we optimize the transmission power, the local CPU frequency, the offloading rate of UAVs, and the bandwidth allocation between UAVs. We model the UAVs tracking system as an energy consumption optimization problem with the constraint of task latency. Although the proposed optimization problem is complex, we transform the optimization problem into several subproblems with decoupling and rigorous mathematical proof. By combining the convex optimization with the genetic algorithm, an offloading algorithm with low complexity and good performance is obtained, which is verified by comparing with some benchmark offloading strategies in the numerical results.},

To achieve immersive user experiences in the metaverse, real-time rendering is the key technology. However, computing intensive tasks of real-time rendering from metaverse service providers cannot be processed efficiently on a single resource-limited mobile device. Alternatively, such mobile devices can offload the metaverse rendering tasks to other mobile devices by adopting the collaborative computing paradigm based on Coded Distributed Computing (CDC). Therefore, this paper introduces a hierarchical game-theoretic CDC framework for the metaverse services, especially for vehicular metaverse. In the framework, idle resources from vehicles, acting as CDC workers, are aggregated to handle intensive computation tasks in the vehicular metaverse. Specifically, in the upper layer, a miner coalition formation game is formulated based on a reputation metric to select reliable workers. To guarantee the reliable management of reputation values, the reputation values calculated based on the subjective logical model are maintained in a blockchain database. In the lower layer, a Stackelberg game based incentive mechanism is considered to attract reliable workers selected in the upper layer to participate in rendering tasks. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed framework is resistant to malicious workers. Compared with the baseline schemes, the proposed scheme can improve the utility of metaverse service provider and average profit of CDC workers.},

However, the familiar paradigm, namely, data collection can hardly fulfill the active and real-time information gathering demands of many thriving smart applications, such as smart grid, where the UAV needs to serve as an intelligent aerial entity, gathering and analysing the information of surroundings actively and timely. To this aim, this article studies the paradigm data acquisition , where the UAV dynamically gathers information by on-board sensors. We consider a general mission scenario where a UAV acquires data in real time, which needs to be timely processed with the assistance of a mobile edge computing server. To address the real-time characteristics, we construct a novel theoretical data acquisition rate model, based on which the real-time processing quality of requirement (QoR) is defined. We respectively minimize the UAV energy consumption and mission completion time, under the constraints including real-time processing QoR and UAV mobility, by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, resources allocation, and time duration. To tackle these highly complex problems, we propose efficient algorithms by means of successive convex approximation and block coordinates descent techniques, where a closed-form solution for the UAV transmission and computation resources allocation is rigorously derived. Moreover, we consider a practical multi-location trajectory optimization where the UAV needs to traverse multiple target locations or areas in addition to the initial and final locations. The simulation results demonstrate the significant system performance gains brought by the proposed design and the effectiveness of the algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Device-to-device (D2D) technology has been widely used to address the mobile traffic explosion problem due to its ability of direct communications between proximal devices. In practice, the available spectrum is often limited. With the rapid increase of D2D users and cellular users, the efficiency of resource allocation would be dramatically reduced. To overcome the above limitations, this paper proposes a spiking mean field reinforcement learning framework (S-MFRL) to optimize the resource allocation of D2D networks. Firstly, spiking neural network (SNN) cooperated with deep reinforcement learning is trained for channel selection and power control. Secondly, spatio-temporal backpropagation is adopted to accelerate the SNN training. Thirdly, mean field multi-agent reinforcement learning (MFRL) is applied to approximate interactions among D2D users. By this means, the optimization process of resource allocation becomes tractable as the number of D2D users increases, which solves the problem of exponential growth of user interactions. Two algorithms are implemented under the S-MFRL framework by integrating MFRL into spiking actor-critic (S-AC) and spiking proximal policy optimization (S-PPO), which are named S-MFAC and S-MFPPO, respectively. Experimental results show that our designed S-MFAC and S-MFPPO outperform both AC and PPO in terms of convergence rate, access rate, time-averaged overall throughput, and collision probability. Besides, further simulations have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the case of larger action space and hundreds of D2D users.},

This work considers an update-and-decision system with a Poisson-arrival bufferless queue, where updates are delivered and processed for making decisions with exponential or periodic intervals. We use age-upon-decisions (AuD) to characterize timeliness of updates at decision moments, and the missing probability to specify whether updates are useful for decision-making. Our theoretical analyses 1) present the average AuDs and the missing probabilities for bufferless systems with exponential or deterministic decision intervals under different service time distributions; 2) show that for service scheduling, the deterministic service time achieves a lower average AuD and a smaller missing probability than the uniformly distributed and the negative exponentially distributed service time; 3) prove that the average AuD of periodical decision system is larger than and will eventually drop to that of Poisson decision system along with the increase of decision rate; however, the missing probability in periodical decision system is smaller than that of Poisson decision system. The numerical results and simulations verify the correctness of our analyses, and demonstrate that the bufferless systems outperform the systems applying infinite buffer size.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) provides an economical way for the resource-constrained edge users to offload computational workload to MEC servers co-located with the access point (AP). In this article, we consider a hybrid computation offloading scheme that allows edge users to offload workloads by using active RF communications and backscatter communications. We aim to maximize the overall energy efficiency subject to the completion of all workload by jointly optimizing the AP&#39;s beamforming and the users&#39; offloading decisions. Considering a dynamic environment, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (H-MADRL) framework to solve this problem. The high-level agent resides in the AP and optimizes the beamforming strategy, while the low-level user agents learn and adapt individuals&#39; offloading strategies. To further improve the learning efficiency, we propose a novel optimization-driven learning algorithm that allows the AP to estimate the low-level users&#39; actions by solving approximate optimization problem efficiently. Then, the action estimation can be shared with all users and drive them to update individuals&#39; actions independently. Simulation results reveal that our algorithm can improve the system performance by 50%. The learning efficiency and reliability are also improved significantly comparing to the model-free learning methods.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, mobile data traffic is growing explosively, but in many realistic scenarios, users still often encounter insufficient or unstable network bandwidth. A promising solution is provided by unmanned aerial vehicle mounted base stations (UAV-BSs) to serve regions with bandwidth shortfall. It is significant to investigate how to deploy UAVs effectively and efficiently for maximizing the sum throughput and service time of a set of mobile clients scattered in a large environment. A basic idea is to use RF ray tracing simulations as a hint to narrow down the search space of UAVs for conducting actual measurements. Furthermore, we formulate two key sub-problems, chunk selection , which selects an optimal subset of chunks in the region as the search space of UAVs, and chunk search , which plans the paths of UAVs to cover all selected chunks for conducting measurements, provide network services and charge timely under energy constraints to maximize the total service time. As they are both proved to be NP-hard, a 3D convolutional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based chunk selection algorithm and an energy-aware DRL-based chunk search algorithm are proposed to solve them efficiently. A prototype system, UAV-Net+ , is implemented to evaluate the feasibility by conducting measurements by an UAV mounted WiFi AP communicating with several clients scattered in a campus, reporting an obvious throughput gain with a small measurement overhead and time consumption. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D convolutional DRL-based chunk selection algorithm and energy-aware DRL-based chunk search algorithm . It is able to achieve 95.35% effective throughput of the skyline algorithm, Oracle , with only 0.7% time cost. It is more beneficial for providing long-time network service and balancing the workload among UAVs.},

  abstract     = {While the problem of jointly controlling the pilot-and-data power in cell-based systems has been extensively studied, this problem is difficult to solve in cell-free systems due to two reasons. First, both the large- and small-scale fading are markedly different between a served user and the multiple serving access points. Second, due to the user-centric architecture, there is a need for decentralized algorithms that scale well in the cell-free environment. In this work, we study the impact of joint pilot-and-data power control and receive filter design in the uplink of cell-free systems. The problem is formulated as optimization tasks considering two different objectives: 1) maximization of the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) and 2) maximization of the total SE. Since these problems are non-convex, we resort to successive convex approximation and geometric programming to obtain a local optimal centralized solution for benchmarking purposes. We also propose a decentralized solution based on actor-critic deep reinforcement learning, in which each user acts as an agent to locally obtain the best policy relying on minimum information exchange. Practical signaling aspects are provided for such a decentralized solution. Finally, numerical results indicate that the decentralized solution performs very close to the centralized one and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of minimum SE and total system SE.},

As the interest in UAVs is accelerating, increased attention is paid to the reliability and resilience of UAV-based systems with respect to the collision avoidance. One of the ways to improve this aspect is to utilize the RADAR functionality. In this work, we consider a cellular network employed for communication jointly with RADAR operation. The critical parameter that affects the RADAR algorithm is the radar cross-section (RCS). Since the task of obtaining the RCS of a complex-shaped object is extremely challenging, we first propose a novel, accurate, and fast method of scattered field assessment. We further perform radio network planning for the cellular deployment, as well as link budget estimations for the RADAR system that co-exists with it. Under this system model, we carry out detailed Monte-Carlo simulations of the RADAR detection process to obtain reliable statistical results and answer the question of how the actual bistatic RCS model affects the detection algorithm. We then apply mathematical modeling based on stochastic geometry to estimate the collision probability without the need to simulate an extensive number of flight-hours. Our numerical results confirm the robustness to RCS pattern nulls, which is crucial for safety-centric applications such as collision avoidance.},

This article focuses on multi-beam HTS systems where all beams reuse the same spectrum. In particular, we propose a novel user scheduling and power allocation design capable of providing guarantees in terms of the individual QoS requirements while maximizing the system throughput under a limited power budget. Precoding is employed in the forward link to mitigate mutual interference among the users in multiple-access scenarios over different coherence time intervals. The combinatorial optimization structure from user scheduling requires an extremely high cost to obtain the global optimum even when a reduced number of users fit into a time slot. Therefore, we propose a heuristic algorithm yielding a good trade-off between performance and computational complexity, applicable to a static operation framework of geostationary (GEO) satellite networks. Although the power allocation optimization is signomial programming, non-convex on a standard form, the solution can be lower bounded by the global optimum of a geometric program with a hidden convex structure. A local solution to the joint user scheduling and power allocation problem is consequently obtained by a successive optimization approach. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on GEO satellite networks by providing better QoS satisfaction combined with outstanding overall system throughput.},

In this paper, we first investigate the signaling interaction procedure of the hard handover strategy in 3GPP 5G new radio (NR) standard. For providing better connectivity and lower outage probability, a soft handover scheme named double-beam soft handover (DB-SH) is designed for the mmWave UAV system. Considering the dynamic wind effects, we formulate a random walk (RW) model for quantifying the angle offsets of the beams at the UAVs, as the orientations of the UAVs suffer from the fluctuations over time due to the dynamic wind load. Considering the RW model and the beam training, we further analyze the outage probabilities of the 3GPP 5G NR hard handover scheme and the DB-SH scheme for the mmWave UAV communication systems. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of the presented theoretical analysis which provides insights for mmWave UAV system designs.},

First, we propose an independent beamforming algorithm. Compared to the existing joint beamforming, the proposed scheme achieves the same performance but is practically much more convenient. Second, we propose an absorb-then-reflect power transfer scheme so that the RIS-aided WPT system can be self-sustainable without external energy supply. Third, we analyze the WPT efficiency of the proposed scheme and derive the minimum required scale of the RIS elements to guarantee a performance gain over the traditional WPT system. Next, we consider the multi-user scenario, and propose power allocation schemes to maximize the energy utility. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed RIS-aided WPT scheme is verified by simulation results.},

Two novel mode selection schemes are proposed, which adaptively select the NOMA and cooperative modes according to different buffer states and communication environments. These two proposed schemes are termed single-core state (SCS) and dual-core state (DCS) schemes since they correspond to single and dual-core buffer states. These core states are carefully chosen, which ensure not only a sufficient amount of available transmission modes or links but also a small number of stored packets at each buffer. The closed-form expressions of the outage probabilities and average delays of the proposed schemes are derived and verified by simulation results. Asymptotic performance analysis is also performed, revealing that both proposed schemes achieve the full diversity within the minimum required buffer size of two.

Adopting a proper feature selection technique is important to achieve further improvement in detection accuracy. As described herein, we propose a device-free indoor localization scheme using a lightweight ML model with compressed spatially concatenated CSI in WLAN systems with distributed antennas. In this scheme, feedback beam-forming weights (BFWs) are collected at a CSI capture terminal. Then, current and past BFWs are concatenated as accurate feature data to characterize the object behavior. Additionally, we propose the use of a frequency-domain sampling scheme for a low-complexity real-time target position detection with a small number of datasets. Using ray-trace based simulation analysis and experimentally obtained results from an indoor environment, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme using the concatenated CSI is effective not only for achieving more accurate real-time detection, but also for reducing the necessary complexity for both off-line training and on-line classification compared with other reference schemes.},

Specifically, eMBB applications support extremely high data rate communications, while URLLC services aim to provide stringent latency with high reliability communications. Due to their differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, the spectrum sharing between URLLC and eMBB services becomes a challenging scheduling issue. In this paper, we aim to investigate the URLLC and eMBB co-scheduling/coexistence problem under a puncturing technique in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. The objective function is formulated to maximize the data rate of eMBB users while satisfying the latency requirements of URLLC users through joint user selection and power allocation scheduling. To solve this problem, we first introduce an eMBB user clustering mechanism to balance the system throughput and computational complexity. Thereafter, we decompose the original problem into two subproblems, namely the scheduling problem of user selection and power allocation. We introduce a Gale-Shapley (GS) theory to solve the user selection problem, and a successive convex approximation (SCA) and a difference of convex (DC) programming to deal with the power allocation problem. Finally, an iterative algorithm is utilized to find the global solution with low computational complexity. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and verify the proposed approach outperforms other baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {By virtue of the low cost and flexible deployment, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming the most promising platform for active radar sensing to find targets in shaded areas and build a temporary communication infrastructure at disaster sites. Radar and wireless communication are essential functions for reliable control of UAVs and real-time exchange of sensed measurements. However, due to the limited payload and power budget of UAVs, it is impossible to mount two individual radar and communication systems, especially on small- or medium-sized UAVs. Recently, joint communication and radar (JCR) systems have emerged as a breakthrough, which perform the communication and radar functions simultaneously on the same hardware platform. Compared to a simple combination of individual communication and radar systems, a UAV JCR system can minimize the implementation cost, power consumption, payload, and radio resource usage. This paper proposes transmit beamformer and receive beamformer designs for a UAV network composed of a UAV JCR base station, a target, and multiple user equipments. Specifically, the UAV transmits an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-modulated waveform with transmit and receive beamforming to perform multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar and multiuser-MIMO (MU-MIMO) communication functions simultaneously. Unlike the previous OFDM radar scheme that employs the communication symbol repetition method, a novel receive beamformer design is proposed to resolve the inter-carrier interference problem in the range/velocity estimation process, which therefore does not sacrifice the communication transmission rate. As a result, simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a higher radar signal-to-clutter ratio while achieving a higher communication sum-rate than existing schemes.},

Recently, although there are plenty of works on wireless sensing and hand gesture recognition, most of them are applied in single user scenario. Since the recognition algorithm is mainly realized by analyzing the variation of wireless propagation channel, the simultaneous movement of multiple people will cause superposition of the dynamic channel responses and cause interference to each other. This article proposes to use spatial beamforming to alleviate the mutual influence of multiuser hand gestures. Since the hands of multiple users reflect the same signal, the channel responses are usually not orthogonal even if the users are well separated in different locations, and there is no reference signals to help distinguishing the channel response reflected by different users. We propose a preamble gesture scheme to estimate the spatial channel of dynamic reflections under the impact of strong phase noise, and use the Doppler variation feature to verify the channel response belongs to hand movement. We have a thorough analysis of the inter-user interference impacted by the transmitter-user-receiver geometry relations, user movement speeds and directions. The interference suppression effect is demonstrated by prototype experiments under real LOS and NLOS scenarios exploiting LTE signals.},

Firstly, we propose two relay aided multiuser scheduling (RMS) schemes to improve the secrecy outage performance of the network by considering the availability of channel state information (CSI) of CCI links, including the partial CSI based RMS (PCSI-RMS) scheme and the full CSI based RMS (FCSI-RMS) scheme. For comparison purposes, the relay aided round-robin scheduling (RRRS) scheme is also employed as a baseline. Then, we derive closed-form expressions for the proposed PCSI-RMS and FCSI-RMS schemes as well as the RRRS scheme in terms of their exact and asymptotic secrecy outage probabilities over Rayleigh fading channels in the face of CCI. Finally, numerical results show that the secrecy outage performance of the proposed PCSI-RMS and FCSI-RMS schemes is better than that of the RRRS scheme, where FCSI-RMS achieves the best secrecy outage performance. With an increase of the number of users, the secrecy outage performance of the PCSI-RMS and FCSI-RMS schemes is significantly improved, while that of the RRRS scheme keeps unchanged, which demonstrates the benefits of adopting the proposed PCSI-RMS and FCSI-RMS schemes against eavesdropping in CCI environments. Moreover, there is an optimal power allocation factor between the CH and the relay, which makes the network have the best secrecy outage performance.},

In the first stage, guided by the slot polarization, a slot subset is constructed at each active user side and the receiver side. With an irregular degree distribution, each active user randomly selects slots from the slot subset to transmit the packet replicas. Subsequently, in the second stage, by using the packet-based polarization transform, the slotted packets are encoded by using a packet-level polar code. Correspondingly, at the receiver side, a packet-oriented successive cancellation (pSC) or pSC list decoding algorithm is performed to overcome the corruption caused by the SEC. And then, the success interference cancellation procedure is executed to recover the packet. Furthermore, for a given average transmission rate, the irregular degree distribution is optimized by searching the maximum within all feasible traffic load thresholds. Then, an upper bound of the polar-code rate for the PSA scheme is derived. Simulation results indicate that the proposed PSA scheme can achieve an improved throughput over the irregular repetition slotted ALOHA scheme for the SEC.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to investigate the impacts of sensing energy and data availability on the secondary throughput of energy harvesting cognitive radio networks (EH-CRNs), where secondary transmitters (STs) are powered by the energy harvested from primary radio frequency (RF) signals. To reach the aim, we consider two extreme cases by employing two data arrival processes: heavy data arrival and general data arrival. In the heavy data arrival case, we consider STs always have data to transmit, and study the impacts of sensing energy on the secondary throughput. In the general data arrival case, we consider the data arrives with a certain probability, and study the impacts of data availability (i.e., data arrival probability and data buffer capacity) on the secondary throughput. Moreover, to compare the secondary throughput under non-cooperative spectrum sensing (NCSS) and cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS), we further study two CRN scenarios for each data arrival case: Scenario 1 with one pair of secondary users (SUs) conducting NCSS, and Scenario 2 with multiple pairs of SUs conducting CSS. As the harvest-then-transmit protocol is employed by STs, it is essential to balance energy harvesting and data transmission to achieve high secondary throughput. We thus utilize an energy threshold approach to determine the actions of each ST. Specifically, under the heavy data arrival, we derive the average secondary throughput for each scenario by taking the sensing energy as an energy unit and modeling the energy states of each ST as a Markov chain. Under the general data arrival, we derive the secondary throughput for each scenario by modeling the energy and data states of each ST as a two-dimensional Markov chain. Simulation results show that: (1) both the secondary throughput and the optimal energy threshold decrease with the sensing energy; (2) the secondary throughput increases with the data availability, while the optimal energy threshold decreases with the data availability; (3) from the normalized secondary throughput perspective, CSS is not always better than NCSS.},

  abstract     = {Next-generation communication systems aim for providing pervasive services, including the high-mobility scenarios routinely encountered in mission-critical applications. Hence we harness the recently-developed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to assist the high-mobility cell-edge users. However, in the face of high Doppler frequencies, the existing RIS channel estimation techniques that assume block fading generally result in irreducible error floors. In order to mitigate this problem, we propose a new RIS channel estimation technique, which is the first one that performs minimum mean square error (MMSE) based interpolation for the sake of taking into account the time-varying nature of fading even within the coherence time. The RIS modelling invokes only passive elements without relying on RF chains, where both the direct link and RIS-reflected links as well as both the line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS (NLoS) paths are taken into account. As a result, the cascaded base station (BS)-RIS-user links involve the multiplicative concatenation of the channel coefficients in the LoS and NLoS paths across the two segments of the BS-RIS and RIS-user links. Against this background, we model the multiplicative RIS fading correlation functions for the first time in the literature, which facilitates MMSE interpolation for estimating the high-dimensional and high-Doppler RIS-reflected fading channels. Our simulation results demonstrate that for a vehicle travelling at a speed as high as 90 mph, employing a low-complexity RIS at the cell-edge using as few as 16 RIS elements is sufficient for achieving substantial power-effieincy gains, where the Doppler-induced error floor is mitigated by the proposed channel estimation technique.},

Specifically, we obtain non-trivial sum-SDoF upper and lower bounds. Firstly, we derive the sum-SDoF upper bound by means of statistical equivalence property, security constraints, and permutations. Then, for the sum-SDoF lower bound, we leverage the artificial noise transmission and interference re-transmission to design two transmission schemes, which have holistic and sequential higher-order symbol generation, respectively. For these two schemes, we propose the redundancy reduction approach for security analysis, by which the minimal duration of artificial noise transmission phase of the scheme is obtained. To eliminate the redundant equations in security analysis, this approach first identifies the constituent equations, and then analyzes the rank of assemble of them. As a result, both the proposed sum-SDoF upper and lower bounds are tighter than the existing sum-SDoF upper and lower bounds, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed lower bound showcases a three-user coding gain.},

  abstract     = {The incorporation of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) systems can unleash the potential of next-generation networks by improving the performance of user equipments (UEs) in service dead zones. However, their requirement for accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical, and especially, applications with UE mobility that induce channel aging make challenging the achievement of adequate quality of service. Hence, in this work, we investigate the impact of channel aging on the performance of RIS-assisted mMIMO systems under both spatial correlation and imperfect CSI conditions. Specifically, by accounting for channel aging during both uplink training and downlink data transmission phases, we first perform minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimation to obtain the UE effective channels with low overhead similar to conventional systems without RIS. Next, we derive the downlink achievable sum spectral efficiency (SE) with regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding in closed-form being dependent only on large-scale statistics by using the deterministic equivalent (DE) analysis. Subsequently, we present the attractive optimization of the achievable sum SE with respect to the phase shifts and the total transmit power that can be performed every several coherence intervals due to the slow variation of the large-scale statistics. Numerical results validate the analytical expressions and demonstrate the performance while allowing the extraction of insightful design conclusions for common scenarios including UE mobility. In particular, channel aging degrades the performance but its impact can be controlled by choosing appropriately the frame duration or by increasing the number of RIS elements.},

Existing driver recognition systems use mechanisms based on identity keys (e.g., car keys and identity cards) or biometric characteristics (e.g., fingerprints, voiceprints, and face recognition). However, identity keys are prone to loss or misappropriation; biometric methods are prone to driver substitution and raise issues pertaining to privacy; and neither approach is applicable to the majority of commercial applications (e.g., hiring delivery drivers and renting out vehicles). This paper presents a novel driver identity recognition system based on the channel state information (CSI) of Wi-Fi signals, which tend to vary with the user, even when performing identical tasks. CSI values corresponding to driver maneuvers (e.g., turning or going straight) are used as inputs for a deep neural network tasked with establishing a driver recognition model. The feasibility of this approach was verified through simulations in the laboratory and with a vehicle, both of which achieved average recognition accuracy of roughly 95%.},

Secrecy and energy efficiency are crucial to the data collection, but have never been well addressed in the lack of appropriate propulsion energy models for three-dimensional (3D) flights of fixed-wing UAVs. This paper delivers a new approach to the joint optimization of the 3D flight trajectory and data collection schedule of a fixed-wing UAV for secure and energy-efficient data collection under an eavesdropping attack. A critical aspect is that we derive a new propulsion energy model for fixed-wing UAVs flying 3D trajectories. By using equivalent transformation, difference-of-convex techniques, and successive convex approximation, we convexify the model and demonstrate its viability to the design of energy-efficient 3D trajectories. Another key aspect is that we further optimize the trajectory and schedule of the UAV for secure and energy-efficient collection of secret data from sensor nodes on the ground. This is non-trivial due to the convexification of the non-smooth secrecy constraints in addition to the new 3D propulsion energy model. Simulations validate the new model and demonstrate considerable energy saving of 3D trajectories, compared to two-dimensional (2D) trajectories optimized based on the state-of-the-art 2D propulsion energy model.},

However, with hybrid beamforming, the one-to-one mapping between the radio frequency (RF) chain and the nonlinear power amplifier (PA) is destroyed. The PA nonlinearity cannot be compensated by conventional digital predistortion (DPD) algorithms. In this article, we propose a novel multiple-input DPD model for hybrid beamforming MIMO systems. An extra digital compensation block is introduced in the feedback path. With the feedback compensation block, the proposed DPD can linearize the PA output signal as well as the aggregated far-field signal. What is more, we propose a DPD estimation algorithm with much reduced complexity. Comparing to existing solutions, the proposed scheme achieves satisfactory performance for hybrid beamforming system. It does not rely on the measurement of the channel or the assumption of massive antennas. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DPD scheme.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies have explored the potential benefits of the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in different wireless communication scenarios. However, no work has quantitatively analyzed the performance of IRS-aided communication systems impaired by non-Gaussian noise. In this article, motivated by this research gap, we study the effect of impulsive noise on IRS-aided communication systems. Specifically, the channel impairments are modeled by Middleton&#39;s class A noise (MCA) and Weibull fading. By leveraging the Laguerre series, accurate channel distributions are derived. Building upon these expressions, new closed-form expressions of average bit-error-rate (BER), average channel capacity (ACC), and outage probability (OP) are obtained. To gain further insight into the system performance at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, the asymptotic expressions of BER, OP, and ACC are derived. In addition, a tight upper bound of ACC is obtained. The effect of the impulsive index &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$ (A)$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; on the systems performance metrics is investigated for different parameter settings. Moreover, it is shown that IRS-assisted communication systems outperforms a multi-hop relaying network impaired by impulsive noise. The results reveal that the system performance impaired by impulsive noise can be significantly improved by increasing the reflecting elements (REs). The derived expressions are in excellent agreement with Monte-Carlo simulations.},

  abstract     = {Dispatching flexible unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from distributed Internet-of-Things devices (IoTDs) is expected to be a promising technology to support time-critical applications. However, in urban environments, the communication links between the UAV and IoTDs are prone to be frequently blocked by buildings, which severely impairs the freshness of information collected by the UAV. Thus, how to overcome urban building blockages and ensure fresh data collection is quite important but neglected in existing works. In this paper, for keeping the information fresh, we propose to utilize the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to assist the UAV in mitigating signal propagation impairments caused by building blockages. The formulated optimization problem is minimizing the age of information (AoI) of all IoTDs by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, IoTD scheduling and discrete phase shifts of the RIS. It is a mixed-integer non-convex problem as well as lacking the complete channel state information (CSI), thus using conventional optimization methods is intractable. To address this issue, we present an effective and robust deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based scheme called “SAC-AO-RIS,” where a soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm with recent-prioritized experience replay is designed for learning highly stable policies of UAV trajectory and IoTD scheduling, and an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is leveraged for solving RIS phase shifts. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed scheme compared with other baseline approaches.},

In addition to the PAP and GNs, the system consists of a set of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) mounted on man-made structures to increase the number of bits transmitted per Joule of energy consumed measured as the global energy efficiency (GEE). The GEE trajectory for the PAP is designed by considering the UAV propulsion energy consumption and the Peukert effect of the PAP battery, which represents an accurate battery discharge profile as a non-linear function of the UAV power consumption profile. The GEE trajectory design problem is solved in two phases: in the first, a path for the PAP and feasible positions for the IRS modules are found using a multi-tier circle packing method, and the required IRS phase shift values are calculated using an alternate optimization method that considers the interdependence between the amplitude and phase responses of an IRS element; in the second phase, the PAP flying velocity and user scheduling are calculated using a novel multi-lap trajectory design algorithm. Numerical evaluations show that: neglecting the Peukert effect overestimates the available flight time of the PAP; after a certain threshold, increasing the battery size reduces the available flight time of the PAP; the presence of IRS modules improves the GEE of the system compared to other baseline scenarios; the multi-lap trajectory saves more energy compared to a single-lap trajectory developed using a combination of sequential convex programming and Dinkelbach algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a distributed beam tracking scheme for millimeter-wave unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communication systems. In the considered systems, aerial node base (aNB) connects the ground vehicles (GV) through directive beams to mitigate the path loss. However, line-of-sight (LoS) blockage may result in the link disconnection, which leads to the corruption of observations. To solve this issue, we extend the one-to-one beam tracking into the multi-node cooperative beam tracking scheme. For the multi-node cooperative problem, we develop the distributed extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based beam tracking to overcome the high nonlinearity and field-of-view (FoV) limitation of the observation model. While the multi-node cooperation scheme alleviates the corruptions of the observations, it may cause the error propagation between neighbor nodes. Thus, we incorporate the resilient network control into the proposed scheme. Consequently, a distributed EKF-based multi-node cooperative beam tracking protocol is proposed for the correction of corrupted observations and link stability. From our comprehensive simulation, the result of the proposed scheme shows 87.07% error reduction compared to the single node method. This improvement is comparable to the result of the centralized method (91.28% error reduction), and the proposed scheme also has the advantage of scalability.},

  abstract     = {In order to improve the performance of the communication infrastructure in smart cities, integration of two emerging technologies, namely Fog Computing (FC) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN), has been proposed and is gaining momentum. The resulting SDN-based FC integrated architecture is expected to meet the Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications&#39; requirements, especially in terms of easy manageability, high scalability, increased reliability, and low latency. Existing traffic engineering approaches proposed for SDN-based FC for IoT compute the route between an IoT device and fog server subject to some Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. However, these approaches ignore the link reliability level in the route computation process. Unlike them, this paper proposes a Reliability-Aware Flow Distribution Algorithm (RAFDA) and two associated optimization algorithms called Reactive Reliability-Aware Heuristic Algorithms (RRAHA-1 and RRAHA-2), which distribute the flows on the links based on the links&#39; reliability levels, subject to additional constraints like traffic load on the link, bandwidth allocation, link utilization, and end-to-end delay. The proposed algorithms minimize the impact of link failure occurrences on the ongoing time-critical flows (applications/services) of smart cities. The proposed algorithms, evaluated using both real network traces and simulations, outperform existing approaches in terms of performance for delay-sensitive services in smart cities.},

  abstract     = {Compared with the scalar array, the polarization-sensitive array (PSA) possesses a more powerful anti-jamming ability in adaptive array processing. However, each antenna of the traditional PSA requires two or more radiofrequency (RF) front-ends, which results in proliferation in computational complexity and even configuration redundancy that has little impact on performance. Besides, the RF front-end is much more expensive than the antenna, making the cost extremely high when considering a large PSA. Therefore, it is essential to search for a PSA reconfiguration approach that utilizes fewer RF front-ends and can generate excellent interference rejection performance. In this work, we devise a new PSA reconfiguration strategy, termed dipole selection, to employ fewer dipoles and RF front-ends to acquire a high signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR). And the strategy is implemented by controlling the RF switch between the RF front-end and the dipole. The polarization-spatial correlation coefficient (PSCC), characterizing the difference between desired signal and interference in the polarization-spatial domain, is proposed to analyze the effect of PSA reconfiguration on anti-interference performance. Subsequently, the problem of dipole selection is addressed with two proposed methods, named Quadratic-Over-Linear Fraction (QOLF) and Correlation Measurement Elimination (CME), respectively. Numerical and experimental simulation results demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed strategy and approaches.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the problem of Remote Electrical Tilt (RET) optimization using off-policy learning techniques devised for Contextual Bandits (CBs). The goal in RET optimization is to control the vertical tilt angle of antennas at base stations to optimize key performance indicators representing the Quality of Service (QoS) perceived by the users in cellular networks. Learning an improved tilt update policy is hard. On the one hand, coming up with a policy in an online manner in a real network requires exploring tilt updates that have never been used before, and is operationally too risky. On the other hand, devising this policy via simulations suffers from the simulation-to-reality gap. In this paper, we circumvent these issues by learning an improved policy in an offline manner using existing data collected on real networks. We formulate the problem of devising such a policy using the off-policy contextual bandit framework. We propose CB learning algorithms to extract optimal tilt update policies from the data. We train and evaluate these policies on real-world cellular network data. Our policies show consistent improvements over the rule-based logging policy used to collect the data.},

While massive MIMO transceiver design typically relies on the conventional mean-square error (MSE) criterion, directly minimizing the symbol error rate (SER) can lead to a superior performance. In this article, we first mathematically formulate the problem of hybrid transceiver design under the minimum SER (MSER) optimization criterion and then develop an MSER-based iterative gradient descent (GD) algorithm to find the related stationary points. We then propose a deep-unfolding neural network (NN). The iterative GD algorithm is unfolded into a multi-layer structure wherein trainable parameters are introduced to accelerate the convergence and enhance the overall system performance. To implement the training stage, we derive the relationship between adjacent layers&#39; gradients based on the generalized chain rule (GCR). The deep-unfolding NN is developed for both quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$M$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -ary quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) signals, and its convergence is investigated theoretically.

Along this direction, we first introduce a quantization-aware channel estimator based on linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) estimate theory over spatially correlated Rayleigh fading channels. By leveraging on the estimated channel state information (CSI), we derive the theoretical expressions of the achievable uplink spectral efficiency (SE) for maximal ratio combining (MRC), quantization-aware multicell minimum mean-squared error (QA-M-MMSE) combining, and quantization-aware single-cell MMSE (QA-S-MMSE) combining, respectively. We consider the impacts of quantization errors and resort to random matrix theory to derive theoretical results. Afterwards, power and bit allocation problems are investigated under the variable-resolution architecture. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our theoretical analyses are correct and that the proposed quantization-aware estimator and combiners are more beneficial than their quantization-unaware counterparts. Moreover, simulation results also verify the conclusions of the proposed power and bit allocation schemes.},

Practical situations arise where sensor measurement noise is non-Gaussian and the standard extended Kalman filter (EKF) based tracker may not be robust, resulting in large tracking error or even lack of convergence. This motivated development of a new tracker, designed for white non-Gaussian noise cases. The noise is decomposed into a sum of Gaussian components using expectation maximization (EM), and the target state is estimated by adapting an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Adaptations are necessary to combine the EM with the iterative EKF. From the analysis of the estimation error, a closed-form expression was derived revealing the presence of a bias in the estimate. On investigation, a sensor path optimization scheme is found that can eliminate bias. Furthermore, a compensation algorithm is presented, which reduces bias for the case of static sensors. The new tracker is suitable for real-time implementation and simulation results demonstrate significant improvements for the target tracking with non-Gaussian noise.},

  abstract     = {Considering the limited bandwidth of underwater wireless communications with radio frequency and acoustic waves and the constant increasing need for underwater high-speed data transmission, underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) has been regarded as an attractive and viable alternative. However, UWOCs suffer from degradation attributed to underwater attenuation, oceanic turbulence, and pointing errors in oceanic channel. Therefore, performance enhancement technique plays a key role in the design and deployment of a UWOC system. In this article, we propose to improve the performance of a UWOC by transmitting with pointing adjustable beam arrays (PABA). In a PABA, we can adjust pointing directions of every single beam by reflectors. To decrease the path loss and turbulence-induced scintillations and weaken the influence of pointing errors in UWOCs, we make the one central beam and several surrounding beams in a PABA point toward the center of a receiver aperture, and make the remaining surrounding beams in a PABA point toward several target points located symmetrically on a ring with an adjustable radius around the center of a receiver aperture. This adjustable radius is set according to the average pointing errors in every specific UWOC link. To estimate the average pointing errors more accurate, we calculate pointing errors in view of both beam wander caused by oceanic turbulence and the misaligned displacements resulted by the changes in the position and attitude of an underwater platform. Finally, we validate the effect of PABA on improving the performance of UWOCs by simulations.},

Partial charging voltage and current data are selected from the raw charging data and can be directly fed into the proposed model without complicated pre-processing, resulting in easier training preparation and lower computational intensity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can precisely estimate the battery capacity with the absolute error of less than 0.021 Ampere-hour and 0.11 Ampere-hour for two types of batteries.

To enhance the performance of SINS/DVL TC integration system in situations of partial DVL beam measurements, virtual beam aided solutions are proposed, theoretically derived, and experimentally evaluated. To that end, we analyze the geometrical relation between the DVL beam configuration and a zero velocity vector assumption and derive a zero velocity update (ZUPT) aided virtual beam method to continuously operate the TC fusion. Further, to avoid the precondition limitation of ZUPT method, a least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) aided virtual beam construction algorithm together with its SINS/DVL TC integration scheme is proposed. Our experiments show the advantages and disadvantages of the ZUPT aided solution under different scenarios, and indicate the effectiveness of the LS-SVM aided virtual beam solution during short partial beam measurement periods.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a new nonlinear observer-based method to detect the faults of both steering and torque actuators of autonomous ground vehicles. To this end, the nonlinear vehicle system is reformulated in a Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model with both measured and unmeasured nonlinear consequents, called N-TS fuzzy model. Differently from the classical TS fuzzy technique with linear consequents, this N-TS fuzzy reformulation enables an effective use of differential mean value theorem to deal with unmeasured nonlinearities, which is known as a major challenge in TS fuzzy observer design. Moreover, the N-TS fuzzy form also allows reducing not only the design conservatism but also the numerical complexity of the design conditions as well as the observer structure, which is crucial for real-time vehicle application. To minimize the disturbance effect with an &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathscr {H}_\infty$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; performance and maximize the fault sensibility with an &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathscr {H}_-$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; performance, the a priori information on the disturbance/fault frequency ranges is taken into account in the N-TS fuzzy observer design via the generalized Kalman–Yakubovich–Popov (KYP) lemma. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, the design of the proposed multiobjective &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathscr {H}_-/\mathscr {H}_\infty$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; N-TS fuzzy fault detector is recast as an optimization problem with strict linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints, which can be effectively solved with numerical solvers. Both numerical and experiments are performed under realistic driving conditions to demonstrate the theoretical and practical interests of the new finite-frequency fuzzy fault detection method.},

  abstract     = {Diverse passengers have various driving habits and driving preferences, thus the function of personalized driving is one of the most important features for autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this paper, the variable driving style factor is proposed to describe the preferences of aggressiveness for different passengers. Based on this, a cooperative trajectory planning framework that includes longitudinal speed adjustment and lateral trajectory planning for lane changing is proposed. In the longitudinal speed adjustment, a cooperative game approach that considers driving safety, ride comfort, travel efficiency, and the preferences of aggressiveness is proposed to extend the longitudinal distance between the ego car and cars moving on the adjacent lane before lane changing. In the lateral trajectory planning, an alternate trajectory set (ATS) method is proposed to obtain a set of trajectories, and the artificial potential field (APF) method is deployed to select the optimal safe trajectories subject to the environmental constraints. Then, the B-spline method is utilized to generate safe and smooth lane-changing trajectories considering the driving style factors. Finally, a modified pure pursuit tracker is designed to accurately track the planned trajectories. Experimental results show that the real-time system can generate safe and personalized trajectories for AVs with different driving preferences, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

However, the traditional passive filter design method takes less consideration of the change of the system source impedance, which will lead to almost no insertion loss in some frequency bands or an over-design of the filter. Based on the onboard working conditions of high-voltage and high-current, this article adopts the dual current probe method to obtain the source impedance of the system when it is working, and proposes a filter multi-objective optimization design method based on the genetic algorithm (GA). This method automatically selects the optimal topology of the filter and related component parameters according to the source impedance and load impedance, avoiding the filter resonance phenomenon and over-design problems caused by not considering source impedance. The experimental results show that conducted interference voltage and current of motor drive system with filter designed by the proposed method can pass CISPR25-2016rd level 3.},

  abstract     = {Torque is a significant parameter in the design and control of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). Torque measurement systems are usually expensive, which correspondingly require extra room and add weight. Alternatively, torque can be estimated by the product of the measured current and the estimated magnetic flux. In general, the conventional torque estimation method for PMSM is established based on ignoring core saturation. However, in special vehicles, due to the high power density and narrow installation space of the motors, the saturation degree of the core is high, and the nonlinear characteristic between torque and current is more prominent, which would bring significant errors to the conventional torque estimation method. In order to solve the aforementioned problem, this paper studies on the torque from the perspective of magnetomotive force (MMF). A saturation coefficient is proposed to modify the conventional torque model by considering the core reluctance. Then, a practical analytical expression of average torque and an improved torque estimation method are proposed. Compared with the conventional method, the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy of the estimation. At last, comprehensive simulation and experimental results based on a prototyped 300 kW interior PMSM have fully demonstrated that the proposed method can get accurate torque under different load conditions.},

Back Situation Awareness (BSA) is such a use case that provides an advance notification to the vehicles of an arriving emergency vehicle (EmV). This paper presents an algorithm for enhancing the accuracy of the advanced Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) notification of an approaching EmV towards the other vehicles on the highway. The notification is expected to ensure timely reaction by the vehicles to create a clear corridor for the EmV to pass through unhindered, thereby saving critical time to reach the emergency event in a safe manner. The main features of the presented solution are i) the self-correcting algorithm, ii) adaptive and dynamic dissemination areas size allocation, as a response to traffic changes, and iii) the evaluation of the ETA estimation accuracy. We have used the real travel time data measurements collected on the E313 highway (Antwerp, Belgium), to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. The performance is evaluated and compared in terms of accuracy and run-time complexity, using different methods such as Kalman filter, Filter-less method, Moving Average, and Exponential Moving Average filters. It is observed that the Kalman filter provides better accuracy on the ETA estimation, thereby reducing the estimation error by around 14% on average.},

The model was developed to comprehensively assess and more accurately identify long-term driving styles. First, the characteristic parameters of the driving cycle and style are selected and calculated, and the dimensions of the data collected from real vehicles are minimized through principal component analysis (PCA). Second, a two-stage clustering algorithm based on the particle swarm optimization K-means optimized by the genetic algorithm (GA-PSO-K-means) is used to obtain the type labels of driving cycles and styles to ensure the stability of the clustering algorithm. Third, an artificial neural network (ANN) is utilized to build the instantaneous recognition model of the driving cycle and style. Based on this, a comprehensive driving style identification model is built using the analytic hierarchy process(AHP). Finally, the bench and real vehicle tests are used to verify that the proposed model is accurate and effective.},

However, most of the existing methods focus on pedestrian-pedestrian interaction ignoring the pedestrian-vehicle interaction and containing much ineffective interaction. To tackle the problem, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal LSTM attention network (STLAN) for pedestrian trajectory prediction based on a spatiotemporal dual attention module (STDAM). First, a pedestrian social force model is established to analyze the effective pedestrian-pedestrian interaction and pedestrian-vehicle interaction in mixed traffic scene. Second, a pedestrian trajectory prediction network architecture is constructed to integrate temporal and spatial information. By temporal attention STDAM captures underlying dependencies between time steps in individual pedestrian, assigning different weights to the input sequence of it. By spatial attention STDAM extracts latent interaction between traffic actors, assigning different weights to every traffic actor. In addition, random noise is introduced to simulate the uncertainty of pedestrian trajectory. Experimental results on a real-world traffic actors dataset show that STLAN outperforms several mainstream methods. Specifically, STLAN achieves 0.17/0.11 ADE/FDE and 3.79/0.38 AMD/AMV in the representative pedestrian-pedestrian interaction scene, with 0.15/0.17 ADE/FDE and 2.36/0.21 AMD/AMV in pedestrian-vehicle interaction scene. Furthermore, ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of STDAM in improving trajectory prediction accuracy.},

Current yaw moment control methods for distributed drive electric vehicles (DDEVs) does not fully consider the relationship between the vehicle instability degree and the optimal yaw moment control center, which greatly restricts the attitude correction ability of the four-wheel drive torque. To solve this problem, this article proposes a novel multi-level coordinated yaw stability control method based on robust sliding mode predictive control (SMPC) for DDEVs to improve the maneuverability and lateral stability. Firstly, a novel multi-scale vehicle dynamic model of yaw motion is constructed with the consideration that the vehicle instability center is time-varying under various sideslip conditions. Then, an online sliding mode prediction model of dynamics nonlinear system of DDEVs is established according to the local modeling method based on just-in-time learning. In addition, the linear time-varying model predictive control algorithm (LTV-MPC) with less predictive horizon is used to obtain the optimal sliding mode control law. Besides, an adaptive weighted soft switching function based on data driven hierarchical predictive proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control is put forward to determine the optimal weight value of the three yaw moment control modes in real time. Finally, the simulation and experimental results have verified that the proposed control method has strong vehicle attitude correction ability which can improve the trajectory tracking accuracy and the handling stability for DDEVs under extreme conditions.},

However, to fully realize the potential of this structure, the design of an appropriate energy management strategy (EMS) is necessary. This paper aims to compare the operating cost, including hydrogen consumption and degradation of the FC, between a single-stack (SS) and an MSFC-HEV. To do so, a hierarchical EMS, composed of two layers, is devised for the MS system. In the first layer, a rule-based strategy determines how many FCs should be ON according to the requested power, battery state of charge (SOC), and FCs degradations. In the second layer, an equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) is developed to determine the output power of each activated FC according to the cost function and constraints. Regarding the SS structure, ECMS is employed for power distribution. The purpose of this strategy is to decrease fuel consumption and FC system degradation costs in both structures. The performance of the ECMS is compared with dynamic programming (DP) as a global optimization strategy for validation purposes. The obtained results using experimental data show that an FC-HEV with an MS structure reaches less hydrogen and degradation costs than an SS one.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed a remarkable growth of micro aerial vehicle (MAV) technologies, which are desirable for many applications, e.g. , warehouse inventory management and home entertainment. These indoor needs significantly improve work efficiency while posing fundamental challenges in the design of MAV state estimation. The state includes a vehicle&#39;s position, orientation, and velocity, which are fundamental to guide the motor control and adjust that vehicle&#39;s actions in autonomous flight. Existing vision-based solutions only work in well-lit texture-rich environments, while laser-based solutions are limited to MAVs&#39; payload and budget. This paper presents WiSion, a robust and low-cost state estimator that leverages ubiquitous WiFi to estimate six-degree-of-freedom states for MAVs. Our observation is that the multipath of WiFi conceals a wealth of information about a vehicle&#39;s state, which helps combat the temporal drift of inertial sensors for smooth state estimation. We realize WiSion by an absolute-relative WiFi sensing module and a WiFi-inertial state estimation module. It works without knowing access points&#39; (APs&#39;) positions. We implement the prototype with off-the-shelf products and conduct experiments in indoor venues. Our results show that WiSion achieves the position error of 35.25 cm and the attitude error of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$2.6^\circ$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; with a maximum linear velocity of 1.74 m/s. Moreover, WiSion can recover APs&#39; positions and is robust to indoor hindrances such as obstacles and multipath.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the gradual improvement of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) ecosystem has highlighted the commercial potential of IoV. The IoV not only shows excellent performance in terms of road safety and driving comfort but also has great significance in terms of building new models of automobiles and transportation services. In addition, as the foundation of intelligent transportation, IoV has emerged as a research hotspot. However, the IoV has some shortcomings in terms of security, privacy, and storage of massive amounts of data. First, from the viewpoint of security and privacy, the transmission of encrypted data is bound to cause traffic wastage. Second, the massive amount of data stored in the cloud inevitably leads to data redundancy. To address the conflict between semantic security and data redundancy, this study formalizes a secure scheme for duplicated data that can prevent unnecessary storage and traffic on the cloud. This method ensures that an authorized intelligent connected vehicle (ICV) can logically outsource and retrieve data regardless of duplication. Under the premise of semantic security, a two-party deduplication protocol is constructed in terms of the homomorphic number theory research unit (NTRU). Our experimental results show that the proposed scheme is not only secure, but also able to provide complete semantic privacy without any third party. In the context of large-scale real-time IoV, this study not only provides a safe and reliable solution for data deduplication but also optimizes the efficiency of the solution.},

The actively controlled pantograph is one of the promising technologies to suppress the fluctuation of the pantograph-catenary contact force (PCCF). In this paper, we propose a novel pantograph control strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to overcome the complex time-varying characteristic of PCS, which distorts the system identification of the classical control methods. First, a non-linear pantograph-catenary system model is established based on the finite element and multi-body dynamics theory as the simulation environment in DRL. Then, the state space, action space, and reward in DRL are redesigned to train the agent, which is suitable for PCS. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method are verified under various working conditions and parameter disturbances. The experiment results show that our control strategy can reduce the PCCF fluctuation up to 40% and reject parametric perturbation while achieving state-of-the-art performance on the benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {With the development of urban rail transit, energy conservation has been highly concerned by the worldwide railway industry. The existing energy-saving control methods are hard to meet the requirements of large-scale multi-train intelligent cooperation. Furthermore, in order to optimize the overall energy consumption and make effective utilization of regenerative braking energy (RBE), the micro train driving strategies must be taken into account in the macro train schedule regulation. This article aims to establish a systematic optimization model to describe the train traffic environment and design a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach using multi-agent cooperative actor-critic (MACAC) to reschedule multiple trains for energy saving. Due to the high dimensional characteristic of control actions, the action representation technique is applied for generalization. The multiple agents are deployed on the Spark cloud platform to effectively improve the learning efficiency through multi-node parallel computing. The proposed MACAC approach on Spark cloud is capable of dealing with the intelligent learning and computing efficiency of large-scale train operation synergy, and saving energy to the maximum extent on the premise of satisfying various time constraints. The evaluation was carried out through the field data of Beijing Yizhuang subway line. The results show that the proposed MACAC approach can effectively learn to improve the energy efficiency, and the parallel computing method on Spark cloud is suitable for practical applications.},

According to the characteristics of lateral constraint, in the area with good GPS signal, installation errors between the INS body coordinate frame and the vehicle coordinate frame are estimated at the same time of integrated navigation. In the GPS-denied area, the estimated installation errors are compensated to calculate the reference velocity at first. After compensation, the difference between INS velocity and reference velocity is taken as the measurement. Finally, the Kalman filter model is established to correct the inertial navigation position. In addition, the simulation and experimental verification of the proposed lateral constraint method are carried out. The results show that the INS positioning accuracy can be improved above 50% by using the lateral constraint method in GPS-denied environment, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed lateral constraint method.},

The basis of our strategy is to optimally allocate the transmitted resources of power and effective bandwidth by the prior information in the closed-loop system of cognitive tracking. On account of the predicted conditional Cramér-Rao lower bound (PC-CRLB) offering a more accurate and time-sensitive lower bound than the standard posterior CRLB (PCRLB), the PC-CRLB of the range, Doppler frequency, and direction-of-arrival (DOA) is derived, normalized and adopted as the optimization criterion. Moreover, in order to solve the nonconvex problem, the initial nonconvex problem is converted into a series of convex problems, which are further formulated as the standard semi-definite programming (SDP) problems and then be solved, by introducing the convex relaxation technique and the two-step solution technique. Simulations confirm the superiority of the proposed JSPBA algorithm, in terms of the overall tracking accuracy in the MMTT scenario.},

  abstract     = {Due to the numerical subsystems and functionalities among the platoon, failures easily occur and lead vehicle safety and stability to deteriorate. With the surge of platoon connectivity, the abnormal states arising in faulty vehicles will have an impact on adjacent healthy vehicles, potentially resulting in severe traffic accidents. To address the aforementioned problems and improve the functional safety of platoons, a systemic anti-fault safety consensus strategy is proposed in this article to deal with sensor faults, LOE actuator faults, and bias actuator faults simultaneously. To tackle the necessary defects, this safety consensus technique can be split into fault detection tasks and fault-tolerant control tasks. Initially, a distributed finite-time observer is employed to detect sensor faults through the index between the reconstructed states and received states. In the presence of actuator faults, a novel adaptive finite-time fault parameter estimation law collaboration with a feasible differential observer is developed to assess the precise fault extent. In addition, to improve the estimation performance of the adaptive fault parameter estimation law, an integral discounted cost function is constructed in this paper to obtain the optimal learning gain. Via theoretical analysis, the solution for the minimal value of the cost function and the finite-time convergence property are demonstrated in this paper. Furthermore, by utilizing this novel adaptive optimal finite-time estimation law, a novel distributed adaptive finite-time fault-tolerant controller is constructed to compensate for failures in platoon. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of our safety consensus strategy are verified by real-time simulations through the dSPACE platform.},

To address the torque tracking control problem with time delay, a deep inference and control method is proposed. First, a theoretical delay time under different rotating speeds is identified with a data-driven model. Then, a fast end-to-end prediction model is established to estimate the torque performance of the next step with delay information. The deep Q-network (DQN) learning approach is proposed to learn the experimental data by exploring and seeking the optimal control strategy in the time delay environment. A comparative simulation of the proposed DQN-based controller with or without considering time delay, and the rule-based method with or without considering time delay is implemented, and an online processor-in-the-loop (PIL) test with the edge computing device NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX is performed on the robustness condition. The simulation results and PIL test results demonstrate that the proposed control framework achieves a great improvement in the torque tracking effect with time efficiency.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a stochastic and predictive control design approach for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in a mixed-autonomy traffic environment, where CAVs are able to react properly to uncertain maneuvers of human-driven vehicles (HVs). The proposed fully-automated cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) design leverages a discrete hybrid stochastic model predictive controller that automatically determines the vehicle&#39;s operating mode based on onboard sensors data and information received through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. Operating modes include free following, warning, danger, emergency braking, and lane change. Although the controller mainly focuses on maintaining the desired velocity and distance among CAVs, it also allows HVs to perform lane-change maneuvers and merge into the platoon&#39;s lane when needed. In response to an HV&#39;s position in the lane and its probabilistic behavior, the controller may switch the CAV&#39;s operating mode to react accordingly. Considering free-following and emergency-braking modes leads to efficient and safe autonomous driving. Switching between warning, danger, and lane-change modes along with adjusting the steering angle to perform a lane-change maneuver, when needed, robustifies the platoon&#39;s performance against unexpected human-driven vehicle maneuvers. Simulation studies are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed control design approach. The performance of the proposed control design approach is also compared to a switching control using simulation studies.},

  abstract     = {Automatic emergency braking (AEB) system play an essential role in avoiding traffic collisions and minimizing impact strengths, which contributes to improving road traffic safety. However, the present research of the AEB system is mainly concentrated on avoiding the car to car and car to pedestrian collisions. China has typical mixed traffic characteristics, especially the frequent car to two-wheeler collision accidents. Research on the AEB system to prevent car to two-wheeler collisions in complex multi-traffic scenarios is of great significance to further improve the comprehensive performance of the AEB system. In this article, based on the cases of the car to two-wheeler collisions from China In-Depth Accident Study (CIDAS) database, the effects of three key parameters of the AEB system, braking deceleration, braking advance time, and detection range, on the accident rate and severity are studied by accident reconstruction and virtual experiment. Results show that the theoretical optimal detection range of the AEB system is 180°–35 m for the car to two-wheeler collision prevention. Moreover, the current feasible optimal detection range is 120°–35 m due to the limitation of environmental awareness technology. When the braking advance time is 1 s, the detection angle is 120°, and the detection distance is 35 m, the installation of the AEB system can avoid 22.3% of the car to two-wheeler collision accidents. Meanwhile, in the inevitable accidents, the average collision speed of vehicles decreases from 33.93 to 21.34 km/h, which effectively reduces the collision strengths. Findings of this study could help car manufacturers and makers of AEB hardware select the appropriate detection radar. They can also provide ideas and data support for formulating relevant laws and regulations of the AEB system, future development of AEB system, or other driver assistance systems.},

  abstract     = {The physics of shockwaves is a fundamental traffic characteristic that is useful for microscopic traffic flow modeling. Thanks to connected vehicle technologies, it is possible to capture shockwaves by collecting the information of multiple downstream vehicles. Numerous classical physics-based models have utilized the physics of shockwaves to predict vehicle trajectory dynamics, yet their predictability is often limited due to the volatile and complex nature of highway traffic composed of human-driven vehicles. Recent learning-based trajectory prediction models utilize historical trajectories of surrounding vehicles to improve predictability. However, those learning-based models are purely data-driven, thus lacking interpretability and physical insights, or even missing opportunities for further improving model predictability. To leverage the advantages of both learning-based and physics-based models, this study proposes a physics-aware learning-based model for a trajectory prediction of congested traffic in a connected vehicle environment. A newly collected highway trajectory dataset is adopted for training and validation. Experiment results show that the proposed hybrid model yields better predictability, compared with the learning-based models (e.g., long short-term memory neural networks and convolutional neural networks), with an 8.7% predictability reduction of position errors and a 6.5% reduction of speed errors, which further verify the positive impacts of adopting physics of shockwaves in hybrid learning models. Moreover, result analysis shows that predictability improves as the market penetration rate increases, and the proposed hybrid model is better than the learning-based models with 3-10% improvements in predictability.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a low-cost printed-circuit-board (PCB) technology-based on-glass grid structure and its application in highly-transparent antenna for the internet of vehicles are presented. Firstly, a diamond-shaped grid structure on a glass substrate for high optical transparency (OT) is studied. To show the feasibility, two equal-length co-planar waveguide (CPW) transmission lines (TMLs) with conventional solid and the proposed grid structure are compared. It is found that identical electrical length and comparable performance of the two TMLs are obtained. The relationship between OT and electrical performance is also derived. In the next place, the application of the on-glass grid structure in the highly-transparent antenna design is explored, and the detailed fabrication process is presented. Finally, for demonstration, a CPW-fed wideband end-fire on-glass highly-transparent antenna covering the 5.8-GHz vehicle-to-vehicle band is designed, fabricated, and measured. Ultra-broad impedance bandwidth of 64.6% (3.08–6.02 GHz), wide H-plane beamwidths of over 146°, high antenna efficiencies of over 71.9%, and high OT of 69.8% are achieved. Easily fabricated with mature PCB technology and integrated on the vehicle windows, the proposed structure provides a low-cost highly-transparent solution for the internet of vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) have potential applications in improving the efficiency and safety for intelligent transportation systems. The openness of VANETs, however, also introduces privacy and security implications. Despite a number of conditional privacy-preserving authentication (CPPA) schemes with anonymity and conditional traceability have been designed for VANETs, a majority of these schemes cannot be directly applied to a real-world setting (e.g., due to the need for a certificate manager for issuing keys in PKI-based solutions, or the inherent key escrow problem in ID-based solutions). There have also been attempts to design blockchain-based CPPA schemes, but these schemes may not support key revocation or are inefficient (e.g., due to on-chain operations). This paper proposes an efficient blockchain-based CPPA (EBCPPA) scheme, which is designed to mitigate the above limitations. Our proposal consists of two key building blocks, namely: signature of knowledge and smart contract. To evaluate the feasibility, we present the security and performance analyses of EBCPPA. Specifically, the performance evaluations show that EBCPPA is more efficient than other existing state-of-the-art solutions, in terms of signing (improving at least 49.71%), the verification (improving at least 32.84%) and bandwidth requirement (reducing at least 27.59%).},

This work also presents a parallel and hardware-efficient architecture of the QC-LDPC decoder based on the suggested SOMS algorithm. Additional architectural transformations have been carried out to reduce the routing complexity of the proposed decoder and deliver lower latency and higher throughput. Comprehensive performance analysis of the SOMS algorithm has been presented under various scenarios based on the specifications of the 5G-NR standard. It shows that the suggested SOMS algorithm delivers an adequate FER of 10 &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$^{-5}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; at SNR of 1.3 dB while decoding 16-QAM modulated QC-LDPC code with the code rate of 1/3 and the code length of 26112 bits.

  abstract     = {An orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform enables simultaneous radar sensing and communications. In the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) case with several transmit (Tx) antennas, multiplexing the transmit signals is usually implemented using equidistant subcarrier interleaving (ESI), thus allowing the separation of the transmit signals in frequency domain. In this work, a multiplexing technique denoted as range-division multiplexing (RDMult) is analyzed, which allows separating signals radiated by different Tx antennas along the range axis of a range-Doppler map. This work also investigates the effects of RDMult on the communication task. It turns out that RDMult heavily distorts the channel statistics by introducing a repetitive pattern of deep fading holes, which severely distort the transmission of data. To combat this issue, this work proposes a communication system especially designed for RDMult, including methods for data estimation, channel estimation and synchronization. Simulations confirm the effectiveness of these concepts in terms of bit error ratio (BER) performance.},

In this article, we present an integrated Time-Sensitive Software-Defined Networking (TSSDN) architecture that simultaneously enables control of synchronous and asynchronous real-time and best-effort communication for all IVN traffic classes. Despite the central SDN controller, we can validate that control can operate without a delay penalty for TSN traffic, provided protocols are properly mapped. We demonstrate how TSSDN adaptably and reliably enhances network security for in-vehicle communication. A systematic investigation of the possible control flow integrations with switched Ether-networks reveals that these strategies allow for shaping the attack surface of a software-defined IVN. We discuss embeddings of control flow identifiers on different layers, covering the range from a fully exposed mapping to deep encapsulation. We experimentally evaluate these strategies in a production vehicle, which we map to a modern Ethernet topology. Our findings indicate that visibility of automotive control flows on lower network layers enables isolation and access control throughout the network infrastructure. Such a TSSDN backbone can establish and survey trust zones within the IVN and reduce the attack surface of connected cars in various attack scenarios.},

In the proposed GBSM, clusters in the environment are divided into static clusters and dynamic clusters. Furthermore, the time-variant acceleration together with the integration of time during the transmission distance update are exploited. As a result, the continuously arbitrary trajectory of the transceiver and dynamic clusters is successfully captured. To jointly model space-time-frequency (S-T-F) non-stationarity of 6G V2V channels, a new method, which properly integrates the frequency-dependent factor, birth-death (BD) process, and selective evolution of static and dynamic clusters, is developed. Key channel statistics, including the space-time-frequency correlation function (STF-CF), time stationary interval, and Doppler power spectral density (DPSD) are obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that S-T-F non-stationarity is modeled and the impacts of vehicular traffic density (VTD) and vehicular movement trajectory (VMT) on channel statistics are further analyzed thoroughly. Finally, the generality and accuracy of the proposed GBSM are validated through the comparison of simulation results and available measurement data.},
