  abstract     = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a burden to the society and family. Applying computing-aided strategies to reveal its pathology is one of the research highlights. Plasma neurofilament light (NFL) is an emerging noninvasive and economic biomarker for AD molecular pathology. It is valuable to reveal the correlations between the plasma NFL levels and neurodegeneration, especially hippocampal deformations at the preclinical stage. The negative correlation between plasma NFL levels and hippocampal volumes has been documented. However, the relationship between the plasma NFL levels and the hippocampal morphometry details at the preclinical stage is still elusive. This study seeks to demonstrate the capacity of our proposed surface-based hippocampal morphometry system to discern the plasma NFL positive (NFL+ &gt; 41.9 pg/L) level and plasma NFL negative (NFL– &lt; 41.9 pg/L) level and illustrate its superiority to the hippocampal volume measurement by drawing the cohort of 154 cognitively unimpaired (CU) middle aged and elderly adults. We also apply this morphometry measure and a proposed sparse coding-based classification algorithm to classify CU individuals with NFL+ and NFL− levels. Experimental results show that the proposed hippocampal morphometry system offers stronger statistical power to discriminate CU subjects with NFL+ and NFL− levels, comparing with the hippocampal volume measure. Furthermore, this system can discriminate plasma NFL levels in CU individuals (Accuracy = 0.86). Both the group-level and individual-level analysis results indicate that the association between plasma NFL levels and the hippocampal shapes can be mapped at the preclinical stage.},

  abstract     = {To address the law enforcement challenges arising from the rapid expansion of the online catering industry, China’s market regulatory authorities are pursuing countermeasures through legislative efforts and innovative regulatory models. At present, administrative law enforcement for online catering faces difficulties in license management and ensuring the authenticity and security of data. Specifically, there is a prevalence of fraudulent licenses in the industry, and the market supervision department struggles to verify the authenticity of the data gathered during investigations and evidence collection. The tamper-proof and transparent features of blockchain technology cannot be directly applied to the online catering domain. Consequently, to attain trusted license management and secure data-sharing measures, further system design is necessary. To achieve trusted license management, we employ blockchain technology for managing qualification certificates and delineate the format for valid certificates and the application process. The secure data-sharing protocol is divided into two stages. In the first stage, we ensure data authenticity before uploading it to the blockchain through a consensus process involving platforms, users, and merchants. In the second stage, we implement fine-grained access control based on the on-chain data from the previous stage, utilizing conditional proxy reencryption and ultimately employing the data digest on the blockchain for verification. The experiment thoroughly validates the system’s functionality, which is traceable, transparent, and scalable. Moreover, the minimal delay introduced by ensuring data authenticity is virtually negligible. The system’s additional storage overhead does not surpass 10%, remaining within acceptable limits.},

Based on Ethereum and interplenary file systems (IPFS), we implement our framework and comprehensively analyze its performance. Experiments show that the proposed framework has acceptable collaboration costs and offers advantages in terms of privacy, security, and decentralization.

  abstract     = {Unit electricity pricing is of vital importance in an electric grid network. It is essential to charge the customers in a fair manner. Traditional pricing models are found to be inadequate in the ability to charge customers fairly due to a lack of support for real-time communication between customers and electricity providers. With the introduction of smart devices in the electric grid domain, the real-time gathering of information is a seamless process. Such an electric network that uses smart devices is called a smart grid. In a smart grid network, electricity providers can monitor the electricity usage pattern of customers in a real-time manner, which can then be analyzed to determine the appropriate prices. To analyze the customer’s history of usage and price the electricity in a real-time manner, the computation must be performed with minimal latencies. Adoption of a fog computing layer in the smart grids can aid in the attainment of this goal. In this article, we propose a novel method for the pricing of electricity. In our approach, the electric demand of a household is predicted based on their past usage patterns. Users are then clustered into different bins based on their demands, and an evolutionary algorithm is used to generate the prices for the users present in different bins in a real-time manner to ensure the maximum attainable profit to a service provider.},

In this article, a stereo vision odometry method in a dynamic environment is proposed, which can not only effectively overcome the influence of dynamic objects but also detect the position of dynamic objects. An optical flow filtering algorithm based on the quantitative histogram (QH) and the optical flow angle histogram (OFAH) of the feature points is proposed to obtain dynamic points. Furthermore, a multifeature fusion mechanism is used to perform binary segmentation and get the bounding box of dynamic object. Experiments show that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of pose estimation and detect moving objects in a dynamic environment.},

  abstract     = {Although the system for annual rankings of higher education institutions (HEIs) faces considerable criticism, these rankings are here to stay. Having become competent in assigning holistic ranking scores to HEIs, reputed ranking entities have now started focusing on subject-specific and regional rankings. However, in experts’ opinion, the process of assigning rankings should be more consistent, transparent, and representative. This study focuses on enhancing the credibility of the academic ranking process, by performing fine-grained assessment of the academic data pertaining to the computing discipline. The proposed assessment approach explores the data at the sub-discipline level, analyzing several ranking dimensions, including the research productivity, research impact, and research contribution of influential research scholars affiliated with renowned HEIs in the computing discipline. The analysis considers highly curated data published by three well-known international academic ranking entities, namely, Academic Rankings of World Universities (ARWU), Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), and Times Higher Education (THE), in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Researchers’ profiles are obtained from the Scopus repository, and the DBpedia repository is used to retrieve information about HEIs and their locations. For a stable comparison of the subject-specific academic rankings, the grand average rank measure is employed, whereas for finding the most influential researchers in computing, the ResRank measure is used. The sub-discipline-specific academic rankings provide more detailed insight into the academic rankings, thereby providing more robust decision support. This analysis, which focuses on the computing sub-discipline, is among the first few such efforts.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, there is a large number of web services with similar functions, from which users choose the best according to the quality of service (QoS). Hence, QoS prediction is a primary challenge in service recommendation. Most existing approaches model the user-service interaction relationship. However, the low-dimensional linear and the high-dimensional nonlinear relationships between users and services are seldom considered simultaneously. In addition, although location information, including the local location information of users and services, is incorporated to overcome data sparsity in most approaches. The global location information is seldom considered. Aiming at the above shortcomings, we propose a new QoS prediction model that fuses local and global location information of users and services in the interaction layer of the model. The proposed model uses a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to acquire high-dimensional nonlinear relationships of users and services, where the dot product is employed in complementing the learning of low-dimensional linear relationships. Experimental results on the real world dataset WS-Dream validate the prediction performance of the proposed model.},

By modeling the transaction data of blockchain as a network, a series of graph-based phishing detection frameworks have been proposed. Enlightened by adversarial attacks of graph data, we propose to verify the robustness of current phishing detection frameworks under intentional attackers aiming to hide phishing behaviors. In this study, we first propose a general phishing detection framework based on feature engineering and then propose a phishing hiding framework combing the greedy selection mechanism with four phishing hiding strategies to measure the robustness of the proposed general detection models. Extensive experiments evaluate the detective performance of the phishing detection model and its robustness against the hiding framework. The experimental results indicate that the detective model based on feature engineering is rather fragile under adversarial attacks.},

Crowdsensing requires a large number of users to participate in the collection of sensing data, and these data may carry sensitive information, such as identity and location related to the users or sensing object. If this information is eavesdropped, intercepted, and leaked, this may seriously harm the interests of individuals, organizations, and even countries. Therefore, from a privacy perspective, users may be reluctant to open data. While relying on mobile devices used by a large number of ordinary users as the basic sensing unit, it is necessary to include a variety of communication methods to realize the distribution of sensing tasks and to collect the sensing data. Then, to complete the complex crowdsensing tasks, it is important to ensure privacy security in the context of crowdsensing because it is a key problem.

Based on the maximum expert consensus model (MECM), we considered the uncertainty of the opinions of the three participating roles by introducing noncooperators. Additionally, three different opinion uncertainty sets were constructed to describe the characteristics of opinion uncertainty more accurately. Furthermore, by applying a robust optimization (RO) method to process uncertain sets, we propose mixed-integer robust MECMs, which reduce the risk of uncertain opinions to decision-makers (DMs). Moreover, numerical experiments used in the passenger satisfaction survey of the Shanghai Metro verified the validity of the models proposed in this article. The characteristics of the models were revealed through sensitivity analysis. Finally, to overcome the relatively highly conservative results of the classic RO method, we construct data-driven opinion uncertainty sets and propose data-driven RO models. Hence, DMs with different risk preferences can choose RO models with different risk levels according to the situation.},

We model both strategies in the evolutionary dynamics of signed networks to examine how both types of agents choose to behave in society. In particular, we run simulations and find that when agents’ strategies are fixed, collectivist agents or group decision-making are conducive to cooperation. Some network properties such as having structural balance and a clear modular organization promote cooperation. However, when strategic learning is considered, the dynamics become highly uncertain. When collectivist agents are initially located in a closely related group, the cooperation ratio and proportion of collectivist agents both rise. These observations reveal that besides network properties, the topology distribution of agents with different decision-making tendencies plays a significant role in social evolution.},

  abstract     = {The different news clicked by users reflects the diverse interests of users. Most of the existing news recommendation methods do not consider the interaction with candidate news in the process of modeling user interest representation. This method makes it challenging to precisely match candidate news to specific user interests. We propose a user interest activation recommendation method that fuses multichannel information—MIAR. It utilizes the word embedding of the user’s historical clicked news and the news title embedding generated by aggregation and interacts with the candidate news, respectively, to better match the candidate news with the user’s interests. Our proposed method contains two frameworks (interactive framework and distributed framework). In the interactive framework, we propose a user multichannel interest modeling framework MIF from the word embedding level of news headlines to capture more semantic cues related to user interests. In the distributed framework, we design a candidate-aware interest activation module TAR from the news embedding representation level obtained by attention aggregation. It uses different candidate news vectors to adjust the user representations learned from the user’s historical reading records. This allows the model to build candidate-guided user representations to accurately match candidate news to parts of user interests that are relevant to the candidate news. Finally, we effectively assign the weights of the two frame scores so that the models can fuse better. Extensive experiments on the MIND news recommendation dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract     = {Studying the dynamics of research communities has been an important yet tedious topic. It is important for devising management policies that optimize the quality of research outputs by promoting a certain composition, structure, and interaction patterns for a community. While there has been significant attention to understanding the roles of individuals, there has been less focus on studying the roles that research groups perform and how roles relate to the characteristics of the community. This article presents an experimental study on the roles that research groups have in the idea flow through a community. The study analyzes two facets: the contribution of different kinds of groups to the impact research ideas make on other groups and the importance of specific groups to connect a community together. The results showed that research groups can be classified into four categories depending on the number of received citations. Groups of the mid-tier categories (called categories B and C in this article) are important in tying a community together as they improve the idea impact and bridging between groups. Policies that aggressively eliminate such groups reduce the effectiveness of idea flow, even though research communities include a certain amount of robustness for moderate levels of group removals.},

  abstract     = {China is a developing country with a population of more than 1.4 billion, and people are demanding higher quality health care. Meanwhile, population aging and changes in the disease spectrum put new demands on medical and health services, indirectly promoting the rapid development of medicine and raised the tension of physician–patient relationship, which has led to increasing pressure on doctors, especially surgeons. Notably, the high risk of major operation and complicated postoperative conditions result in high comprehensive quality and high mental pressure of surgeons. In addition, the long hours for major operations, bright light stimulation, and fixed positions with a long time led to heavier burden for surgeons, whose physical and mental health need to be focused and researched. Thus, in this study, from May 1, 2021 to July 30, 2021, 316 surgeons in the Provincial General Hospital of Gansu were surveyed on their physical and mental health, and finally, the efficiency of questionnaires was 99%. The results found that most surgeons thought that they were under great pressure in scientific research, professional title, and work. About half of surgeons with experience of medical disputes felt depression and anxiety during medical disputes, of which only 8.14% did not receive professional psychological counseling. About one-third surgeons had different physical diseases and only 32% expressed that they had good physical health status. According to the result of self-report symptom checklist (SCL-90), the top five in percentage order of diseases were cervical spondylosis, digestive diseases, lumbar disease, fatty liver, and hyperlipidemia for surgeons. About 37% surgeons had mental health issues, and the main aspects were obsessive-compulsive, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, somatization, and anxiety. The workload and disease were the main influence factors on mental health of surgeons in Gansu Province, China.},

IM is a widely used model for information propagation in social networks. Although IM has been widely investigated in recent years, the fair propagation of information is still understudied. In this article, we consider the group-fairness-aware IM, where the objective is to ensure that information has been fairly distributed across different groups in the population. We extend the notion of group fairness in IM, introduced by Tsang et al., by considering the speed of information propagation in different groups of a social network and formulating it as a new group-fairness metric. We propose a multiobjective metaheuristic (SetMOGWO), based on the multiobjective gray wolf optimizer, to improve the fair propagation of information in IM concerning various fairness metrics. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the previous work with respect to all introduced fairness metrics. We also carry out detailed experimental analyses on real-world networks and report interesting relationships between fairness concepts and network characteristics, including the price of ensuring fairness in social networks, the effect of social groups’ structure on fairness, and the dependence among fairness metrics. Especially, we show that traditional IM techniques often neglect smaller groups. On the other hand, we show that, with a low cost, it can be ensured that these groups receive a fair portion of resources in fair order.},

  abstract     = {With the proliferation of smart devices and widespread Internet connectivity, social sensing is advancing as a pervasive sensing paradigm where experiences shared by individuals on social platforms (e.g., Twitter and Facebook) are analyzed to interpret the physical world. In this article, we introduce CovidTrak, a vision of social intelligence-empowered contact tracing that aims to scrutinize the knowledge derived using social sensing to track Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections among the general public. Contact tracing is known to be an effective technique for detecting and monitoring persons who may have been exposed to individuals infected with any communicable disease. While a good number of contact tracing schemes are existent today (e.g., in-person and phone interviews, paper forms, email and web-based questionnaires, and smartphone apps), they often require active user participation and might miss certain cases of social interactions that go off-the-records but still lead to COVID-19 transmission. By contrast, social sensing provides an alternative avenue for spontaneously determining such contacts by harnessing the rich experiences and information conveyed by people on social data platforms (e.g., a group photograph tweeted from a house party with a potential contact). As such, CovidTrak can form a powerful basis to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The vision of CovidTrak intends to answer the following questions: 1) how to bolster the privacy and security of the online users while determining their contacts? 2) how to collect relevant social signals that indicate in-person encounters among people? 3) how to reliably process the vast amount of noisy data from social platforms to identify chains of transmission? 4) how to handle the scarcity of location metadata in the incoming data? 5) how to effectively communicate crucial contact information to concerned individuals? and 6) how to model and handle the responses of the common people toward contact information? We envision unexplored opportunities to leverage multidisciplinary techniques to address the above questions and develop effective future CovidTrak schemes.},

Much research has been done around the support exchange behaviors and the content of support. Few have investigated the formation of reciprocal social support, especially in the context of social embedding where the social networks evolve. In this article, we aim to explain how reciprocal social support forms by testing and integrating the social science hypotheses into the modeling of the outside social networks. A series of simulation experiments have been conducted to test our hypotheses and the proposed models. The results show that our proposed models can well capture the reciprocal properties observed in real-world social networks, and our hypotheses can collectively explain the formation of reciprocal social support. By hypothesizing user behaviors of support exchange and modeling the outside social networks, our study advances the understanding of how users participate in online groups, either to give more or to receive more support.},

Traditional heuristic algorithms for influence maximization suffer from different issues, such as accuracy descent and information loss during network exploration. Besides, recently proposed deep learning-based approaches cannot extract the in-depth structural information of social networks well. In light of these problems, we propose a novel heuristic method called the network dynamic GCN influence maximization algorithm based on the leader fake labeling mechanism. To exploit the in-depth network topology information for the influence maximization task, we design a network dynamic GCN that owns adaptive layer numbers in terms of different network scales to obtain node representations. Then, considering that there are few labels in the network or the labels are irrelevant to the task of influence maximization, we establish a leader fake labeling mechanism to automatically generate node labels that are helpful to seed nodes selecting for model training. Finally, a heuristic method based on the Mahalanobis distance is developed to quickly select influential seed nodes with the learned node representations. Three real-world datasets are used in our experiments, and the experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm has a better performance for seed set identification under the premise of high efficiency compared with some latest heuristic influence maximization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Since 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted regular off-line business activities. This unprecedented situation inspires the valuable research on facilitating off-line business under pandemics. In this article, we conceptualized the problem as travel management in pandemic (TMiP) and analyzed it from the technological perspective. Enabling travel in a pandemic not only needs a health certificate to prove that the traveler is safe but also entry/exit permissions from both the origin and the destination regions, determined by the local situation and measures. Thus, TMiP is related to technical, social, economic, and administrative factors. By conducting a review on the literature covering the health certificate technology, its adoption in practice, and the exchange system technology published during the COVID-19 pandemic, we learned about their usefulness and limitations in TMiP. Second, we analyzed the review outcomes to infer the six distinctive technical challenges of TMiP. Third, we analyzed the feasibility of referential solutions to these challenges and showed their applicability and limitations. Finally, we offered the perspectives on new TMiP solutions and concluded that they rely on adapting existing solutions, creating new ones, and integrating all of them. We also presented future research directions in a holistic view of TMiP technical solutions. Overall, the findings of the study will stimulate more research on a more coordinated, comprehensive, and intelligent TMiP solution. We also hope this article can help practitioners to restart economies in a pandemic.},

We use random regular networks and real networks in our simulations to show that the constructed game follows evolutionary dynamics and that the outcome of the game depends on the relation between the structural properties of the network and the benefit and cost variables defined in a cooperative game. Second, we create a game on the network level where the players control a set of nodes. We define agents whose goal is to maximize the total reward that we set up to be the number of nodes affected at the end of the game.

However, in quite a few sale scenarios, the platform has the necessity to display users a series of items, which is called package recommendation. There is very little research in this area. This article develops a novel and realistic package recommendation system named package graph attention network (PGAT) based on graph neural network. PGAT integrates users, items, and packages to build a unified heterogeneous graph and treat them as a whole. PGAT incorporates an attention mechanism in the first-order neighborhood aggregation operation, which can differentiate the weight of different neighbor nodes to the center node. By performing graph attention and graph convolution operations on the tripartite graph, PGAT can learn node embeddings more expressively and address the problem of data sparse to a large extent. Extensive experiment results on two real-world datasets validate the outstanding performance of PGAT, which is superior to the state-of-the-art baselines by 0.77%–10.12%.},

  abstract     = {By matching attributes in user profiles, social networking services (SNSs) are able to create certain social relationships between different users. However, user profiles often contain sensitive information about users. If data matching is done in plaintext, users’ privacy and security will face serious challenges. Most recently, the hacking incident of Ashley Madison website, which incurred more than 60 GB of data being leaked, has prompted researchers to explore the privacy of user data in social networks urgently. Existing schemes may be able to achieve privacy-preserving user profile matching, but they require high communication bandwidth and complex computational costs.

  abstract     = {Current evidence indicates that the semantic representation of question and answer sentences is better generated by deep neural network-based sentence models than traditional methods in community answer selection tasks. In particular, as a widely recognized language model, the self-attention model computes the similarity between the specific word and the whole sets of words in the same sentence and generates new semantic representation through the similarity-weighted summation of semantic representations of the whole words. However, the self-attention operation entirely considers all the signals with a weighted sum operation, which disperses the distribution of attention, which may result in overlooking the relation of neighboring signals. This issue becomes serious when applying the self-attention model to online community question answering platforms because of the varied length of the user-generated questions and answers. To address this problem, we introduce an attention mechanism enhanced local self-attention (LSA), which restricts the range of original self-attention by a local window mechanism, thereby scaling linearly when increasing the sequence length. Furthermore, we propose stacking multiple LSA layers to model the relationship of multiscale &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$n$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -gram features. It captures the word-to-word relationship in the first layer and then captures the chunk-to-chunk (such as lexical &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$n$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -gram phrases) relationship in its deeper layers. We also test the effectiveness of the proposed model by applying the learned representation through the LSA model to a Siamese and a classification network in community question answer selection tasks. Experiments on the public datasets show that the proposed LSA achieves a good performance.},

In this article, we present a compartmental epidemiological model incorporating vaccinations with dose-dependent effectiveness. We study a possible sudden outbreak of SARS-CoV2 variants in India, bring out the associated predictions for various vaccination rates, and point out optimum control measures. Our model simulation numbers for the total infected are close to the seroprevalance data in August 2021, and our results show that second dose vaccine effectiveness is the most sensitive parameter in the future evolution of the disease. A combination of vaccination and social distancing is the key to tackling the current situation and for the coming few months. Our simulation shows that social distancing measures show better control over disease spread than higher vaccination rates, and disease spread does not appear to rise sharply in the near future unless a new variant emerges.},

A loss-aversion distributionally-robust optimization model is constructed if the return distribution of risky assets is unknown. Then, under the premise that the mean returns of risky assets belong to an ellipsoidal uncertainty set, a model under joint ambiguity in distribution and mean returns is constructed. This study solves both robust models and derives their analytical solutions, respectively. Moreover, the effect of ambiguity aversion and loss aversion on robust optimal portfolio returns is studied. The results show that ambiguity-neutral investors who do not know the return distribution obtain more robust optimal portfolio returns than ambiguity-averse investors who are unaware of both the distribution and mean return. The difference between them decreases with the increase of loss aversion coefficients and increases with ambiguity aversion coefficients. Both loss aversion and ambiguity aversion play important roles in investors’ behavioral portfolio selection.},

  abstract     = {The wide application of deep neural networks (DNNs) has significantly improved the performance of hashing models on multimodal retrieval issues. DNN-based deep models can automatically learn semantic features from raw data to make human-level decisions. However, the superior generalization leads to potential privacy leakage risks. Strong DNN-based retrieval models enable malicious crawlers to search for nontag private information based on semantic similarity matching. Hence, executing effective privacy protection mechanisms against those retrieval software is essential for reliable social website construction. In this article, we propose a retrieval task-based adversarial perturbation generation method called Hashing Fake to meet this request. Specifically, DNNs are recently found to be vulnerable to a specific set of attacks called adversarial perturbations, which denote some magnitude-restricted signals added on objective samples to misguide well-crafted DNN models, and perturbations’ magnitudes are small enough that will not induce humans’ perception. Moreover, since existing adversarial perturbation generation methods are designed for supervised tasks, Hashing Fake constructs a differential approximation substitution for perturbation production on unsupervised retrieval tasks. Through extensive experiments on several deep retrieval benchmarks, we demonstrate that well-crafted perturbations using Hashing Fake can effectively misguide objective models’ recognitions to make false predictions. The added norm-restricted perturbations on objective samples will not alter humans’ perception; hence, Hashing Fake can be applied on real-world social websites to protect subscribers’ privacy against malicious retrieval software.},

  abstract     = {Understanding social media users’ engagement is one of the most crucial steps in a successful deployment of an influencer marketing campaign. On mainstream social media platforms, opinion leaders are the major channels to spread opinions and media content to a large population of consumers. Therefore, analyzing how users respond to the blogs of opinion leaders lies at the core of understanding user engagement in social media. In this article, to study the factors that have great impacts on user engagement, we first collect a cross-platform opinion leaders’ blogs dataset, which includes 344643 blogs published by 93 opinion leaders who have accounts on both Weibo and WeChat, the two most popular social media platforms in China. Based on this dataset, we conduct both characteristics study and semantic study to investigate the impact factors of user engagement with respect to blogs of opinion leaders. To find out the associations between user engagement and practically accessible attributes of opinion leaders and their blogs, we adopt state-of-the-art (SOTA) sentiment analysis models to process the blog data, develop a normalization technique to alleviate the issue caused by the heterogeneity of fall-out intervals of blogs, and devise a saliency method to compute the integrated gradients of sentences in blogs. Utilizing these computational tools, we reveal that user engagement on the two platforms agrees on some common factors, such as the number of tokens of blogs. Meanwhile, the two platforms differ in some aspects. For example, the semantic patterns that can improve the level of user engagement on the two platforms are very different. Our analysis can provide advertisers with valuable insights on how to plan an influencer marketing campaign on the two platforms.},

  abstract     = {Crime risk prediction is crucial for city safety and residents’ life quality. However, without labeled data, it is challenging to predict crime risk in cities. Due to municipal regulations and maintenance costs, it is not trivial for many cities to collect high-quality labeled crime data. In particular, some cities have lots of labeled data while others may have few. It has been possible to develop a crime prediction model for a city without labeled crime data by learning knowledge from a city with abundant data. Nevertheless, the inconsistency of relevant context data between cities exacerbates the difficulty of this prediction task. To this end, this article proposes an effective unsupervised domain adaptation model (UDAC) for crime risk prediction across cities while addressing the contexts’ inconsistency issue. More specifically, we first identify several similar source city grids for each target city grid. Based on these source city grids, we then construct auxiliary contexts for the target city, to make contexts consistent between the two cities. A dense convolutional network with unsupervised domain adaptation is designed to learn high-level representations for accurate crime risk prediction and simultaneously learn domain-invariant features for domain adaptation. The effectiveness of our model is verified through extensive experiments using three real-world datasets.},

The challenge in detecting a compromised account by service providers is validating the trusted relationship established between the account owners, their friends, and the spammers. Another challenge is the increase in required human interaction with feature selection. Research available on supervised learning has limitations with feature selection and accounts that cannot be profiled, like application programming interface (API). Therefore, this article discusses the various behaviors of OSN users and the current approaches in detecting a compromised OSN account, emphasizing its limitations and challenges. We propose a deep learning approach that addresses and resolve the constraints faced by previous schemes. We detailed our proposed optimized nonsymmetric deep autoencoder (OPT_NSDAE) for unsupervised feature learning, which reduces the required human interaction levels in the selection and extraction of features. We evaluated our proposed classifier using three different social network datasets, Facebook, Google+, and Twitter, in addition to the NSL-KDD and KDDCUP’99 datasets, in a graphical-user-interface-enabled Weka application.

Large-scale outpatient systems (LSOSs) are usually faced with crowdedness and, hence, require critical departmental improvement to maintain patient satisfaction under a limited budget. Besides, when demand surges (DSs) or physicians are absent [supply loss (SL)], critical department identification becomes one of the key steps to resilient clinical management. To improve the clinical services and mitigate the risk of disruptions efficiently, we conduct critical department analysis under three scenarios: one clinical improvement scenario [supply enhancement (SE)] and two clinical disruption scenarios (DS and SL). These scenarios can happen in different departments in varying time sessions (e.g., am or pm). We define the criticality of a department as the change of patient satisfaction with respect to the change of departmental supply and demand. We accordingly propose a simulation-based ranking method and implement a case study in an LSOS. The simulation results show that the criticality of the department highly depends on the time session. Surprisingly, SE may reduce patient satisfaction when the supply increases in several specific departments. Key findings and managerial insights are further discussed.},

Mobile edge computing (EC) is migrating cloud computing platforms from the core network to the edge of mobile networks, giving vehicles local access to numerous computing resources. The classic greedy boundary stateless routing (GPSR) method is widely used to meet the communication requirements of vehicle self-organizing networks. In order to solve the problems of GPSR’s neighbor node position acquisition lag and single routing criterion, a new routing method based on the fuzzy logic system [Geographic Routing method based on Velocity, Angle, and Density (GRVAD)] is proposed. This method gets the relative velocity between the nodes and the angle between the current node, the neighbor node and the target node, and the node density of the neighbor node as the input of fuzzy logic, and the unscented Kalman filter is used to predict the location of the neighbor node to obtain more accurate location information of neighbor nodes. Simulation results show that the routing method compensates for some of the shortcomings of the GPSR method and reasonably considers the delivery rate and end-to-end delay of data packets and is more in line with the communication requirements of the vehicle ad hoc network.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the increasing development of social networks has brought about many privacy-related issues. Because users (participants) have different privacy sharing behaviors when multiple parties participate. The way of privacy sharing depends on the wishes of publishers, and users usually cannot control privacy sharing independently. To address this issue, this article proposes an autonomous privacy control and authentication sharing (APCAS) scheme based on quick response (QR) codes in social networks. Using the error correction of QR codes with high-quality images can prevent photographs that are uploaded to the social network from being subjected to lossy operations, which meets the participants’ needs of availability and privacy simultaneously. Combining the superiority of the polynomial-based secret image sharing and the visual secret image sharing can provide single-share certification for both dealer participation and dealer nonparticipation during certification. By comparing advanced image sharing algorithms, the proposed APCAS can restore the secret images one by one according to users’ wishes and can thus effectively mitigate the problem of autonomous privacy control in online sharing. Compared with related methods in recent years in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), authentication operation, and authentication complexity, the proposed APCAS algorithm provides lossless decryption, lower authentication computation complexity, and no pixel scalability.},

  abstract     = {Spectrogram is commonly used as the input feature of deep neural networks to learn the high(er)-level time–frequency pattern of speech signal for speech emotion recognition (SER). Generally, different emotions correspond to specific energy activations both within frequency bands and time frames on spectrogram, which indicates the frequency and time domains are both essential to represent the emotion for SER. However, recent spectrogram-based works mainly focus on modeling the long-term dependency in time domain, which makes these methods suffer from the following issues: 1) neglecting to model the emotion-related correlations within frequency domain during the time–frequency joint learning and 2) ignoring to capture the specific frequency bands associated with emotions. To cope with the issues, we propose an attentive time–frequency neural network (ATFNN) for SER, including a time–frequency neural network (TFNN) and time–frequency attention. Specifically, aiming at the first issue, we design a TFNN with a frequency-domain encoder (F-Encoder) based on the Transformer encoder and a time-domain encoder (T-Encoder) based on the bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). The F-Encoder and T-Encoder model the correlations within frequency bands and time frames, respectively, and they are embedded into a time–frequency joint learning strategy to obtain the time–frequency patterns of speech emotions. Moreover, to handle the second issue, we adopt the time–frequency attention with a frequency-attention network (F-Attention) and a time-attention network (T-Attention) to focus on the emotion-related long-range dependencies between frequency bands and across time frames, which can enhance the emotional discrimination of speech features. Extensive experimental results on three public emotional databases, i.e., IEMOCAP, ABC, and CASIA, show that our proposed ATFNN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Natural disasters are public emergencies characterized by suddenness, universality, and nonconventionality. Realizing the early warning, monitoring, and intervention of natural disasters and their derivative social impacts is significant for reducing the disasters’ damage and benefits the maintenance of social stability. Social sensors are ubiquitous sensors based on social network platforms. It uses the concepts and methods of physical space to mine social signals that integrate human perception and intelligence in cyberspace. Compared with traditional physical sensors, social sensors represent a crucial data acquisition channel in the emergency management of natural disasters and have the advantages of real time, comprehensive coverage, low cost, and flexible deployment. This article reviews the application of social sensors in natural disasters emergency management. We summarize the application functions of social sensors into three categories: natural disaster situation awareness and event detection, disaster information dissemination and communication, and disaster sentiment analysis and public opinion mining. Based on the above functions, this article analyzes the research status, data, technical methods, and application systems. Finally, this article proposes a research trend of applying social sensors in natural disaster emergency management according to the requirements of real scenarios.},

Traditional sign prediction research focuses on the prediction of positive signs and neglects the mining of potential implicit links, and there is little research on negative sign prediction. To address these problems, we propose a two-stage model that uses implicit link detection and link sign prediction. First, we use the preference attachment closeness degree (PACD) to predict possible implicit links by adding a measure of relationship closeness to the traditional link prediction algorithm (PA). Next, we propose a negative link sign prediction (Ne-LP) method to predict relation types through multidimensional negative sign-related features, including those of nodes, user similarity, and structural balance, and merge them by a logistic regression model. Finally, we evaluate PACD and Ne-LP through extensive experiments on three real-world social network datasets, whose results demonstrate that the method can effectively mine implicit relations and accurately predict negative links.},

  abstract     = {Clickbait is a sort of news that contains low-quality content but intriguing or overstated titles. Most of the existing studies usually utilize titles to detect clickbait and suffer from poor performance. However, from the perspective of user cognition, the essence of clickbait news is due to the fact that the body contents fall short of the titles’ expectations. So, in addition to the explicit features of titles, many extra informative signals could help to distinguish clickbait. In this article, we proposed a novel Multiview learning approach-based ClickBait Detection (MCBD) model that takes into account useful signals from both titles and body contents. From the view of titles, a multilayer gated convolutional network is employed to learn the local- and long-distance dependence relationships between words. From the view of body contents, we first extract the key topic sentences from the body content and then we developed a novel attention-fused deep relevance matching network (ARMN) to thoroughly mine the similarity between titles and body contents. Combined with the information from the views of titles and body contents, our model can distinguish well-hidden clickbait news. Finally, extensive experiments were conducted on two real-world datasets to demonstrate that the MCBD model outperforms the state-of-the-art models, improving the final performance by 3% in terms of the F1-score. The ablation studies demonstrate that the relevancy between titles and body contents can improve the model’s performance by 1.7% on the F1-score.},

There is a public channel used to collect data from humans and send it to the cloud, which is highly unreliable and vulnerable to attacks. Another risk is storing data in a single centralized system, which can be vulnerable to a single-point failure. Blockchain is being used for secure data storage in a decentralized manner to avoid single-point failure. We propose a secure IoMT-based data collection method for patients and storing the data on the blockchain in accordance with general data protection regulation (GDPR). In the proposed system, IoMT devices send data to the cloud via the patient’s personal digital assistant (PDA), and the cloud server transacts data on the blockchain. We propose a miner selection algorithm to avoid bias in the blockchain. We simulate various attacks on open channels between IoMT devices and the cloud servers. This scheme is implemented on a custom Python-based blockchain. IoT simulation is performed using the Bevywise IoT simulator and the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) simulator.

Throughout, we focus on a simple class of routing games where the system operator has uncertainty regarding the network characteristics (i.e., latency functions) and population characteristics (i.e., sensitivity to monetary taxes). Specifically, we address the question of what information can be most effectively exploited in the design of taxation mechanisms to improve system performance. Our main results characterize an optimal marginal-cost taxation mechanism and associated performance guarantee for varying levels of network and population information. The value of a piece of information cannot be known a priori, so we adopt a worst-case interpretation of the value a piece of information is guaranteed to provide. Several interesting observations emerge about the relative value of information, including the fact that the value of population information saturates unless we also acquire more network knowledge.},

  abstract     = {The current two-stage detectors remarkably benefit from hybrid representation of points and 3-D voxels, but they have high time cost and leave room for improving the accuracy of small objects. On the contrary, 2-D voxel-based methods tend to have good efficiency and better performance for small objects. An intuitive idea of optimizing a two-stage algorithm is to use a 2-D voxel-based backbone. However, naive representation substitution cannot achieve optimal joint learning of each representation and may cause a decrease in accuracy. In this article, we propose hybrid point–voxel RCNN (HPV-RCNN), a novel point cloud detection network which combines the merits of points and 2-D voxels. First, we propose a multiattentive voxel feature encoding module (MAVFE) to exploit multilevel attention of multiscale voxels. We also present a partial fusion pyramid network (PFPN) to effectively integrate multiresolution features and generate high-quality proposals. Then, a multiscale region of interest (RoI)-grid pooling (MSRGP) module is proposed to adaptively abstract proposal-specific features from sampled keypoints in multiple receptive fields. In addition, a cascade attentive module (CAM) is adopted to achieve incrementally proposal refinement by subsequent multiple subnetworks. Our method reaches top performance among two-stage methods in Cyclist and Pedestrian categories on the KITTI dataset while achieving real-time inference speed. Extensive experiments on challenging roadside DAIR-V2X-I dataset also demonstrate that our method achieves superior detection performance.},

  abstract     = {Enterprise competition analysis has long been treated as a crucial task of management science, which can reveal pertinent information about market saturation and business opportunities to support the decision-making process of entrepreneurs and investors. Recently, with the development of graph representation techniques, enterprises could be now formulated in a novel graph-oriented perspective to model their cooperation and competition in a directional graph. However, these prior arts mainly treat the enterprises as individual nodes, while the ecosystems, i.e., enterprise groups formed based on their common interests, and consequent interaction effects have been largely ignored. To address this issue, in this article, by adapting the concept of hypergraph to describe enterprise ecosystems, we propose a novel multiview enterprise relation network (MERN) framework for enterprise competition analysis. Specifically, we first put forward a hypertranslating embedding (HTransE) algorithm inspired by translation distance models for the hyperrelation embedding of ecosystems. Meanwhile, a relational graph convolutional network (RGCN) is designed for ordinary relation embedding, e.g., supplier, client, or competitor. Afterward, considering the commercial diversity in ecosystems, which means that different enterprises may focus on different industry fields, we propose an industry trend embedding module to describe industry distribution and development trend factors for each enterprise. Finally, we apply the self-attention mechanism to integrate these three modules and adapt the bilinear model DistMult for competition link analysis. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset validate that our solution can achieve better performance compared with several competitive baselines.},

Further, this article analyzes the optimal pricing decision of the platform and the initiator under different crowdfunding modes and its optimal mode. The results show that there are two Evolutionary Stable Strategies that are accepted by three players under certain parameters, and the equilibrium point remains stable under external interference. When the net income of initiators participating in value co-creation increases, it can promote the crowdfunding platform to actively participate in the value co-creation process, while it will inhibit the participation of the platform when the net loss of initiators participating in value co-creation increases. In addition, although supporters will also be affected by the willingness of the platform to participate in value co-creation, the willingness of initiators to participate has a greater impact on supporters. As for the mode selection, when the platform does not provide fee preference, considering that the prices of the initiators in the crowdfunding period are the same, single-stage crowdfunding is the dominant mode, and the income of the platform and the initiators is also higher than that under the two-stage crowdfunding. When the product price in the single-stage crowdfunding period is lower than that in the two-stage sales period, the two-stage crowdfunding is the best choice for the initiator.},

  abstract     = {Target-specific stance detection on social media, which aims at classifying a textual data instance such as a post or a comment into a stance class of a target issue, is an emerging opinion mining paradigm of importance. An example application would be to overcome vaccine hesitancy in combating the coronavirus pandemic. Existing stance detection strategies rely merely on the individual instances which cannot always capture the expressed stance of a given target. We address a new task called conversational stance detection (CSD) which is to infer the stance toward a given target (e.g., COVID-19 vaccination) when given a data instance and its corresponding conversation thread. To carry out the task, we first propose a benchmarking CSD dataset with annotations of stances and the structures of conversation threads among the instances, which is based on six major social media platforms in Hong Kong. To infer the desired stances from both data instances and conversation threads, we propose a model called Branch-bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) that incorporates contextual information in conversation threads. Extensive experiments on our CSD dataset show that our proposed model outperforms all the baseline models that do not make use of contextual information. Specifically, it improves the F1 score by 10.3% compared with the state-of-the-art method in the SemEval-2016 Task 6 competition. This shows the potential of incorporating rich contextual information on detecting target-specific stances on social media platforms and suggests a more practical way to construct future stance detection tasks.},

Current research mainly considers social information that can be directly observed, with little attention to indirect social relationships between users or the explainability of social recommendation results. To address this challenge, this article proposes a knowledge graph-based many-objective model for explainable social recommendation (KGMESR) by considering the explainability, accuracy, novelty, and content quality of social recommendation results. The model takes advantage of social behavior information to calculate user similarity and quantifies the explainability of social recommendation results using entity vectors and embedding vectors. To ensure model efficiency, a many-objective recommendation algorithm based on the partition deletion strategy is designed. It employs the association of individuals with the nearest reference vector to render the diversity of the population and then obtains the final solution by deleting poorly converged individuals in each partition. Experimental results show that many-objective optimization recommendation algorithm based on partition deletion strategy (MaOEA-PDS) allows for preferable recommendation results for users in real datasets. The explainability of the proposed model is demonstrated by two case studies.},

  abstract     = {The ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to its extensive research and application in various fields, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and medical image analysis. However, responsible AI faces severe security challenges, including the leakage of pretrained models and valuable training data. The existing solutions adopt new algorithm designs (such as federated learning) or cryptography (such as homomorphic encryption) to prevent possible security vulnerabilities. We observe that hardware-assisted trusted execution environments (TEEs) can further improve machine learning responsibility. Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX) is a popular, trusted execution hardware that enables users’ programs to run in an untrusted execution environment, such as a malicious operating system, but ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data. Therefore, we have designed GUARDIAN, a hardware-assisted secure machine learning training framework that protects data security during the training process. We have analyzed the typical characteristics of machine learning applications and characterized GUARDIAN through extensive experiments. Our findings demonstrate that introducing security guarantees causes performance degradation, which provides a feasible optimization direction in the near future.},

Toward this end, this article formulates a new problem by introducing fairness into cliques model to mine the absolute fair cliques from attributed social networks. Specifically, this article adopts formal concept analysis (FCA) methodology to represent the given attributed social network, and extracts a set of special attributed equiconcepts to further return the absolute fair maximal cliques. Then, we develop an efficient absolute fair cliques detection algorithm AFCMiner for the cases of single-dimensional attributed social networks, multivalued attributed social networks, as well as multidimensional attributed social networks. Extensive experiments are conducted for demonstrating that the proposed AFCMiner algorithm can significantly reduce the time for finding absolute fair cliques with the correctness guarantee.

Various guidelines, principles, and regulatory frameworks are designed to ensure that AI technologies adhere to ethical well-being. However, the implications of AI ethics principles and guidelines are still being debated. To further explore the significance of AI ethics principles and relevant challenges, we conducted a survey of 99 randomly selected representative AI practitioners and lawmakers (e.g., AI engineers and lawyers) from 20 countries across five continents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study that unveils the perceptions of two different types of population (AI practitioners and lawmakers) and the study findings confirm that transparency, accountability, and privacy are the most critical AI ethics principles. On the other hand, lack of ethical knowledge, no legal frameworks, and lacking monitoring bodies are found to be the most common AI ethics challenges. The impact analysis of the challenges across principles reveals that conflict in practice is a highly severe challenge. Moreover, the perceptions of practitioners and lawmakers are statistically correlated with significant differences for particular principles (e.g. fairness and freedom) and challenges (e.g. lacking monitoring bodies and machine distortion). Our findings stimulate further research, particularly empowering existing capability maturity models to support ethics-aware AI systems’ development and quality assessment.},

  abstract     = {The fairness consideration has received increasing attention in artificial intelligence (AI), especially in the significant application, recommender system. One kind of fairness issue is to balance the exposure of popular items and less popular items. Existing works mainly compensate the less popular items when predicting their ratings. However, the compensation for the items may result in a loss of recommendation accuracy, as the compensated items may not match user’s preference. For this problem, we propose a multi-community clustering recommendation with fair decision fusion (MultiFDF) framework to compensate less popular items locally, which can reduce the negative impact on user’s preferred popular item. We first design an experiment and deliver a causal graph-based mathematical proof to demonstrate the feasibility of local compensation. It proves that there is a discrete tendency of ratings predicted by a recommendation algorithm and a recommendation algorithm gives a higher rating to the popular item than the less popular item. The MultiFDF consists of three parts, community exploration module, local recommendation module, and fair decision fusion module. The community exploration module outputs several communities for local recommendation module to generate local recommendation lists, respectively. The fair decision fusion module then computes the discrete ratings of items based on local recommendation lists and designs an edge reranking strategy based on their discrete ratings to obtain the final fair top- &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$N$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; recommendation list.

This article proposes a novel feature-contrastive graph federated (FcgFed) learning approach to improve the robustness of the federated learning system in graph data. First, we design an architecture for FcgFed learning systems to analyze graph information. Furthermore, we present a graph federated learning method based on contrastive learning to alleviate the weight divergence in federated learning. The experiments in node classification and graph classification demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than model-contrastive federated learning (MOON) and federated average (FedAvg). We also test the adaptability of our method in image classification, and the results demonstrate that weight similarity evaluation works for other frameworks and tasks.},

  abstract     = {The development and applications of artificial intelligence (AI) have brought unprecedented opportunities to humans, but also brought many challenges and concerns such as unfairness, immorality, distrust, illegality, and discrimination. Responsible AI provides a new solution to effectively address these AI potential threats by integrating social/physical rules into AI systems. However, these rules are high-level regulations and ethical principles, which are difficult to be formalized. To this end, we attempt to use the data generated in various AI systems such as cyber–physical–social systems (CPSS) to discover and reflect these rules to provide more responsible services for humans. In this article, we first propose a data-driven responsible CPSS framework. Its core idea is to mine valuable rules through perception, fusion, processing, and analysis of CPSS data, and then use these rules to adaptively optimize CPSS. Based on this framework, three tensor-based couple hidden Markov models (T-CHMMs) are constructed to integrate three responsible features (i.e., timing, periodicity, and correlation) for mining potential and valuable rules. Then, the corresponding tensor-based Baum–Welch (TBW) algorithms are designed to solve their learning problems. Finally, the predictive accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed models and algorithms are verified on three open datasets. The experimental results show that proposed methods have the best performances for various scenarios, which reflects that our methods are more promising and responsible than existing methods.},

Existing efforts are inadequate to address this issue since the training sample size needs to be unified before model training in VFL. To this end, selfish clients should unconditionally and honestly declare their private information, such as model training costs and benefits. However, such an assumption is unrealistic.

Specifically, we design a transfer payment rule via internalizing externalities, which bundles the clients’ utilities with the social utility, making truthful reporting by clients be a Nash equilibrium. Theoretically, we prove that &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathbb {TEA}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; can achieve truthfulness and social utility maximization, as well as budget balance (BB) or individual rationality (IR).

Notably, consensus convergence speed is of key importance to manage the consensus formation in GDM with opinion dynamics. Recently, social network DeGroot (SNDG) model has been widely used in opinion dynamics. Based on this, this article dedicates to study how agents’ high self-confidence levels affect the consensus convergence speed in SNDG model. Interestingly, using theoretical analysis, we prove that: 1) the speed of consensus reaching is subject to the largest self-confidence level of opinion followers and 2) the speed of consensus reaching is also subject to the top two self-confidence levels of opinion leaders. Furthermore, through extensive simulation’, we find that the theoretical results are robust to the topological structure and the size of social networks.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we address the problem of modeling and orchestrating the interactions between a museum and its visitors, viewing the system as a cyber–physical–social system (CPSS). In particular, the museum operator provides monetary rewards to the visitors in exchange for their contributions, which are expressed as their total number of provided feedback evaluations of visited exhibits over their touring time. The interactions among the museum operator and visitors are captured in appropriately designed utility functions following the principles of labor economics, while the visitors’ behavioral characteristics are utilized to define their unique types. Under such a setting and formulation, the goal of the museum operator is to optimize their profit and benefits while jointly satisfying the visitors’ quality of experience prerequisites as reflected via their utility functions. The corresponding optimization problem is treated and solved under the general and realistic cases of incomplete information, wherein the museum operator estimates the visitors’ types probabilistically. The resulting outcome, referred to as the “optimal contract,” jointly determines the visitors’ optimal contributions, as well as the museum operator’s optimal amount of personalized rewards provided to each visitor. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through modeling and simulation, and detailed numerical results are presented to demonstrate the key benefits of the proposed optimization approach versus either type-agnostic or heuristic alternatives.},

  abstract     = {The cognitive inertia of sociology, similar to the inertia of physics, plays a significant role on the opinions formulation. In a general way, each individual possesses both a private and an expressed opinion in social networks. In this article, we propose a novel model with expressed and private opinions over issue sequences to capture cognitive inertia. The persistent disagreement and consensus for opinion dynamics over issue sequences are studied by the network structure and the social power evolutions. Moreover, we consider the opinion evolutions over issue sequences with bounded confidence. It is shown that the private opinions and the expressed opinions can also achieve consensus. By our proposed issue-sequence-based opinion dynamics model, the social phenomenon of cognitive freezing can be reproduced. The simulation analysis reveals that the convergence rates for the discrepancy of individuals are inversely proportional to the social powers of individuals, and the number of issue sequences for opinions achieving consensus is inversely proportional to the confidence thresholds and directly proportional to the number of individuals.},

  abstract     = {The multimodality nature of web data has necessitated complex multimodal information retrieval for a wide range of web applications. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely employed to extract semantic features from raw samples to improve retrieval accuracy. In addition, hashing is widely used to improve computational and storage efficiency. As such, deep hashing frameworks have been applied for multimodal retrieval tasks. However, there is still a great recognitive gap between primate brain structure-inspired DNNs and humans. On computer vision tasks, well-crafted DNN models can be easily defeated by invisible small attacks, and this phenomenon indicates a large recognition gap between DNN models and humans. Recently, adversarial defense methods have been shown to improve the human–machine recognition alignment in several classification tasks. However, the robustness problem on the retrieval tasks, especially on the deep hashing-based multimodal retrieval models, is still not well studied. Therefore, in this article, we present an adversarially robust training mechanism to improve model robustness for the purpose of human–machine recognition alignment on retrieval tasks. Through extensive experimental results on several social multimodal retrieval benchmarks, we show that the robust training hashing framework proposed can mitigate the recognition gap on retrieval tasks. Our study highlights the necessity of robustness enhancement on deep hashing models.},

  abstract     = {In online social networks, users’ awareness of a topic and their personal consciousness can significantly influence the dissemination of information on that topic. Traditional information dissemination research has mainly introduced user awareness as a single factor and has failed to fully consider the impact between users with different awareness. By considering the differences in user awareness and their impact, we proposed a multiple layer spatial information dissemination model based on user awareness. First, for the multidimensional nature of the communication space, we consider differences in users’ cognitive level into consideration, and by setting the corresponding threshold, the users who participate in topic dissemination are divided into two states of high awareness and low awareness. By constructing different communication networks, we depict the propagation dynamics of information at different levels of awareness and introduce an evolutionary game mechanism to analyze the influence between users at different levels of awareness networks. Second, during information dissemination, isolating transmission sources can provide effective control over the spread of information. Based on the susceptible-infectious-recovery (SIR) model in infectious disease dynamics, we consider that susceptible users have a certain chance of being isolated, so we abstract the isolated user group as an independent state Q (quarantine) and introduce it into the traditional SIR model to construct an SQIR information dissemination model. Finally, considering the influence between the information disseminated by high awareness users and low awareness users and the differences in users’ communication behavior at different periods, a dynamic information dissemination model based on user awareness and evolutionary game is obtained through a time-slicing process to dynamically explore the dynamics of information dissemination. The experiments showed that the proposed model could effectively reveal the influence of different levels of awareness on the dynamic information dissemination trend.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of the Internet of Things technology, the concept of smart cities that aims to help residents improve their quality of life has raised much attention in several application areas. In the context of smart cities, the provision of point of interest (POI) recommendations become an important requirement because a wide range of POIs are available for urban dwellers. Location-based social networks (LBSNs) such as Foursquare and Gowalla provide a massive volume of user check-in records that can assist users in choosing new POIs. However, user trajectories are mostly sparse in the real world. For example, users only check in a few POIs, and this makes it difficult to provide recommendations based on limited history trajectories. Though some attempts have adopted auxiliary geographical information to enhance POI recommendation, they still encounter the following problems: 1) the geographical trajectories of users are usually sparse in real-world datasets; 2) users may be more interested in the remote POIs; and 3) the previous models inherently perform transductive learning that cannot handle well the recommendation of unseen users and POIs. To address these problems, we propose an inductive representation learning model (IRLM) for location recommendation. IRLM contains two parts, namely geographic feature extraction and inductive representation learning. IRLM first captures global geographical influences among POIs through a standard Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Then IRLM adopts an attention neural network for the recommendation. Experimental results indicate that our proposed model can achieve superior performance over state-of-the-art models.},

We show that PLATO is highly accurate on two novel datasets, which cover Al Qaeda (AQ) and the Islamic State (ISIS). Using both machine learning and statistical methods, we show that the most significant macrofeatures for predicting AQ’s lethality are related to their public communications (PCs) and logistical subnetworks, while the leadership and operational subnetworks are most impactful for predicting ISISs lethality. Across both groups, the average degree and the diameters of the strongly connected components (SCCs) within these networks are strongly linked with lethality.},

  abstract     = {Depression is one of the most prevalent mental disorders, which seriously affects one’s life. Traditional depression diagnostics commonly depend on rating with scales, which can be labor-intensive and subjective. In this context, automatic depression detection (ADD), aiming to assist medical experts in their diagnosis and analysis, has been attracting more attention for its better objectivity and fewer laborious interventions. A typical ADD model detects depression via automatically extracting task-specific features from medical records, such as video sequences, and sending them into a classifier for assistive prediction. However, it remains challenging to effectively extract depression-specific information from long sequences, thereby hindering a satisfying accuracy. In this article, we propose a novel ADD method via learning and fusing features from visual cues. Specifically, we first construct temporal dilated convolutional network (TDCN), in which multiple dilated convolution blocks (DCBs) are designed and stacked, to learn the long-range temporal information from sequences. Then, the featurewise attention (FWA) module is adopted to fuse different features extracted from TDCNs. The module learns to assign weights for the feature channels, aiming to better incorporate different kinds of visual features and further enhance the detection accuracy. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus Wizard-of-Oz (DAIC_WOZ) dataset compared with other visual-feature-based methods, showing its effectiveness.},

Automatic depression detection (ADD) technology based on physiological and psychological information provides an objective and quantitative way for MDD detection. As a useful data modality, audio signals have attracted increasing interest in mental disorder detection. However, most recent audio-based depression detection methods underestimate the importance of subtly organizing audio data. They either simply use equally split audio segments, or directly build the model upon the entire data sequence, which pose challenges to learning task-specific features. To address this issue, we propose to reorganize the audio data at response level. Based on that, we construct a novel end-to-end model that hierarchically learns discriminative features for accurate depression detection. The stages of intraresponse fusion and interresponse fusion facilitate the extraction and aggregation of ADD-specific information from multiple kinds of acoustic features. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art audio-based methods. In addition, the flexibility and the robustness of our model are also validated.},

However, more rich and in-depth insights about using Instagram for commercial purposes within a certain context are yet to be discovered. Therefore, this study aims at discovering experiences and interactions with Insta shopping, the factors and the drivers that impact users’ acceptance of Insta shopping, the weight of each factor (degree of consensus among participants), and their direction (positive, negative, or both). The study followed a qualitative approach, by creating four homogeneous focus groups (six participants each) of IT students in United Arab Emirates (UAE) universities. The data analysis approach considered is an axial coding technique as part of the grounded theory, which includes open coding, axial coding, and selective coding stages. The results revealed that the time factor, trust in Insta shops (and its drivers such as reviews, word of mouth, trading license, and others), distrust (and its drivers such as fake comments and reviews, extremely low prices, and others), and the associated risks (financial for losing money, security because of online payments, and some privacy issues) can impact users’ behaviors toward Insta shopping. Also, the study classified participants’ viewpoints and experiences’ themes into advantages, disadvantages, and issues that are associated with Insta shopping.

To solve this problem, a hybrid social evolution mechanism based on Q-learning is proposed in this article. The evolution of social relations is realized from the perspective of individual, group, and global situations to improve the success rate and comprehensive effectiveness of task allocation in the system while reducing the communication cost during task execution. In addition, the hybrid evolution mechanism considers the balance of interests between the global and the individual, which can guarantee the rationality of task benefit distribution while improving the global effectiveness. The experiments show that compared with the single-form evolution method, the hybrid mechanism proposed in this article has more advantages in the success rate, communication cost, and comprehensive effectiveness of task allocation. Moreover, the rationality of benefit distribution is also improved, and a strong and harmonious social system is realized.},

Thus, the automatic authentication checking of the available contents is the need of the hour.

The identity of the suspect user is matched against tweets written by the specific user in tweet-user verification process.

  abstract     = {As one of the most popular blockchain systems, EOSIO has been widely used in decentralized applications (DApps). Compared with traditional proof-of-work (PoW)-based blockchain systems like Bitcoin, EOSIO achieves a high transaction throughput and an alleged decentralization with the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus protocol. However, recent reports claimed the existence of voting collusion and manipulation during the DPoS consensus procedure of EOSIO, which may greatly decline the decentralization degree, fault tolerance, and reliability of the whole system. In this article, we obtain data from up to 135 000 000 blocks of EOSIO and conduct a data-driven decentralization analysis. Specifically, we characterize the decentralization evolution of the two phases in DPoS, namely block producer election and block production. Moreover, we study the voters with similar voting behaviors and propose methods to discover abnormal mutual voting behaviors in EOSIO.

  abstract     = {Multiview learning aims to learn beneficial patterns from heterogeneous data sources and has captured growing attention in recent years. Most of the previous research studies focused on searching for an effective feature embedding of downstream tasks using diverse optimization algorithms, however, very limited work has been conducted to explore the connection between multiview learning and deep neural networks of structure sharing hidden layers. In this article, we propose a multiview deep matrix factorization model to learn a shared compact representation from multiview data. First, the proposed model constructs a multiview auto-encoder architecture with one shared encoder and multiple decoders, where each view corresponds to a factorization and the shared encoder leads to a common hidden layer. Accordingly, matrix factorizations from multiview data share the last hidden layer for a high-level semantic representation. Second, the nonnegativity constraint of the learned representation is transformed to the projection operation, which can be easily achieved by activating weights of the shared encoder network. Third, this network is trained with a joint loss of the reconstruction error and the compactness loss. By employing the clustering layer, the proposed method serves as an end-to-end multiview clustering method. Finally, comprehensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method against state-of-the-art multiview clustering methods.},

Repurposing CDR data for this task have many advantages, including the lower costs of data collection and the potential for contemporaneous analysis. We present a framework for the repurposing and analysis of CDR data. We identify the home location of a subscriber, with corresponding confidence measures, and determine if the subscriber is a definite migrant, likely migrant, likely nonmigrant, or definite nonmigrant. A predictive model then uses mobility and social network features, extracted from the CDR data, to predict the individual decision to migrate. We are the first to address the challenging task of predicting the migration decision at the individual level. We also provide insight into features that can have an impact on the decision to migrate. An in-depth evaluation using CDR data from two provinces in Sri Lanka provides a granular map of migrant inflow and outflow. The success of our prediction model and the insights gained from the evaluation prepare the way for the repurposing of CDR data for social good with a focus on migration.},

  abstract     = {Academic knowledge graph is an important application of knowledge graph in the vertical field of academia. At present, the construction of the academic knowledge graph is mainly completed by extracting published academic papers, authors, publications, and other information from related databases. However, academic information is not just information of published papers. Scholars’ academic activities include participation in academic conferences, visiting and making presentation, and so on. However, the above academic information is hidden in natural language texts and cannot be directly stored in academic knowledge graph. This article proposes an approach named construct-SCHOLAT knowledge graph to construct an academic event knowledge graph based on academic social network SCHOLAT. The construction framework mainly consists of two parts: data preprocessing and event extraction. In the data preprocessing, we propose a knowledge graph embedding method to represent scholars’ academic social feature. In the event extraction, we concatenate the preprocessed scholar vector with academic we-media blog text into the extraction model based on BiLSTM-CRF fused with attention mechanism. The extracted events are added to academic knowledge graph, and a public relationship exists between the event and the scholar. Compared to the previous methods, our framework has an excellent performance after experimental verification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use the scholar academic social information of the scholar who edited the text as the event extraction input information. In addition, we publish a Chinese event extraction dataset SCHOLAT academic event extraction. 1 The dataset includes academic we-media blog and the social behavior embedding vector of the scholar.

  abstract     = {It is undeniable that rumors abound on online social networks and rumors can cause many disastrous consequences. Effective controlling of rumors is of great significance in social networks. However, the existing research only selects boosting users who are more likely to adopt the truth or select blocking users to terminate the spread of rumors. The former tends to correct the rumor after the spread is over but with high controlling cost, while the latter blocks the rumor without considering the truth transmission. In this article, we focus on how to select boosting–blocking users to control rumors when the rumor and truth are spreading together. We propose a boosting-truth blocking-rumor cascade (BTBRC) model. Under this model, given the rumor seed set and truth seed set, the boosting rumor controlling (BRC) problem aims to find a boosting–blocking seed set with &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; users such that the number of users influenced by the truth can be maximized. In order to solve it, we design a multihop neighbor boosting (MHNB) algorithm, which can get effective results with a data-parameter-dependent approximation ratio. Based on the above model, we also propose a positive boosting-truth blocking-rumor cascade (PBTBRC) model and design a connected multihop neighbor boosting (CMHNB) algorithm to solve the connected positive boosting rumor controlling (CPBRC) problem that requires a seed set to be connected under this model. Finally, extensive theoretical analysis and experimental results show the superiority of our algorithms over other comparison methods.},

In the utterance-level encoder, adjacent utterance representations are automatically encoded as dialog structure information, and the self-attention mechanism is used to update the utterance representations. The context and masked response representation are then updated using the self-attention mechanism in the decoder. Finally, the correlation between context and reply is calculated and used in further decoding.

This article proposes a rumor and anti-rumor diffusion model based on multi-information multidimensional compound game considering the complex game antagonism in the process of spreading multiple messages. First, in view of the diversity and complexity of the characteristic space of communication individual, communication structure, and multitype rumor and anti-rumor news, the communication network is expressed in low-dimensional, real-value, and dense vectorization by combining the representation learning algorithm and centering on the content, structure, and attribute of information transmission. Second, considering the antagonistic and competitive relationship between multiple rumors and anti-rumors, and considering the compound iterative cascade of multi-information rumor, this article proposes a multi-information rumor and anti-rumor game model from a multidimensional perspective. Finally, the information expression of the topic space and the complex game relationship between multiple messages are considered comprehensively. At the same time, considering the graph convolutional network (GCN)’s ability of convolution processing non-Euclidean data such as social network, a dynamic, unified representation, multimessage complex game topic propagation model MMGameGCN is proposed based on graph convolutional neural network (MultiMessage-game GCN). The experiment shows that the model can more truly and effectively reflect the process of network rumor propagation in the multimessage transmission network, effectively analyze the user group behavior of rumor topic under multiple messages, and correctly perceive the spread situation of rumor and anti-rumor.},

  abstract     = {Recommendation systems play a vital role in identifying the hidden interactions between users and items in online social networks. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited significant performance gains by modeling the information propagation process in graph-structured data for a recommendation. However, existing GNN-based methods do not have broad applicability to heterogeneous graphs that integrate auxiliary data with diverse types. Moreover, graph structures are susceptible to noise and even unnoticed malicious perturbations, as perturbations from connected nodes can create cumulative effects on a target node in the graph. To enhance the robustness and generalization of GNN-based recommendations, we propose a new optimization model named Adversarial Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for RECommendation (AHGNNRec). First, AHGNNRec learns user and item embeddings by exploring the distinct contributions of various types of interactions between users and items using a hierarchical heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN). Second, to produce more robust embeddings for recommendations, we employ the adversarial training (AT) method to optimize the HGNN layers. AT is a min-max optimization training process where the generated adversarial fake nodes from normal nodes with intentional perturbations try to maximally deteriorate the recommendation performance. Following this, we learn about these adversarial user or item nodes by minimizing the impact of an additional regularization term for the recommendation. The experimental outcomes on two real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AHGNNRec.},

In this article, we define a simple yet an effective network generation mechanism that can learn model parameters efficiently and produces simulated networks having structural properties close to a given input real-world signed social network. In the proposed model, corresponding to each node, a characteristic function is defined that controls its dynamics and its link formation process. A family of exponential functions is suited well to include aging and local growth, including triangle formation of different types of balanced and unbalanced triangles, and produce a wide range of degree distributions. In the proposed model, two layers are modeled independently, and further superimposition of layers is applied to get the final simulated signed network. Apart from that, the experimental results manifest that our proposed model, signed network structural reconstruction model (SNSRM), is able to replicate the characteristic properties of the various real-world signed networks more closely compared to the state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract     = {Online dating is an increasingly thriving business which boosts billion-dollar revenues and attracts users in the tens of millions. Despite its popularity, internet dating is not exempt from the concerns about privacy and trust posed by the revelation of potentially sensitive data as well as the exposure to self-reported (and hence potentially distorted) information. The increasing popularity of online dating networks leads to an increase in security concerns and challenges, as well as harmful actions and attacks, such as creating fake accounts, phishing on these networks. To maintain the safety of legitimate online dating users, it is critical to recognize and isolate criminal people as soon as possible. However, researchers concerning malicious user detection in dating social networks are merely a few. To address some key challenges in this space, we propose a trust-aware detection framework to detect malicious users based on different kinds of data from a real dating site. In particular, we develop a user trust model to distinguish between malicious and legitimate users. Furthermore, we propose a novel data-balancing method to improve the recall rate of malicious user detection. Extensive experiments have been conducted over real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed approach yields a precision of up to 59.16% and a recall rate of up to 73%, which is significantly higher than other baseline algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Given the severe impact of low bone density (LBD) on public health, and to avoid the potential damage of X-rays-based bone density measurements, this study aimed to develop a scoring system for the mass screening for LBD in women aged 50 years or older, using the basic body check-up items as variables. Five variables, including age, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), blood glucose level, and total cholesterol level (TCL), were obtained from medical check-up records of 1525 women aged 50 years or older who had done body examination between 2011 and 2018, and were used to construct a scoring system for the screening for LBD. Multivariate logistic regression was applied to investigate the putative association of the five variables with LBD. A scoring system was derived from the regression model to discriminate persons at risk of LBD from low-risk persons. An artificial neural network (ANN) model was also applied to the same task. Precision, recall, &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$F1$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -score, and c-statistic were adopted as evaluation metrics. Age, BMI, SBP, glucose, and TCL were significantly associated with the risk of LBD. Precision, recall, c-statistic, and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$F1$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -score of the proposed scoring system were 0.66, 0.83, 0.73, and 0.74, respectively. ANNs achieved better performances in terms of all measurements. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using routine body check-up items to estimate LBD risk. Different from X-rays-based instruments, the scoring system derived from this study may serve as a postcheck-up mass screening tool to enable health practitioners to identify individuals at a risk of LBD efficiently and nonintrusively.},

Retrieving the trending topics, evaluating the trends and extracting the scope of topics could be beneficial to young researchers, which can be recommended for future scope. Publication of articles is a continuous process, and so is the evolution of topics as well as the scope. The dynamic behavior of topics can be handled by continuously updating the partitioning of incoming articles arriving in a streaming manner. This article proposes an online clustering approach utilizing the autoencoder, which is capable of handling the online stream of articles. The training is performed by considering the multiple views of articles and posing the topic modeling (TM) problem as a multiview (MV) clustering problem. In addition, we employ an evolutionary-based approach to the latent representation of data to automatically determine the number of clusters. To learn the nonlinear mapping appropriately and to generate clusters effectively, the model simultaneously optimizes the reconstruction loss and clustering loss in an MV framework. The developed method has experimented on ArXiv dataset to determine the trending topics, scope, and recommendation of topics. The superiority of the proposed method in generating clusters as well as in determining scope is shown by comparing the results with many existing and baseline methods.},

Unfortunately, online reviews sometimes can be intentionally misleading to manipulate the ecosystem. To date, existing methods to automatically detect “spam reviews” either focus on sophisticated feature engineering with traditional classification models or rely on tuning neural networks with aggregated features. In this article, we develop a novel graph-based model, namely, graph-aware deep fusion networks (GDFNs) that use information from relevant metadata (review text, features of users, and items) and relational data (network) to capture the semantic information from their complex heterogeneous interactions via graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Besides, GDFN also uses a novel fusion technique to synthesize low- and high-order interactions with propagated information across multiple review-related subgraphs. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets show that our proposed model is effective and outperforms several strong state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {Emotions and gestures are essential elements in improving social intelligence and predicting real human action. In recent years, recognition of human visual actions using deep neural networks (DNNs) has gained wide popularity in multimedia and computer vision. However, ambiguous action classes, such as “praying” and “pleading,” are still challenging to classify due to similar visual cues of action. We need to focus on attentive associated features of facial expressions and gestures, including the long-term context of a video for the correct classification of ambiguous actions. This article proposes an attention-aware DNN named human action attention network (HAANet) that can capture long-term temporal context to recognize actions in videos. The visual attention network extracts discriminative features of facial expressions and gestures in the spatial and temporal dimensions. We have further consolidated a class-specific attention pooling mechanism to capture transition in semantic traits over time. The efficacy of HAANet is demonstrated on five benchmark datasets. As per our knowledge, no publicly available dataset exists in the literature, which distinguishes ambiguous human actions by focusing on the visual cues of a human in action. This motivated us to create a new dataset, known as Visual Attention with Long-term Context (VALC), which contains 32 actions with about 101 videos per class and an average length of 30 s. HAANet outperforms UCF101, ActivityNet, and BreakFast-Actions datasets in terms of accuracy.},

Cooperation among different kinds of guidance modals can benefit the passenger evacuation process and reduce the operating and management costs as well as the risk of injury to people in subway stations. This article proposes a framework of multimodal cooperative guidance (MMCG) systems for commanding the crowd evacuation in case of emergency, where three types of guidance modes are considered. The bi-level MMCG optimization models are constructed to determine the optimal quantities and initial locations of multimodal guidance. The MMCG schemes are designed by minimizing cost functions taking into account the constraints of the number of guidance, valid coverage, and guiding expectation. An extended social force (SF) model is proposed to study crowd evacuation dynamics with multimodal guidance. The computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed cooperative guidance schemes at the subway platform scenario. Three unimodal guidance schemes and a contrasted scheme without guidance are also proposed as comparison schemes. The results show that the crowd evacuation efficiency and the utilization ratio of exits are improved by taking into account the cooperation among different guidance modals.},

Excessive graph mining promotes the research of attack methods on graph embedding. Most attack methods generate perturbations that maximize the deviation of the prediction confidence. They are difficult to accurately misclassify the instances into the target label, and the nonminimized perturbations are more easily detected by defense methods. To address these problems, we propose Graphfool, a novel targeted label adversarial attack on graph embedding. It can generate adversarial graphs to attack graph embedding methods via classification boundary and gradient information in the target graph embedding method. Graphfool first estimates the classification boundaries of different categories. Then, it calculates the minimum perturbation matrix to misclassify the attacked node according to the target classification boundary. Finally, the adjacency matrix is modified according to the maximum absolute value of the perturbation matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Graphfool achieves the state-of-the-art attack performance with minimum perturbations. Besides, the possible defense experiments further prove that the perturbations generated by Graphfool are more imperceptible.},

  abstract     = {The growth of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has turned into an unprecedented pandemic in the last century. It is crucial to identify superspreading nodes to prevent the pandemic’s progress. Most available superspreader identification techniques consider only a single or few network metrics related to the complex network’s topological structure. Furthermore, it is more challenging to determine influential spreaders from heterogeneous structures of networks. In a disease transmission network, the degree of heterogeneity is essential to locate the path of the infection spread. Therefore, it is required to have an extended degree of centrality to collect information from various neighborhood levels. This article presents an approach, namely, global structure influence (GSI), which considers network nodes’ local and global influence. This method can gather information from multiple levels of the neighborhood. Evaluation of our proposed method is done by considering different types of networks, i.e., social networks, highly heterogeneous human contact networks, and epidemiological networks, and also by using the benchmark susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model. The GSI technique provides real-spreading dynamics across various network structures and has outperformed the baseline techniques with an average Kendall’s &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\tau $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; improvement range from 0.017 to 0.278.

One way of controlling hate speech in texts is to transform the text into its non-hate version while preserving the rest of the contents. Without the use of parallel data, unsupervised back-translation-based text style transfer is a common method of tackling such problems. In this article, we propose a zero-shot style-transfer technique that does effective unsupervised hate to non-hate conversion without using any hate domain text for training. While decoding the outputs produced by the system, we define an additional step of introducing lexical constraints, for better preservation of contents. Detailed empirical evaluation shows that the zero-shot method outperforms classical unsupervised style-transfer methods while at the same time reducing the data required while training.},

This article considers a security surveillance system with two competing failure modes: degradation processes and multiple states. A state dependent inspection-maintenance strategy with imperfect preventive maintenance is designed and applied to this system to improve the performance. The performability and cost models for this system are developed based on these mechanisms. A modified Nelder–Mead downhill simplex method is proposed to determine the optimal inspection-maintenance strategy to minimize the expected long-run cost rate (ELCR) of the system.

The UIO system contains &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$n$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; parallel independent observers associated with different design criteria to minimize bias from pattern diversity of UIs.

The main contribution of this article is that we creatively design a WVS for decision-making on UIs by quantifying the model performance in terms of system reliability. Two unsolved aspects including the observer pick criterion for the UIO system and the entire system stabilization for the nonlinear WVS are briefly mentioned, which indicates the difficult parts for the future research to make the system more applicable.},

  abstract     = {Users share information on social media platforms by posting visual and textual contents. Due to the massive influx of user-generated content, hashtags are extensively used to manage, organize, and categorize the content. Despite the usability of hashtags, many social media users refrain from assigning hashtags to their posts owing to the uncertainty in choosing appropriate hashtags. Several methods have been proposed to recommend hashtags using content-based information. However, multimodality and personalization aspects of hashtag recommendation have rarely been addressed. In light of the above, we propose a multimoDal pErSonalIzed hashtaG recommeNdation (DESIGN) method that incorporates relevant information embedded in textual and visual modalities of social media posts and models user interests to recommend a plausible set of hashtags. We use word-level attention (WA) on the textual modality followed by a parallel co-attention (PCA) mechanism to model the interaction between textual and visual modalities. Unlike the existing works, we present a hybrid deep neural network that capitalizes hashtags from multilabel classification (MLC) and sequence generation (SG) to recommend candidate hashtags for social media posts. We perform our experiments on social media datasets containing textual, visual, and user information. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

However, most network embedding algorithms, in particular, graph neural networks (GNNs), are difficult to interpret and do not scale well to handle millions of nodes. In this article, we tackle the problem from a new perspective based on the equivalence of three constrained optimization problems: the network embedding problem, the trace maximization problem of the modularity matrix in a sampled graph, and the matrix factorization problem of the modularity matrix in a sampled graph. The optimal solutions to these three problems are the dominant eigenvectors of the modularity matrix. We propose two unsupervised learning algorithms that belong to a special class of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for solving these problems: 1) Clustering As Feature Embedding (CAFE) and 2) Sphere. Both algorithms are stable trace maximization algorithms and yield good approximations of dominant eigenvectors. Moreover, there are linear-time implementations for sparse graphs. Various experiments are conducted to evaluate our algorithms and show that our proposed algorithms outperform several baseline methods.},

The emotional state and sentiment of a person have a significant influence on the intended content. The current work is the first attempt in investigating the role of sentiment and emotion information for identifying cyberbullying in the Indian scenario. From Twitter, a benchmark Hind–English code-mixed corpus called BullySentEmo has been developed as there is no dataset available labeled with bully, sentiment, and emotion. Moreover, emoji information available with tweet texts can provide better understanding of user intention. The developed dataset consists of both modalities, tweet text, and emoji. In India, the majority of communication on different social media platforms is based on Hindi and English and language switching is a common practice in digital communication. An attention-based multimodal, adversarial multitasking framework is proposed for cyberbully detection (CBD) considering two auxiliary tasks: sentiment analysis (SA) and emotion recognition (ER). Experimental results indicate that compared to unimodal and single-task variants, the proposed framework improves the performance of the main task, i.e., CBD, by 3.59% and 2.56% in terms of accuracy and F1-Score, respectively. Furthermore, two different benchmark datasets (Twitter dataset and Aggression dataset) have been considered to show the robustness of our proposed model.},

However, most previous research neglects to introduce the motion characteristics of disabled pedestrians into the modeling of crowd evacuation. Therefore, we develop an extended model to simulate the evacuation process involving nondisabled, visual-disabled, acoustic-disabled, and physical-disabled pedestrians. Numerical simulations indicate that this model achieves a more realistic mixed crowd evacuation in the library scene and reproduces the escape movement of multitype disabled pedestrians. Moreover, several management strategies are provided to guide the evacuation of disabled pedestrians, and the appropriate strategy can be determined by comprehensively considering multiple factors such as efficiency, safety, and cost.},

  abstract     = {Influence maximization (IM) problem, which selects a subset of nodes from a social network to maximize the influence spread, appeals to numerous scholars. Since the IM problem is NP-hard, it is still an arduous task to achieve good results in terms of influence spread and running time at the same time. This article proposes a novel search space reduction strategy-based progressive evolutionary algorithm (SSR-PEA) for solving IM problems effectively and efficiently. In SSR-PEA, a novel search space reduction strategy (SSR) in the light of the power-law distribution of the social network is designed to reduce the computational overheads, which eliminates a great deal of less influential nodes in a sensible way. After that, we propose a progressive evolutionary framework based on SSR, where the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -element individual is optimized on the basis of the ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -1)-element individual to speed up the optimal solution search process. Experimental results on ten real-world networks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm SSR-PEA can achieve 98% of the influence spread achieved by cost-effective lazy forward (CELF) on average, and its running time is two or even three orders of magnitude shorter. Thus, SSR-PEA strikes a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.},

Rising entities has been explored in academics, sports, and blogs in the recent past, but business side is ignored. However, predicting rising business managers (RBMs) can result in significant business growth of any business. In order to maintain a competitive edge, machine learning techniques should be adopted to devise intelligent business strategies and perform predictions. In this article, RBMs are classified by exploring features of co-business managers (Co-BMs), rather than their own work history. Since ignoring their work history enables such prediction in a cold-start scenario, where work history is not available. After formulating features of Co-BM, the dataset is classified into two different evaluation setups. One is average revenue (AR) and the other one is average relative increase in revenue (ARIR)—class labels. All instances for both labels are randomly sorted into multisize (10, 20, and 30–100) datasets. Later on, these datasets are explored through machine learning classifiers using fivefold cross validation. In order to compare the prediction results with baseline and to measure the effectiveness of the proposed methods, the candidates’ business scores are used, which are calculated by the business definition and formulation. In terms of precision, recall, and f-measure, the feature, category, and model-based experimental results show that the generative models, particularly Bayesian networks, produce better results for an AR-based dataset. Also, overall results show the effective the proposed method.},

However, it is a challenging task due to the biased and noisy nature of the data. In this work, we propose a method to predict election results via Twitter. In particular, we first detect the stance of social media accounts using their retweets. Subsequently, we develop four different counting methods for our prediction task. In the simple user counting (SC) method, we count labeled users without taking any further steps to reduce bias. In the city-based weighted counting (CBWC) method, we apply a weighted counting based on the number of electorate in each city. The closest-city-based prediction (CCBP) method utilizes sociological similarity between cities to predict results for cities with limited sample sizes. The using former election results (UFERs) method compares predictions for each city against former election results to detect data bias and uses them accordingly. We evaluate our proposed methods with the data collected for the presidential election of Turkey held in 2018. In our extensive evaluation, we show that utilizing domain-specific information and location-based weighted counting is effective in reducing bias. CBWC, CCBP, and UFER methods outperform tweet-counting-based baseline methods. Furthermore, UFER and CCBP outperform almost all traditional polls, suggesting that social media platforms are alternative mediums for conducting election polls.},

  abstract     = {Most rumor detection methods extract the features of rumor through two aspects of text semantics and propagation structure to achieve automatic rumor classification, while most of the existing methods do not realize that false and irrelevant interactions in the propagation structure will reduce the accuracy of rumor detection. In addition, most of the existing rumor detection methods failed to effectively extract key clues from the comments of social network users. In response to these phenomena, this article proposes a social network rumor detection method combining a dual attention mechanism and graph convolutional network (GCN) (dual-attention GCN, DA-GCN). First, build an event propagation graph; then, the GCN is used to extract the propagation structure information of each event-related microblog (tweet), and the attention mechanism is combined to suppress the false and irrelevant interactive relationships. Therefore, the anti-interference propagation structure features are extracted from the propagation graph. Second, to fully utilize the clues in users’ comments, this article makes use of the attention mechanism to fuse source microblog (tweet) with the comment–retweet information and extract interactive semantic features from it. Finally, the above two features are fused to generate a new event representation. Experimental results show that the proposed DA-GCN has an accuracy of 94.4%, 90.5%, and 90.2% on the Weibo dataset, the Twitter15 dataset, and the Twitter16 dataset, respectively, and has achieved excellent performance in the early rumor detection task, which proves that the proposed method is reasonable and effective.},

In the second loop, the SPSS, in which the hybrid service system is parallel with the real service system, maintains the continuous innovations of the system. Following our framework, we can design prototypes, perform experiments, and run the hybrid service system.

Developing a commercial BCI system usually requires close collaborations among multiple organizations, e.g., hospitals, universities, and/or companies. Input data in BCIs, e.g., electroencephalogram (EEG), contain rich privacy information, and the developed machine learning model is usually proprietary. Data and model transmission among different parties may incur significant privacy threats, and hence, privacy protection in BCIs must be considered. Unfortunately, there does not exist any contemporary and comprehensive review on privacy-preserving BCIs.

  abstract     = {Human behavior plays a vital role in spreading contagious diseases, and understanding its influence on the outbreak could be the key to devising better mitigatory strategies. The varied individual behaviors give rise to different patterns in the evolution of the disease. Such trends in the disease outbreak that arise due to microscopic behaviors of heterogeneous agents in a populace are typical of agent-based models. Therefore, we propose an agent-based framework equipped with a population mixing algorithm, and stochastic disease transmission and evolutionary dynamics. The mixing algorithm incorporates different mobility trends in a synthetic populace to generate contact patterns among them. On the other hand, the disease model characterizes the health condition of agents using three crucial traits of the disease: 1) infection status; 2) severity; and 3) awareness, endowed with age-dependent probabilities for transmission, progress, and recovery of the disease. Together with different mobility patterns, we demonstrate the impact of mitigatory measures, such as social distancing, vaccination, testing, isolation, and containment zones, on the spread of disease. The proposed model is used to demonstrate trends in the COVID-19 outbreak rather than predict its course of evolution. The results indicate that enhanced mobility of agents facilitates contagion, and a combination of mitigation strategies needs to be adopted to combat the spread of the disease effectively.},

  abstract     = {Community detection is a fundamental problem in complex network analysis that aims to find closely related groups of nodes. Recently, network embedding techniques have been integrated into community detection in two manners to capture the intricate relationships between nodes. The two-staged manner generates node embedding vectors and obtains communities by running a clustering algorithm on them. The single-staged manner simultaneously obtains node embedding vectors and communities by optimizing a hybrid objective concerning with node–community relationships. The general-purpose network embedding algorithms used in the first manner do not emphasize retaining node–community relationships. The second manner ignores the influence of a node’s location in a community (at the center or boundary) and its attributes on community generation. In this article, we propose a biased-random-walk-based community detection (BRWCD) algorithm to tackle the issues. First, a topology-weighted degree is designed to enhance the random walk at the boundary of and inside a community to extract communities precisely. Second, we design an attribute-to-node influence index and an attribute-weighted degree to distinguish different attributes’ influence on node transition to obtain communities with high internal cohesion. Comprehensive experiments on the real-world and synthetic networks demonstrate that BRWCD achieves nearly 10% higher accuracy at most than the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In rating prediction research, how to capture user and item features from review text is a key to improving model prediction accuracy. The sparsity of review text and the accuracy of the description of items in the review text make it difficult to obtain accurate feature representations of users and items by modeling the text content alone. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the usefulness of the reviews at first because not all review texts are valuable. How to analyze the usefulness of a review is a key to modeling the review text. The way previous models use attention to inscribe semantic weights on the review text is not sufficient to indicate the degree of usefulness of a review, so we suggest adding property information to model reviews. Based on this, we propose an interaction recommendation model that is based on enhanced graph convolution and fuses review properties (PGIR), which incorporates property information into text modeling by different activations and matches useful property feature interaction pairs for review text in a self-supervised manner. This allows the model to obtain an accurate feature representation of the review text. In addition, we analyze the high-order connectivity among user–item pairs. Then, we design an enhanced graph convolution method to capture the collaborative signals between users and items and model the dynamic features of users and items on this basis. After extensive experiments conducted on five standard datasets based on Amazon, the results show that the PGIR model achieves a substantial improvement over existing state-of-the-art models in terms of rating prediction. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate the superiority of our proposed property activation method, which further improves the rating prediction performance of the PGIR model.},

  abstract     = {Self-supervised learning (SSL) recently has achieved outstanding success on recommendation. By setting up an auxiliary task (either predictive or contrastive), SSL can discover supervisory signals from the raw data without human annotation, which greatly mitigates the problem of sparse user–item interactions. However, most SSL-based recommendation models rely on general-purpose auxiliary tasks, e.g., maximizing correspondence between node representations learned from the original and perturbed interaction graphs, which are explicitly irrelevant to the recommendation task. Accordingly, the rich semantics reflected by social relationships and item categories, which lie in the recommendation data-based heterogeneous graphs, are not fully exploited. To explore recommendation-specific auxiliary tasks, we first quantitatively analyze the heterogeneous interaction data and find a strong positive correlation between the interactions and the number of user–item paths induced by meta-paths. Based on the finding, we design two auxiliary tasks that are tightly coupled with the target task (one is predictive and the other one is contrastive) toward connecting recommendation with the self-supervision signals hiding in the positive correlation. Finally, a model-agnostic dual-auxiliary learning (DUAL) framework, which unifies the SSL and recommendation tasks, is developed. The extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DUAL can significantly improve recommendation, reaching the state-of-the-art performance.},

In this article, we argue that users will dialectically trust the information based on their own opinions rather than the rule of first-come-first-listen.

Previous works usually depend on designing the traversal rules made by hand or using two separate components to obtain spatial and temporal information based on skeleton graph, respectively, which still have generalization difficulties and significant challenges in learning effective spatial–temporal information. This article proposes a local spatial–temporal synchronous network (LSTSN) for skeleton-based dynamic gestures recognition, which can simultaneously deal with spatial and temporal information in gestures. Specifically, to fully obtain the spatial–temporal information of the skeleton data, a coupled position embedding and a three-neighbor local spatial–temporal graph (LSTG) are constructed. An adaptive threshold method is designed to describe the joint connections of LSTG, and then, an attention mechanism is used to efficiently capture complex local spatial–temporal correlations. Meanwhile, multiple spatial–temporal attention modules of different periods are designed to effectively capture the LSTG’s heterogeneity. Besides, from the data aspect, a hand motion vector (HMV) is also introduced into the model to express subtle finger motions. Extensive experiment results on DHG-14/28 and SHREC’17 Track datasets demonstrate that the proposed LSTSN is competitive with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The metaverse and its underlying blockchain technology have attracted extensive attention in the past few years. How to mine, process, and analyze the tremendous data generated by the metaverse systems has posed a number of challenges. Aiming to address them, we mainly focus on modeling and understanding the blockchain transaction network from a structural identity perspective, which represents the entire network structure and reveals the relations among multiple entities. In this article, we analyze three metaverse-related systems: non-fungible token (NFT), Ethereum (ETH), and Bitcoin (BTC) from the structural-identity perspective. First, we conduct the complex network analysis of the metaverse network and obtain several new insights (i.e., power-law degree distribution, disconnection, disassortativity, preferential attachment, and non-rich-club effect). Secondly, based on such findings, we propose a novel representation learning method named structure-to-vector with random pace (SVRP) for learning both the latent representation and structural identity of the network. Thirdly, we conduct node classification and link prediction tasks with the integration of graph neural networks (GNNs). Empirical results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed SVRP outperforms other existing methods in multiple tasks. In particular, our SVRP achieves the highest node classification accuracy (Acc) (99.3%) and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$F1$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -score (96.7%) while only requiring original non-attributed graphs.},

Humans immersed in the metaverse are digital entities who communicate with others or objects, such that ubiquitous access controls (UACs) are indispensable sectors for multiple platforms. However, in the metaverse, UACs have opened a wide scope of bridges for individuals to shuttle the virtual world, which implies that numerous threats exist at the access layer due to a great pool of entries. In this paper, to solve security issues in the UAC setting of the metaverse, we propose a novel blockchain-based multisignature lock for UAC (BMSL-UAC) scheme. All data institutions reconstruct a consortium blockchain system. In addition, our proposed scheme ensures that only authorized users can access an institution’s data. Finally, we abstract the user’s data access behaviors into the transaction information of the consortium blockchain system to realize full life-cycle data management and traceability. To verify the performance of our scheme, a series of experiments are carried out on the Hyperledger, and evaluation results have demonstrated that the resource consumption, delay, and throughput of this scheme are all within a reasonable range.},

To better examine how the value of NFT projects is affected by human time and attention devoted to metaverse, we first study systems with structured rules, e.g., blockchain games, to measure the players’ time spent and to quantify the players’ rewards. In addition, we investigate systems without dominant rules, in which the value of the NFTs relies more on users’ subjective valuation of their community symbols. Two representative projects, Aavegotchi and Bored Ape Yacht Club, are examined as cases of the above two scenarios. We analyze the data of NFTs such as price, time devoted, and the number of likes and acquire some meaningful findings of how NFTs drive prices up. Building on the above researches, we consider NFT systems as partly attention economy fused with finance and propose a theory of physical products combined with NFT collections to help set the value anchor of early metaverse.

The first thing is user engagement. Metaverse relies heavily on massive online users to realize its social value. In other words, user engagement is the foundation of the metaverse ecosystem. Therefore, our research uses Nova Empire as a case study, aiming at understanding metaverse engagement via complexity analysis of social patterns and reward mechanisms. Specifically, the behavioral data of 46 954 players in September 2021 are used for analysis. Our observations show that social behavior is not the main factor for user engagement. Then, we perform a correlation analysis of trigger times for different gaming behaviors to verify the above observations. The results prove that the main factors affecting user engagement are game tasks and reward mechanisms in the early stage and social gaming behaviors environment with alliances in the middle and late stages. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future games and propose operation strategies on user engagement to improve the metaverse ecosystem and other online social space.},

  abstract     = {The term “metaverse” was first introduced in Neal Stephenson’s 1992 science fiction novel, Snow Crash. It is conceived as the successor to the contemporary Internet, wherein users, represented as avatars, can interact with others or with applications within a three-dimensional (3D) virtual space, which is ubiquitously accessible. Although the metaverse remains a digital construct, establishing a sophisticated virtual societal framework—including a stable economic system—is paramount as users acquire assets and foster communities therein [4] . The implications become profound and potentially unpredictable should any single entity gain dominance over this virtual societal infrastructure. Such anxieties have been vividly portrayed in recent cinematic offerings such as “Ready Player One” and “Free Guy.” In response, blockchain technology emerges as a promising countermeasure. Trailblazing metaverse platforms leveraging blockchain, such as Decentraland, CryptoVoxels, and Sandbox, utilize cryptocurrency and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) to define programmable assets or access privileges [11] . These tokens may facilitate a borderless and frictionless payment layer, ensuring the uniqueness, persistence, and tradability of users’ digital assets [9] . Furthermore, the rise of smart contract-driven decentralized applications (DApps) [10] —spanning decentralized finance (DeFi) to innovative social applications [5] — ushers in an era of transparent, self-regulating digital ecosystems. As a multimedia community predicated upon vast online participation, advancements in blockchain may pave the way for a fair, transparent, and sustainable metaverse [13] .},

  abstract     = {Depression is a severe medical condition that substantially impacts people’s daily lives. Recently, researchers have examined user-generated data from social media platforms to detect and diagnose this mental illness. As a result, in this paper we have focused on phrases used in personal remarks to solve recognizing grief on social media. This research aims to develop generalized attention networks (GATs) that employ masked self-attention layers to overcome the depression text categorization problem. The networks distribute weight to each node in a neighborhood based on neighbors’ properties/emotions without using expensive matrix operations like similarity or architectural knowledge. This study expands the emotional vocabulary through the use of hypernyms. As a result, our architecture outperforms the competition. Our experimental results show that the emotion lexicon combined with an attention network achieves receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-0.87 while staying interpretable and transparent. After obtaining qualitative agreement from the psychiatrist, the learned embedding is used to show the contribution of each symptom to the activated word. By utilizing unlabeled forum text, the approach increases the rate of detecting depression symptoms from online data.},

  abstract     = {In the pharmaceutical industry, problems like counterfeit drugs, including vaccines, and their supply chain management problems like transparency, immutability, and traceability exist. In the case of vaccines, it becomes more difficult to standardize and detect fake vaccines because the public has less awareness and knowledge about vaccines. Moreover, the increase in online pharmacies gives more opportunities for counterfeiting vaccines to enter the authentic supply chain management system. We present transparent, immutable and secure vaccine supply chain (TISVSchain), a framework based on blockchain to handle the issues of counterfeited vaccines and vaccine supply chain problems like transparency, immutability, and traceability. Our proposed framework can run both on the private and public blockchain. We have implemented the framework on public blockchain by using remix ide and the smart contracts designed by solidity language run on very low gas cost. We also carried out several experiments by changing the number of nodes and their block time to evaluate the performance of our framework in terms of transaction per second (TPS), gas cost, and propagation delay. Our proposed framework improves the security by using offline unique account addresses in blockchain-based frameworks and improves the overall efficiency of the framework by keeping the gas cost low, finding a way to decrease the number of lost blocks to keep low propagation delay, and keeping high TPS value. TISVSchain shows us promising results to improve vaccine supply chain management’s overall performance, security, and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In future smart cities supported by cyber-physical social intelligence, autonomous behavioral decision for vehicular agents is going to become a general demand. Despite much progress achieved in autonomous behavioral decision of vehicular agents, the existing works can just be used in scenarios of short-distance behavioral decision. Naturally, they are not well suitable for long-distance behavioral decision tasks, posing much challenge in realistic cyber-physical environment. To bridge the existing gaps, this article proposes an autonomous behavioral decision framework for vehicular agents using cyber-physical social intelligence. First, it is expected to establish a dynamic planning model with multiple objectives and constraints. This can be embedded into the control unit of a vehicular agent to endow it with proper social intelligence. On this basis, an iterative search algorithm is specifically designed for it to find the optimal solutions from the whole solution space. Finally, two typical situation cases are implemented with use of simulation modeling to display the working architecture of the proposed method. In addition, a universal optimization search algorithm is selected as the baseline to be compared with the proposed method. The comparison results reveal both planning utility and running efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The traditional dietary recommendation systems are basically nutrition or health-aware where the human feelings on food are ignored. Human affects vary when it comes to food cravings, and not all foods are appealing in all moods. It takes a lot of effort to learn people’s food preferences and make recommendations based on their affects and nutrition. A questionnaire-based and preference-aware meal recommendation system can be a solution. However, automated recognition of social affects on different foods and planning the menu considering nutritional demand and social affect has some significant benefits over the questionnaire-based and preference-aware meal recommendations. A patient with severe illness, a person in a coma, or patients with locked-in syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cannot express their meal preferences. Therefore, the proposed framework includes a social-affective computing module to recognize the affects of different meals where the person’s affect is detected using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. EEG allows to capture the brain signals and analyze them to anticipate affective state toward a food. In this study, we have used a 14-channel wireless Emotiv Epoc+ to measure affectivity for different food items. A hierarchical ensemble method is applied to predict affectivity upon multiple feature extraction methods and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is used to generate a food list based on the predicted affectivity. In addition to the meal recommendation, an automated menu planning approach is also proposed considering a person’s energy intake requirement, affectivity, and nutritional values of the different menus. The bin-packing algorithm is used for the personalized menu planning of breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. The experimental findings reveal that the suggested affective computing, meal recommendation, and menu planning algorithms perform well across a variety of assessment parameters.},

  abstract     = {Sign language is utilized by deaf-mute to communicate through hand movements, body postures, and facial emotions. The motions in sign language comprise a range of distinct hand and finger articulations that are occasionally synchronized with the head, face, and body. Automatic sign language recognition (SLR) is a highly challenging area and still remains in its infancy compared with speech recognition after almost three decades of research. Current wearable and vision-based systems for SLR are intrusive and suffer from the limitations of ambient lighting and privacy concerns. To the best of our knowledge, our work proposes the first contactless British sign language (BSL) recognition system using radar and deep learning (DL) algorithms. Our proposed system extracts the 2-D spatiotemporal features from the radar data and applies the state-of-the-art DL models to classify spatiotemporal features from BSL signs to different verbs and emotions, such as Help, Drink, Eat, Happy, Hate, and Sad. We collected and annotated a large-scale benchmark BSL dataset covering 15 different types of BSL signs. Our proposed system demonstrates highest classification performance with a multiclass accuracy of up to 90.07% at a distance of 141 cm from the subject using the VGGNet model.},

  abstract     = {Social media platforms have been widely used as a communication tool where most of the population expresses their feelings and shares life experiences. Along with general information about the public, these platforms hold an ample amount of content related to depressed users and thus can generate sensitive social signals indicating if a person is suffering from some serious issues, such as self-harm, suicidal thoughts, or intention for an unlawful act. Early depression detection using advanced natural language processing (NLP), deep machine learning, and transfer learning techniques can assist in designing an efficient system to detect major depressive systems at an early stage. The current depression detection models are not enough to capture sensitive social signals indicating the true mood, personality, and behavior of an individual. Thus, making the current systems unsatisfactory. To address this life-threatening human-health problem, we propose an efficient artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL)-based model for identifying depressed individuals on social media platforms. The model employs hybrid feature-based behavioral-biometric signals captured using Word2Vec, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) models to learn a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) models. The data are captured from multiple sources using advanced crawling strategies to have data variety in the corpus. Thus, making the proposed system effective across platforms. The Dataset produced by this study is the first of its kind with a variety of depressive signals from online social network (OSN) platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The experiments have shown that both DL models LSTM and CNN, and the hybrid (CNN + LSTM) models achieved promising results on all individual as well as combined datasets. Out of 24 experiments for Word2Vec LSTM and Word2Vec (CNN + LSTM) models, we achieved the accuracy of 99.02% and 99.01%, respectively, and recorded as best results outperforming all the existing approaches on performance measures such as recall, precision, accuracy, and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${F}1$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -score.

Traditional incineration causes a waste of resources and pollution to the environment. Disassembling and recycling end-of-life products are the recommended way to maximize the utilization of resources and reduce environmental pollution. Disassembly performance is affected by many factors, such as the disassembly posture of the human body, the fatigue of workers on a workstation, disassembly profit, and task precedence relationship. In this article, a mixed integer linear programming mathematical model for U-shaped layout disassembly line balancing problems is developed, in which the balance of workers’ fatigue indices is an optimization objective in addition to disassembly profits. An efficient solution to the problem that uses a collaborative resource allocation strategy of the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is proposed. The linear programming solver CPLEX is used to verify the accuracy of the model and compared with the proposed algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that the algorithm is significantly superior to the CPLEX solver in handling large-scale cases. The proposed algorithm is also compared with two well-known algorithms, which further verifies its superiority.},

To make reliable transactions into a SIoT scenario, in this article, we introduce a multi-agent SIoT architecture, which integrates a reputation system based on a clustering of the SOs. In our framework, when a SO looks for a resource and detects a reliable partner having that resource, then the two SOs can interact to make a transaction, and at the end of the transaction each of them provides a feedback about the partner to the local reputation system of the edge server, to update the SOs’ reputation scores. Moreover, each edge server sends these reputation scores to the cloud, which updates the associated reputation values of the SOs, deriving from experiences coming from all the edge domains. This architecture provides a given object, moving from an edge domain to another one, with the possibility to have an updated value of its reputation, represented by the value stored in the cloud. We have validated our approach by a campaign of simulations, whose results seem particularly promising.},

  abstract     = {With the applications of deep learning in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving systems gaining ground, it demands rigorous verification to guarantee the safety and reliability of corresponding systems. As the intelligent component in such systems, neural networks (NNs) must be robust in that their outputs are not affected by minor perturbation to inputs. Many research studies have shown that formal methods are effective ways to the robustness verification of NNs. However, most of the existing approaches are focused on NNs that contain monotonic activation functions, such as ReLU, Tanh, and Sigmoid. In this work, we propose an approach to verify the robustness of NNs with the nonmonotonic activation function called Swish. Such networks have been proved to have a better performance on image classification than other NNs. In our approach, we turn the robustness verification problem into a constraint-solving problem using the linear approximation technique. We first model the affine function of an NN into a linear constraint model. Then, for nonlinear activation functions, we leverage an efficient approximation strategy to linearly approximate them. Finally, we utilize the constraint solver gurobi to solve the model, which reveals that the model satisfies the robustness property. We develop a prototype tool and evaluate it with open-sourced NNs. Experimental results showed the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.},

The key idea of the proposed method is to embed system encoded media access control (MAC) address in patient’s ID card image via discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to generate the final mark. Afterward, embed the generated watermark into computed tomography (CT) scan images of the COVID-19 patient and general images through employing the RDWT and RSVD. Further, we use a hybrid of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and Firefly optimization techniques to determine the optimal scaling factor for embedding purposes. After that, the watermarked CT scan image is encrypted using an encryption technique based on a nonlinear-chaotic map, random permutation, and singular value decomposition (SVD). Extensive evaluations establish the benefit of our proposed algorithm over the traditional schemes. The optimal robustness is more effective than the five traditional schemes at lower computational efficiency.},

There are many factors causing patient congestion; understaffing is undoubtedly a critical one. However, as staffing accounts for about 75% of the cost of all emergency medicine groups, emergency department (ED) staffing must match the demand for services. In this article, we attempt to employ a systematic and formal approach to find out optimal staffing levels for EDs. For this purpose, a hierarchal modeling process of patient flow in typical EDs with stochastic timed Petri nets (STPNs) is developed. Special attention is paid to resource requirements, resource sharing, and service duration. The evaluation of average patient WT is discussed based on simulation. Two staffing options are considered, and the decision on the optimal staffing level with each option is addressed.

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved impressive success in traffic signal control systems (TSCS). However, since a key component of many DRL models is the complex deep neural networks (DNNs), it hinders humans or experts from understanding and explaining the learned policy. Recently, many works have focused on developing interpretable techniques to compress or distill complex DNNs into smaller, faster, or more understandable models. The decision trees (DTs) are viewed as the de facto technique for interpretable and transparent machine learning, and can provide an easy-understanding decision path from the root to the leaf node. In this work, we utilize modified DTs to extract models with simpler hierarchical structures from premium policy achieved by DRL methods. First, we use a DRL algorithm to learn a premium policy for traffic signal control. Then, we collect a dataset with the learned premium policy by interacting with the environment. Finally, we extract the DTs with the collected dataset of state-actions pairs. We evaluate our method on a Simulation of Urban Mobility simulator in a simulation way. Simulation results show that the extracted DTs can generate human-understandable decision processes and provide explicit knowledge from the DNNs reference of the DRL.},

  abstract     = {Overcrowding in emergency departments (EDs) is a common problem encountered by healthcare systems worldwide. Its essence is the imbalance between the need for emergency care and available resources, such as doctors, nurses, medical supplies, and treatment facilities and spaces. Such an imbalance increases with the volume of visiting patients. To solve the problem of ED overcrowding, service providers need to ensure rational allocation of resources in the emergency process to the greatest extent. This article uses stochastic timed Petri nets (STPNs) as a modeling and simulation tool to optimize the resource allocation in the emergency care workflow. On the basis of STPN simulation architecture, we propose a novel “observation-response” block (ORB) to adaptively supplement the corresponding resources according to the local crowding situation in the emergence workflow, so as to reduce the waiting time of patients in urgent need of treatment. In this article, models of patient arrival, triage, and examination process are constructed. Then, considering the waiting time of patients as the optimization objective, the statistical simulation based on STPN models is performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ORB block in the emergency workflow resource optimization process. The presented work provides a feasible way for the optimal ED resource allocation.},

  abstract     = {Facial landmark detection is a crucial step for the task of computer-aided facial palsy diagnosis, which enables to focus on the affected facial regions for learning asymmetry, shape, and texture features of facial palsy. However, it is still very challenging to accurately detect salient landmarks on facial palsy images due to the unavailability of sufficient training databases providing annotated facial landmark images of facial palsy. To this end, we present a database in this article named annotated facial landmarks for facial palsy (AFLFP). AFLFP is a diverse, and reliable database that contains facial images with 16-class facial expressions of asymmetric facial expressions from 88 subjects. Each facial image is independently and manually annotated with 68 facial landmarks. This database is the first public manually annotated facial landmark database for facial palsy so far. Furthermore, to establish the benchmark results for the proposed database, we propose a deep neural network (DNN) baseline with a two-stage cascaded fully convolutional network (FCN), which can detect facial landmarks in facial palsy from coarse to fine. The comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method performs better than the mainstream methods of machine- and deep-learning. And we have also compared the performance using normal- and palsy-faces, respectively, as the training data. The comparison results show that there are significant differences between them in terms of facial landmark detection, which further confirms the necessity to develop a facial landmark database specifically for facial palsy.},

Among them, deep learning models represented by fully convolutional networks (FCNs) have achieved excellent performance in medical image segmentation. However, limited by the complex structure of segmentation networks and the inherently redundant characteristics of convolutional operation, the scale of these models is extremely large. To further promote the application of machine intelligence in the field of medical image analysis, we propose an attention U-Net based on Bi-ConvLSTM (AUBC-Net) for accurate segmentation of medical images in this article. Different from classical U-Net, the proposed model deals with the potential association between decoding features and encoding features by bidirectional convolution LSTM. Furthermore, for the inherent redundancy characteristics of FCNs, we propose a lightweight feature generation strategy and optimize the calculation process of Bi-ConvLSTM based on tensor multilinear algebra, which can greatly reduce the number of network parameters. In addition, we have conducted the image segmentation experiments on two benchmark medical datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can not only achieve better performance than existing methods, but also effectively compress network parameters while ensuring performance, which greatly facilitates AI-driven smart medical applications.},

In this work, we address one of the most important problems in business, the relationship with the customers and more precisely the identification of loyal customers. We use behavioral analytics to model and process customer actions. We extract user behavior based on our unified crawling approach and collect data from three different social media namely Reddit, Twitter and YouTube. We are extracting for each user three different behaviors namely communication, sentiment and product mix and convert them into a 3-D time-series. We use shapelet clustering to determine the loyal users. To verify our approach, we develop a set of metrics based on trust, commitment and engagement and we show that our approach results in differentiating the loyal users successfully. Moreover, we validate our results presenting a word cloud visualization. We extend our methodology introducing a semantic data transformation algorithm where we use the topic extraction, reducing the time-series to a more relevant one. Our experiments show that based on the verification metrics, our transformation increases the accuracy of the clustering results.},

Typically, these adaptive systems either focus on assisting or engaging the player, or on providing a more human-like tutoring experience. For appropriate adaptation, these games make use of player analytics and player modeling to determine what help to provide, predict future player actions, or otherwise model a player’s mental or physical state. To assist researchers in the development of future adaptive SGs, this article reviews and categorizes both player modeling and game adaptation methods from publications over the past ten years. We offer comparisons of various methods to achieve both modeling and adaptation, as well as comprehensive categories for both aspects.

This work, which is an extended version of an earlier conference publication, investigates the reachability graphs of underlying Petri net process models for masking the neural network of decay replay mining to ultimately increase the quality of next event predictions. A more comprehensive set of experiments is performed to provide robust statistical evidence of the usefulness of the approach and relativizes earlier made claims and hypotheses. In addition, the decay replay mining approach is applied with the suggested reachability graph-based masking extension to a healthcare use case of sepsis patients facilitating decision-making for healthcare practitioners. The obtained results further underscore the validity of the masking of neural networks using knowledge contained in the reachability graph of a Petri net process model.},

The synthetic population is a set of artificial individual attributes for each resident that is synthesized according to census data. We have synthesized a set of the synthetic populations of Japan. We assign a workplace attribute to each worker to estimate daytime population distribution and develop activity-based models in agent-based or microsimulations. Although statistical information in a residential area or a working place is released by the government and some individual moving data are released by cellphone companies, it is hard to collect the information with home and workplace location of a worker with their family and working information. We employ origin–destination–industry (ODI) statistics to estimate workplaces for workers. Since some attributes in ODI statistics are not available for privacy reasons, we propose a workplace assignment method for all cities, towns, and villages using restricted ODI and OD statistics in Japan. We show how much difference there are between the number of workers using the complete ODI statistics and the number of workers by the proposed workplace assignment method. We show that 88.2% of workers in a city in Japan are assigned to correct cities as workplaces by our proposed method. We also show several maps of daytime population distributions by our proposed method. Synthetic populations with workplace attributes enable real-scale social simulations to design transport or business systems in times of peace or to estimate victims and plan recoveries in times of emergency, such as disasters or pandemics.},

  abstract     = {Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the issue of how to maintain economic development while containing the epidemic has become a significant concern for decision-makers. Though lockdown measures are verified to be very effective in containing the epidemic, its economic costs and other influences have not been fully explored. As a result, decision-makers in many countries are still hesitant to include the lockdown measure in an intervention strategy in response to COVID-19. To address this issue, we propose a universal computational experiment approach for policy evaluation and adjustment based on the Artificial societies, Computational experiments, Parallel execution (ACP) concept. First, we innovatively construct a model via observable CO2 emissions, which is able to estimate the economic costs affected by nonpharmaceutical interventions. Furthermore, based on the population movement data, a risk source model is proposed to estimate the local transmission risk for any prefectures outside the epicenter. Finally, we integrate the data models in a high-resolution agent-based artificial society and carry out large-scale computational experiments supported by the Tianhe supercomputer. Policy adjustments and evaluations are carried out in four cities: Wenzhou, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Wuhan. Our research findings show important implications for policy-making: 1) the local transmission of a city can be almost contained if lockdowns are adopted immediately when the risk index is larger than 1.645, 1.960, or 2.576 at the 90%, 95%, or 99% confidence interval, respectively; 2) if lockdowns are required, in-advance lockdown measures facilitate mitigation efficacy and reduce economic loss; and 3) lockdowns lasting for 7–14 days in a prefecture would be effective in controlling the spread of the epidemic. The duration of the measure should be prolonged with the increment of the initial transmission risk.},

The proposed IWEH facilitates coordination between multienergy and water sectors via close energy conversion and can enhance the operational efficiency of an integrated urban utility system. In particular, we incorporate social-aware peer-to-peer (P2P) resource trading in the optimization model, in which operators of an IWEH can trade energy and water with other interconnected IWEHs. To cope with renewable generation and load uncertainties and mitigate their negative impacts, a two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) is developed to capture the uncertainties, using a semidefinite programming reformulation. To demonstrate our model’s effectiveness and practical values, we design representative case studies that simulate four interconnected IWEH communities. The results show that DRO is more effective than robust optimization (RO) and stochastic optimization (SO) for avoiding excessive conservativeness and rendering practical utilities, without requiring enormous data samples. This work reveals a desirable methodological approach to optimize the water–energy–social nexus for increased economic and system-usage efficiency for the entire (integrated) urban utility system. Furthermore, the proposed model incorporates social participations by citizens to engage in urban utility management for increased operation efficiency of cities and urban areas.},

  abstract     = {Identification of influential nodes has emerged as one of the major challenges, especially after their use in the rapid propagation of information, epidemics, and so on in social media. Most of the previous works in this field deal with the homogeneous interactions that are not pertinent in the determination of the accurate context of the nodes due to their noisy and sparse nature. Hence, heterogeneous interactions need to be explored for the identification of influential nodes in the network. To consider heterogeneous interactions available within the network, a multilayer network (ML) has been designed in this work. Each layer of the network represents a particular type of interaction, e.g., upload, comment, retweet, reply, and mention. A heterogeneous degree ranking (HDR)-based influential nodes’ detection and ranking are proposed for the designed ML. Furthermore, multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, such as the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), fuzzy AHP, fuzzy TOPSIS, and the analytic network process (ANP), are explored for the proposed ML for identification and ranking of the influential nodes. The susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) model is used to evaluate the proposed work. In addition to this, statistical analysis is performed using the Pearson correlation, Kendall’s correlation, Spearman’s correlation, and the Friedman test on the ranks generated by different methods, which shows that the results generated by different proposed methods are consistent. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Currently, most existing link prediction algorithms simply study the interrelationships between node pairs without considering the interaction force and the higher order relationships between node pairs. In order to find a solution to this problem, the concept of the gravitational field is introduced in this article, and then, a novel algorithmic framework is proposed from the perspective of physics. The framework is applied to the classic link prediction algorithms to effectively enhance their prediction performance. First, the node contraction method is applied to measure the node importance, and a similarity-based link prediction algorithm is used to calculate the similarity values between node pairs. Second, the importance of nodes is introduced into the gravitational field model as the mass attribute, and the similarity values between node pairs are used as a distance metric between node pairs. Thereby, a gravitational field model of the complex network from the perspective of physics is established. Finally, the edges of the undirected complex network are assigned the weights, and a weighted local random walking-based link prediction algorithm is proposed. The link prediction method is adopted to evaluate the reasonableness and practical value of the gravitational field model. Experimental results show that most link prediction algorithms using the proposed algorithmic framework have got improvement with a minimum improvement of 2% and a maximum improvement of 33%; thus, the effectiveness and feasibility of the algorithm are verified.},

In this study, we propose a prediction method to identify missing links and link weight by using multiple motif features. The experimental results show that the highest improvement of performance in link prediction is 13.5%, and 86.8% in weight prediction. In addition, the correlation analysis on multiple motif features reveals topology correlation between different scientist collaboration modes.

To address this problem, a cognitive model that integrates the VGG-facial action coding system (FACS)-OCC model based on fer2013 expression features and the OCC-pleasure-arousal-dominance (PAD)-openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (OCEAN) fusion of the basic theory of emotional psychology, namely, a computational affection-based OCC-PAD-OCEAN federation cognitive modeling (OPO-FCM), is constructed. By constructing this model and performing formal proof algorithms, it is shown that the OPO-FCM can acquire expression features in video streams, complete the acquisition of expression features in videos by training a deep neural network, map expressions to the PAD emotion space through the established expression–basic emotions–emotion space mapping relationship, and finally complete the mapping of the average emotion over a period time. The information of personality space is obtained through it. Finally, the experimental simulation of the model is conducted, and the results show that the average accuracy of the valid tested personalities is 79.56%. This article takes the knowledge-driven approach of emotional psychology as a starting point and combines deep learning techniques to construct interpretable cognitive models, thus providing new ideas for future cross-innovation between computer technology and psychology theory.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and IoT technology have revolutionized the healthcare industry by providing effective remote healthcare. Furthermore, with the aging of the world’s population, remote health monitoring and recommendations are becoming imperative to provide cost-effective healthcare solutions for improving the quality of life of our senior citizens. The explosive growth of wearable sensors (IoT sensors) and health bands has facilitated the interconnection among patients and caregivers to enable assisted living by leveraging AI techniques. This work proposes an end-to-end connected smart home healthcare system (FEEL) for elderly people. Our proposed framework addresses the main challenges of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) system namely, the scarcity of labeled data and user’s diverse needs. The major contributions of the work are: 1) few-shot learning-enabled novel federated learning (FL) framework for health data and context information analysis and recommendation; 2) user and context-based knowledge graph (UKG) to represent and model health parameters and environmental impacts on recommendations; 3) deep learning architecture for activity monitoring and location estimation of the users; and 4) edge-fog-IoMT collaborative framework to collect, store, and share medical recommendations while protecting the privacy of the users. FEEL is specifically beneficial for elderly homes where several aged people stay together and require constant care. We aim to develop a novel AI module where along with the health parameters, the social context of the home can be augmented to provide an accurate and improved healthcare service. FEEL has been evaluated for three tasks, namely: 1) activity monitoring and location estimation; 2) fall detection; and 3) medical recommendations for unusual health conditions. A customized wearable device has been used to collect, store, and send health-related parameters. The experimental evaluation demonstrates promising accuracy (F1 score 0.86–0.94 range) for the tasks and outperforms the baselines by a significant margin ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\approx 10$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; %–16%).},

The researcher created a centralized social-media-based pharmacovigilance virtual podium to extract relevant medical services. And simultaneously built a virtual community of homogeneous e-patients for informational and emotional support. This article presents a new research-based review of the clinical recommendation system and possible medication repository and adverse drug reaction (ADR) research gaps.

Subsequently, this article presents a preprocessing and clinical feature extraction approach described for drug recommendation and ADR classification. This methodology analyzed preprocessed clinical tweets for language diversity and clinical characteristics. This system also does multilayer content and collaborative filtering for patient-to-disease and disease-to-drug similarity indexing. It reveals the scope and collaborative filtering’s strengths and weaknesses. The collaborative association for filtering comparable clinical entities improves ADR detection and medicine recommendation. DNN comes out with the best result for ADR detection and classification and naive Bayes and SVM gain the comparatively biased result. In contrast, SVM achieves the highest improvement after preprocessing and with the amalgamation of clinical vector space. However, with the amalgamation of clinical vector space, the performance of ADR classification increased by approximately 12% and gained 86% accurate classification with the SIDER dataset.},

Even worse, it may cause the collapse of medical services and the death of many patients. To prevent its serious impact on society, the target of rumor suppression for the healthcare system is to restrain the spread of rumors (negative opinions) and maximize the spread of antirumors (positive opinions). Therefore, in this article, for the first time, we propose comprehensive learning-based particle swarm optimization with opinion maximization (OM) to address the rumors suppression problem in the healthcare system. We define the rumor suppression problem in the healthcare system based on OM and devise two opinion propagation models. Then, we propose a directed acyclic graph-based objective function to evaluate the opinion propagation and solve this problem using comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization. Experimental results show that our proposed scheme achieves better results for positive opinion propagation in the scenario of rumor suppression in the healthcare system than the baseline algorithms.},

It faces challenges like a collection of a global activity dataset which comprises a myriad of activities. In this article, we propose a federated Siamese network-based data-independent group activity segregator—Skipper—which aims to identify anomalies in an activity-monitoring social IoMT system. The novelty of this work is that Skipper does not require any dataset before its deployment, which removes the need for any prior training of the model for activity monitoring. As a proof of concept, we select activities pertaining to school environments to identify low-performing students in a classroom, who would require teachers’ close attention to ensure balanced growth and proper health. Skipper monitors the students independently for their motion signatures through a wearable device that consists of an accelerometer. A federated Siamese network calculates indices that signify the degree of similarity among the students’ activities. Skipper identifies the students who do not perform the same activity. With real-world implementations, we observe that Skipper requires network rates of 10 Kb/s, making it suitable for low bandwidth networks while we achieve just 20% CPU and 10 MB memory utilization on constrained edge devices. Further, with an increasing number of students up to 100, the time delay for final results is limited to 80 s. Hence, Skipper is a fast, easy, and accurate solution for recognizing outliers in IoMT social systems.},

In this article, we present a news article retrieval model based on active learning (AL) in a semisupervised learning setting. This model has the advantages of limited communication requirements, strong scalability, increased data privacy, and a time-dependent retrieval model. We use lexicon expansion, content segmentation, and temporal events to generate a bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT) attention embedding query for the temporal understanding of sequential news articles. To generate pseudo-labels, we combine the partially trained model with the original tagged data. An attention network is used to update pseudo-labels of data samples when the label of a sample is correctly or incorrectly predicted. Finally, the modified classifiers are combined to make predictions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model has 81% performance, showing that co-training and semisupervised learning can improve the performance of temporal expansion and profiling algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation in embedded and communication technologies made the concept of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) a reality. Individuals’ physical and physiological status can be constantly monitored, and numerous data can be collected through wearable and mobile devices. However, the silo of individual data brings limitations to existing machine learning approaches to correctly identify a user’s health status. Distributed machine learning paradigms, such as federated learning, offer a potential solution for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing without sending raw personal data. However, federated learning is vulnerable to harmful participants that can degrade the overall model quality by sharing low-quality data. Therefore, it is critical to select suitable participants to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of federated learning. In this article, a unique clustering-based approach is proposed to use social context data for participant selection. Different edge participant groups will be established, and group-specific federated learning will be performed. The models of various edge groups will be further aggregated to strengthen the robustness of the global model. The experimental results demonstrated that through participant selection, clustering-based hierarchical federated learning can achieve better results with less participants in two different IoMT applications for ECG and human motion monitoring. This shows the efficacy of the proposed method in improving federated learning performance and efficiency in various IoMT applications.},

Among the services that benefit from the usage of such devices is predictive analysis, which can improve early diagnosis in e-health. However, due to the limitations of wearable IoT devices, challenges in data privacy, service integrity, and network structure adaptability arose. To address these concerns, we propose a platform using federated learning and private blockchain technology within a fog-IoT network. These technologies have privacy-preserving features securing data within the network. We utilized the fog-IoT network’s distributive structure to create an adaptive network for wearable IoT devices. We designed a testbed to examine the proposed platform’s ability to preserve the integrity of a classifier. According to experimental results, the introduced implementation can effectively preserve a patient’s privacy and a predictive service’s integrity. We further investigated the contributions of other technologies to the security and adaptability of the IoT network. Overall, we proved the feasibility of our platform in addressing significant security and privacy challenges of wearable IoT devices in predictive healthcare through analysis, simulation, and experimentation.},

  abstract     = {Traditional classification algorithms struggle to categorize hypertensive retinopathy (HR) lesions correctly because they lack obvious characteristics. A regional IoT-enabled federated learning-based HR categorization approach (IoT-FHR) incorporating global and local attributes is suggested as a solution to this issue. The local feature arterial and venous nicking (AVN) classification model is fused with the overall IoT-FHR classification model to enhance the effect of the classification of IoT-FHR. The AVN classification model’s local lesion characteristics and the IoT-FHR classification model’s global lesion characteristics were combined using feature mean. After that, the results of the global IoT-FHR classification model are averaged with the results of the local AVN classification model. An easy neural network receives its input from the final outcome. The probability value of IoT-FHR in the fundus image is output by the sigmoid classifier after the neural network’s two fully connected and one dropout layer. The AVN classification makes a new kind of intersection detection algorithm suggestion. To determine the intersection points, the algorithm applies a logical AND operation to the classified arteries and veins. It takes HR fundus pictures and extracts AVN image blocks using the region of interest extraction approach. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the suggested fusion model are 93.50%, 69.83%, and 98.33%, respectively, when tested on a private dataset. It is clear from the experiments and results that the suggested model leads the currently used methods when the single-stage classification model is compared with them.},

Since the existing centralized signature schemes cannot address the challenges to security and efficiency in IoT identification, this article proposes IdenMultiSig, a decentralized multi-signature protocol that combines identity-based signature (IBS) with Schnorr scheme under discrete logarithms on elliptic curves. First, to solve the problem of offline or faulty devices under unstable networks, we introduce a novel improvement of the existing Schnorr scheme by introducing a threshold Merkle tree for the verification with only &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; valid signatures among &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$n$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; participants ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; – &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$n$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; tree), while hiding the real identity to protect the data security and privacy of IoT nodes. Furthermore, to prevent dishonest or malicious behavior of the private key generator (PKG), a consortium blockchain is innovatively applied to replace the traditional PKG as a decentralized and trusted private key issuer. Finally, the proposed scheme is proven to be unforgeable against forgery signature attacks in the random oracle model (ROM) under the elliptic curve discrete logarithm (ECDL) assumption. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our scheme matches or outperforms existing research studies in privacy protection, offline device support, decentralized PKG, and provable security.},

IoMT devices can detect patient signs and provide treatment guidance and even instant diagnoses through technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and wireless communication. However, conventional centralized machine learning approaches are often difficult to apply within IoMT devices because of the difficulty of large-scale collection of patient data and the potential risk of privacy breaches. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-based two-stage federated learning approach that allows IoMT devices to train a global model collaboratively without gathering the data to a central server. Specifically, to address the problem of poor training performance on non-independent identically distributed (non-IID) data, we design a blockchain-based data-sharing scheme that can significantly improve the model’s accuracy without threatening user privacy. We also design a client selection mechanism to further improve the system’s efficiency. Finally, we validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our system through simulation experiments on three popular datasets (i.e., MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10).},

  abstract     = {Sentiment analysis is an important task in social computing and behavior analysis, and is a typical indicator of social health. It is a challenging mission to predict the sentiment of people in socially implemented Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) systems. The existing methods have several defects, and a typical defect is that most methods ignore the fact that there is much noise in IoMT systems and it is far not enough only to develop classification models for one type of data. In socially implemented IoMT systems, many methods treat the review text as plain text but ignore the potential knowledge structure. To solve those problems, in this article, we propose a novel solution, which is composed of adversarial learning and a hierarchical attention mechanism. We construct a hierarchical attention mechanism to learn the knowledge structure of a text. We propose to apply the attention mechanism both at the word level and sentence level, enabling us to learn the knowledge from each word and each sentence. We propose to use adversarial learning to learn new knowledge as non-random perturbations, which promotes the model’s robustness. We evaluate our method on several large-scale real-world datasets, covering a wide range of cases of sentiment analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Modern healthcare systems operate in highly dynamic environments requiring adaptable access control mechanisms. Access to sensitive data and medical equipment should be granted or denied according to the current health situation of the patient. To handle the need for adaptable access control of healthcare scenarios, we propose a novel model that allows dynamic access control decisions based on the context characterizing the source, type of access request, patient, and estimated risk corresponding to the conditions of the patient. Estimating patient status risk requires analyzing vital physiological data whose availability is growing, thanks to the widespread diffusion of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices. Inferring the patient health status risk through machine learning (ML) techniques is possible, but to achieve better accuracy, the training phase requires the aggregation of vast amounts of data from different sources. This aggregation could be difficult or even impossible due to organization regulations and privacy laws. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel federated learning risk-based authorization middleware for healthcare (FRAMH) that supports risk-based access control to deal with changing and unforeseen medical situations. Our solution infers the risk of health status through a federated learning (FL) approach enriched with blockchain to avoid the weaknesses of centralized servers. The implemented prototype and a large set of experimental results demonstrate the advantages of FL in estimating the risk in healthcare scenarios. Through this approach, even a medical institution with a limited dataset can achieve a satisfying risk estimation and efficient access control enforcement.},

This poses a great threat to personal privacy due to exposure to the outside world. To address this challenge, this work uses a federated learning mechanism and proposes a privacy-preserving social computing framework for health management. User data are deposited in different user terminals to prevent exposure. A group of parameters are pretrained for each terminal in an iteration and are then transferred to the center cloud for updating.

  abstract     = {Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is on the increase nowadays due to the high sugar level in the blood, and it is the reason for blindness that mainly occurs in middle-aged people. Furthermore, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) enabled computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems record DR-related data online and give patients with reassuring information. The internet allows for the interconnection of a variety of smart devices, enabling remote healthcare systems based on the IoMT to link patients with medical professionals. The proper diagnosis of diabetic patients and detection of DR severity in earlier stages help in preventing blindness. Therefore, the basic aim of this study is to prevent the diabetic patient from losing vision by detecting and classifying the severity of DR fundus images using the IoMT-enabled CAD system. This article designed a novel diabetic retinopathy classification (DRC) system by hybridizing the DL model with optimization algorithms to classify the DR images based on severity. This system begins with preprocessing phase for removing the noise from edges. Next, the proposed K-mean cluster-based growing region segmentation is employed to extract the useful region from the images. Then, pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model, i.e., RESnet with the proposed hybrid genetic and ant colony optimization (HGACO) algorithm, is applied to extract the features from the region of interest (ROI) and classify them into four severity levels. Performance indices such as AUC, &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$F$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -measure, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are analyzed to evaluate the performance on MESSIDOR dataset. The performance of the proposed DRC system is compared with state-of-the-art classification systems. The proposed HGACO algorithm is also compared with Adam and gradient descent (GD) optimizers. The system is also evaluated by employing different parameters of CNN and HGACO. Additionally, for the determination of the classification accuracy of the DRC system, the confidence interval statistical test is implemented considering various parameters and configurations of the neural network. The results revealed that the proposed DR system provides higher classification results by achieving 95.78%, 91.98%, 97.7%, and 94.56% AUC, sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity rate, respectively. CNN alleviates the difficulty of developing image features, whereas the HGACO algorithm-based technique automates CNN hyperparameter design.},

Medical emergencies can have a severe emotional and financial impact. Thus, a health insurance policy can help mitigate financial risks in unpredictable circumstances. However, the current insurance system is very expensive, as thousands of people pay the premiums, and very few take the claims. Furthermore, the claim settlement process is excruciatingly long and tiresome. In this article, we focus on establishing a rapid and cost-effective framework for the health insurance market, based on machine learning and blockchain technology. By developing a smart contract, blockchain may eliminate any third-party organizations and make the complete process safer, easier, and more efficient. The contract pays the claim based on the claimant’s documentation. We optimized the premiums using a regression model based on the net amount claimed during the current policy tenure and various other criteria. For anticipating risk, a random forest classifier is used, which aids in the risk-rated premium rebate computation for policyholders for their next term of insurance.},

Also, they can be used in the prediagnosis of various diseases and in detecting abnormalities of organ functionality. In this article, we design and implement a multifunction and portable health monitoring system, which can help in daily medical inspections. The developed system monitors various medical aspects: heart rate (HR), blood oxygen saturation level (SpO2), body temperature, photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, electrocardiography (ECG) signal, room temperature, and room humidity. The obtained measurements are displayed on the built-in display or transmitted over Wi-Fi to either a mobile application, in the local mode, or to the cloud storage for remote monitoring. The developed system can be used to keep an eye on the people we need to care about, while keeping them in their normal daily life. The maximum error percentage of the proposed system is reported as 2.67%, 2.04%, and 1.58% for HR, SpO2, and body temperature, respectively, compared to commercial devices. In addition, statistical tests were performed and they showed a high level of agreement between the observed and the reference measurements.

  abstract     = {Patient activities’ monitoring is a promising application of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), revolutionizing clinical diagnosis. An IoMT uses sensory data collected from smart devices to train a model on the server. The trained model recognizes the patient activities on smart devices. However, training the model on the server has raised privacy concerns and security threats. The sensitive medical data transferred from the smart devices to the Cloud poses different cybersecurity challenges, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS), phishing, network penetration, and side-channel. This article proposes a secure patient monitoring system using federated learning (FL). The system performs training on local devices and sends only weight matrices to the server for aggregation; thus, it preserves data privacy and security compromises. The system intelligently divides the participants into clusters based on the available resources, trains suitable models on each cluster, and enhances the performance via knowledge distillation (KD). The model of high-performing clusters distills knowledge to the model of small-size clusters to improve their performance. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed system successfully work in the presence of unequal resources.},

  abstract     = {As a cause of interfering with routine activities, freezing of gait (FOG) is a severe syndrome of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and usually performs as an abrupt and momentary inability to effective stepping forward. Advanced wearable acceleration sensors based on socially implemented Internet of medical things (IoMT) devices can remotely provide a platform for recognizing FOG. However, due to the diverse data acquisition modes that appear in classic IoMT devices, the obtained data may contain imprecise, hesitant, and incomplete ones. Meanwhile, the bounded rationality owned by neurologists usually has a big impact on using wearable acceleration sensors to predict illnesses. Therefore, the objective of this article lies in exploring a fuzzy intelligence learning approach based on bounded rationality in IoMT systems and providing a valid scheme for biomedical data analysis. Specifically, a brand-new three-way group decision-making approach by means of TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for interactive multicriteria decision-making) with incomplete dual hesitant fuzzy (DHF) information and its applications in detecting FOG in PD using IoMT devices are systematically explored. First, taking advantage of DHF sets (DHFSs) when depicting realistic group decision information, the concept of multigranulation (MG) incomplete DHF information systems is built. Second, adjustable MG DHF probabilistic rough sets (PRSs) are further put forward via DHF similarity relations. Third, a three-way group decision-making approach is constructed by virtue of adjustable MG DHF PRSs and TODIM. Finally, the validity, effectiveness, and practicality of the constructed three-way group decision-making approach are investigated by a University of California, Irvine (UCI) dataset with several experimental analyses in the background of FOG detection in PD using IoMT devices. The experimental result indicates that the developed fuzzy intelligence learning approach achieves reasonable diagnostic conclusions for FOG detection in PD from the perspective of uncertain information processing abilities, decision risks, and bounded rationality.},

To detect and classify malware attacks, automated malware detection and classification is an essential subsystem in healthcare cyber-physical systems. This work proposes an attention-based multidimensional deep learning (DL) approach for a cross-architecture IoMT malware detection and classification system based on byte sequences extracted from Executable and Linkable Format (ELF; formerly named Extensible Linking Format) files. The DL approach automates the feature design and extraction process from unstructured byte sequences. In addition, the proposed approach facilitates the detection of the central processing unit (CPU) architecture of the ELF file. A detailed experimental analysis and its evaluation are shown on the IoMT cross-architecture benchmark dataset. In all the experiments, the proposed method showed better performance compared with those obtained from several existing methods with an accuracy of 95% for IoMT malware detection, 94% for IoMT malware classification, and 95% for CPU architectures classification. The proposed method also suggests a similar performance with an accuracy of 94% on the Microsoft malware dataset. Experimental results on two malware datasets indicate that the proposed method is robust and generalizable in cross-architecture IoMT malware detection, classification, and CPU architectures classification in healthcare cyber-physical systems.},

  abstract     = {In social IoMT systems, resource-constrained devices face the challenges of limited computation, bandwidth, and privacy in the deployment of deep learning models. Federated learning (FL) is one of the solutions to user privacy and provides distributed training among several local devices. In addition, it reduces the computation and bandwidth of transferring videos to the central server in camera-based IoMT devices. In this work, we design an edge-based federated framework for such devices. In contrast to traditional methods that drop the resource-constrained stragglers in a federated round, our system provides a methodology to incorporate them. We propose a new phase in the FL algorithm, known as split learning. The stragglers train collaboratively with the nearest edge node using split learning. We test the implementation using heterogeneous computing devices that extract vital signs from videos. The results show a reduction of 3.6 h in the training time of videos using the split learning phase with respect to the traditional approach. We also evaluate the performance of the devices and system with key parameters, CPU utilization, memory consumption, and data rate. Furthermore, we achieve 87.29% and 60.26% test accuracy at the nonstragglers and stragglers, respectively, with a global accuracy of 90.32% at the server. Therefore, FedCare provides a straggler-resistant federated method for a heterogeneous system for social IoMT devices.},

These data, available in various forms, such as images, text, and videos, may be interpreted to reflect the user’s activities, including their mental state regarding depression. For example, depression is a chronic disease from which the vast majority of users suffer, and it has emerged as a significant issue relating to mental health on a global scale. However, because these data are scant, unfinished, and sometimes given inaccurately, it is challenging to make an accurate automated diagnosis from them. Even though several procedures have been utilized over the past few decades to diagnose depression, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques supply superior insights. Thus, in this study, we review several state-of-the-art ML and DL techniques in terms of the systematic literature review (SLR) approach for depression detection. We also highlight some critical challenges from the existing literature that may help to explore for future study. Finally, we believe this survey will help readers and researchers in ML and DL to understand critical solutions in diagnosing depression.},

  abstract     = {Epilepsy recognition based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and artificial intelligence technology is the main tool of health analysis and diagnosis in Internet of medical things (IoMT). As a distributed learning framework, federated learning can train a shared model from multiple independent edge nodes using local data, which has greatly promoted the development of IoMT. One of the main challenges of EEG-based epilepsy recognition in IoMT is that EEG records show varying distributions in different devices, different times, and different people. This nonstationary characteristic of EEG reduces the accuracy of the recognition model. To improve the classification performance in IoMT, a hierarchical domain adaptation projective dictionary pair learning (HDA-PDPL) model is developed in the study. HDA-PDPL integrates EEG signals from different domains (person, edge nodes, devices, etc.) into a set of hierarchical subspace and simultaneously learns synthesis and analysis dictionary pairs in each layer. Specifically, a nonlinear transform function is introduced to seek hierarchical feature projection. The domain adaptation term on sparse coding builds a connection between different domains. Thus, the shared synthesis and analysis dictionaries can encode domain-invariant representation and discrimination knowledge from different domains. Besides, the local preserved term of projective codes is introduced to capture the potential discriminative local structures of samples. The experimental results on two EEG epilepsy classifications verified that the HDA-PDPL model can outperform other comparisons by utilizing more shared knowledge of different domains.},

This study proposes a DL-based network to fuse multimodal medical images. In our method, the lattice unit (LU) is designed to improve the representation capability of the fusion network. Moreover, to acquire hierarchical features from images, the progressive module (PM) treats the network’s shallow and deep layers differently. The shallow layers represent the structure of the source image; the deep layers correspond to details. Different loss functions are utilized for these two kinds of information to retain fused images’ salient structures and functional information. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm performs well on visual quality and objective evaluation, which provides a reliable reference for medical diagnosis. In addition, this method is lightweight and speedy compared to existing algorithms, facilitating further placement in the IoMT’s specific devices.},

However, social media has emerged as a valuable resource for identifying symptoms of depression and other mental disorders as people are increasingly willing to share their experiences and emotions online. As such, social media-based depression detection has become an important area of research. Unfortunately, despite the growing number of cases in China, there are few Chinese social media-based resources for depression research. To address this gap, this article presents a dataset collected from Sina Weibo and approaches depression detection as a binary classification problem. A depression lexicon is developed based on domain knowledge of depression and the Dalian University of Technology Sentiment Lexicon (DUT-SL), which facilitates better extraction of lexical features related to depression. Then the lexical features are fused using a correlation-based metric. The effectiveness of this approach is verified using five classical machine learning methods and two boosting-based models, both on a public dataset and our dataset. Experimental results indicate that the depression domain lexicon features improve classification performance and fusing these features based on their correlations can further enhance prediction effectiveness. This study provides a method for future research in social media-based depression detection and contributes to the development of Chinese depression detection resources.},

Over the past decade, information and communication technology has proved its ability to improve medical quality, reduce costs, and promote data security. Developing countries can exploit these technologies to improve the healthcare process and ensure remote health monitoring, especially in rural areas. The Internet of Things and smart medical devices are widely used to provide remote patient monitoring. Current systems are based on centralized communication with cloud servers. However, this architecture increases several security and privacy risks. The adoption of a distributed architecture is required to overcome these issues. In this article, we describe a Blockchain-based system for securing Internet-of-Things (IoT) healthcare devices. In addition to data encryption, we propose to use Blockchain technology to enhance security and privacy in healthcare systems. The system is intended to allow remote patient monitoring, particularly for chronic diseases that necessitate regular monitoring. Three important characteristics were taken into account: security, scalability, and processing time. The security concerns are ensured by using the re-encryption proxy in conjunction with Blockchain to encrypt data and control access to it. To ensure Blockchain scalability, data are stored in an InterPlanetary file system (IPFS) off-chain database. We use an Ethereum Blockchain based on proof of authority (PoA) to speed up the data storage. In comparison to existing methods, the experimental system has shown a significant improvement in the security of healthcare systems.},

  abstract     = {With the prevalence of social media, rewarding users to invite their friends to use an application or adopt a service has become one of the most successful designs in recent years. As the application or service spreads, a diffusion process driven by incentivized invitation forms. However, despite the extensive attention from both industry and academia, this newly-emerging diffusion process remains under-explored. To bridge this gap between academic research and industrial practice, we set out to examine the influence of social hubs, i.e., people with a considerable number of social ties, in the diffusion process driven by incentivized friend invitation. Through a large-scale empirical data analysis, we found that under three different measures, the influence of social hubs on the growth of the diffusion process is saturated as their number of contacts increases. Following this observation, we further explored possible causes of this phenomenon by a mixed method that combines a large-scale empirical data analysis and a semi-structured interview to deepen our understanding of social hubs’ influence in the diffusion process. We revealed two main causes. First, large social hubs lacked the will to keep engaging in sending invitations, and the anchoring effects on the cost-utility trade-off could explain their behaviors. Second, social hubs’ broadcasting capability decreased in the invitation-based diffusion process because hubs are better at informing rather than persuading compared with non-hubs. Our findings provide in-depth insights into the understanding of the nature of social hubs’ influence, and we further discuss practical implications for designs to facilitate invitation-based online diffusion processes.},

  abstract     = {We present a machine-learning-driven end-to-end simulator, called the Volume-Audience-Match (VAM) simulator. VAM’s purpose is to simulate future phenomena related to various topics of discussion in social media networks. We focus our attention on the social media platform, Twitter, due to its abundant use in today’s world. VAM was applied to do time series forecasting to predict the future: 1) number of total activities; 2) number of active old users; and 3) number of newly active users over the span of 24 hours from the start time of prediction. VAM then used these macroscopic volume predictions (VPs) to perform user link predictions. A user–user edge was assigned to each of the activities in the 24 future time steps. We report that VAM outperformed multiple baseline models in the time series task, which were the auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), auto regressive moving average (ARMA), auto regressive (AR), moving average (MA), Persistence Baseline, and state-of-the-art tNodeEmbed models. Furthermore, we show that VAM outperformed the Persistence Baseline and tNodeEmbed models used for the user-assignment tasks. Finally, it is also shown that using Reddit activity data improves prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The application of automation technology and artificial intelligence technology has promoted the improvement of the business capabilities of enterprises in industrial scenarios. Compared with the improvement or innovation of the business process, in recent years, part of academic research and practical applications has also shifted their attention from a single point of business intelligence perspective to a comprehensive intelligent upgrade of the industrial system. To the best of our knowledge, however, there is little research on the concept and model of the industrial intelligent system (IIS). To make up for the lack, this article presents the concept and reference model of IIS by analyzing the intelligentization requirement of the industrial systems. Different from academic research on general intelligent system capabilities, the reference model given emphasizes factors that need to be considered when implementing IIS in the industry. By analyzing the reference model, knowledge as the core driving force of IIS is recognized. Then, the four main forms of knowledge in IIS, as well as the role and key technologies of knowledge in different stages of IIS, are discussed in detail. In addition, several important potential applications of IIS are pointed out in this article.},

  abstract     = {Politeness enhances interactions by improving relations between the participants. If there is a display of rudeness, even the finest conversation can fall through. In addition, if lathered with kindness, even the most angst-prone circumstance can be expressed with far less suffering. Previously, researchers have focused upon including politeness in conversations. But the existing research does not focus on variations in politeness according to the user profile. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel task of generating polite personalized dialog responses in accordance with the user profile and consistent with the conversational history. We design a novel Polite Personalized Dialog Generation (PoPe-DG) framework that employs a reinforced deliberation network. We create human-annotated politeness templates according to user profiles to induce politeness variation in the generated responses for the proposed task. Precisely, the personality profile is transformed and normalized into a vector using the fusion attention combined with dialogue utterances to build context. Furthermore, the context modules and the annotated templates are appended to initialize the deliberation decoder. Experimental analysis validates that our proposed approach inculcates politeness in responses in accordance with the user profile and the conversational history.},

  abstract     = {In the team allocation problem (TAP), eliminating team disparities aims at keeping an equilibrium of the resource or ability among teams for equality. For this concern, existing literature merely utilized the golden mean principle to eliminate team disparities from a static perspective. Few of them reasonably investigate the pros and cons of this principle from a computational perspective. Moreover, maintaining equilibrium is a dynamic process and requires dynamic adjustment, especially after considering team members’ self-efforts and adaptivity. With respect to the environments—classes, agents, roles, groups, and objects (E-CARGO) model and its role-based collaboration (RBC) methodology, this article formalizes and solves the TAP, i.e., revised group role assignment (GRA) problem, from both the individual and team’s perspective. Based on the revised GRA, this article provides novel insight into the effectiveness of dynamically maintaining equilibrium, which may help decision-makers be proactive in building more sustainable teams. Relevant large-scale simulation experiments are conducted in this article to verify the proposed method. This article reveals a social paradox: even though considering all about the team members’ self-efforts and adaptivity, equilibrium still seems inequitable. Conversely, pursuing equilibrium may bring the Matthew effect.},

In this article, we investigate the robustness of the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -core structure under adversarial attacks by deleting edges, for the first time. First, we give the general definition of the targeted &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -core attack, map it to the set cover problem, which is NP-hard, and further introduce a series of evaluation metrics to measure the performance of attack methods. Then, we propose the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$Q$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; index theoretically as the probability that the terminal node of an edge does not belong to the innermost core, which is further used to guide the design of our heuristic attack methods, namely, COREATTACK and GreedyCOREATTACK. The experiments on a variety of real-world networks demonstrate that our methods behave much better than a series of baselines, in terms of much smaller edge change rate (ECR) and false attack rate (FAR), achieving state-of-the-art attack performance. More impressively, for certain real-world networks, only deleting one edge from the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -core may lead to the collapse of the innermost core, even if this core contains dozens of nodes.

First, the higher the number of deaths, the worse it is for society; second, if the inequality of deaths is greater between regions of a country, the worse the assessment of pandemic management should be. On a global scale, this unevenness is evident because it is not controlled by anything. In particular countries, it should be the result of efficient and honest management of the spread of the epidemic. The authors assume in the proposed algorithm that the number of deaths in individual organizational units of the state (regions, states, provinces, etc.) is known in the existing administrative division. By considering the population numbers in these units, the Lorentz curve is prepared, and the Gini coefficient is calculated for the entire world and for individual countries such as USA, India, Brazil, Poland, and the Balkan and Eastern European countries with the highest number of deaths per million inhabitants in the world. Moreover, an attempt was made to present the universal mortality rate in a given country in the form of a bicriterion combining the Gini index and the number of deaths per million inhabitants achieved. We obtained definitely different values of this criterion for the countries under consideration. The method is universal and allows calculating the criterion for any country or group of countries.},

  abstract     = {Influence maximization (IM) is a classical and heated issue in online social networks. Although some works have studied multifeature IM, they do not consider this problem from the perspective of users’ preferences. In this article, we construct a novel multifeature spreading model that considers users’ different preferences, namely, the MFP-independent cascade (IC) model, which uses the IC model as the basic propagation model. Some features are positive or negative depending on users’ preferences. According to this spreading model, we consider a novel problem that focuses on the influence gap between positive features and negative features, namely, positive evaluation maximization (PEM). This problem is NP-hard and nonsubmodular. Fortunately, PEM can be expressed as DS decomposition because the positive influence and the negative influence are both monotone submodular. Based on DS decomposition, we design some special greedy strategies, namely, the parametric conditioned greedy (PCG). To reduce the computational cost of our method, we design fast PCG (FPCG) algorithm using the sampling technique. In addition, the approximation ratio of the PCG and FPCG approaches is only the gap between their &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$O(\epsilon)$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; values.

As the size of financial transaction data continues to grow, traditional machine-learning models are increasingly difficult to use for financial fraud detection. Some graph-learning methods have been widely used for Internet financial fraud detection, however, these methods ignore the stronger structural homogeneity and cannot aggregate features for two structurally similar but distant nodes. To address this problem, in this article, we propose a graph-learning algorithm TA-Struc2Vec for Internet financial fraud detection, which can learn topological features and transaction amount features in a financial transaction network graph and represent them as low-dimensional dense vectors, allowing intelligent and efficient classification and prediction by training classifier models.

With the development and popularity of social networks, the IM problem plays an essential role in various applications, such as public opinion analysis, viral marketing, and rumor early warning. However, most of the existing IM solutions have not accessed the risk of negative information from nodes in the future. In reality, a company may face economic loss when negative information breaks out of its spokesman. Therefore, a crisis assessment oriented and topic-based IM problem (TIM-CA) is proposed, which is utilized to model the IM problem by considering the crisis assessment (CA) and topics of users. To solve this problem, we propose a maximum influence arborescence model-based algorithm for TIM-CA, namely, MIA-TIM-CA. The proposed algorithm consists of crisis degree calculation, topic relevance calculation, and influence spread evaluation. More importantly, as for crisis degree calculation, it considers self-, topology-, and topic-based crisis degrees for each node. At the influence spread evaluation stage, MIA-TIM-CA proposes two functions to evaluate the node’s importance and node influence spread. Extensive experiments on two real-world social networks demonstrate that our MIA-TIM-CA outperforms all comparison algorithms on influence spread, crisis score, and running time.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes semantic embedding for image transformers (SEiTs) to explore semantic features of facial morphology in the action unit (AU) detection task. The conventional approaches typically rely on external information (e.g., facial landmarks) to obtain the location of facial components, whereas the SEiT can learn morphological features intrinsically from the face image. The pre-training task, namely semantic masked facial image modeling (SMFIM), aims to actively obtain facial morphological information. The pixels of the input facial image are randomly erased with semantic masks (e.g., nose, eyes, eyebrows, mouth, and lip). The embedding model tries to predict the presence of facial components for the input image that can learn semantic representations of the face simultaneously. The learned semantic embeddings are fed to transformer blocks, which enable global interaction between semantic elements. The SEiT integrates facial morphological information and global interaction characters, appropriate for AU detection. The experiments are conducted on the Binghamton-Pittsburgh 4D (BP4D) dataset and Denver intensity of spontaneous facial action (DISFA) dataset, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SEiT.},

  abstract     = {Online social networks are at the limelight of the public debate, where antagonistic groups compete to impose conflicting narratives and polarize the discussions. This article proposes an approach for measuring network polarization and political sectarianism in Twitter based on user interaction networks. Centrality metrics identify a small group of influential users (polarizers and unpolarizers) who influence a larger group of users (polarizees and unpolarizees) according to their ideological stance (left, right, and undefined). This network polarization is computed by the Bayesian probability using typical actions such as following, tweeting, retweeting, and replying. The measurement of political sectarianism also uses Bayesian probability and words extracted from the tweets to quantify the intensity of othering, aversion, and moralization in the debate. We collected Twitter data from 33 conflicted political events in Brazil during 2020, strongly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our methodology and polarization score, our results reveal that the approach based on user interaction networks leads to an increasing understanding of polarized conflicts in Twitter. Also, a small number of polarizers is enough to represent the polarization and sectarianism of Twitter events.},

  abstract     = {Gender difference in how technology is used has been a long-time concern in education. This study examined the impact of the rapid transition from face-to-face learning to remote learning (RL) for students of selected higher education institutions in South Africa. The study employed a quantitative census sampling method as an electronic questionnaire administered to 243 respondents, mainly students enrolled in accounting and finance department in their second, third, and fourth year of study. In designing the questionnaire, ten items from the Technology Readiness Index (TRI 2.0) were adapted to determine the technology readiness of respondents. Furthermore, descriptive statistics were used to establish the common Information and Communications Technology (ICT) tools, platforms, and teaching approaches adopted by lecturers and estimate the technological readiness of students. This article revealed some challenges encountered by students while schools were closed due to the lockdown measures to contain the COVID-19 virus. From the findings in this study, it can be seen that male students are more likely to adjust faster than female students to RL. This result is consistent with some of the findings in the literature. Learning from home or other environments outside the university has been proven ineffective as students can get easily distracted by external factors that can affect their learning and understanding. This becomes more difficult for female students, especially in Africa, where it is believed that specific responsibilities are for girls. Statistically, there is a high level of anxiety among female students. This can be attributed to the exceptional living conditions and situations during the ongoing pandemic, such as uncertainty of the future, social isolation, challenges of RL, childcare, babysitting, and gender-based violence. The study recommended that policymakers introduce policies that address students’ challenges, especially female students while working from home.},

  abstract     = {Recognition of amount in figures in the financial multi-bill scenes is crucial for the automatic banking business. However, the diversity of banking business and the limitation of customer data privacy determine that it is difficult to collect a large number of sample datasets. Aiming at the problem of insufficient training data in multi-bill scenes and the low accuracy of the detection model, this article proposes a new generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate new samples and to expand the bill dataset, which is then adopted to train a framework for recognition of the bill amount. In the proposed WGAN-SA, a residual block is adopted as the basic structure of the generator and the discriminator, and the self-attention mechanism is also utilized to improve the generation performance. In addition, Wasserstein distance is utilized to measure the distance between real and synthetic samples. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset and comparisons with state-of-the-art works show that our proposed WGAN-SA can effectively improve the few-sample learning performance. Besides, experiments on the bill dataset verify that our method can solve the problem of model collapse and has the ability to generate images of the amount in figures with better fidelity and variety, which is also helpful to achieve better bill amount recognition performance compared with other latest works.},

  abstract     = {The background subtraction (BGS) technique is popularly used for many surveillance systems, segmenting the foreground by subtracting the modeled background from the image sequences. The effectiveness of any BGS technique depends on the robustness of the constructed background model. It is to be noted that many BGS schemes are affected by the inclusion of either noisy pixels in background construction or parameters of generative models. In this regard, we propound an idea of a kernel-induced possibilistic fuzzy associated BGS scheme for local change detection from a fixed camera captured sequence. The proposed scheme follows two stages: background training and foreground segmentation. In the background construction stage, each pixel is modeled using a possibilistic fuzzy cost function in kernel-induced space. The use of the induced kernel function will project the low-dimensional data into a higher dimensional space and the use of the possibilistic function will construct a robust background model based on the density of the data in the temporal domain avoiding the noisy and outlier points. The performance of the proposed scheme is tested on three benchmark databases. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is evaluated on different performance evaluation measures: precision, recall, F-measure, and average similarity. We corroborate our findings by comparing them against 19 state-of-the-art existing BGS techniques.},

  abstract     = {Related item recommendations (RIRs) are ubiquitous in most online platforms today, including e-commerce and content streaming sites. These recommendations not only help users compare items related to a given item but also play a major role in bringing traffic to individual items, thus deciding the exposure that different items receive. With a growing number of people depending on such platforms to earn their livelihood, it is important to understand whether different items are receiving their desired exposure. To this end, our experiments on multiple real-world RIR datasets reveal that the existing RIR algorithms often result in very skewed exposure distribution of items, and the quality of items is not a plausible explanation for such skew in exposure. To mitigate this exposure bias, we introduce multiple flexible interventions [fair related item recommendation (FaiRIR)] in the RIR pipeline. We instantiate these mechanisms with two well-known algorithms for constructing RIRs—rating singular value decomposition (SVD) and item2vec—and show on real-world data that our mechanisms allow for a fine-grained control on exposure distribution, often at a small or no cost in terms of recommendation quality, measured in terms of relatedness and user satisfaction.},

  abstract     = {Since its introduction in 2003, the influence maximization (IM) problem has drawn significant research attention in the literature. The aim of IM, which is NP-hard, is to select a set of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; users known as seed users who can influence the most individuals in the social network. The state-of-the-art algorithms estimate the expected influence of nodes based on sampled diffusion paths. As the number of required samples has been recently proven to be lower bounded by a particular threshold that presets tradeoff between the accuracy and the efficiency, the result quality of these traditional solutions is hard to be further improved without sacrificing efficiency. In this article, we present an orthogonal and novel paradigm to address the IM problem by leveraging deep reinforcement learning (RL) to estimate the expected influence. In particular, we present a novel framework called deeP reInforcement leArning-based iNfluence maximizatiOn (PIANO) that incorporates network embedding and RL techniques to address this problem. In order to make it practical, we further present PIANO-E and PIANO &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\text{@}\langle d\rangle $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , both of which can be applied directly to answer IM without training the model from scratch. Experimental study on real-world networks demonstrates that PIANO achieves the best performance with respect to efficiency and influence spread quality compared to state-of-the-art classical solutions. We also demonstrate that the learned parametric models generalize well across different networks. Besides, we provide a pool of pretrained PIANO models such that any IM task can be addressed by directly applying a model from the pool without training over the targeted network.},

In reality, the sensing costs information (time cost, battery drainage, bandwidth occupation of mobile devices, and so on) is the private information of collectors, which is unknown by the data requester. In this article, we model the strategic interactions between health-data requester and collectors using a bilevel optimization model. Considering that the crowdsensing market is open and the participants are equal, we propose a Walrasian equilibrium-based pricing mechanism to coordinate the interest conflicts between health-data requesters and collectors. Specifically, based on the exchange economic theory, we transform the bilevel optimization problem into a social welfare maximization problem with the constraint condition that the balance between supply and demand, and dual decomposition is then employed to divide the social welfare maximization problem into a set of subproblems that can be solved by health-data requesters and collectors. We prove that the optimal task price is equal to the marginal utility generated by the collector’s health data. To avoid obtaining the collector’s private information, a distributed iterative algorithm is then designed to obtain the optimal task pricing strategy. Furthermore, we conduct computational experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed pricing mechanism and analyze the effects of intrinsic rewards, sensing costs on optimal task prices, and collectors’ health-data supplies.},

  abstract     = {Recently, many data mining models based on heterogeneous graph (HG) have emerged. Among these, HG embedding is an important and indispensable process. However, the existing HG embedding models usually use graph neural network to learn embeddings separately on different meta-paths, ignoring the fact that different meta-paths contain not only their unique semantics but also related semantics. This may result in semantic overlap or irrelevance, which needs to be a feasible and effective tradeoff for high-quality HG embedding, yet studies thereof have rarely been reported. In this article, we propose semantic tradeoff HG embedding (STHGE) by first introducing the Hilbert–Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) as restriction. The main idea of STHGE is to regard semantic tradeoff as independence tradeoff (or correlation) between different meta-path spaces. Specifically, we first transform the original features of nodes into different meta-path feature spaces with HSIC restriction between them. Then, we use graph attention network to learn the embeddings of nodes on different meta-paths with HSIC restrictions. Finally, we concatenate the embeddings on different meta-paths to perform prediction. Experimental results on three heterogeneous datasets not only demonstrate the effectiveness of STHGE but also demonstrate that STHGE can achieve a new semantic tradeoff between different meta-paths. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of STHGE.},

During the COVID-19 pandemic, users get exposed to a massive amount of information about a new topic having a high level of uncertainty. In this article, we analyze two social media that enforced opposite moderation methods, Twitter and Gab, to assess the interplay between news consumption and content regulation concerning COVID-19. We compare the two platforms on about three million pieces of content, analyzing user interaction with respect to news articles. We first describe users’ consumption patterns on the two platforms focusing on the political leaning of news outlets. Finally, we characterize the echo chamber effect by modeling the dynamics of users’ interaction networks. Our results show that the presence of moderation pursued by Twitter produces a significant reduction of questionable content, with a consequent affiliation toward reliable sources in terms of engagement and comments. Conversely, the lack of clear regulation on Gab results in the tendency of the user to engage with both types of content, showing a slight preference for the questionable ones which may account for a dissing/endorsement behavior. Twitter users show segregation toward reliable content with a uniform narrative. Gab, instead, offers a more heterogeneous structure where users, independent of their leaning, follow people who are slightly polarized toward questionable news.},

  abstract     = {Pareto optimality refers to a benefit distribution that cannot be improved without lowering the benefit of at least one individual. Group role assignment (GRA) pursues an optimal role assignment from the team’s viewpoint and mainly considers the team performance. It is valuable to check whether an optimal assignment is consistent with the Pareto optimality. Otherwise, there would be discomforts in social development. In this article, we establish a model for simulating a resource/benefit distribution by using the environment–class, agent, role, group, and object (E-CARGO) model, which was developed by our previous work. To obtain a deep understanding of the Pareto optimality, we use a revised GRA model to check for possible Pareto improvement. This article contributes a unique and novel way to investigate economic or social phenomena with the E-CARGO and GRA model, provides further insight into the Pareto optimality from the perspective of role assignment, and confirms the feasibility of Pareto improvements. The proposed algorithm is verified using theoretical proofs and simulation experiments. Interesting findings are deduced and presented: 1) Pareto improvements do not exist when resources are insufficient and are feasible only when the number of provisions is larger than that of requests. 2) Pareto assignment exists if and only if we have sufficient people for production and sufficient resources for consumption. The defined Pareto GRA problem seems complex but we can solve it with a simple and efficient algorithm. 3) Overproduction is driven by not only individual requests but also the social requirement of Pareto improvements.},

Single-server and small clinics have been extensively studied, but little attention has been paid to the modeling and evaluation of large-scale outpatient care systems. In this study, complex patient routings in large-scale outpatient systems are specified, and three patient flow variability factors (e.g., return rate, first-lab-visit rate, and second-lab-visit rate) are discussed. The measures, namely, patient satisfaction, resource utilization, and system efficiency, are based on the ratios of “effective time” over “holistic time.” The purpose of this study is to find the effect of patient flow variability and service time variability on the efficiency of a multistage outpatient system. A discrete-event simulation (DES) model is built, and a real case is presented. A novel method to generate the transition matrix based on patient flow variability is proposed. Our results show that the patient flow variability has a negative impact on patient satisfaction and a positive effect on resource utilization and system efficiency.

  abstract     = {Topic modeling on tweets is known to experience under-specificity and data sparsity due to its character limitation. In earlier studies, researchers attempted to address this problem by either 1) tweet aggregation, where related tweets are combined into a single document or 2) tweet expansion with related text from external sources. The first approach faces the problem of losing the topic distribution in individual tweets. While finding a relevant text from the external source for a random tweet in the second approach is challenging for various reasons like differences in writing styles, multilingual content, and informal text. In contrast to adding context from external resources or combining related tweets into a pool, this study uses the internal vocabulary (hashtags) to counter under-specificity and sparsity in tweets. Earlier studies have indicated hashtags to be an important feature for representing the underlying context present in the tweet. Sequential models like Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) over distributed representation of words have shown promising results in capturing semantic relationships between words of a tweet in the past. Motivated by the above, this article proposes a unified framework of hashtag-based tweet expansion exploiting text-based and network-based representation learning methods such as BiLSTM, BERT, and Graph Convolution Network (GCN). The hashtag-based expanded tweets using the proposed framework have significantly improved topic modeling performance compared to un-expanded (raw) tweets and hashtag-pooling-based approaches over two real-world tweet datasets of different nature. Furthermore, this article also studies the significance of hashtags in topic modeling performance by experimenting with different combination of word types such as hashtags, keywords, and user mentions.},

Thus, it is crucial to achieving a balance between recommendation performance and privacy-preserving of RSs. Aiming to solve the above problem, this article proposes a novel matrix factorization (MF) algorithm. The algorithm predicts the user rating through a linear weighting of global average rating, item average rating, user average rating, and MF, which improves the prediction accuracy. Then, based on the above algorithm, this article proposes a MF RS for preserving user privacy by using local differential privacy technology. In this algorithm, the rating data are normalized on the user side to reduce global sensitivity. Then, Laplace noise is added to sensitive data before it is sent to the aggregator. Finally, based on the disturbed data, rating prediction is realized by using the MF algorithm. The proposed method is compared with five well-known recommendation methods on four public datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better recommendation performance at the same privacy-preserving level.},

  abstract     = {Text mining in noisy situations, like poor contrast and fainted edges, is one of the challenging areas of research in the domain of social networks and computer vision. Scene text detection is a complicated task as text regionhaving varying span in term of size, orientation, aspect ratio, color, font, and script. Furthermore, the contrast of a scene image varies drastically in noisy situations due to poor illumination and image filtering. This faints the text edges and make the task of detection more challenging. In this article, we bring forward a semantic edge supervised spatial-channel attention network, known as SESANet, for detecting arbitrary-shaped text instances in noisy scene images with faint text edges. Our network learns multiscale (MS) supervised edge semantic, pixel-wise spatial structure information, and interchannel dependencies for precisely localizing the text masks in scene images with poor contrast and illumination. Our network is efficient, precise, and fast in nature. SESANet captures rich, dense, discriminative, and MS semantic information. The experimental results show the success of the proposed network. It shows a superior performance with regard to recall on the publicly available benchmark datasets. A new dataset scene images, named as Edge-fainted Noisy Arbitrary-shaped Scene Text (EFNAST) dataset, having varying noise density, poor contrast, low illumination, and faint edges is created.},

In a comparative study of the Southeast Asian social media markets of Vietnam and Singapore, we induce a grounded theory perspective of social media cultures, comparing across instances of both an emerging market and an advanced market in the hemispheric region. We find the Vietnamese culture of social media use orients around economic productivity, Social Commerce, leveraging social connections to generate consumer-to-consumer commerce largely outside of government notice and taxation. The Singaporean culture of social media revolves around the important and highly implicit notion of Influence Commerce. Singaporeans are experts in their application of social media presence to monetize the process of exerting social influence on networks of information and opinion.

  abstract     = {At the end of 2021 Q2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Indonesia experienced a continuous increase in positivity and mortality rates. There are limited studies regarding the factors of COVID-19 mortality in Indonesia with a more balanced dataset. The previous studies only implemented logistic regression, sensitive to the imbalanced dataset. Meanwhile, other countries implemented survival analysis to overcome the problem. Most survival analyses using Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model require the variables to be time-independent. To this end, this study aims to identify the risk factors for COVID-19 mortality in Indonesia using a survival analysis approach using Jakarta as a case study. We use the Piecewise Exponential Model (PEM) to overcome the time-dependent problem in CPH. The findings show that the COVID-19 mortality does not differ the gender. In contrast, it differs the elderly with 3.5 times higher to be deceased. Dyspnea, malaise, and pneumonia are the primary symptoms associated with COVID-19 mortality. From the comorbidities, diabetes and chronic disease are related to COVID-19, while hypertension and heart attack are still considerable in clustered contexts. The advanced treatment using intubation and extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) produces a relatively large hazard risk of COVID-19 mortality. Based on the findings, we suggest that collaboration among the government, society, and hospitals is vital in overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic and minimizing the COVID-19 death.},

To address this challenge, consideration of emojis and surrounding words of the disease names in the text can be helpful. Transformer-based methods are better at capturing the meaning of a word based on its surrounding words compared to traditional methods. However, there are numerous transformer-based methods available and pretrained on natural language processing (NLP) data that are inherently different from Twitter data. Moreover, the size of these models varies in terms of the number of parameters. Hence, it is challenging to decide and choose one of these methods for fine-tuning it on the downstream tasks such as tweet classification. In this work, we experiment with nine widely used transformer methods and compare their performance on the personal health mention classification of tweet data. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of model size on the classification task and provide a brief interpretation of the classification decision made by the best performing classifier. Experimental results show that RoBERTa outperforms all other models by achieving an F1 score of 93%, while two other models perform similarly by achieving an F1 score of 92.5%.},

  abstract     = {Mental health disorder continues to be a grievous concern plaguing humans worldwide. The scarcity of mental health professionals (MHPs) has driven novel efforts lately to combat mental illness by developing automated systems capable of assisting MHPs. However, lack of high-quality conversational data due to privacy concerns remains a bottleneck toward its study and automation. Also, distinguishing and identifying various mental disorders is a challenging task as these are expressed using similar patterns in terms of language usage and overall sentiment polarity. The need for classifying different mental illnesses is rather intuitive as their true diagnosis is imperative for determining their path to recovery. As a first step toward creating automated virtual agent (VA), in this article, we curate a large-scale dataset for multiple mental illnesses comprising of dyadic conversations between a mentally ill user (typically a support seeker) and the VA (typically a peer supporter imparting hope and motivation), collected from a peer-to-peer support platform. We present a hierarchical attention-based deep neural network classifier for modeling conversations to detect different mental disorders as the dialog progresses. The proposed network is equipped with lexicon-based sentiment scores in order to prioritize certain contributing features. The proposed model attained an accuracy of 83.91% and outperformed several strong baselines.},

In this article, we study the information diffusion at the user level and propose a diffusion control method based on gradient information to generate an optimized network structure, namely ConTroL information DIFFusion (CTL-DIFF). CTL-DIFF targets a user through subtle modifications of its local network structure. It first selects the edges with the largest absolute gradient based on the prediction model to optimize the original network’s structure. It then employs several prediction methods to verify whether the target user’s social action status is controlled. CTL-DIFF achieves state-of-the-art control performance with a minimum budget, comparing with five baselines based on edge centrality strategies on four real-world datasets. We extend the diffusion control from user-level to global-level, comparing with four baselines on three datasets. Experimental results show that CTL-DIFF can effectively control information diffusion in the global social network by identifying and controlling the most influential users.},

While a CAT bond typically enables fund generation to the insurers and re-insurers after a disaster happens, a PEFF or pandemic bond’s payout is linked to random thresholds that keep evolving as the pandemic continues to unfold. The subtle difference in the timing and structure of the funding payout between the usual CAT bond and PEFF complicates the valuation of the latter. We address this complication, and our analysis identifies certain aspects in the PEFF’s design that must be simplified and strengthened so that this financial instrument is able to serve the intent of its original creation.

The payout is triggered when the number of infected people exceeds a predetermined threshold. A CAT-bond pricing setup is developed with the Vasiček-based financial risk factor correlated with the SIR dynamics for the PEFF valuation. The probability of a pandemic occurrence during the bond’s term to maturity is calculated via a Poisson process. Our sensitivity analyses reveal that the SIR’s disease transmission and recovery rates, as well as the interest rate’s mean-reverting level, have a substantial effect on the bond price. Our proposed synthesized model was tested and validated using a Canadian COVID-19 dataset during the early development of the pandemic. We illustrate that the PEFF’s payout could occur as early as seven weeks after the official declaration of the pandemic, and the deficiencies of the most recent PEFF sold by an international financial institution could be readily rectified.},

In addition, if lathered with politeness, even the most angst-prone scenario can be expressed with far less hurt. In this article, we address the task of identifying politeness in goal-oriented dialog systems. In this regard, we create politeness-annotated conversational data (PACD) utilizing Microsoft Dialogue Challenge and DSTC1 datasets. For correctly identifying the politeness, we employ a hierarchical transformer network that effectively captures the contextual information (i.e., previous utterances) and current input for predicting the politeness in a given utterance of a dialog. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms all the defined baselines. Furthermore, through in- and cross-domain experiments, we show the necessity of a PACD to mitigate acts such as rude requests or insults for both socially interactive and task-oriented dialog systems.},

  abstract     = {COVID-19 has spread all over the world, accounting for countless death and enormous economic loss. Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic, governments from different countries have made various policies to prevent the pandemic from becoming worse. However, civilian reactions to the pandemic vary when they face similar situations. This behavioral variation creates a challenge when it comes to policy-making. Such differences are generally implicit, hidden in ones’ social lives. As a result, it is challenging to analyze such differences when the governments make policies. In this work, we investigate social media posts on Twitter and Weibo in order to effectively explore the difference in reactions across various countries, with the aim to understand national differences. To this end, we employ natural language processing (NLP) methods and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) tools to process six languages in different countries, including the USA, Germany, France, Italy, the U.K., and China. We provide a comprehensive analysis of public reaction differences from the emotional perspective. Our findings verify that the reactions vary noticeably among various countries for some policies. Therefore, sentiment analysis can significantly influence policy-making. Our work sheds light on the mechanism of detecting the reaction differences in various countries, which can be utilized to conduct effective communication and make appropriate policy decisions.},

First, we analyze the relationship between the leaders’ broadcast moments and the consensus opinion of followers and explain that the marginal revenue of the broadcasts is diminishing. Second, we describe the connotation of assimilation and calculate the minimum number of broadcasts required for the leaders to assimilate the followers’ opinions. Finally, aiming to make the consensus opinion of the followers and the leaders’ as close as possible, we give an optimal strategy on how to select followers to broadcast.

  abstract     = {In an autonomous system, rational agents aim to maximize their benefits. Rational agents gradually give up cooperation with others and only request services, which leads to the phenomenon of free-riding. This phenomenon generally exists in the real society and application system. Therefore, how to reduce the behavior, which is similar to free-riding, has become an important research topic. In addition, the traditional pairwise interaction network cannot truly reflect the interaction properties of cooperative events. Social norms provide an effective way to promote cooperation for autonomous systems. Axelrod’s metanorm game model achieves the emergence of social norms by conducting punishment to connivance based on punishing defection. However, links in networks only allow for pairwise interactions. Therefore, we introduce hypergraphs, which are more suitable to reflect group interaction to model metanorm games. The establishment efforts of norms are examined on hypergraphs (uniform random hypergraph (URH), hyperdegree-heterogeneous random hypergraphs, and real-world hypergraphs). We show that the difference in group sizes affects norms emergence of agents and realize the establishment of social norms on URH. To a certain extent, the probability of being seen is positively correlated with agents’ vengefulness and learning time and negatively correlated with boldness. However, the usage of the boldness and vengefulness learning (BV-learning) algorithm on HRHs cannot make norms emergence because leavers cannot participate in learning and the fixed learning step. Therefore, we propose the dynamic relevance BV-learning algorithm to overcome the aforementioned problems, so hub agents and leavers can jointly establish better social norms. We also verify the evolution process of agents’ cooperation rate by BV-learning and the dynamic relevance BV-learning, respectively, which demonstrate that the establishment of social norms can indeed promote agents’ cooperation. Finally, in order to illustrate the universality of the dynamic relevance BV-learning clearly, we study norms establishment on real-world hypergraphs by and compare it with BV-learning. It can be found that the dynamic relevance BV-learning can effectively establish social norms on real-world hypergraphs.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes private intersection weighted sum (PIWS), a scalable, fair, and privacy-preserving intersection weighted sum protocol and applies it to voting scenarios. The PIWS protocol can privately calculate the intersection of identity index sets maintained by each participant and can privately calculate the weighted sum of the data associated with the identity indexes of the intersection set. After the execution of the protocol, both parties can only know the weighted sum, but not any additional information, such as any identity index or associated data of the other party. The PIWS protocol is very suitable for the privacy-preserving weighted voting scenarios and has three novel characteristics. First, it does not require as many semitrusted tally clerks as other protocols, which greatly reduces the deployment, communication, and calculation costs involved. It only requires the distributed deployment of voting servers and weight servers that are honest but curious. This is consistent with the deployment framework of the future big data application backgrounds. Second, perfect privacy protection and ballot secrecy are achieved. That is, the voting terminal or polling station provides encryption services for ballots immediately after each ballot is cast. All voting information is then expressed in ciphertext throughout the weighting and counting processes, until the final result of the weighted vote is passed to the voting server in the ciphertext. After decryption, the voting server only knows the results of the voting and it has no knowledge of the content or preference of the ballots, the privacy of the voters, or even the process of counting the votes. This design avoids the disclosure of voter privacy and ballot information, and the ciphertext form also prevents malicious users from cheating or tampering with voter or ballot information during the counting process. To better explain the security of our protocol, we present the provable security of the protocol under the honest-but-curious model and show the formal verification obtained using the Tamarin prover software. Third, our protocol not only achieves the function of an optional weighted voting protocol but also is relatively lightweight and efficient. The efficiency analysis results of the deployed voting system in terms of communication, storage, and calculation show that the protocol meets the requirements applicable to real-world applications. In summary, PIWS is superior to existing voting protocols in terms of function, security, and efficiency, and can be harmoniously applied to model updating of federated learning, consensus building of blockchain systems, or decision-making in artificial intelligence.},

  abstract     = {Emojis or emoticons are not just a modern trend but have become an essential part of our day-to-day interactions. Predicting a suitable emoji for a given tweet is a challenging task because a wrong emoji prediction for a tweet can change the meaning of the message or can amplify the emotion of the message. This task is particularly challenging since it requires selecting an appropriate emoji from a huge list of prospective emojis that may or may not be equivalent to one another. Humans use multiple emojis to convey their emotions, thereby making the task a multilabel classification problem. In this article, we propose a multilabel emoji prediction system that predicts the appropriate emoji for a given tweet by using different state-of-the-art baselines. Due to the unavailability of a multi-emoji dataset, we create a large-scale multilabel emoji dataset named Mu-Emoji that comprises of more than 0.6 million tweets having varied emojis belonging to both positive and negative sentiments. For our proposed task, we employ graph attention network along with bidirectional encoder representations from transformer encoder for the accurate prediction of emojis. Qualitative and quantitative analyses show that our multilabel emoji prediction baselines perform well compared with the single-emoji prediction baselines for our proposed Mu-Emoji dataset. Our proposed framework also outperforms all the baselines for both single and multilabel emoji prediction tasks.},

  abstract     = {With the popularity of credit cards worldwide, timely and accurate fraud detection has become critically important to ensure the safety of their user accounts. Existing models generally utilize original features or manually aggregated features as their transactional representations, while they fail to reveal the hidden fraudulent behaviors. In this work, we propose a novel model to extract transactional behaviors of users and learn new transactional behavioral representations for credit card fraud detection. Considering the characteristics of transactional behaviors, two time-aware gates are designed in a recurrent neural net unit to learn long- and short-term transactional habits of users, respectively, and to capture behavioral changes of users caused by different time intervals between their consecutive transactions. A time-aware-attention module is proposed and employed to extract the behavioral information from their consecutive historical transactions with time intervals, which enables the proposed model to capture behavioral motive and periodicity inside their historical transactional behaviors. An interaction module is designed to learn more comprehensive and rational representations. To prove the effectiveness of the learned transactional behavioral representations, experiments are conducted on a large real-world transaction dataset and a public one. The results show that the learned representation can well distinguish fraudulent behaviors from legitimate ones, and the proposed method can improve the performance of credit card fraud detection in terms of various evaluation criteria over the state-of-the-art methods.},

Due to a large number of minors (vulnerable groups) and complex building environments, the school is one of the main targets of terrorists. The Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 poses a challenge to social and public security. Considering the dichotomous characteristics of the people shot and the impact of the refuge area on the crowd movement in the shooting incident, we use an agent-based model to restore the real target case. Based on the optimal solution, we explore the effects of the number and location of building exits, the scale of the shooter’s attack, and the time to find shelter on the shooting results. For building exits, we found that for the environment in the case, the exit location has little impact on the number of casualties, but the increase in the number of exits provides more evacuation routes for the crowd and reduces the number of casualties. Panic will increase the probability of collision and injury. Hiding in a refuge area away from the shooter is effective to avoid shooting injury. At the same time, we propose the critical point of hiding probability. When it is greater than 40%, the faster the escape speed is, the higher the safety is; escape is more likely to replace avoidance in hiding probability less than 40% of environments. These findings are helpful to guide the building evacuation channel construction and emergency evacuation training.},

To better understand their preferences, personality analysis has attracted more attention. Unlike single modal data such as text or images, which is hard to comprehensively uncover one’s personal traits, personality analysis on short video is verified to be much more accurate but also more challenging because of the huge gap between incompatible data modalities. We have noticed that the key problem is how to disentangle the complexity from multimodal data to find their consistency and uniqueness. In this article, we propose a novel video analysis framework for personality detection with visual, acoustic, and textual neural networks. Specifically, to enhance our model’s sensitivity to personality detection, we first propose three deep learning channels to learn modal features. The framework can not only extract each modal feature but also learn time-varying pattern via a temporal alignment network. To identify the consistency and uniqueness across multiple modalities, we creatively propose to maximize the similarity of common information learned by a shared neural network across multiple modalities and extend the distance of exclusive information learned by private networks of different modalities. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that our model can outperform existing baselines.},

Because students’ social centrality is based on both their study ability and facial traits, this study does a comparative analysis of how facial perception and academic performance influence the social centrality of students.

  abstract     = {In the last few decades, profit maximization (PM), which is mainly considered for maximizing net profits, i.e., the difference between gain and cost, has been a prominent issue for online social networks (OSNs). However, the output-to-input ratio, which is an important metric in economics, is also worth studying for OSNs. In this article, we present a novel problem that considers the PM problem from the ratio of gain and cost, known as output-to-input ratio maximization (OIRM). Unfortunately, it is neither submodular nor supermodular. The hill-climbing greedy algorithm for solving this problem is a &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$1-e^{-(1-c_{g})}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; approximation algorithm, where &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$c_{g}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is the curvature of the monotone submodular set function &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$g$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; . To speed up the hill-climbing greedy algorithm, we propose the threshold decrease algorithm and prove that its approximation ratio is &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$1-e^{-(1-c_{g})^{2}}-\epsilon $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; . In addition, based on the relationship between classical net PM and OIRM, the algorithms for solving PM can also solve OIRM. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our algorithms using massive experiments on real datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to study the OIRM in viral marketing.},

  abstract     = {Moral outrage has become synonymous with social media in recent years. However, the preponderance of academic analysis on social media websites has focused on hate speech and misinformation. This article focuses on analyzing moral judgments rendered on social media by capturing the moral judgments that are passed in the subreddit /r/AmITheAsshole on Reddit. Using the labels associated with each judgment, we train a classifier that can take a comment and determine whether it judges the user who made the original post to have positive or negative moral valence. Then, we employ human annotators to verify the performance of this classifier and use it to investigate an assortment of website traits surrounding moral judgments in ten other subreddits. Our analysis looks to answer three questions related to moral judgments and how these apply to different aspects of Reddit. We seek to determine whether moral valence impacts post scores, in which subreddit communities contain users with more negative moral valence, and whether gender and age play a role in moral judgments. Findings from our experiments show that users upvote posts more often when posts contain positive moral valence. We also find that certain subreddits, such as /r/confessions, attract users who tend to be judged more negatively. Finally, we found that men and older age were judged negatively more often.},

  abstract     = {Smartphones with the platforms of applications are gaining extensive attention and popularity. The enormous use of different applications has paved the way for numerous security threats. The threats are in the form of attacks such as permission control attacks, phishing attacks, spyware attacks, botnets, malware attacks, and privacy leakage attacks. Moreover, other vulnerabilities include invalid authorization of apps, compromise on the confidentiality of data, and invalid access control. In this article, an application-based attack modeling and attack detection are proposed as a novel attack vulnerability is identified based on the app execution on the smartphone. The attack modeling involves an end-user vulnerable application to initiate an attack. The vulnerable application is installed at the background end on the smartphone with hidden visibility from the end-user, thereby accessing the confidential information. The detection model involves the proposed technique of an application-based behavioral model analysis (ABMA) scheme to address the attack model. The model incorporates application-based comparative parameter analysis to perform the process of intrusion detection. The ABMA is estimated by using the parameters of power, battery level, and data usage. Based on the source Internet accessibility, the analysis is performed using three different configurations, Wi-Fi, mobile data, and a combination of the two. The simulation results verify and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

This intention can be considered as anticonformist, as it is in opposition to the general view of others. This article hypothesizes that this phenomenon can be explained by some biases on the perceptions of attitudes. It proposes an agent-based model which computes an intention based on the theory of reasoned action (TRA) and assumes some biases in the perception of others’ attitudes according to the social judgment theory. It investigates the conditions on the model parameter values for which the simulations reproduce the features observed in the studies. The results show that perceptual biases are a possible explanation of anticonformist intentions.},

However, noise is introduced when data reconstruction is performed; and the square loss method is sensitive to noise, which leads to degradation in the performance of data analysis tasks. To solve this problem, a novel graph regularized sparse NMF (GSNMF) is proposed in this article.

In addition, the corresponding inference and alternating iterative update algorithm to solve the optimization problem are given. Then, an extension of GSNMF, namely, graph regularized sparse nonnegative matrix trifactorization (GSNMTF), is proposed, and the detailed inference procedure is also shown.

This article conducts a novel study of attraction assessment with pupil diameter and eye movements. We collected high temporal resolution ocular variation data from 50 subjects while they viewed a variety of emotional video stimuli. Besides, this article proposes two orthogonal-moment-based feature extraction methods for emotion classification, i.e., Legendre moment and Krawtchouk moment. The results of experiments show that our proposed feature sets achieve better classification performance compared with conventional time- or frequency-domain feature sets. The accuracy of predicting attraction level reached 87.4% and 91.0% when new features were used alone and combined with conventional features, respectively. Compared with the conventional features with an accuracy of 86.6%, our proposed features can improve the accuracy by 4.4%.This study conducts a ground investigation of quantitative attraction assessment for video clips, which might provide reference for paradigm design of affective computing research.},

As smart society evolves, Ethereum makes smart contracts reality, while the mine of transaction characteristics appearing on the Ethereum platform is scarce; thus, there is an urgent need to mine Ethereum from contract and transfer. In this article, we propose a heterogeneous network representation learning method to mine implicit information inside Ethereum transactions. Specifically, we construct an Ethereum transaction network by collecting transaction data from normal and phishing Ethereum accounts. Then, we propose a walk strategy that combines timestamps and transaction amounts to represent the information that occurs at the time of a transaction. To mine the types of nodes and edges, we use a heterogeneous network representation learning method to map the transaction network to a low-dimensional space. Finally, we improve the accuracy of the embedding results in the node classification task, which has important implications for Ethereum mining as well as identity recognition.},

The development of CSOs is often subject to very limited resources, and understanding its underlining principles is critical to maximizing the utility of available resources. Existing studies of CSOs are often empirical and adopt top-down methods of organizational management. This is partly because the inputs needed for such studies, for example, the interactions between community members, are often difficult to record. In this article, we perform an objective social network analysis on a real CSO with 2073 active members, with data collected over a five-year span on a mobile platform. Our study shows that the CSO members’ network has a low density and weak densification and is assortative and obvious in community structure. With a classification algorithm called SC-CEE, we observe that the development of the CSO can be robustly divided into stages. We further observe that the relationship between specific stimulus and community evolution varies across development stages, implying that an organization’s response strategy to change should be aligned with its stage of development. We then give practical guidance on the developmental priorities and response strategy of CSOs at different stages.},

The dynamics of learner behaviors in game are then addressed through the incorporation of learning mechanisms (i.e., reinforcement learning (RL) and random forest classification) into the Petri net model for knowledge reasoning and learning. Finally, an algorithm based on LAPN is proposed, aiming to guide learners to achieve a faster and better solution to problem-solving in game.

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing has become an important tool to collect data for various artificial intelligence applications, and auction can be an effective way to allocate work and determine reward in a crowdsourcing platform. In this article, we focus on the crowdsourcing of small tasks such as image labeling and voice recording, where we face a number of challenges. First, workers have different limits on the amount of work they would be willing to do, and they may also misreport these limits in their bid for the work. Second, if the auction is repeated over time, unsuccessful workers may dropout of the system, reducing competition and diversity. To tackle these issues, we first extend the results of the celebrated Myerson’s optimal auction mechanism for a single-parameter bid to the case where the bid consists of the unit cost of work, the maximum amount of work one is willing to do, and the actual work completed. We show that a simple payment mechanism is sufficient to ensure a dominant strategy from the workers, and that this dominant strategy is robust to the true utility function of the workers. Second, we propose a novel, flexible work allocation mechanism, which allows the requester to balance between cost efficiency and equality. While cost minimization is obviously important, encouraging equality in the allocation of work increases the diversity of the workforce as well as promotes a long-term participation on the crowdsourcing platform. Our main results are proved analytically and validated through simulations.},

  abstract     = {In mass crowdsourcing, a platform is used for task allocation. Large complex tasks may be assigned to teams directly. To ensure the rapid accomplishment of tasks, we need to assign a task to multiple teams, while a team is composed of at least one worker. On the other hand, in order to ensure the enthusiasm and income of workers, the platform allows one worker to participate in a limited number of teams. Thereby, a team may undertake multiple but limited tasks. It is obvious that task allocation needs to avoid each worker being overloaded as well as prevent information leakage, which is caused by a task assigned to different teams at the same time. Therefore, different teams being assigned to a certain task cannot include the same workers. Such a scenario forms a many-to-many (M2M) assignment problem [or group multirole assignment (GMRA)] under high-order cardinality (HC) constraints, while the platform wants to choose appropriate and excellent teams for all the tasks in a specific time window. In order to solve this problem, this article studies and formalizes the above problem by introducing HC and conflicting agents on roles (CAR) constraints to GMRA. The main contributions of this article include: 1) the first formalization of the team allocation problem (TAP) in crowdsourcing through extending GMRA and the creation of a composition matrix to express HC constraints of agents and conflict avoiding constraints; 2) theoretical proofs of the theorems of the formalized problem, such as a necessary and sufficient condition (NSC), which confines the solution space of the problem; and 3) a practice solution to the proposed problem based on the IBM ILOG CPLEX optimization package (CPLEX). All the proposed approaches are verified by simulation experiments, which demonstrates that the proposed approaches are efficient, feasible, and practicable.},

  abstract     = {Community partition is an important problem in many areas, such as biology networks and social networks. The objective of this problem is to analyze the relationships among data via the network topology. In this article, we consider the community partition problem under the independent cascade (IC) model in social networks. We formulate the problem as a combinatorial optimization problem that aims at partitioning a given social network into disjoint &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; communities. The objective is to maximize the sum of influence propagation of a social network through maximizing it within each community. The existing work shows that the influence maximization for community partition problem (IMCPP) is NP-hard. We first prove that the objective function of IMCPP under the IC model is neither submodular nor supermodular. Then, both supermodular upper bound and submodular lower bound are constructed and proved so that the sandwich framework can be applied. A continuous greedy algorithm and a discrete implementation are devised for upper and lower bound problems. The algorithm for both of the two problems gets a &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$1-1/e$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; approximation ratio. We also present a simple greedy algorithm to solve the original objective function and apply the sandwich approximation framework to it to guarantee a data-dependent approximation factor. Finally, our algorithms are evaluated on three real datasets, which clearly verifies the effectiveness of our method in the community partition problem, as well as the advantage of our method against the other methods.},

Alternatively, we use an agent-based model to simulate real cases and use counterfactual outcomes to evaluate the beneficial effect of social knowledge. We obtain the optimal solution (with the best matches), based on which we calculate and obtain the social knowledge matrix. Then, we add this matrix into simulations to infer social outcomes. It suggests that social safety has been enhanced substantially: the living chance of shooters has been reduced sharply; the civilian survival rate has been enhanced substantially; and the living chance of heroes themselves has been increased as well. Thus, social safety can be improved, and the effects can be evaluated by computational methods.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, social media platforms play a significant role in real-world events, which can cause both positive and negative effects. The popularity of image-based content on social media has been dramatically increased, which brings the problem that the quality of content is rather spotty. Therefore, automated techniques of identifying fake images have drawn significant attention. The traditional detection methods focus on the elements’ consistency of the image, which requires massive computing resources and huge datasets for pairs of real and fake images. Many studies on detecting rumors on social media showed that there are propagation patterns for the spreading of fake content that can be used as clues of detection. Thus, the proposed approach attempts to characterize the propagation patterns of fake images on social media using several user features and tweet features. The detection model applies recurrent neural networks to capture the variation of suggested features along the propagation path over time. The results of the experiment on a Weibo dataset of image tweets show that the model can achieve 89% accuracy in classifying fake images from real ones. Moreover, the model already reaches high performance as the detection deadline is smaller than 24 h, which demonstrates the strong capability of early detection. The positive outcomes indicate that the proposed detection model has great potential to be further developed to an automated technique that can be used in classifying real images from fake images posted on social media.},

  abstract     = {The ever-increasing web application programming interfaces (APIs) in various service-sharing communities (e.g., ProgrammableWeb.com and Mashape.com) have enabled software developers to quickly create their interested mashups conveniently and economically. However, the big volume of candidate web APIs and their differences often make it hard for software developers to discover a set of appropriate web APIs for mashup creation by considering API functions and API quality performances (e.g., popularity, compatibility, and diversity) simultaneously. These decrease the mashup development success rate and the mashup developers’ satisfaction significantly. In view of these challenges, a novel web APIs’ recommendation method named the popularity-aware and diverse method of web API compositions’ recommendation (PD-WACR) is proposed in this article. In concrete, we model web APIs’ functions, popularity, and compatibility with an API correlation graph. Afterward, correlation graph-based web APIs’ recommendation is performed with popularity and compatibility guarantee. Moreover, a top- &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; strategy is adopted in the recommendation process, so as to diversify the final recommended web APIs’ results. Finally, massive experiments are carried out on a real-world web API dataset crawled from ProgrammeableWeb.com. Experimental comparisons with related methods show the advantages and innovations of the proposed PD-WACR method.},

  abstract     = {Network alignment (NA) that identifies equivalent nodes across networks is an effective tool for integrating knowledge from multiple networks. The state-of-the-art NA methods learn inter-network node similarities based on labeled anchor links, which are costly, time-consuming, and difficult to acquire. Therefore, a few unsupervised network alignment (UNA) methods propose solving NA problems without anchor links. However, most existing UNA methods rely on discriminative attributes to capture nodes’ similarities and are hard to obtain optimal one-to-one alignments. Toward these issues, this article proposes a novel method named HackGAN to solve the UNA problem solely based on the structural information. Specifically, HackGAN represents nodes with embeddings based on an unsupervised graph neural network (GNN) to capture their global and local structural features. After that, it initializes mapping functions to transform the embedding spaces of different networks into the same vector space by iteratively solving the Wasserstein–Procrustes problem. The mapping functions are then refined by an adversarial model with cycle-consistency and Sinkhorn distance losses to obtain optimized one-to-one mappings. Based on the distances between mapped embeddings, accurate and robust results are obtained with a collective alignment algorithm. Experimental comparisons on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HackGAN.},

  abstract     = {Detecting driver inattentive behaviors is crucial for driving safety in a driver monitoring system (DMS). Recent works treat driver distraction detection as a multiclass action recognition problem or a binary anomaly detection problem. The former approach aims to classify a fixed set of action classes. Although specific distraction classes can be predicted, this approach is inflexible to detect unknown driver anomalies. The latter approach mixes all distraction actions into one class: anomalous driving. Because the objective focuses on finding the difference between safe and distracted driving, this approach has better generalization in detecting unknown driver distractions. However, a detailed classification of the distraction is missing from the predictions, meaning that the downstream DMS can only treat all distractions with the same severity. In this work, we propose a two-phase anomaly proposal and classification framework [driver anomaly detection and classification network (DADCNet)] robust for open-set anomalies while maintaining high-level distraction understanding. DADCNet makes efficient allocation of multimodal and multiview inputs. The anomaly proposal network first utilizes a subset of the available modalities and views to suggest suspicious anomalous driving behavior. Then, the classification network employs more features to verify the anomaly proposal and classify the proposed distraction action. Through extensive experiments in two driver distraction datasets, our approach significantly reduces the total amount of computation during inference time while maintaining high anomaly detection sensitivity and robust performance in classifying common driver distractions.},

The use of a digital signature is a common cryptographic technique for text authentication. Linguistic steganography can be applied to further conceal a digital signature within the corresponding text to facilitate data management. However, steganographic distortion lurking in the text, albeit almost imperceptible, has the potential to cause automatic computing machinery to make biased decisions. This has led to an interest in the pursuit of reversibility, the ability to reverse a steganographic process and remove distortion. In this article, we propose a reversible steganographic system for natural language text. We use a pre-trained transformer neural network for masked language modeling and embed messages in a reversible manner via predictive word substitution. Furthermore, we derive an adaptive steganographic route by taking account of predictive uncertainty, which is quantified based on a theoretical framework of Bayesian deep learning. Experimental results show that the proposed steganographic system can attain a proper balance between capacity, imperceptibility, and reversibility with close semantic and sentimental similarities between cover and stego texts.},

Therefore, we propose spatial-aware local community detection (SLCD), which finds the spatial-aware local community with only local information and defines the community based on the difference in terms of the sparseness of edges inside and outside the community. Specifically, to address the SLCD problem, we design a novel spatial aware local community detection algorithm based on dominance relation, but this algorithm incurs high cost. To further improve the efficiency, we propose a greedy algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed greedy algorithm outperforms the comparison algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In the last two years, the outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly affected human life, society, and the economy worldwide. To prevent people from contracting COVID-19 and mitigate its spread, it is crucial to timely distribute complete, accurate, and up-to-date information about the pandemic to the public. In this article, we propose a spatial–temporally bursty-aware method called STBA for real-time detection of COVID-19 events from Twitter. STBA has three consecutive stages. In the first stage, STBA identifies a set of keywords that represent COVID-19 events according to the spatiotemporally bursty characteristics of words using Ripley’s &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$K$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; function. STBA will also filter out tweets that do not contain the keywords to reduce the interference of noise tweets on event detection. In the second stage, STBA uses online density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise clustering to aggregate tweets that describe the same event as much as possible, which provides more information for event identification. In the third stage, STBA further utilizes the temporal bursty characteristic of event location information in the clusters to identify real-world COVID-19 events. Each stage of STBA can be regarded as a noise filter. It gradually filters out COVID-19-related events from noisy tweet streams. To evaluate the performance of STBA , we collected over 116 million Twitter posts from 36 consecutive days (from March 22, 2020 to April 26, 2020) and labeled 501 real events in this dataset. We compared STBA with three state-of-the-art methods, EvenTweet, event detection via microblog cliques (EDMC), and GeoBurst+ in the evaluation. The experimental results suggest that STBA outperforms GeoBurst+ by 13.8%, 12.7%, and 13.3% in terms of precision, recall, and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$F_{1}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; score.

  abstract     = {Is everyone on your team on the same page about the task? This is a question team leaders want to know. Herein, we take an approach that can help managers move the team in the right direction of team mental models (TMMs), individually held cognitive representations of task components that when similar and/or accurate can promote task success. We begin by defining the new concept of mental model shifts (MMSs) as the directional shift in each team member’s mental model, leading to an increase or decrease in convergence toward a shared or quality referent mental model. Next, we propose an algorithm that applies the concepts of Markov chains and vector geometry on communication patterns to predict future patterns and TMM convergence (i.e., sharedness and quality) levels. We base the model on a dataset of teams conducting the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) human exploration research analog (HERA) missions from which we draw communication attributes of MMS, process topic, and message purpose. We show that tasks can be modeled as vectors using the frequency of attribute patterns. Our initial experiments show that an accuracy of up to 86.21% can be achieved in predicting future communication patterns with data from real-world tasks. Furthermore, we validate the estimation of TMM sharedness, showing that the model results are comparable to sharedness ratings provided by subject matter experts with an average accuracy of 71.29%. Research and practical implications are discussed.},

Unfortunately, investigating approaches that emphasize the detection of such cross-communities has been understudied. Moreover, few current approaches may detect cross-communities but without regard for their granularities. To overcome this, we introduce a novel methodology that analyses the overlapping among social traits to detect the most granular cross-communities with multisocial traits. The methodology is implemented in a working system called CDBCD. It can detect the most granular multisocial traits cross-communities, to which an active user (i.e., a context user) belongs. Such cross-communities are detected and selected by the system if they exhibit evidence of multisocial traits’ homophily among their users. We propose novel context-driven search techniques that infer the relationships among various social traits. We evaluated CDBCD by comparing it with ten methods. The results demonstrated that CDBCD can detect granular cross-communities with marked accuracy. The improvement of CDBCD over the ten methods combined is 23% and 19% in terms of ARI and F1-score, respectively.},

First, we propose a strategy that saves a percentage of the contributions of each member of the ROSCA to reduce the impact of individuals who stop contributing to the association and study how this strategy impacts the financial life of the individuals and trust among community members. Second, we study a decentralized version of the ROSCA in which individuals contribute to more than one association and analyze the impact of the size of the cooperation scheme and the number of associations where each individual participates.

Recent studies have proposed several graph pooling operators to obtain graph-level representations from node representations. Nevertheless, they usually adopt a single strategy to evaluate the importance of nodes, which may generate node rankings with weak robustness. Also, they cannot capture the different substructures of a graph since they shrink the graph layer by layer. To solve the above problems, this article proposes a Multistructure graph classification method with Attention mechanism and Convolutional neural network (CNN), called MAC. In particular, we propose a novel pooling operator, which adopts multiple strategies to evaluate the importance of nodes and updates node representations through an attention mechanism. Also, we design a hierarchical architecture for MAC to capture multiple different substructures of a graph. To further reduce the loss of graph information, we utilize 2-D CNN to generate a graph-level representation. Comparative experiments are performed on public benchmark datasets deriving from social systems, and the experimental results indicate that our method outperforms a range of state-of-the-art graph classification methods.},

  abstract     = {Link prediction on dynamic networks has been extensively studied and widely applied in various applications. However, existing methods only consider either the network structure or the temporal information, ignoring the potentialities of using both types of information together to comprehend the complex behaviors of dynamic networks. Moreover, temporal unlink prediction, which also plays an important role in the evolution of social networks, has not been paid much attention. Accurately predicting the links and unlinks on the future network greatly contributes to the network analysis that uncovers more latent relations between nodes. In this work, we assume that there are two kinds of relations between nodes, namely, long-term relations and short-term relations, and we propose an effective algorithm called LULS for temporal link prediction and unlink prediction based on such relations. Specifically, for each snapshot of a dynamic network, LULS first collects higher order structures as two topological matrices by applying short random walks. Then, LULS initializes and optimizes a global matrix and a sequence of temporary matrices for all the snapshots by using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) based on the topological matrices, where the global matrix denotes long-term relations and the temporary matrices represent short-term relations of snapshots. Finally, LULS calculates the similarity matrix of the future snapshot and predicts the links and unlinks for the future network. In addition, we further improve the prediction results by using graph regularization constraints to enhance the global matrix, resulting in that the global matrix contains a wealth of topological information and temporal information. The conducted experiments on real-world networks illustrate that LULS outperforms other baselines for both link prediction and unlink prediction tasks.},

  abstract     = {Hashing has attracted widespread attention in the field of supervised cross-modal retrieval due to its advantages in search and storage. However, there are still some issues to be addressed, e.g.: 1) how to effectively combine sample and label semantics to learn hash codes; 2) how to reduce high computational requirements brought by computing a pairwise similarity matrix; and 3) how to effectively solve discrete optimization problems. To cope with them, a fast asymmetric and discrete cross-modal hashing (FADCH) method is proposed in this article. First, matrix factorization is leveraged to collaboratively construct a common semantic subspace between different modalities. Second, semantic consistency is preserved by aligning the common semantic subspace with the semantic representation constructed from labels, which effectively exploits the semantic complementarity of labels and samples. Third, we embed labels into hash codes and keep the correlation between different modal samples by using a pairwise similarity matrix. Fourth, we use an asymmetric strategy with relaxation to associate hash codes with semantic representation, which not only avoids the difficulty of symmetric frame optimization but also embeds more semantic information into the Hamming space. In addition, a strongly orthogonal constraint is introduced to optimize the hash codes. Finally, an effective optimization algorithm is developed to directly generate discrete hash codes while reducing the complexity from &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$O(n^{2})$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; to &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$O(n)$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; .

  abstract     = {Computation tree logic of knowledge (CTLK) can be used to specify many properties related to privacy of multiagent systems (MASs). Our previous work defined knowledge-oriented Petri nets (KPNs) to formally describe both the interacting/collaborating process of multiagents and their epistemic evolutions. Our KPN-based verification of CTLK required to obtain all reachable states, the transition relation of all states, and the equivalence relations of all states with respect to knowledge, which resulted in a serious state explosion problem and thus only fit some small-scale systems. This article adopts reduced ordered binary decision diagram (ROBDD) to deal with this problem. Especially, the ROBDD technique is used to encode and store all reachable states but not to encode and store any transition relation or equivalence relation. However, when verifying a CTLK formula, the transition relation and equivalence relation of some states must be known. To solve this problem, we design the related algorithms to compute only those required relations and prove their correctness. We design the related model checking algorithms and develop a tool. A number of experiments are done by using a famous benchmark about the privacy problem of MAS: the dining cryptographers protocol (DCP), and the results illustrate the advantages of our methods. For example, our tool running with a general PC spends less than 14 h to verify the DCP with 1200 cryptographers, which involves about 101080 states and two CTLK formulas with more than 6000 atomic propositions and more than 3600 operators. This represents a significant advance in the field of model checking.},

  abstract     = {Identification and categorization of social media posts generated during disasters are crucial to reduce the suffering of the affected people. However, the lack of labeled data is a significant bottleneck in learning an effective categorization system for a disaster. This motivates us to study the problem as unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) between a previous disaster with labeled data (source) and a current disaster (target). However, if the amount of labeled data available is limited, it restricts the learning capabilities of the model. To handle this challenge, we use limited labeled data along with abundantly available unlabeled data, generated during a source disaster to propose a novel two-part graph neural network (GNN). The first part extracts domain-agnostic global information by constructing a token-level graph across domains and the second part preserves local instance-level semantics. In our experiments, we show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by 2.74% weighted F1 score on average on two standard public datasets in the area of disaster management. We also report experimental results for granular actionable multilabel classification datasets in disaster domain for the first time, on which we outperform BERT by 3.00% on average w.r.t. weighted F1. Additionally, we show that our approach can retain performance when minimal labeled data are available.},

Therefore, each participant forms an independent private network, and they form a “ multiple private networks” regarding the original network. Existing methods only use the structure of private network itself to predict missing links, leading to underutilized information and deteriorated prediction accuracy. One natural question arises: how to integrate the information of multiple private networks by formulating a security protocol, so as to help each private network to better predict missing links in its own network without disclosing its structure to others. To this end, we propose an SMPC-LP method based on secure multiparty computation (SMPC) to solve this problem. The method fuses the information of each private network without disclosing their inputs, and then, the similarity score of each node pair is jointly calculated, achieving enhanced link prediction performance in each private network. The experimental results show that the SMPC-LP method can better predict the missing links than the methods only using the information of the one private network, without violating data privacy agreement.},

In this study, we propose a disinformation diffusion trend analysis and identification method, which uses social situation analytics and a multilevel attention network. First, we present a division and feature representation approach of social user circle based on the content sequence (internal driving factor) and social contextual information (external driving factor) of users associated with disinformation. Second, disinformation content feature, crowd response feature, and time-series feature are represented using embedding layer and bidirectional long short-term memory neural networks (Bi-LSTMs). We also present an attention mechanism model based on multifeature fusion, which can dynamically adjust the weight of each feature. On this foundation, the fused features are fed into the multilayer perceptron to identify the propagation quantity trend. According to the experimental results of real-world OSNs and social situation metadata, we conclude that while disinformation occurs across OSN platforms, the disinformation is more likely to spread widely in the original OSN platform. We also identify four typical disinformation propagation trends based on propagation patterns and propagation peak times. Findings from our experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach accurately identifies and predicts the diffusion trend of disinformation, which can then be used to inform mitigation strategy.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural network (GNN) has achieved great success on graph representation learning. Challenged by large-scale private data collected from user side, GNN may not be able to reflect the excellent performance, without rich features and complete adjacent relationships. Addressing the problem, vertical federated learning (VFL) is proposed to implement local data protection through training a global model collaboratively. Consequently, for graph-structured data, it is a natural idea to construct a GNN-based VFL (GVFL) framework. However, GNN has been proven vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Whether the vulnerability will be brought into the GVFL has not been studied. This is the first study of adversarial attacks on GVFL. A novel adversarial attack method is proposed, named Graph-Fraudster. It generates adversarial perturbations based on the noise-added global node embeddings via the privacy leakage and the gradient of pairwise node. Specifically, first, Graph-Fraudster steals the global node embeddings and sets up a shadow model of the server for the attack generator. Second, noise is added into node embeddings to confuse the shadow model. Finally, the gradient of pairwise node is used to generate attacks with the guidance of noise-added node embeddings. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that Graph-Fraudster achieves the state-of-the-art attack performance compared with baselines in different GNN based GVFLs. Furthermore, Graph-Fraudster can remain a threat to GVFL even if two possible defense mechanisms are applied. In addition, some suggestions are put forward for the future work to improve the robustness of GVFL. The code and datasets can be downloaded at https://github.com/hgh0545/Graph-Fraudster .},

  abstract     = {In recent years, we have witnessed increasing attention paid to the problem of cross-site user identification (CSUI) with the bloom of social media. Despite noticeable progress in this field, the problem of enormous computation posed by the full-scale pairwise comparison still remains unsolved, which constrains the real application of the state-of-the-art approaches, especially when the user number reaches tens of millions. To address this issue, we propose a novel trajectory-oriented method, which aims at incorporating the locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) technology into the strategy of approximate nearest neighbors searching. Specifically, we design an LSH function based on binary search (BLSH) for processing user trajectory easily, and by searching the BLSH buckets, we cluster similar users to avoid the onerous full-scale pairwise comparison. Moreover, a hierarchy of discrete attention is devised to further improve the effectiveness, which develops our method into the mature one, hierarchically attentioned binary-search-based LSH (HA-BLSH). Extensive experiments on ground-truth datasets demonstrate that our HA-BLSH outperforms the cutting-edge approaches on efficiency and effectiveness. The further discussion indicates that our method is also quite flexible and able to accommodate more scenarios.},

Based on the intuition that post contents of male and female users differ, we can predict the gender of the social media account holder via their corresponding posts. These posts can be multimodal (text + image) in nature. We investigate various emotion-assisted multimodal gender prediction models in this article. The developed models use gated recurrent units (GRUs) and ResNets for extracting features from the tweets and the images, respectively. The distribution of emotion categories is related to the gender of the target person. In response to these findings, this article describes the first attempt to use multimodal (image and text posted) information for gender prediction in a multitask setting with emotion recognition as an auxiliary task. The enriched PAN-2018 dataset with gender and emotion labels is used to train gender and emotion networks. Several models were developed to improve the gender prediction task by generating better emotion-aware features. The results show that the proposed multimodal emotion detection model outperforms single-modal (text and image)-based models and state-of-the-art systems on the benchmark PAN-2018 dataset.},

  abstract     = {Group emotion recognition (GER) from image has attracted much attention in recent years. Networks using attention mechanism for GER have shown great potential. However, the performance of the current attention-based GER networks suffers from the indistinctive features of individuals in the group, poor feature fusion weights, and the lack of semantic information of the objects in the image. We present a new framework that is composed of three networks, FacesNet, SceneNet, and ObjectsNet, to address these shortcomings. This new framework is designed to recognize group emotion by exploiting the information from the faces, scene, and objects in image. In FacesNet, we use contrastive learning to help the network extract distinctive emotion features and a new attention mechanism named self-fusion module to generate precise fusion weights for aggregation of individual facial features. We design SceneNet to capture the multiscale scene features to exploit the emotion cues from the scene. We construct a fully connected network named ObjectsNet to classify the semantic features of the objects. Finally, we linearly integrate the outputs of these three networks as the final output of this unique framework for GER. Experiment results on three datasets for GER show that our proposed framework achieved better performance in terms of recognition accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

However, detecting the critical nodes is a challenging nondeterministic polynomial time complete (NP-complete) problem. One possible solution is using the evolutionary algorithm which has a high global search capability. However, the existing evolutionary algorithms for CND only focus on independent nodes, ignoring the underlying relationship among the nodes. Thus, in this work, we proposed a new topology-combined differential evolution framework called TDE to explore the possibility of improving the performance by fusing topology information, which designs individual genotypes through node degree, and new mutation and decoding-based selection operators are designed for these genotypes to use topology information effectively. The experiments on synthetic and real networks show that it is feasible to improve the search capability of the algorithm by fusing node degree information.},

Disinformation via social media can easily mislead people’s beliefs toward or against an event that may mislead their behaviors based on the misbeliefs. The game theory approaches have been proposed under dynamic settings to limit the adverse influences of disinformation. It is a challenge to expand the users’ game strategies from the spreading decisions to the possible opinion updating choices. This work proposes a game-theoretic opinion framework that can formulate dynamic opinions by a belief model called Subjective Logic (SL) and provide opinion updates on five types of users’ interactions on OSN platforms. The opinions are updated based on user choices and user types through the game interactions among legitimate users, attackers, and a defender in an OSN. Via the extensive simulation experiments, the effectiveness of the opinion models of five decision-makers (DMs) is analyzed in terms of users believing or disbelieving disinformation in an epidemic model with parameter optimization. Our results show that while homophily-based DMs (H-DMs) introduce the highest opinion polarization, uncertainty-based DMs (U-DMs) can effectively filter untrustworthy users propagating disinformation.},

Recent studies have shown that this framework can significantly reduce the size and complexity of the initial system. In this sense, the smaller-scale replica can be used as an alternative or guidance to the original large-scale network. In this article, we extend the GR framework to the weighted network and prove that this framework can sustain the self-similarity of synthetic weighted networks and real-world weighted networks. Furthermore, we assign the corresponding weights to all edges of reconstructed human connectomes at five different resolutions, and the results show that topological features of these networks exhibit self-similar behaviors. Remarkably, our results also suggest that the GR transform group can generate a series of low-resolution replica networks that are similar to the initial highest-resolution human connectome networks, which greatly promotes the network science, neuroscience, and physics understanding of brain mechanisms, and is of great significance to the research of brain science. Finally, a typical spin-like model is used to further verify the rationality of this framework.},

Most current approaches employ attention-based neural methods to capture semantic relationships between aspects and words in one sentence. However, these methods ignore the fact that sentences with the same aspect and sentiment polarity often share the structure and semantic information in a domain, which leads to lower model performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose a heterogeneous aspect graph neural network (HAGNN) to learn the structure and semantic knowledge from intersentence relationships. Our model is a heterogeneous graph neural network since it contains three different kinds of nodes: word nodes, aspect nodes, and sentence nodes. These nodes can pass structure and semantic information between each other and update their embeddings to improve the performance of our model. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use a heterogeneous graph to capture relationships between sentences and aspects. The experimental results on five public datasets show the effectiveness of our model outperforming some state-of-the-art models.},

Three mathematical characteristics of tonal music melody are found based on music composition theory.

Three other typical power-law models in economics, linguistics/informatics, and design of complex engineering systems are reviewed, and their goal orientation behaviors are analyzed. It is found that the models quantifying different social behaviors with goal orientation are consistent with the unified model. The power law is actually the result of the well-known social distribution mechanisms with limited resources, such as the maximal wealth with limited economic capability, the minimal cost under constrained resources, and the maximal entropy with restrictions.

This study proposes a novel sing-link end-to-end spatio-temporal demographic network (SSTD) that fuses spatial, temporal, and demographic information for electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition. In the SSTD model, an adaptive time window using single-link hierarchical clustering based on Riemannian metrics was realized for data preprocessing to solve the problem of individual differences. Then, the preprocessed EEG data acted as a gate recurrent unit (GRU) network input to calculate high-level time-domain features. At the same time, the EEG covariance matrices were fed into the symmetric positive definite matrix network (SPDNet) to calculate high-level spatial features. Given the correlation between EEG signals and individual demographic information, gender and age factors were integrated into the spatio-temporal model, resulting in more effective high-level features for EEG-based emotion recognition. Finally, extensive comparative experiments were conducted on two public datasets: DEAP and DREAMER. The average accuracy of valence and arousal on the DEAP dataset are 68.28% and 71.48%, respectively. The average accuracy of valence and arousal on the DREAMER dataset are 76.81% and 81.64%, respectively. Experimental results show that the SSTD model has an excellent recognition performance.},

  abstract     = {In view that the K-shell decomposition method can only effectively identify a single most influential node, but cannot accurately identify a group of most influential nodes, this article proposes a hybrid method based on K-shell decomposition to identify the most influential spreaders in complex networks. First, the K-shell decomposition method is used to decompose the network, and the network is regarded as a hierarchical structure from the inner core to the periphery core. Second, the existing centrality methods such as H-index are used as the secondary score of the proposed method to select nodes in each hierarchy of the network. In addition, for the sake of alleviating the overlapping problem, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method is introduced to calculate the comprehensive score of secondary score and overlapping range, and the node with the highest comprehensive score will be selected in each round. The proposed algorithm can be used as a general framework to improve the existing centrality method which can represent nodes with definite values of centrality. Experimental results show that in the susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) model experiment, compared with the benchmark methods, the infection scale of the proposed K-TOPSIS method in nine real networks is improved by 1.15%, 2.23%, 1.95%, 3.12%, 6.29%, −0.37%, 4.01%, 0.48%, and 0.48%, respectively.

  abstract     = {#StopAsianHate and #StopAAPIHate are two of the most commonly used hashtags that represent the current movement to end hate crimes against the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. We conduct a social media study of public opinion toward the #StopAsianHate and #StopAAPIHate movement based on 46 058 Twitter users across 30 states in USA ranging from March 18, 2021 to April 11, 2021. To facilitate fine-grained analyses, the demographic information of the Twitter users, including age, gender, race/ethnicity, social capital, political affiliation, geolocation, family, income, and religious status, is either retrieved from the user profiles or inferred using classifiers. We find that the movement attracts more participation from women, younger adults, Asian, and Black communities. It is noteworthy that most of them are also active in other online movements related to racial or social issues, such as #BlackLivesMatter or #SayHerName; 51.56% of the Twitter users show direct support, 18.38% are news about anti-Asian hate crimes, and 5.43% show a negative attitude toward the movement. By conducting logistic regression, we find that the public opinion varies across user characteristics. Furthermore, among the states with most racial bias-motivated hate crimes, the negative attitude toward the #StopAsianHate and #StopAAPIHate movement is the weakest. The majority of the top influencers are Asian–American reporters, journalists, or politicians. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale social media-based study to understand public opinion toward the #StopAsianHate and #StopAAPIHate movement. We hope that our study can provide insights and promote research on anti-Asian hate crimes and ultimately help address such a serious societal issue for the common benefits of all communities.},

  abstract     = {Social media are extensively used in today’s world, and facilitate quick and easy sharing of information, which makes them a good way to advertise products. Influencers of a social media network, owing to their massive popularity, provide a huge potential customer base. However, it is not straightforward to decide which influencers should be selected for an advertising campaign that can generate high returns with low investment. In this work, we present an agent-based model (ABM) that can simulate the dynamics of influencer advertising campaigns in a variety of scenarios and can help discover the best influencer marketing strategy. Our system is a probabilistic graph-based model that provides the additional advantage to incorporate real-world factors such as customers’ interest in a product, customer behavior, the willingness to pay, a brand’s investment cap, influencers’ engagement with influence diffusion, and the nature of the product being advertised, viz. luxury and non-luxury. Using customer acquisition cost and conversion ratio as a unit economic, we evaluate the performance of different kinds of influencers under a variety of circumstances that are simulated by varying the nature of the product and the customers’ interest. Our results exemplify the circumstance-dependent nature of influencer marketing and provide insights into which kinds of influencers would be a better strategy under respective circumstances. For instance, we show that as the nature of the product varies from luxury to non-luxury, the performance of celebrities declines, whereas the performance of nano-influencers improves. In terms of the customers’ interest, we find that the performance of nano-influencers declines with the decrease in customers’ interest, whereas the performance of celebrities improves.},

  abstract     = {Label propagation-based overlapping community detection algorithms have been widely used in complex networks due to their simplicity and efficiency. However, such algorithms need to randomly choose neighbor nodes and do not fully take the network’s topology into consideration, resulting in low stability and accuracy. Aiming at this problem, we propose an overlapping community detection approach based on DeepWalk and the improved label propagation. We first use the DeepWalk model to learn the network’s topology to obtain low-dimensional vector representations that reflect the spatial location of nodes and construct the weight matrix through vector dot product operation. Then, we design a label propagation algorithm with a preference selection strategy, which can obtain stable overlapping communities by exchanging information with fixed neighbors on the basis of preserving the nodes’ own labels. The experimental results on the real network and synthetic datasets show that the proposed approach has better accuracy and stability than the baseline methods.},

To address the above issues, this article proposes an evolutionary framework to automatically optimize guardrail layouts in subway stations. In the proposed framework, a novel guardrail layout encoding method is proposed, which can facilitate the algorithm to generate regular guardrail layout design solutions. Furthermore, a new fitness evaluation function is proposed to effectively measure the quality of a given guardrail layout design strategy. To validate its effectiveness, the proposed framework is applied to two scenarios with different characteristics. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed framework can provide promising guardrail layout designs, which can alleviate the congestion of subway stations effectively.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the dynamics of competition among organizations with unequal expertise. Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been used to simulate and understand the impact of various incentive schemes designed to offset such inequality. We design Touch-Mark, a game based on well-known multiagent particle environment, where two teams (weak and strong) with unequal but changing skill levels compete against each other. For training such a game, we propose a novel controller-assisted MARL algorithm C-MADDPG, which empowers each agent with an ensemble of policies along with a supervised controller that by selectively partitioning the sample space and triggers intelligent role division among the teammates. Using C-MADDPG as an underlying framework, we propose an incentive scheme for the weak team such that the final rewards of both teams become the same. We find that despite the incentive, the final reward of the weak team falls short of the strong team. On inspecting, we realize that an overall incentive scheme for the weak team does not incentivize the weaker agents within that team to learn and improve. To offset this, we now specially incentivize the weaker player to learn and, as a result, observe that the weak team beyond an initial phase performs at par with the stronger team. The final goal of this article has been to formulate a dynamic incentive scheme that continuously balances the reward of the two teams. This is achieved by devising an incentive scheme enriched with an RL agent, which takes minimum information from the environment.},

The recent outbreak of COVID-19, U.S.–China trade friction, and three historical financial turbulences are involved to distinguish the changes in the spillover in these distinct crises, which has seldom been unveiled in the literature. By considering that the stock volatility spillover may vary over distinct timescales, the spillovers are disclosed through innovatively constructing the multi-scale spillover networks, followed by connectedness computation, based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and generalized vector autoregression (GVAR) process. Our empirical analysis first demonstrates the different levels of increases in the total sectoral volatility spillover and changes in the roles of the sectors in the system under the aforementioned crises. Besides, the increases in the sectoral spillover in the long-term are verified to negatively impact the macroeconomy and can thereby act as warning signals.},

Existing studies on person–job fit usually focus on the representation learning of textual data in jobs and resumes. Person–job fit is a highly nonlinear complex problem that is affected by several fields of features. We assume that it would bring benefits to comprehensively consider the numerical features, categorical features, and textual features of resumes and jobs. To this end, we propose a novel model based on the self-attention mechanism, named MUlti-Field Features representation and INteraction (MUFFIN) learning for person–job fit. The key idea is to explore meaningful feature representations and interactions. Specifically, we group all the features of resumes and jobs into several fields. And a module is introduced to learn the hidden vectors of feature correlations in each feature field. Along this line, we propose a module with the multi-head self-attention mechanism and a residual connection to further model the feature field interactions. Moreover, we utilize a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to measure the matching score between a resume and a job. Finally, the experimental results on a real-world dataset validate the effectiveness of MUFFIN for person–job fit.},

During the outburst period, the paucity of knowledge and research aggravated devastating panic and fears that lead to social stigma and created serious obstacles to contain the disastrous epidemic. We propose a deep learning-based method to detect stigmatized contents on online social network (OSN) platforms in the early stage of COVID-19. Our method performs a semantic-based quantitative analysis to unveil essential spatial-temporal characteristics of COVID-19 stigmatization for timely alerts and risk mitigation. Empirical evaluations are carried out to examine our method’s predictive utilities. The visualization results of the co-occurrence network using Gephi indicate two distinct groups of stigmatized words that pertain to people in Wuhan and their dietary behaviors, respectively. Netizens’ participations and stigmatizations in the Hubei region, where the COVID-19 broke out, are twice ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$p &amp;lt; 0.05$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ) and four ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$p &amp;lt; 0.01$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ) times more frequent and intense than those in other parts of China, respectively.

  abstract     = {When user-centric location privacy protections are used by the public (e.g., published as a mobile application to Mac app store), they are found to be vulnerable to a novel kind of potential inference attacks. These attacks can utilize the open-use protection’s input–output pairs to closely study the protection’s structure and mechanism. We name this kind of attacks as knowing-and-learning (KL) attacks. Targeted at such potential but threatening deep learning-based KL attacks in local search services, we propose a novel location privacy protection framework LPP2KL. LPP2KL aims to generate an obfuscated location, which is robust to the aforementioned attacks, so that the user’s current location (real) can be replaced by the generated location (pseudo) when submitted to the untrusted search server. To achieve this, we first depict a feasible net structure to implement the deep KL attack and verify its power with extensive experiments. Second, to simulate the attack-and-defense process, we develop a novel network structure with an adversary net and a protection net. These nets play a mini–max game toward privacy inference in an adversarial manner until an equilibrium is reached. Meanwhile, the protection net also achieves the balance between preserved privacy and quality of service through utility-constrained privacy optimization. We introduce a novel penalty function to handle the utility-constrained privacy optimization problem. Extensive experiments are conducted on Yelp and FoursSwarm datasets, which validate the generality of our proposed LPP2KL in protection handling and illustrate its effectiveness in utility control under the acceptable quality of service.},

The recognition of the above three couples of learning states was regarded as five binary classification problems. We collected electrocardiogram (ECG) data from 45 college students during their classes of circuit analysis and calculated the peaks of two consecutive R waves (RR) interval series from the ECG data. For each binary classification problem, RR interval features and classifiers were compared to find the critical feature subsets and suitable classifiers for the recognition of learning states. The generalization accuracies of the machine learning models were in the range of 58.41%–82.35% on the validation sets independent of classifier training and feature selection.

The contribution of this study will be capitalized as recommendations to the company, based on monitoring in real-time their customers’ satisfaction on Twitter and from questionnaire analysis. It is the first work to evaluate customers’ satisfaction with telecommunications (telecom) company in Saudi Arabia by using both social media mining and a quantitative method. It has been built by a corpus of Arabic tweets, using a Python script searching for real-time tweets that mention Telecom company using the hashtags to monitor the latest sentiments of Telecom customers continuously. The subset is 20 000 tweets that are randomly selected from the dataset, for training the machine- classifier. In addition, we have done the experimented using deep learning network. The results show that the satisfaction for each service ranges between 31.50% and 49.25%. One of the proposed recommendations is using 5G to solve the “internet speed” problem, which showed the lowest customer satisfaction, with 31.50%.This article’s main contributions are defining the traceable measurable criteria for customer satisfaction with telecom companies in Saudi Arabia and providing telecom companies’ recommendations based on monitoring real-time customers’ satisfaction through Twitter.},

  abstract     = {Proximity detection is one of the most popular location-based applications in social networks when users intend to find their nearby friends. However, the existing proximity detection has access to precise and real-time location information of users, raising serious privacy concerns for millions of users. A number of privacy-preserving models have taken shape over the past decade, but they almost universally rely on syntactic privacy models such as &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -anonymity and location perturbation, which are proved to waver in the balance of privacy and availability requirements. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel location privacy-preserving mechanism for proximity detection to support user-defined range queries while guaranteeing a certain level of privacy. It divides the proximity detection service into two independent subservices and ensures that each subservice provider can only access part of the user’s location information, which is encoded by Geohash and divided into two parts (i.e., prefix and suffix). By adjusting the length of location encoding, we can make a good trade-off between accuracy and system overhead. The privacy requirements of users are not implicated in the quality of service, and it achieves the balance of privacy and utility. The analysis results through an extensive simulation indicate that our scheme successfully ensures that neither each server in the system nor an external attacker can obtain the real location of the user. Moreover, it demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Group role assignment with cooperation and conflict factors (GRACCFs) is a creative social computing method for team establishment. It can maximize the new team’s performance through role assignment considering potential cooperation or conflict factors among agents. However, this method has two bottlenecks in practical applications. First, in the scenario of establishing a new team from several existing teams, collecting the pertinent cooperation or conflict information encounters challenges. Second, GRACCF merely takes the CCFs as a part of the objective function for team performance, but this will underestimate the CCFs’ impacts on the sustainable development of the team. This article tackles these issues by extending GRACCF from a new viewpoint. It first designs a KD45 logic algorithm based on the KD45 logic system, which can discover the implicit cognitive CCFs through logical inferences with closure calculations. Then, it proposes an original team evaluation method that can help decision-makers determine the weights of team performance and CCFs’ impacts based on their demands. Large-scale simulation experiments indicate that the proposed solution is practicable and robust. The proposed method provides a solid decision-making reference for administrators when establishing a sustainable team.},

Experimental results and performance comparison show that the DPSGO algorithm has a better searchability and convergence rate. In addition, aiming at the socially hot issue of aviation safety, the simulation and experimental results show that the temperature measurement error can be reduced to less than 7.5 °C by using the DPSGO algorithm combined with reflected radiation correction to process the aeroengine multispectral radiation temperature measurement data.

  abstract     = {Deceptive reviews on social media and e-commerce websites are inflammatory and will significantly affect the judgment and purchase behavior of other users. At present, many researchers build models based on single text features to detect deceptive reviews. However, deceptive reviewers will deliberately imitate the text style of true reviews when writing reviews. At this time, these methods based on text features are not necessarily effective. What’s more, detection performance is limited because the category distribution is likely to be unbalanced in practice. In this work, to address these shortcomings, a deceptive review detection method based on multidimensional feature construction and ensemble feature selection is proposed. Our proposal constructs 3-D features including text feature, reviewer behavior feature, and deceptive score feature. In addition, to alleviate the impact of unbalanced category distribution, a data resampling algorithm is applied which incorporates random under-sampling (RUS) and Borderline-SMOTE algorithm. Furthermore, we integrate the results of different feature selection based on the Chi-square test, Information gain, and XGBoost feature importance. Our method addresses the limitation of single dimension features and can provide useful detection. Experimental results area under the curve (AUC, Macro Average Precision, and weighted F1-score) show that the proposed method performs well in the task of deceptive review detection on two Amazon datasets. Compared with other advanced methods, our method achieves additional performance gains in the case of poor text quality and datasets with unbalanced category distribution.},

We propose a social network event storage management method based on microblog text clustering and hot/cold data classification. First, for the microblog text data, we construct a keyword provenance graph by using the information entropy to measure the weight of the edge between keyword nodes. Then, we cluster the events using the provenance-based community partition (PCP) with local modularity to improve the event clustering accuracy. In addition, we can further filter noisy data via incremental clustering, enable hot/cold event data classification and dynamic migration, and compress cold data to save space on a hybrid storage architecture. The experimental results show that the clustering purity can reach more than 93% and the query time can be reduced by more than 70% using clustering and hybrid storage policy.},

  abstract     = {Contact-tracing smartphone applications have been developed and used as a complement to manual contact tracing in the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of these apps is to trace contacts between people and notify the mobile phone owners when one of their contacts tested positive. People who receive a notification should behave as exposed people, take a test, and possibly isolate themselves until they receive the result. Unfortunately, identifying contacts based on distance is technically a daunting task: apps can be configured conservatively (a very small number of people are notified, limiting the effectiveness of the app) or they may be more tolerant and produce a high number of notifications but also of false positives. We review the data available from Immuni, the Italian app, which provides detailed figures on the notifications sent and the positive users, and we show that Immuni was configured to generate a very large amount of notifications. We estimate the testing resources that the health system would have needed if the app was downloaded by 100% of the adult population, and every notified person would require a test. In such conditions, Immuni would have generated a number of tests orders of magnitude higher than what was available. We compare the performance of Immuni with the currently available literature on other apps and observe that contact-tracing apps had a limited impact on the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. As contact tracing exposes citizens to privacy risks, we discuss some ways to reshape the goal of the apps to achieve a better tradeoff between social benefit and risk.},

  abstract     = {Graph convolution networks (GCNs), with their efficient ability to capture high-order connectivity in graphs, have been widely applied in recommender systems. Stacking multiple neighbor aggregation is the major operation in GCNs. It implicitly captures popularity features because the number of neighbor nodes reflects the popularity of a node. However, existing GCN-based methods ignore a universal problem: users’ sensitivity to item popularity is differentiated, but the neighbor aggregations in GCNs actually fix this sensitivity through graph Laplacian normalization, leading to suboptimal personalization. In this work, we propose to model multigrained popularity features and jointly learn them together with high-order connectivity to match the differentiation of user preferences exhibited in popularity features. Specifically, we develop a Joint Multigrained Popularity-aware Graph Convolution Collaborative Filtering model, short for JMP-GCF, which uses a popularity-aware embedding generation to construct multigrained popularity features and uses the idea of joint learning to capture the signals within and between different granularities of popularity features that are relevant for modeling user preferences. In addition, we propose a multistage stacked training strategy to speed up model convergence. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets to show the state-of-the-art performance of JMP-GCF. The complete codes of JMP-GCF are released at https://github.com/hfutmars/JMP-GCF .},

  abstract     = {As a new and effective technology, network function virtualization (NFV) manages network nodes to improve service performance for the next-generation network. Despite its promised effectiveness, efficiently deploying the functions to different consumers is the major difficulty presented in NFV. In this article, the multiple-Walrasian auction graphic model combined with virtual network functions of different bundled tree nodes based on Vickrey–Clarke–Grove (VCG) payment is proposed to maximize the social effectiveness of NFV. It is the first work to define the virtualized service as a tree valuation in the NFV market. To solve this problem, novel algorithms, including the valuation structure algorithm and auction strategy, are implemented along with the NFV to schedule network resources. With all theories considered, we conducted a comprehensive simulation to verify the tree valuation mechanism. The results confirmed that the tree valuation mechanism outperforms the backpack auction model and reserve auction model with respect to social welfare.},

  abstract     = {Being able to recommend links between users in online social networks is important for users to connect with like-minded individuals as well as for the platforms themselves and third parties leveraging social media information to grow their business. Predictions are typically based on unsupervised or supervised learning, often leveraging simple yet effective graph topological information, such as the number of common neighbors. However, we argue that richer information about personal social structure of individuals might lead to better predictions. In this article, we propose to leverage well-established social cognitive theories to improve link prediction performance. According to these theories, individuals arrange their social relationships along, on average, five concentric circles of decreasing intimacy. We postulate that relationships in different circles have different importance in predicting new links. To validate this claim, we focus on popular feature extraction prediction algorithms (both unsupervised and supervised) and we extend them to include social circles’ awareness. We validate the prediction performance of these circle-aware algorithms against several benchmarks (including their baseline versions as well as node-embedding- and graph neural network (GNN)-based link prediction), leveraging two Twitter datasets comprising a community of video gamers and generic users. We show that social awareness generally provides significant improvements in prediction performance, beating also state-of-the-art solutions such as node2vec and learning from Subgraphs, Embeddings and Attributes for Link prediction (SEAL), and without increasing the computational complexity. Finally, we show that social awareness can be used in place of using a classifier (which may be costly or impractical) for targeting a specific category of users.},

  abstract     = {The World Bank estimates that the number of refugees worldwide will reach 140 million by 2050 due to global warming and local wars. Considering the rapid increase in the number of refugees, an efficient and feasible assignment method is required for refugee resettlement. This article formalizes the refugee resettlement issue using the Environments-Classes, Agents, Roles, Groups, and Objects (E-CARGO) model. A novel solution is designed for Refugee reSettling (RS) by extending the Group MultiRole Assignment (GMRA), which applies the agent stability evaluation method as a feedback mechanism while optimally resettling refugees. With this proposed solution, decision-makers can swiftly resettle refugees from multiple suffering countries while appropriately ensuring host countries’ benefit. Finally, large-scale simulation experiments based on the Python PuLP platform are carried out to demonstrate the practicability and robustness of the proposed solution. The simulation results provide a solid decision-making reference for the leaders of the world.},

  abstract     = {This study focuses on a topology identification problem of weighted networks with different connection strength, where binary time series generated by propagation dynamics are utilized. An influence probability matrix reflecting the weight of connection is proposed to quantify the influence of other nodes on one node as it transfers from susceptible state to infected state. Further, maximum likelihood estimate and expectation–maximization algorithm are used to obtain the influence probability matrix. A threshold method and a weight-based-identification algorithm are provided to identify connection strength. The robustness against fault data and conflicting results of the same connection is mitigated by introducing a confidence factor. Several Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate the high identification accuracy of our methods under different network models.},

  abstract     = {The world is facing a new era in which social media communication plays a fundamental role in people’s lives. Along with proven benefits, several collateral drawbacks have risen, one being the widespread of false information with malicious intents, oftentimes using anonymous or false identities. Fighting this problem is challenging, especially when considering the nature of text messages involved on social media platforms: a sea of small messages and a myriad of users. Attributing the authorship of such messages is an ambitious endeavor; nevertheless, it is a way to fight this undesired disinformation scenario. In this work, we tackle the problem of authorship attribution of tiny messages, but, different from what has been done with longer texts, we rely upon data-driven approaches, avoiding handcraft features and harnessing recent advances of deep neural networks in the field of pattern recognition. By modeling small texts employed in social media as unidimensional signals, we propose a deep learning model to project these messages onto a manifold suitable for the task of authorship attribution. We provide two state-of-the-art solutions tailored for different setups and strategies for the scenario of authorship verification. These advances were possible, thanks to three additional contributions: an updated dataset based on the Twitter® platform, new sanitization techniques to improve the quality of the training data, and novel visual analytics techniques to help the development of authorship attribution solutions.},
