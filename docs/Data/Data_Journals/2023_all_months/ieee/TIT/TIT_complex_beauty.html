  abstract     = {The problem of sequential anomaly detection is considered, where multiple data sources are monitored in real time and the goal is to identify the “anomalous” ones among them, when it is not possible to sample all sources at all times. A detection scheme in this context requires specifying not only when to stop sampling and which sources to identify as anomalous upon stopping, but also which sources to sample at each time instance until stopping. A novel formulation for this problem is proposed, in which the number of anomalous sources is not necessarily known in advance and the number of sampled sources per time instance is not necessarily fixed. Instead, an arbitrary lower bound and an arbitrary upper bound are assumed on the number of anomalous sources, and the fraction of the expected number of samples over the expected time until stopping is required to not exceed an arbitrary, user-specified level. In addition to this sampling constraint, the probabilities of at least one false alarm and at least one missed detection are controlled below user-specified tolerance levels. A general criterion is established for a policy to achieve the minimum expected time until stopping to a first-order asymptotic approximation as the two familywise error rates go to zero. Moreover, the asymptotic optimality is established of a family of policies that sample each source at each time instance with a probability that depends on past observations only through the current estimate of the subset of anomalous sources. This family includes, in particular, a novel policy that requires minimal computation under any setup of the problem.},

  abstract     = {A key metric to express the timeliness of status updates in latency-sensitive networked systems is the age of information (AoI), i.e., the time elapsed since the generation of the last received informative status message. This metric allows studying a number of applications including updates of sensory and control information in cyber-physical systems and vehicular networks as well as, job and resource allocation in cloud clusters. State-of-the-art approaches to analyzing the AoI rely on queueing models that are composed of one or many queuing systems endowed with service order, e.g., FIFO, LIFO, or last-generated-first-out order. A major difficulty arising in these analysis methods is capturing the AoI under message reordering when the delivery is non-preemptive and non-FIFO, i.e., when messages can overtake each other and the reception of informative messages may obsolete some messages that are underway. In this paper, we derive an exact formulation for the distribution of AoI in non-preemptive, non-FIFO systems where the main ingredients of our analysis are Palm calculus and time inversion. Owing to the rationality of the Laplace-Stieltjes transforms that are used in our approach, we obtain computable exact expressions for the distribution of AoI.},

  abstract     = {Random K-out graphs are receiving attention as a model to construct sparse yet well-connected topologies in distributed systems including sensor networks, federated learning, and cryptocurrency networks. In response to the growing heterogeneity in emerging real-world networks, where nodes differ in resources and requirements, inhomogeneous random K-out graphs were proposed recently. In this model, first, each of the $n$ nodes is classified as type-1 (respectively, type-2) with probability $\mu $ (respectively, $1-\mu$ ) independently from the others, where $0 &amp;lt; \mu &amp;lt; 1$ . Next, each type-1 (respectively, type-2) node draws 1 arc towards a node (respectively, $K_{n}$ arcs towards $K_{n}$ distinct nodes) selected uniformly at random. The orientation of the arcs is ignored yielding the inhomogeneous random K-out graph, denoted by $\mathbb {H}(n;\mu,K_{n})$ . It was recently established that $\mathbb {H}(n;\mu,K_{n})$ is connected with high probability (whp) if and only if $K_{n}=\omega (1)$ . Motivated by practical settings where establishing links is costly and only a bounded choice of $K_{n}$ is feasible ( $K_{n} = O(1)$ ), we study the size of the largest connected sub-network of $\mathbb {H}(n;\mu,K_{n})$ . We first show that the trivial condition of $K_{n} \geq 2$ for all $n$ is sufficient to ensure that $\mathbb {H}(n;\mu,K_{n})$ contains a giant component of size $n-O(1)$ whp. Next, to model settings where nodes can fail or get compromised, we investigate the size of the largest connected sub-network in $\mathbb {H}(n;\mu,K_{n})$ when $d_{n}$ nodes are selected uniformly at random and removed from the network. We show that if $d_{n}=O(1)$ , a giant component of size $n- {O}(1)$ persists for all $K_{n} \geq 2$ whp. Further, when $d_{n}=o(n)$ nodes are removed from $\mathbb {H}(n;\mu,K_{n})$ , the remaining nodes contain a giant component of size $n(1-o(1))$ whp for all $K_{n} \geq 2$ . We present numerical results to demonstrate the size of the largest connected component when the number of nodes is finite.},

Pointwise maximal leakage is a robust and operationally meaningful privacy measure that captures the largest amount of information leaking about $X$ to adversaries seeking to guess arbitrary (possibly randomized) functions of $X$ , or equivalently, aiming to maximize arbitrary gain functions. We study several properties of pointwise maximal leakage, e.g., how it composes over multiple outcomes, how it is affected by pre- and post-processing, etc. Furthermore, we propose to view information leakage as a random variable which, in turn, allows us to regard privacy guarantees as requirements imposed on different statistical properties of the information leakage random variable. We define several privacy guarantees and study how they behave under pre-processing, post-processing and composition. Finally, we examine the relationship between pointwise maximal leakage and other privacy notions such as local differential privacy, local information privacy, $f$ -information, and so on. Overall, our paper constructs a robust and flexible framework for privacy risk assessment whose central notion has a strong operational meaning which can be adapted to a variety of applications and practical scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we explore the connection between secret key agreement and secure omniscience within the setting of the multiterminal source model with an eavesdropper having side information. While the secret key agreement problem considers the generation of a maximum-rate secret key through public discussion, the secure omniscience problem is concerned with communication protocols for omniscience that minimize the rate of information leakage to the eavesdropper. The starting point of our work is a lower bound on the minimum leakage rate for omniscience, $R_{ \text {L}}$ , in terms of the wiretap secret key capacity, $C_{ \text {W}}$ . Our interest is in identifying broad classes of sources for which this lower bound is met with equality, in which case we say that there is a duality between secure omniscience and secret key agreement. We show that this duality holds in the case of certain finite linear source (FLS) models, such as two-terminal FLS models and pairwise independent network models on trees with a linear eavesdropper. Duality also holds for any FLS model in which $C_{ \text {W}}$ is achieved by a perfect linear secret key agreement scheme. We conjecture that the duality in fact holds unconditionally for any FLS model. On the negative side, we give an example of a (non-FLS) source model for which duality does not hold if we limit ourselves to communication-for-omniscience protocols with at most two (interactive) communications. We also address the secure function computation problem and explore the connection between the minimum leakage rate for computing a function and the wiretap secret key capacity.},

  abstract     = {Unlike the classical linear model, nonlinear generative models have been addressed sparsely in the literature of statistical learning. This work aims to shed light on these models and their secrecy potential. To this end, we invoke the replica method to derive the asymptotic normalized cross entropy in an inverse probability problem whose generative model is described by a Gaussian random field with a generic covariance function. Our derivations further demonstrate the asymptotic statistical decoupling of the Bayesian estimator and specify the decoupled setting for a given nonlinear model. The replica solution depicts that strictly nonlinear models establish an all-or-nothing phase transition: there exists a critical load at which the optimal Bayesian inference changes from perfect to an uncorrelated learning. Based on this finding, we design a new secure coding scheme which achieves the secrecy capacity of the wiretap channel. This interesting result implies that strictly nonlinear generative models are perfectly secured without any secure coding. We justify this latter statement through the analysis of an illustrative model for perfectly secure and reliable inference.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the procedure of semi-parametric maximum likelihood estimation under constraints on summary statistics. Such a procedure results in a discrete probability distribution supported on the data points that maximizes the likelihood among all distributions supported on the data points satisfying the specified constraints (called estimating equations). The resultant distribution is an approximation of the underlying population distribution. The study of such empirical likelihood estimation originates from the seminal work of Owen (1998 and 2001). We investigate this procedure in the setting of misspecified (or biased) constraints, i.e., when the null hypothesis is not true. We establish that the behavior of the optimal weight distribution under such misspecification differ markedly from their properties under the null, i.e., when the estimating equations are correctly specified (or unbiased). This is manifested by certain “singularities” in the optimal distribution, that are not observed under the null. Furthermore, we establish an anomalous behavior of the log-likelihood based Wilks’ statistic, which, unlike under the null, does not exhibit a chi-squared limit. In the Bayesian setting, we establish the posterior consistency of procedures based on these ideas, where instead of a parametric likelihood, an empirical likelihood is used to define the posterior distribution. In particular, we show that this posterior, as a random probability measure, rapidly converges, with explicit convergence guarantees, to the delta measure at the true parameter value. We also illustrate implications of our results in diverse settings such as degeneracies in exponential random graph models (ERGM) for random networks (Chatterjee and Diaconis, 2013, and Mukherjee, 2020), empirical procedures where the constraints are themselves estimated from data (Hjort, 2009), and to approximate Bayesian computation based procedures (Chaudhuri et al., 2020). A novel feature of our work is to connect the likelihood maximization problem to critical points of random polynomials. This yields the mass of the singular weight in the optimal weight distribution as the leading term in a canonical expansion of a critical point of a random polynomial. Our work unveils the possibility that similar random polynomial based techniques could be effective in analyzing a wide class of problems in related areas.},

  abstract     = {The literature on “benign overfitting” in overparameterized models has been mostly restricted to regression or binary classification; however, modern machine learning operates in the multiclass setting. Motivated by this discrepancy, we study benign overfitting in multiclass linear classification. Specifically, we consider the following training algorithms on separable data: 1) empirical risk minimization (ERM) with cross-entropy loss, which converges to the multiclass support vector machine (SVM) solution; 2) ERM with least-squares loss, which converges to the min-norm interpolating (MNI) solution; and 3) the one-vs-all SVM classifier. First, we provide a simple sufficient deterministic condition under which all three algorithms lead to classifiers that interpolate the training data and have equal accuracy. When the data is generated from Gaussian mixtures or a multinomial logistic model, this condition holds under high enough effective overparameterization. We also show that this sufficient condition is satisfied under “neural collapse”, a phenomenon that is observed in training deep neural networks. Second, we derive novel bounds on the accuracy of the MNI classifier, thereby showing that all three training algorithms lead to benign overfitting under sufficient overparameterization. Ultimately, our analysis shows that good generalization is possible for SVM solutions beyond the realm in which typical margin-based bounds apply.},

  abstract     = {Consider the problem of nonparametric estimation of an unknown $\beta $ -Hölder smooth density $p_{XY}$ at a given point, where $X$ and $Y$ are both $d$ dimensional. An infinite sequence of i.i.d. samples $(X_{i},Y_{i})$ are generated according to this distribution, and two terminals observe $(X_{i})$ and $(Y_{i})$ , respectively. They are allowed to exchange $k$ bits either in oneway or interactively in order for Bob to estimate the unknown density. We show that the minimax mean square risk is order $\left ({\frac {k}{\log k} }\right)^{-\frac {2\beta }{d+2\beta }}$ for one-way protocols and $k^{-\frac {2\beta }{d+2\beta }}$ for interactive protocols. The logarithmic improvement is nonexistent in the parametric counterparts, and therefore can be regarded as a consequence of nonparametric nature of the problem. Moreover, a few rounds of interactions achieve the interactive minimax rate: the number of rounds can grow as slowly as the super-logarithm (i.e., inverse tetration) of $k$ . The proof of the upper bound is based on a novel multi-round scheme for estimating the joint distribution of a pair of biased Bernoulli variables, and the lower bound is built on a sharp estimate of a symmetric strong data processing constant for biased Bernoulli variables.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we study empirical risk minimization (ERM) within a federated learning framework, where a central server seeks to minimize an ERM objective function using $n$ samples of training data that is stored across $m$ clients and the server. The recent flurry of research in this area has identified the Federated Averaging ( $\mathtt{FedAve} $ ) algorithm as the staple for determining $\epsilon $ -approximate solutions to the ERM problem. Similar to standard optimization algorithms, e.g., stochastic gradient descent, the convergence analysis of $\mathtt{FedAve} $ and its variants only relies on smoothness of the loss function in the optimization parameter. However, loss functions are often very smooth in the training data too. To exploit this additional smoothness in data in a federated learning context, we propose the Federated Low Rank Gradient Descent (FedLRGD) algorithm. Since smoothness in data induces an approximate low rank structure on the gradient of the loss function, our algorithm first performs a few rounds of communication between the server and clients to learn weights that the server can use to approximate clients’ gradients using its own gradients. Then, our algorithm solves the ERM problem at the server using an inexact gradient descent method. To theoretically demonstrate that FedLRGD can have superior performance to $\mathtt{FedAve} $ , we present a notion of federated oracle complexity as a counterpart to canonical oracle complexity in the optimization literature. Under some assumptions on the loss function, e.g., strong convexity and smoothness in the parameter, $\eta $ -Hölder class smoothness in the data, etc., we prove that the federated oracle complexity of $LRGD $ scales like $\phi m (p/\epsilon)^{\Theta (d/\eta)}$ and that of $\mathtt{FedAve} $ scales like $\phi m (p / \epsilon)^{3/4}$ (neglecting typically sub-dominant factors), where $\phi \gg 1$ is the ratio of client-to-server communication time to gradient computation time, $p$ is the parameter dimension, and $d$ is the data dimension. Then, we show that when $d$ is small compared to $n$ and the loss function is sufficiently smooth in the data, i.e., $\eta = \Theta (d)$ , FedLRGD beats $\mathtt{FedAve} $ in federated oracle complexity. Finally, in the course of analyzing FedLRGD, we also establish a general result on low rank approximation of smooth latent variable models.},

  abstract     = {The Gaussian-smoothed optimal transport (GOT) framework, pioneered by Goldfeld et al. and followed up by a series of subsequent papers, has quickly caught attention among researchers in statistics, machine learning, information theory, and related fields. One key observation made therein is that, by adapting to the GOT framework instead of its unsmoothed counterpart, the curse of dimensionality for using the empirical measure to approximate the true data generating distribution can be lifted. The current paper shows that a related observation applies to the estimation of nonparametric mixing distributions in discrete exponential family models, where under the GOT cost the estimation accuracy of the nonparametric MLE can be accelerated to a polynomial rate. This is in sharp contrast to the classical sub-polynomial rates based on unsmoothed metrics, which cannot be improved from an information-theoretical perspective. A key step in our analysis is the establishment of a new Jackson-type approximation bound of Gaussian-smoothed Lipschitz functions. This insight bridges existing techniques of analyzing the nonparametric MLEs and the new GOT framework.},

We derive exact and approximate Bayes-optimal robust classifiers for the important setting of two- and three-class Gaussian classification problems with arbitrary imbalance, for $\ell _{2}$ and $\ell _{\infty} $ adversaries. In contrast to classical Bayes-optimal classifiers, determining the optimal decisions here cannot be made pointwise and new theoretical approaches are needed. We develop and leverage new tools, including recent breakthroughs from probability theory on robust isoperimetry, which, to our knowledge, have not yet been used in the area. Our results reveal fundamental tradeoffs between standard and robust accuracy that grow when data is imbalanced. We also show further results, including an analysis of classification calibration for convex losses in certain models, and finite sample rates for the robust risk.},

The subfamily of formally unimodular (lattice-like) packings is further investigated. It can be seen as a generalization of the unimodular and isodual lattices, and the Construction A formally unimodular packings obtained from formally self-dual codes are presented. Recently, lattice coding for the Gaussian wiretap channel has been considered. A measure called the secrecy function was proposed to characterize the eavesdropper’s probability of correctly decoding. The aim is to determine the global maximum value of the secrecy function, called (strong) secrecy gain. We further apply lattice-like packings to coset coding for the Gaussian wiretap channel and show that the family of formally unimodular packings shares the same secrecy function behavior as unimodular and isodual lattices. We propose a universal approach to determine the secrecy gain of a Construction A formally unimodular packing obtained from a formally self-dual code. From the weight distribution of a code, we provide a necessary condition for a formally self-dual code such that its Construction A formally unimodular packing is secrecy-optimal. Finally, we demonstrate that formally unimodular packings/lattices can achieve higher secrecy gain than the best-known unimodular lattices.},

In this context, we analyze arbitrary harmonic bandwidth (BW) expansions for a class of high-dimension constant curvature curve codes for analog error correction of independent continuous-alphabet uniform sources. In particular, we employ the circumradius function from knot theory to prescribe insulating tubes about the centerline of constant curvature curves. We then use tube packing density within a hypersphere to optimize the curve parameters. The resulting constant curvature curve tube (C3T) codes possess the smallest possible latency, i.e., block-length is unity under BW expansion mapping. Further, the codes perform within 5 dB signal-to-distortion ratio of the optimal performance theoretically achievable at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $ &amp;lt; -5$ dB for BW expansion factor $n \leq 10$ . Furthermore, we propose a neural-network-based method to decode C3T codes. We show that, at low SNR, the neural-network-based C3T decoder outperforms the maximum likelihood and minimum mean-squared error decoders for all $n$ . The best possible digital codes require two to three orders of magnitude higher latency compared to C3T codes, thereby demonstrating the latter’s utility for URLLC.},

This is in contrast to prior work on universal lossy compression, which provides $O(\log n/n)$ redundancy guarantees for weakly universal codes under various regularity conditions. We show that either eliminating the regularity conditions or upgrading to strong universality while keeping these regularity conditions entails an inevitable increase in the redundancy to $\tilde {O}(1/\sqrt {n})$ . Our construction involves random coding with non-i.i.d. codewords and a zero-rate uncoded transmission scheme.

  abstract     = {Goppa, in the 1970s, discovered the relation between algebraic geometry and codes, which led to the family of Goppa codes. As one of the most interesting subclasses of linear codes, the family of Goppa codes is often chosen as a key in the McEliece cryptosystem. Knowledge of the number of inequivalent binary Goppa codes for fixed parameters may facilitate in the evaluation of the security of such a cryptosystem. Let $n\geq 5$ be an odd prime number, let $q=2^{n}$ and let $r\geq 3$ be a positive integer satisfying $\gcd (r,n)=1$ . The purpose of this paper is to establish an upper bound on the number of inequivalent extended irreducible binary Goppa codes of length $q+1$ and degree $r$ . A potential mathematical object for this purpose is to count the number of orbits of the projective semi-linear group ${\mathrm{ PGL}}_{2}(\mathbb {F}_{q})\rtimes {\mathrm{ Gal}}(\mathbb {F}_{q^{r}}/\mathbb {F}_{2})$ on the set $\mathcal {I}_{r}$ of all monic irreducible polynomials of degree $r$ over the finite field $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ . An explicit formula for the number of orbits of ${\mathrm{ PGL}}_{2}(\mathbb {F}_{q})\rtimes {\mathrm{ Gal}}(\mathbb {F}_{q^{r}}/\mathbb {F}_{2})$ on $\mathcal {I}_{r}$ is given, and consequently, an upper bound for the number of inequivalent extended irreducible binary Goppa codes of length $q+1$ and degree $r$ is derived. Our main result naturally contains the main results of Ryan (IEEE-TIT 2015), Huang and Yue (IEEE-TIT, 2022) and, Chen and Zhang (IEEE-TIT, 2022), which considered the cases $r=4$ , $r=6$ and $\gcd (r,q^{3}-q)=1$ respectively.},

  abstract     = {A lattice quantizer approximates an arbitrary real-valued source vector with a vector taken from a specific discrete lattice. The quantization error is the difference between the source vector and the lattice vector. In a classic 1996 paper, Zamir and Feder show that the globally optimal lattice quantizer (which minimizes the mean square error) has white quantization error: for a uniformly distributed source, the covariance of the error is the identity matrix, multiplied by a positive real factor. We generalize the theorem, showing that the same property holds (i) for any lattice whose mean square error cannot be decreased by a small perturbation of the generator matrix, and (ii) for an optimal product of lattices that are themselves locally optimal in the sense of (i). We derive an upper bound on the normalized second moment (NSM) of the optimal lattice in any dimension, by proving that any lower- or upper-triangular modification to the generator matrix of a product lattice reduces the NSM. Using these tools and employing the best currently known lattice quantizers to build product lattices, we construct improved lattice quantizers in dimensions 13 to 15, 17 to 23, and 25 to 48. In some dimensions, these are the first reported lattices with normalized second moments below the best known upper bound.},

In this work, we establish an explicit construction for these codewords of polar codes as a sum of the generator matrix rows, which can then be used as a foundation for two applications. In the first application, we obtain a lower bound for the number of minimum-weight codewords (a.k.a. the error coefficient), which matches the exact number established previously in the literature. In the second application, we derive a novel method that modifies the information set (a.k.a. rate profile) of polar codes and PAC codes in order to reduce the error coefficient, hence improving their performance. More specifically, by analyzing the structure of minimum-weight codewords of polar codes (as special sums of the rows in the polar transform matrix), we can identify rows (corresponding to information bits) that contribute the most to the formation of such codewords and then replace them with other rows (corresponding to frozen bits) that bring in few minimum-weight codewords. A similar process can also be applied to PAC codes. Our approach deviates from the traditional constructions of polar codes, which mostly focus on the reliability of the sub-channels, by taking into account another important factor - the weight distribution. Extensive numerical results show that the modified codes outperform PAC codes and CRC-Polar codes at the practical block error rate of $10^{-2}$ - $10^{-3}$ .},

  abstract     = {Caching prefetches some library content at users’ memories during the off-peak times (i.e., placement phase), such that the number of transmissions during the peak-traffic times (i.e., delivery phase) are reduced. A coded caching strategy was originally proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) leading to a multicasting gain compared to the conventional uncoded caching, where each message in the delivery phase is useful to multiple users simultaneously. The load of the MN scheme is optimal under uncoded placement, but the subpacketization level is $O\left({2^{H\left({\frac {M}{N}}\right)K}}\right)$ , where $K$ is the number of users, $\frac {M}{N}$ is the memory ratio of each user and $H\left({\frac {M}{N}}\right)$ is the binary entropy at $\frac {M}{N}$ . In order to reduce the subpacketization while retaining the multicast opportunities in the delivery phase, Yan et al. proposed a combinatorial structure called placement delivery array (PDA) to design coded caching schemes with uncoded placement and clique-covering delivery. In this paper, we consider the coded caching problem from the perspective of PDA. First we propose a Cartesian product method, which constructs an $mK_{1}$ -user PDA based on the piece-wise $m$ -fold Cartesian product of a special $K_{1}$ -user PDA (called a base PDA) while keeping the memory ratio and load unchanged. Since a base PDA must satisfy some restrictive constraints, we propose a transformation from any existing PDA to a base PDA, which makes the Cartesian product method applicable to any existing PDA. As applications of the Cartesian product method, three new coded caching schemes (i.e., Schemes A, B, C) are obtained, whose performance are validated via analytical and numerical comparisons. It is worth noting that Scheme A is asymptotically optimal under uncoded placement, in the sense that the achieved coded caching gain is only decreased by 1 with respect to the coded caching gain of the MN scheme. When the number of users is $K=mq$ and memory ratio is $\frac {z}{q}$ , the needed subpacketization is at most $O\left ({\sqrt {\frac {K}{q}}2^{-\frac {K}{q}}}\right)$ of that of the MN scheme for large $m$ , which implies that for fixed number of users and memory ratio, when we choose $q$ and $z$ coprime, the subpacketization can be reduced the most, since the value of $\frac {K}{q}$ is maximized. Moreover, Scheme A works for arbitrary memory ratio.},

We consider the first-order theory of random variables with the probabilistic independence relation, which concerns statements consisting only of random variables, the probabilistic independence symbol, logical operators, and existential and universal quantifiers. Although probabilistic independence is the only non-logical relation included, this theory is surprisingly expressive, and is able to express notions such as entropy and cardinality, and interpret the true first-order arithmetic over natural numbers (and hence is undecidable). We also characterize the capacity region for a general class of multiuser coding settings (including broadcast channel, interference channel and relay channel) using a first-order formula, which can be regarded as a “single-letter characterization” of the capacity region of the aforementioned settings (conventional single-letter characterizations are existential formulae, whereas our formula contains both existential and universal quantifiers). We then introduce the linear entropy hierarchy to classify single-letter characterizations according to their complexity.},

For low rates, instead, the convergence is based on the fact that the union bound accurately characterizes the error probability. The paper also zooms into the behavior at asymptotically low rates, and shows that the normalized error exponent converges in distribution to the standard Gaussian or a Gaussian-like distribution.

For the two channel models, we analyze some sub-optimal bin-index decoders, which turn out to be asymptotically optimal, at least for the random coding error exponent. For the dirty-paper channel, we show explicitly via a numerical example, that both the error exponent of the TRC and the expurgated exponent strictly improve upon the random coding exponent, at relatively low coding rates, which is a known fact for discrete memoryless channels without random states. We also show that at rates below capacity, the optimal values of the dirty-paper design parameter $\alpha $ in the random coding sense and in the TRC exponent sense are different from one another, and they are both different from the optimal $\alpha $ that is required for attaining the channel capacity. For the Gel’fand–Pinsker channel, we allow for a variable-rate random binning code construction, and prove that the previously proposed maximum penalized mutual information decoder is asymptotically optimal within a given class of decoders, at least for the random coding error exponent.},

One of the key components enabling SMP to achieve fast convergence, stability and predictable dynamics is the Onsager correction that must be updated at each iteration of the algorithm. This correction involves the denoiser’s divergence that is traditionally estimated via the Black-Box Monte Carlo (BB-MC) method. While the BB-MC method demonstrates satisfying accuracy of estimation, it requires heuristic tuning and executing the denoiser additional times at each iteration and might lead to a substantial increase in computational cost of the SMP algorithms. In this work we develop two Large System Limit models of the Onsager correction for denoisers operating within SMP algorithms and use these models to propose practical black-box methods for divergence estimation that require no additional executions of the denoiser and demonstrate similar correction compared to the BB-MC method.},

  abstract     = {Granger causality is among the widely used data-driven approaches for causal analysis of time series data with applications in various areas including economics, molecular biology, and neuroscience. Two of the main challenges of this methodology are: 1) over-fitting as a result of limited data duration, and 2) correlated process noise as a confounding factor, both leading to errors in identifying the causal influences. Sparse estimation via the LASSO has successfully addressed these challenges for parameter estimation. However, the classical statistical tests for Granger causality resort to asymptotic analysis of ordinary least squares, which require long data duration to be useful and are not immune to confounding effects. In this work, we address this disconnect by introducing a LASSO-based statistic and studying its non-asymptotic properties under the assumption that the true models admit sparse autoregressive representations. We establish fundamental limits for reliable identification of Granger causal influences using the proposed LASSO-based statistic. We further characterize the false positive error probability and test power of a simple thresholding rule for identifying Granger causal effects and provide two methods to set the threshold in a data-driven fashion. We present simulation studies and application to real data to compare the performance of our proposed method to ordinary least squares and existing LASSO-based methods in detecting Granger causal influences, which corroborate our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Permutation polynomials over finite fields are fundamental objects as they are used in various theoretical and practical applications in cryptography, coding theory, combinatorial design, and related topics. This family of polynomials constitutes an active research area in which advances are being made constantly. In particular, constructing infinite classes of permutation polynomials over finite fields with good differential properties (namely, low) remains an exciting problem despite much research in this direction for many years. This article exhibits low differentially uniform power permutations over finite fields of odd characteristics. Specifically, its objective is twofold concerning the power functions $F(x)=x^{\frac {p^{n}+3}{2}}$ defined over the finite field ${\mathbb {F}}_{p^{n}}$ of order $p^{n}$ , where $p$ is an odd prime, and $n$ is a positive integer. The first is to complement some former results initiated by Helleseth and Sandberg in 1997 by solving the open problem left open for more than twenty years concerning the determination of the differential spectrum of $F$ when $p^{n}\equiv 3\pmod 4$ and $p\neq 3$ . The second is to determine the exact value of its differential uniformity. Our achievements are obtained firstly by evaluating some character sums over ${\mathbb {F}}_{p^{n}}$ (which amounts to evaluating the number of ${\mathbb {F}}_{p^{n}}$ -rational points on some related curves and secondly by computing the number of solutions in $({\mathbb {F}}_{p^{n}})^{4}$ of a system of equations presented by Helleseth, Rong, and Sandberg, naturally appears while determining the differential spectrum of $F$ . We show that in the considered case ( $p^{n}\equiv 3\pmod 4$ and $p\neq 3$ ), $F$ is an APN power permutation when $p^{n}=11$ , and a differentially 4-uniform power permutation otherwise.},

The classical examples of bent partitions are obtained from (partial) spreads. In Anbar and Meidl (2022) and Meidl and Pirsic (2021), two classes of bent partitions which are not obtained from (partial) spreads were presented. In Anbar et al. (2023), more bent partitions $\Gamma _{1}, \Gamma _{2}, \Gamma _{1}^{\bullet }, \Gamma _{2}^{\bullet }, \Theta _{1}, \Theta _{2}$ were presented from (pre)semifields, including the bent partitions given in Anbar and Meidl (2022) and Meidl and Pirsic (2021). In this paper, we investigate the relations between bent partitions and vectorial dual-bent functions. For any prime $p$ , we show that one can generate certain bent partitions (called bent partitions satisfying Condition $\mathcal {C}$ ) from certain vectorial dual-bent functions (called vectorial dual-bent functions satisfying Condition A). In particular, when $p$ is an odd prime, we show that bent partitions satisfying Condition $\mathcal {C}$ one-to-one correspond to vectorial dual-bent functions satisfying Condition A. We give an alternative proof that $\Gamma _{1}, \Gamma _{2}, \Gamma _{1}^{\bullet }, \Gamma _{2}^{\bullet }, \Theta _{1}, \Theta _{2}$ are bent partitions in terms of vectorial dual-bent functions. We present a secondary construction of vectorial dual-bent functions, which can be used to generate more bent partitions. We show that any weakly regular ternary bent function $f: V_{n}^{(3)}\rightarrow \mathbb {F}_{3}$ ( $n$ is even) of 2-form can generate a bent partition. When such $f$ is weakly regular but not regular, the generated bent partition from $f$ is not coming from a normal bent partition, which answers an open problem proposed in Anbar and Meidl (2022). We give a sufficient condition on constructing partial difference sets from bent partitions, and when $p$ is an odd prime, we provide a characterization of bent partitions satisfying Condition $\mathcal {C}$ in terms of partial difference sets.},

  abstract     = {A multichannel conflict-avoiding code (MC-CAC) is a collection of two-dimensional codewords represented by zero-one matrices, and any pair of distinct codewords have at most one overlapping 1 regardless of the relative time offsets. Such codes are of practical interest as they are able to provide a hard guarantee that each active user has a successful transmission within every consecutive $n$ time slots in a wireless network with multiple asynchronous collision channels. In a more practical setting, it is assumed that in each time slot each source node can only pick one channel and send one packet in the chosen channel, and hence the at most one-packet per time slot (AM-OPPTS) restriction is appended to an MC-CAC. Only upper bounds for the number of codewords of an AM-OPPTS MC-CAC with weights three and four were known in the literature, and constructions for AM-OPPTS MC-CACs have not been explored and analyzed systematically. This paper is devoted to establishing combinatorial constructions for AM-OPPTS MC-CACs by introducing holey group divisible packings with prescribed automorphism groups. As applications of our constructions, the exact values of the sizes of both an optimal AM-OPPTS MC-CAC $(m,n,3)$ and an optimal AM-OPPTS MC-CAC $\left({m,p^{r},\frac {p+1}{2}}\right)$ are determined for certain $m,n,p$ and $r$ .},

A way to improve computer search is to make use of a characterization of the structural properties in order to reduce the search space. In this work, we use techniques from uniform distribution theory to study several structural constraints on Welch and Golomb constructions of Costas arrays. Then, we find bounds on the number of streaks of a given length and their deficiency and test their tightness with several numerical experiments.

  abstract     = {Social network de-anonymization, which refers to re-identifying users by mapping an anonymized network to a correlated real-name network, is an important problem in network science that has received intensive study. Although different de-anonymization algorithms have been proposed, the performance limit of any algorithm on a de-anonymization problem remains less explored. In this paper, we investigate the Optimal De-Anonymization Yield (ODAY), i.e., the maximum extent to which the network can be de-anonymized, of a given de-anonymization problem. Specifically, due to the uncertainty of the true mapping, we define ODAY as the maximum expected number of correctly mapped nodes, and propose general approaches for its quantification in general networks. Therefore, ODAY can be viewed as a quantitative and non-asymptotic concretization of the concept of network de-anonymizability, which is mostly investigated in an asymptotic manner in prior art. Inspired by the effect of network symmetry on the de-anonymizability, we show that for a graph pair with arbitrary topologies, ODAY equals the maximum diagonal sum of a matching probability matrix generated from graph homomorphisms. Due to the exponential complexity of enumerating all the possible homomorphisms, we further obtain an upper bound of ODAY by counting the orbits of each of the two graphs, which significantly reduces the computational cost. Two case studies apply our general findings on symmetry and ODAY to specific network models, and a sampling-based algorithm framework is proposed for ODAY calculation in practice. Extensive experiments are performed to validate our findings. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first effort that quantifies the de-anonymizability of general networks in a non-asymptotic manner from the perspective of network symmetry, and thus sheds light on privacy enhancement for social network design.},

Inspired by the illuminating formulation of DP in terms of mutual information due to Cuff and Yu, this work explores PP through the lens of information theory. We provide an information-theoretic formulation of PP, termed mutual information PP (MI PP), in terms of the conditional mutual information between the mechanism and the secret, given the public information. We show that MI PP is implied by the regular PP and characterize conditions under which the reverse implication is also true, recovering the relationship between DP and its information-theoretic variant as a special case. We establish convexity, composability, and post-processing properties for MI PP mechanisms and derive noise levels for the Gaussian and Laplace mechanisms. The obtained mechanisms are applicable under relaxed assumptions and provide improved noise levels in some regimes. Lastly, applications to auditing privacy frameworks, statistical inference tasks, and algorithm stability are explored.},

Specifically, we consider a setting in which a group of nodes, connected through a network, aim at computing the mean of their local values without revealing those values to each other. The distributed consensus problem is a classic problem that has been extensively studied and its convergence characteristics are well-known. However, state-of-the-art consensus methods build on the idea of exchanging local information with neighboring nodes which leaks information about the users’ local values. We propose an algorithmic framework that is capable of achieving the convergence limit and rate of classic consensus algorithms while keeping the users’ local values private. The key idea of our proposed method is to carefully design noisy messages that are passed from each node to its neighbors such that the consensus algorithm still converges precisely to the average of local values, while a minimum amount of information about local values is leaked. We formalize this by precisely characterizing the mutual information between the private message of a node and all the messages that another adversary collects over time. We prove that our method is capable of preserving users’ privacy for any network without a so-called generalized leaf, and formalize the trade-off between privacy and convergence time. Unlike many private algorithms, any desired accuracy is achievable by our method, and the required level of privacy only affects the convergence time.},

For linear secret-sharing schemes, the share size for almost all $n$ -party access structures is exponential in $n$ . We would like to study larger classes of secret-sharing schemes with two goals: 1) prove lower bounds for larger classes of secret-sharing schemes; and 2) construct efficient secret-sharing schemes. Given this motivation, Paskin-Cherniavsky and Radune (ITC’20) introduced a new class of secret-sharing schemes in which the shares are generated by applying degree- $d$ polynomials to the secret and some random field elements. We define and study two additional classes of polynomial secret-sharing schemes: 1) schemes in which the reconstruction of the secret is done using polynomials; and 2) schemes in which both sharing and reconstruction are done by polynomials. Our main result is a construction of secret-sharing schemes and conditional disclosure of secrets protocols with quadratic sharing and reconstruction that are more efficient than linear secret-sharing schemes. To complement our results, we prove lower bounds on the share size for schemes with polynomial reconstruction. Finally, we give an evidence that schemes with polynomial sharing are probably stronger than schemes with polynomial reconstruction.},

After a change is detected, we are allowed to continue observing more samples so that we can identify the distribution after the change more accurately. Our goal is to minimize the total cost including delay, false alarm, and misdiagnosis probabilities. We first characterize the optimal SCD rule. Moreover, to address the high computational complexity issue of the optimal SCD rule, we propose a low-complexity threshold SCD rule. We further analyze the asymptotic optimality of the threshold SCD rule. In addition, we investigate how increasing the number of sensors can improve the performance of the proposed threshold SCD rule. Our analysis holds for different sensor array structures, including linear sensor arrays and 2D lattice sensor arrays.},

Metrics that quantify the disparity in probability distributions, such as the Stein discrepancy, play an important role in high-dimensional statistical testing. In this paper, we investigate the role of $L^{2}$ regularization in training a neural network Stein critic so as to distinguish between data sampled from an unknown probability distribution and a nominal model distribution. Making a connection to the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, we develop a novel staging procedure for the weight of regularization over training time, which leverages the advantages of highly-regularized training at early times. Theoretically, we prove the approximation of the training dynamic by the kernel optimization, namely the “lazy training”, when the $L^{2}$ regularization weight is large, and training on $n$ samples converge at a rate of ${O}(n^{-1/2})$ up to a log factor. The result guarantees learning the optimal critic assuming sufficient alignment with the leading eigen-modes of the zero-time NTK. The benefit of the staged $L^{2}$ regularization is demonstrated on simulated high dimensional data and an application to evaluating generative models of image data.},

The goal is to identify all signals (resp. noises), i.e., streams where the alternative (resp. null) hypothesis is correct, subject to prescribed bounds on classical or generalized familywise error probabilities of both types. It is not required that the exact number of signals be a priori known, only upper bounds on the numbers of signals and noises are assumed instead. A decentralized formulation is adopted, according to which the sample size and the decision for each testing problem must be based only on observations from the corresponding data stream. A novel multistage testing procedure is proposed for this problem and is shown to enjoy a high-dimensional asymptotic optimality property. Specifically, it achieves the optimal, average over all streams, expected sample size, uniformly in the true number of signals, as the maximum possible numbers of signals and noises go to infinity at arbitrary rates, in the class of all sequential tests with the same global error control. In contrast, existing multistage tests in the literature are shown to achieve this high-dimensional asymptotic optimality property only under additional sparsity or symmetry conditions. These results are based on an asymptotic analysis for the fundamental binary testing problem as the two error probabilities go to zero. Moreover, they are supported by simulation studies and extended to problems with non-iid data and composite hypotheses.},

Motivated by the recent advances in offline reinforcement learning, we develop an algorithmic framework that incorporates the principle of pessimism into asynchronous Q-learning, which penalizes infrequently-visited state-action pairs based on suitable lower confidence bounds (LCBs). This framework leads to, among other things, improved sample efficiency and enhanced adaptivity in the presence of near-expert data. Our approach permits the observed data in some important scenarios to cover only partial state-action space, which is in stark contrast to prior theory that requires uniform coverage of all state-action pairs. When coupled with the idea of variance reduction, asynchronous Q-learning with LCB penalization achieves near-optimal sample complexity, provided that the target accuracy level is small enough. In comparison, prior works were suboptimal in terms of the dependency on the effective horizon even when i.i.d. sampling is permitted. Our results deliver the first theoretical support for the use of pessimism principle in the presence of Markovian non-i.i.d. data.},

Thus, the expected reward of an arm is the Shannon entropy of the probability mass function of the source that generates its symbols. The player aims to maximize the expected total reward associated with the entropy values of the arms played. Under the assumption that the alphabet size is known, two UCB-based algorithms are proposed for the IMAB model which consider the biases of the plug-in entropy estimator. The first algorithm optimistically corrects the bias term in the entropy estimation. The second algorithm relies on data-dependent confidence intervals that adapt to sources with small entropy values. Performance guarantees are provided by upper bounding the expected regret of each of the algorithms. Furthermore, in the Bernoulli case, the asymptotic behavior of these algorithms is compared to the Lai-Robbins lower bound for the pseudo regret. Additionally, under the assumption that the exact alphabet size is unknown, and instead the player only knows a loose upper bound on it, a UCB-based algorithm is proposed, in which the player aims to reduce the regret caused by the unknown alphabet size in a finite time regime. Numerical results illustrating the expected regret of the algorithms presented in the paper are provided.},

This approach usually results in an exponential running time. We show that, using $\varepsilon $ -projectors, we can sample exactly from the limiting distribution. In the black-box setting, where we only have query access to the adjacency matrix of the graph, our sampling algorithm runs in time proportional to $\Delta ^{-1}$ , where $\Delta $ is the minimum spacing between the distinct eigenvalues of the graph.

Every device independently picks a target location on the street system using a general waypoint kernel, and travels to the target along the shortest path on the streets with an individual velocity. Then, any pair of devices becomes connected whenever they are on the same street in sufficiently close proximity, for a sufficiently long time. In our main results we isolate regimes for the almost-sure absence of percolation if, for example, the device intensity is too small, or the connectivity time is too large. On the other hand, we exhibit parameter regimes of sufficiently large intensities of devices, under favorable choices of the other parameters, such that percolation is possible with positive probability. Most interestingly, we also show an in-and-out of percolation as the velocity increases. The rigorous analysis of the system mainly rests on comparison arguments with simplified models via spatial coarse graining and thinning approaches. Here we also make contact to geostatistical percolation models with infinite-range dependencies.},

  abstract     = {The additive codes may have better parameters than linear codes. However, it is still a challenging problem to efficiently construct additive codes that outperform linear codes, especially those with greater distances than linear codes of the same lengths and dimensions. This paper focuses on constructing additive codes that outperform linear codes based on quasi-cyclic codes and combinatorial methods. Firstly, we propose a lower bound on the symplectic distance of 1-generator quasi-cyclic codes of index even. Secondly, we get many binary quasi-cyclic codes with large symplectic distances utilizing computer-supported combination and search methods, all of which correspond to good quaternary additive codes. Notably, some additive codes have greater distances than best-known quaternary linear codes in Grassl’s code table (bounds on the minimum distance of quaternary linear codes https://www.codetables.de ) for the same lengths and dimensions. Moreover, employing a combinatorial approach, we partially determine the parameters of optimal quaternary additive 3.5-dimensional codes with lengths from 28 to 254. Finally, as an extension, we also construct some good additive complementary dual codes with larger distances than the best-known quaternary linear complementary dual codes in the literature.},

Applying these constructions, some new types of MDS array codes with array numbers $m-\tau $ can be derived, where ${\mathrm{ gcd}}(m,q)=1$ . Moreover, an explicit construction of binary MDS array codes is also presented. Compared to the existing MDS array codes, one important characteristic of these codes is that their available code lengths are much longer, which is suitable for large-scale storage systems. In some particular cases, the maximum code lengths of these codes and their extension can be up to $2^{m-\tau }$ and $2^{m-\tau }+1$ (or $2^{m-\tau }+2$ ), respectively. Moreover, to demonstrate the applicability of our constructed MDS array codes, we present an effective generic decoding method for the erased errors. In particular, when there are no more than three erasures occurring, a scheduled algorithm for the syndrome computation of our explicit construction is further proposed, whose computational complexity is asymptotically optimal. Furthermore, this algorithm can be directly applied to the encoding procedure of their extended form. The simulation shows that our new MDS array codes have better encoding and decoding performances than the corresponding extended RS codes coupled with different algorithms.},

The nodes in this network may perform network coding to combat the errors. Given an integer $\tau $ , the robust computing rate of a network code against $\tau $ errors is the average number of times that the target function can be computed with zero error for one use of the network with at most $\tau $ links being corrupted by errors. We derive two cut-set bounds on the robust computing capacity and show that these bounds can be achieved in a multi-edge tree network for computing any target function. Furthermore, we consider linear network codes for computing linear target functions. Given a computing rate, we define a minimum distance to measure the error-tolerant capability of the linear network function computing codes. We propose a Singleton-like bound on this minimum distance and show that this bound is tight in two classes of networks for computing the sum of source messages.},

Although several existence bounds for all of the above schemes are known, constructions are scarce. In this paper, we present explicit constructions of all mentioned IPP notions, in the form of combinatorial objects. Our discussion follows a systematic procedure. First, we use the Lovász Local Lemma (LLL) to obtain existence bounds for the object to be constructed. The bounds derived essentially match the previously best-known ones. Additionally, our proof strategy enables for further development. It allows us to use the Moser-Tardos algorithmic version of the LLL in order to construct, with polynomial complexity, the actual objects. Moreover, we extend the results of Giotis et al. to precisely establish the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms.},

Our focus is on the $(d,\infty)$ -runlength limited (RLL) constraint, which mandates that any pair of successive 1s be separated by at least $d~0\text{s}$ . In our study, we first consider $(d,\infty)$ -RLL subcodes of RM codes, taking the coordinates of the RM codes to be in the standard lexicographic ordering. We show, via a simple construction, that RM codes of rate $R$ have linear $(d,\infty)$ -RLL subcodes of rate $R\cdot {2^{-\left \lceil{ \log _{2}(d+1)}\right \rceil }}$ . We then show that our construction is essentially rate-optimal, by deriving an upper bound on the rates of linear $(d,\infty)$ -RLL subcodes of RM codes of rate $R$ . Next, for the special case when $d=1$ , we prove the existence of potentially non-linear $(1,\infty)$ -RLL subcodes that achieve a rate of $\max \left ({0,R-\frac {3}8}\right)$ . This, for $R &amp;gt; 3/4$ , beats the $R/2$ rate obtainable from linear subcodes. We further derive upper bounds on the rates of $(1,\infty)$ -RLL subcodes, not necessarily linear, of a certain canonical sequence of RM codes of rate $R$ . We then shift our attention to settings where the coordinates of the RM code are not ordered according to the lexicographic ordering, and derive rate upper bounds for linear $(d,\infty)$ -RLL subcodes in these cases as well. Finally, we present a new two-stage constrained coding scheme, again using RM codes of rate $R$ , which outperforms any linear coding scheme using $(d,\infty)$ -RLL subcodes, for values of $R$ close to 1.},

  abstract     = {For codes equipped with metrics such as Hamming metric, symbol pair metric or cover metric, the Johnson bound guarantees list-decodability of such codes. That is, the Johnson bound provides a lower bound on the list-decoding radius of a code in terms of its relative minimum distance $\delta $ , list size $L$ and the alphabet size $q$ . For study of list-decodability of codes with insertion and deletion errors (we call such codes insdel codes), it is natural to ask the open problem whether there is also a Johnson-type bound. The problem was first investigated by Wachter-Zeh and the result was amended by Hayashi and Yasunaga where a lower bound on the list-decodability for insdel codes was derived. The main purpose of this paper is to move a step further towards solving the above open problem. In this work, we provide a new lower bound for the list-decodability of an insdel code. As a consequence, we show that unlike the Johnson bound for codes under other metrics that is tight, the bound on list-decodability of insdel codes given by Hayashi and Yasunaga is not tight. Our main idea is to show that if an insdel code with a given Levenshtein distance $d$ is not list-decodable with list size $L$ , then the list decoding radius is lower bounded by a bound involving $L$ and $d$ . In other words, if the list decoding radius is less than this lower bound, the code must be list-decodable with list size $L$ . At the end of the paper we use such bound to provide an insdel-list-decodability bound for various well-known codes, which has not been extensively studied before.},

The codes in this family are denoted as $\mathscr {C}_{n}(r,m)$ , and their duals are denoted as $\mathscr {B}_{n}(r,m)$ . The length of these codes is $n^{m}$ , where $n \geq 2$ , and $r$ is their ‘order’. When $n=2$ , $\mathscr {C}_{n}(r,m)$ is the RM code of order $r$ and length $2^{m}$ . The special case of these codes corresponding to $n$ being an odd prime was studied by Berman (1967) and Blackmore and Norton (2001). Following the terminology introduced by Blackmore and Norton, we refer to $\mathscr {B}_{n}(r,m)$ as the Berman code and $\mathscr {C}_{n}(r,m)$ as the dual Berman code. We identify these codes using a recursive Plotkin-like construction, and we show that these codes have a rich automorphism group, they are generated by the minimum weight codewords, and that they can be decoded up to half the minimum distance efficiently. Using a result of Kumar et al. (2016), we show that these codes achieve the capacity of the binary erasure channel (BEC) under bit-MAP decoding. Furthermore, except double transitivity, they satisfy all the code properties used by Reeves and Pfister to show that RM codes achieve the capacity of binary-input memoryless symmetric channels. Finally, when $n$ is odd, we identify a large class of abelian codes that includes $\mathscr {B}_{n}(r,m)$ and $\mathscr {C}_{n}(r,m)$ and which achieves BEC capacity.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, DNA has emerged as a potentially viable storage technology. DNA synthesis, which refers to the task of writing the data into DNA, is perhaps the most costly part of existing storage systems. Consequently, the high cost and low throughput limit the practical use of available DNA synthesis technologies. It has been found that the homopolymer run (i.e., the repetition of the same nucleotide) is a major factor affecting the synthesis and sequencing errors. Recently, Lenz et al. (2020) raised and studied the coding problem for efficient synthesis for DNA-based storage systems. Among other things, they studied the maximal code size under synthesis constraints. In Makarychev et al. (2020), the authors studied the role of batch optimization in reducing the cost of large-scale DNA synthesis, for a given pool $\mathcal {S}$ of random quaternary strings of fixed length. This problem is related to the problem posed in Lenz et al. (2020) which can be viewed as the opposite side of the coin. Instead of seeking the largest code in which every codeword can be synthesized in a certain amount of time, they asked what is the average synthesis time of a randomly chosen string. Following the lead of Makarychev et al. (2020), in this paper, we take a step forward towards the theoretical understanding of DNA synthesis, and study the homopolymer run of length $k \geqslant 1$ . Specifically, we are given a set of DNA strands $\mathcal {S}$ , randomly drawn from a Markovian distribution modeling a general homopolymer run length constraint, that we wish to synthesize. For this problem, we derive asymptotically tight high probability lower and upper bounds on the cost of DNA synthesis, for any $k \geqslant 1$ . Our bounds imply that, perhaps surprisingly, the periodic sequence $\overline { \mathsf {ACGT}}$ is asymptotically optimal in the sense of achieving the smallest possible cost. Our main technical contribution is the representation of the DNA synthesis process as a certain constrained system, for which string techniques can be applied.},

  abstract     = {We define stratified measures on Euclidean space as convex combinations of rectifiable measures. They are possibly singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure and generalize discrete-continuous mixtures. A stratified measure $\rho $ can thus be represented as $\sum _{i=1}^{k} q_{i} \rho _{i}$ , where $(q_{1},..,q_{k})$ is a probability vector and each $\rho _{i}$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the $m_{i}$ -Hausdorff measure $\mu _{i}$ on a $m_{i}$ -rectifiable set $E_{i}$ (e.g., a smooth $m_{i}$ -manifold if $m_{i}&amp;gt;0$ or a countable set if $m_{i}=0$ ). We introduce a set of strongly typical realizations of $\rho ^{\otimes n}$ that occur with high probability; they are supported on a finite union of strata $E_{i_{1}}\times \cdots \times E_{i_{n}}$ whose dimensions “per factor” concentrate around the mean dimension $\sum _{i=1}^{k} q_{i} m_{i}$ . For each $n$ , an appropriate sum of Hausdorff measures on the different strata gives a notion of reference “volume”; the exponential growth rate of the typical set’s volume is quantified by Csiszar’s generalized entropy of $\rho $ with respect to $\mu =\sum _{i=1}^{k} \mu _{i}$ . This entropy satisfies a chain rule; the conditional term is related to the volume growth of the typical realizations in each stratum. Under suitable hypotheses, our notion of mean dimension coincides with Rényi’s information dimension when applied to stratified measures, but the generalized entropy used here differs from Rényi’s dimensional entropy.},

Our bounds are given as solutions to a maximum entropy problem on random graphs of a fixed size $k$ that does not depend on $n$ , under $d$ global density constraints. The bounds are asymptotically close, with a gap that vanishes with $d$ at a rate that depends on the concentration function of the distribution at the center of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov ball.},

  abstract     = {Counting processes (CPs) are important mathematical models with a variety of applications in signal processing, telecommunication, queuing, neuroscience, systems and synthetic biology, meteorology, insurance and finance. A CP $(Y_ {t})_{ t\geq 0}$ can be characterized by its conditional intensity (CI), i.e., the $\sigma (Y_{s}, 0 \le s \le t)$ -intensity, for which the filtration is generated by $(Y_ {t})_{ t\geq 0}$ . The CI is the central quantity from which it is possible to compute information-theoretic measures, and the asymptotic of the CI suffices for their asymptotic versions. Two examples for such measures are the mutual information rate (MIR) of a signal and its Poisson channel output, and the relative entropy rate (RER) between CPs. In order to analytically access the asymptotic of the CI, we introduce the class of CP models for which the CI progresses as a piecewise-deterministic Markov process on an augmented state space and with deterministic jump sizes. This class includes Markov-modulated Poisson processes and self-exciting counting processes. For this class we derive the probability evolution equation of the CI and the fixed point equation for its embedded Markov chain. For the asymptotic CI distribution (ACID) we obtain an analytic description by stationary analysis methods for Markov processes. We present a simulation-free method to compute the ACID, when the dimension of the auxiliary state space is low. Using the ACID, we contribute a new method for the computation of the MIR of the Poisson channel as well as the RER between CPs; and suggest its use also for the empirical assessment of the similarity of CPs. We apply the technique to various naturally occurring CPs, such as the random telegraph modulated Poisson process and the Hawkes process.},

The identification task is part of Post Shannon Theory. The consideration of communication systems beyond Shannon’s approach is useful in order to increase the efficiency of information transmission for certain applications. We propose a coding scheme that first generates infinite common randomness between the sender and the receiver. If the channel has a positive message transmission feedback capacity, for given error thresholds and sufficiently large blocklength this common randomness is then used to construct arbitrarily large deterministic identification codes. In particular, the deterministic identification feedback capacity is infinite regardless of the scaling (exponential, doubly exponential, etc.) chosen for the capacity definition. Clearly, if randomized encoding is allowed in addition to the use of feedback, these results continue to hold.},

These adaptive schemes can be designed so that they have near-optimal rate, and the resulting system will be stable in the sense of having an invariant probability measure, or ergodicity, as well as boundedness of the state second moment. Although structural results and information theoretic bounds of encoders have been studied, the performance of such adaptive fixed-rate quantizers beyond stabilization has not been addressed. In this paper, we propose a two-part adaptive (fixed-rate) coding scheme that achieves state second moment convergence to the classical optimum (i.e., for the fully observed setting) under mild moment conditions on the noise process. The first part, as in prior work, leads to ergodicity (via positive Harris recurrence) and the second part ensures that the state second moment converges to the classical optimum at high rates. These results are established using an intricate analysis which uses random-time state-dependent Lyapunov stochastic drift criteria as a core tool.},

While perfect recovery of signal direction in PO-CS was observed quite early, the exact reconstruction guarantee for a fixed, real signal was recently done by Jacques and Feuillen. However, two questions remain open: the uniform recovery guarantee and exact recovery of complex signal. In this paper, we almost completely address these two open questions. We prove that, all complex sparse signals or low-rank matrices can be uniformly, exactly recovered from a near optimal number of complex Gaussian measurement phases. By recasting PO-CS as a linear compressive sensing problem, the exact recovery follows from restricted isometry property (RIP). Our approach to uniform recovery guarantee is based on covering arguments that involve a delicate control of the (original linear) measurements with overly small magnitude. To work with complex signal, a different sign-product embedding property and a careful rescaling of the sensing matrix are employed. In addition, we show an extension that the uniform recovery is stable under moderate bounded noise. We also propose to add Gaussian dither before capturing the phases to achieve full reconstruction with norm information. Experimental results are reported to corroborate and demonstrate our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Compressive Sensing (CS) has well boosted massive random access protocols over the last decade. Usually, on physical layer, the protocols employ some fat matrix with the property that sparse vectors in the much larger column space domain can still be recovered. This, in turn, greatly reduces the chances of collisions between access devices. This basic scheme has meanwhile been enhanced in various directions but the system cannot operate in overload regime, i.e. sustain significantly more users than the row dimension of the fat matrix dictates. In this paper, we take a different route and apply an orthogonal DFT basis as it is used in OFDM, but subdivide its image into so-called sub-channels and let each sub-channel take only a fraction of the load. In a random fashion the subdivision is consecutively applied over a suitable number of time-slots. Within the time-slots the users will not change their sub-channel assignment and send in parallel the data. Activity detection is carried out jointly across time-slots in each of the sub-channels. For such system design we derive three rather fundamental results: i) First, we prove that the subdivision can be driven to the extent that the activity in each sub-channel is sparse by design. An effect that we call sparsity capture effect. ii) Second, we prove that effectively the system can sustain any overload situation relative to the DFT dimension, i.e. detection failure of active and non-active users can be kept below any desired threshold regardless of the number of users. The only price to pay is delay, i.e. the number of time-slots over which cross-detection is performed. We achieve this by jointly exploring the effect of measure concentration in time and frequency and careful system parameter scaling. iii) Third, we prove that parallel to activity detection active users can carry one symbol per pilot and time-slot so it supports so-called one-shot messaging. The key to proving these results are new concentration results for sequences of randomly sub-sampled DFTs detecting the sparse vectors “en bloc”. Eventually, we show by simulations that the system is scalable resulting in a coarsely 20-fold capacity increase compared to standard OFDM.},

Until now, threshold implementations were only constructed for specific types of functions and some small S-boxes, but no generic construction was ever presented. In this paper, we present the first universal threshold implementation with $t+2$ shares that is applicable to any bijective S-box, where $t$ is its algebraic degree (or is larger than the algebraic degree). While being universal, our construction is also optimal with respect to the number of shares, since the theoretically smallest possible number, $t+1$ , is not attainable for some bijective S-boxes. Our results enable low latency secure hardware implementations without the need for additional randomness. In particular, we apply this result to find two uniform sharings of the AES S-box. The first sharing is obtained by using the threshold implementation of the inversion in $\mathbb {F}_{2^{8}}$ and the second by using two threshold implementations of two cubic power permutations that decompose the inversion. Area and performance figures for hardware implementations are provided.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a general model for evaluating the correlations of correlation attack distinguishers for an LFSR-based stream cipher is given by the Walsh spectrum theory of composite functions. We transform equivalently the linear approximations with $k$ consecutive keystream words into that of a composite function consisting of several simple functions, which enables cryptanalysts to derive linear approximations of any LFSR-based stream cipher by this model and to search for linear trails with high absolute correlations. This model suits any LFSR-based stream cipher, does not need the implicit independence assumption widely used in previous cryptanalysis, and can theoretically ensure that the correlation obtained is the accurate correlation of a correlation attack distinguisher. In addition, we prove that it is enough to consider the distinguishers where the masks of all LFSR elements are zero except for those of a maximal linearly independent system of LFSR elements involved in the update function and output function. As applications, the approximation processes for the correlation attack distinguishers of SNOW-V, SNOW2.0, ZUC, and Grain-128 are exhibited respectively by this method. Moreover, by the proposed method we can perform a full coverage search for binary linear approximations of them. For SNOW-V, we prove that the approximation given by our model is equivalent to that by Shi et al. at EUROCRYPT 2022, and is simpler and more intuitive. For SNOW2.0, we find more linear approximations with the best correlation. For ZUC, for the first time we get the accurate correlations of a series of linear approximations including the known results, and give the supremum of the absolute correlations for a larger set of linear approximations. For Grain-128, utilizing our method, we rediscover the best known correlation as well, which provides more support for the validity of our general model. Our work can give some evidence for the provable security of LFSR-based stream ciphers against correlation attack to some extent, and may provide the key clues in the analysis of complex stream ciphers.},

  abstract     = {The problem of true random number generators (TRNGs) traces back to von Neumann’s 1951 work that aims to simulate an unbiased coin by using a biased coin with unknown probability. The core component in a TRNG is the corrector which is a post-processing function used to reduce or eliminate statistical weaknesses of physical random number generators. Note that an $(n,m,t)$ -resilient function is an $(n,m,t)$ -corrector. Hence, a natural question is how to construct an $(n,m,t)$ -corrector which is not $(n,m,t)$ -resilient? In this paper, a framework concerning the construction of nonlinear $(n,m,t)$ -correctors with algebraic degree $m+1$ is proposed based on an equidistant linear code. We show that the derived correctors are $(n,m,t-1)$ -resilient, but not $(n,m,t)$ -resilient. Given the importance of equidistant linear codes, we discuss how to get such a code with relatively flexible length, and how to get a pair of disjoint equidistant linear codes. In addition, the parameters comparison with linear correctors is given. It is shown that our method achieves the same correction order compared to the optimal linear method. As far as we know, the $(n,m,t)$ -correctors we constructed also possess the best-known correction order compared with the known nonlinear $(n,m)$ resilient functions. The algebraic degree and nonlinearity of the constructed correctors are also analyzed. Through a pair of disjoint equidistant linear codes, the nonlinearity of the nonlinear $(n,m,t)$ -correctors can be improved. The results show that our $(n,m,t)$ -correctors also possess the best algebraic degree and nonlinearity for fixed $(n,m)$ .},

  abstract     = {We study stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with local iterations in the presence of Byzantine clients, motivated by federated learning. The clients, instead of communicating with the server in every iteration, maintain their local models, which they update by taking several SGD iterations based on their own datasets and then communicate the net update with the server, thereby achieving communication efficiency. Furthermore, only a subset of clients communicates with the server at synchronization times. The Byzantine clients may collude and send arbitrary vectors to the server to disrupt the learning process. To combat the adversary, we employ an efficient high-dimensional robust mean estimation algorithm at the server to filter-out corrupt vectors; and to analyze the outlier-filtering procedure, we develop a novel matrix concentration result that may be of independent interest. We provide convergence analyses for both strongly-convex and non-convex smooth objectives in the heterogeneous data setting. We believe that ours is the first Byzantine-resilient local SGD algorithm and analysis with non-trivial guarantees. We corroborate our theoretical results with experiments for neural network training.},

In this paper, uncertainty sets are constructed in a data-driven manner using kernel method, i.e., they are centered around empirical distributions of training samples from the null and alternative hypotheses, respectively; and are constrained via the distance between kernel mean embeddings of distributions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space, i.e., maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). The Bayesian setting and the Neyman-Pearson setting are investigated. For the Bayesian setting where the goal is to minimize the worst-case error probability, an optimal test is firstly obtained when the alphabet is finite. When the alphabet is infinite, a tractable approximation is proposed to quantify the worst-case average error probability, and a kernel smoothing method is further applied to design test that generalizes to unseen samples. A direct robust kernel test is also proposed and proved to be exponentially consistent. For the Neyman-Pearson setting, where the goal is to minimize the worst-case probability of miss detection subject to a constraint on the worst-case probability of false alarm, an efficient robust kernel test is proposed and is shown to be asymptotically optimal. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed robust tests.},

Instead of estimating the community assignments, we aim to test the hypothesis on whether a certain community property is satisfied and provide p-values to assess the statistical uncertainty. For instance, we propose to test whether a given set of nodes belong to the same community or whether different network communities have the same size. We present a general inferential framework that can be applied to all symmetric community properties. To ease the challenges caused by the combinatorial nature of community properties, we develop a novel shadowing bootstrap testing method. By utilizing the symmetry, our method can find a shadowing representative of the true assignment and the number of assignments to be tested in the alternative can be largely reduced. In theory, we introduce a combinatorial distance between two community classes and show a combinatorial-probabilistic trade-off phenomenon in the community property test. Our test is honest as long as the product of the combinatorial distance between two community classes and the probabilistic distance between two assignment probabilities is sufficiently large. On the other hand, we show that such a trade-off also exists in the information-theoretic lower bound of the community property test. We also implement numerical experiments on both the synthetic data and the Protein-Protein Interaction networks to show the validity of our method.},

While standard RF algorithms use bootstrap out-of-bag samples to compute out-of-bag scores, WW uses these samples to produce improved predictions given by an aggregation of the predictions of all possible subtrees of each fully grown tree in the forest. This is achieved by aggregation with exponential weights computed over out-of-bag samples, that are computed exactly and very efficiently thanks to an algorithm called context tree weighting. This improvement, combined with a histogram strategy to accelerate split finding, makes WW fast and competitive compared with other well-established ensemble methods, such as standard RF and extreme gradient boosting algorithms.},

Moreover, this happens precisely when the state is such that both its reductions on systems $AB$ and $AC$ are separable, which is further equivalent to the reductions being PPT. This, in particular, implies that any NPT bipartite state is such that either the state itself or its complement is 2-way distillable. In proving these results, we first obtain an explicit lower bound on the 2-way distillable entanglement of low rank bipartite states. Furthermore, we show that even though not all low rank states are 1-way distillable, a randomly sampled low rank state will almost surely be 1-way distillable.},

The other is the quantum-quantum (QQ) setting, in which the secret to be sent is a quantum state and the shares are quantum systems. The relation between these quantum protocols and MMSP has not been studied sufficiently. We newly introduce the third setting, i.e., the entanglement-assisted (EA) setting, which is defined by modifying the CQ setting with allowing prior entanglement between the dealer and the end-user who recovers the secret by collecting the shares. Showing that the linear version of SS with the EA setting is directly linked to MMSP, we characterize linear quantum versions of SS with the CQ ad QQ settings via MMSP.

Existing works mostly focus on the simple two-hop, single-relay setting and ignore spatial diversity that enables a destination to receive independent noisy copies of data from multiple relays in parallel to improve error performance. In this paper, we consider a single-bit source message and construct learning-rate-optimal, delay-constrained multi-hop schemes by jointly designing time-varying, distributed relay mapping functions with destination decoding strategies. The learning-rate-optimal scheme, however, requires channel and relaying knowledge, which limits practical implementation. With the aim of practical implementation, we have also considered several low-complexity relay and destination strategies and analyzed their performances under different combinations. Numerical comparisons show that none of the alternatives universally dominate, and the system designer thus has to carefully opt for the best suitable schemes depending on the channel conditions. Finally, we show that carefully coordinating many low-quality relay channels in parallel can vastly outperform having only one high-quality relay channel, which demonstrates the spatial diversity gains for the first time in the learning over parallel-relay setting.},

Moreover, by examining the roots of the Krawtchouk polynomials, we give sufficient conditions for a partition of $\mathbf {H}$ induced by combinatorial metric to be non-reflexive, and then give several examples of non-reflexive partitions. When $\mathbf {H}$ is a vector space over a finite field $\mathbb {F}$ , we consider the property of admitting MacWilliams identity (PAMI) and the MacWilliams extension property (MEP) for partitions of $\mathbf {H}$ .

  abstract     = {A line of work has looked at the problem of recovering an input from distance queries. In this setting, there is an unknown sequence $s \in {0,1}^{\leq n}$ , and one chooses a set of queries $y \in {0,1}^{ \mathcal {O}(n)}$ and receives $d(s,y)$ for a distance function $d$ . The goal is to make as few queries as possible to recover $s$ . Although this problem is well-studied for decomposable distances, i.e., distances of the form $d(s,y) = \sum _{i=1}^{n} f(s_{i}, y_{i})$ for some function $f$ , which includes the important cases of Hamming distance, $\ell _{p}$ -norms, and $M$ -estimators, to the best of our knowledge this problem has not been studied for non-decomposable distances, for which there are important instances including edit distance, dynamic time warping (DTW), Fréchet distance, earth mover’s distance, and others. We initiate the study and develop a general framework for such distances. Interestingly, for some distances such as DTW or Fréchet, exact recovery of the sequence $s$ is provably impossible, and so we show by allowing the characters in $y$ to be drawn from a slightly larger alphabet this then becomes possible. In a number of cases we obtain optimal or near-optimal query complexity. One motivation for understanding non-adaptivity is that the query sequence can be fixed and provide a non-linear embedding of the input, which can be used in downstream applications involving, e.g., neural networks for natural language processing.},

First, we propose a general repair model of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes with error-correcting capability for multiple erasure tolerance and derive lower bounds on the number of symbols downloaded and accessed, respectively from helper racks for the purpose of correction and repair. Then, we construct a class of MDS array codes and scalar Reed-Solomon (RS) codes with the optimal repair bandwidth and error resilient capability for multiple node failures. Further, our codes are shown to have the low-access property. In particular, they have the optimal access property for repairing $u$ failed nodes when the dimension of the code is divisible by the rack size $u$ .},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the fundamental limits of the shared-link coded caching problem with correlated files, where a server with a library of ${\mathsf N}$ files communicates with ${\mathsf K}$ users who can locally cache ${\mathsf M}$ files. Given an integer ${\mathsf r}\in [{\mathsf N}]$ , correlation is modelled as follows: each ${\mathsf r}$ -subset of files contains a unique common block. The tradeoff between the cache size and the average transmitted load over the uniform demand distribution is studied. First, a converse bound under the constraint of uncoded cache placement (i.e., each user directly stores a subset of the library bits) is derived. Then, a caching scheme for the case where every user demands a distinct file (possible for ${\mathsf N}\geq {\mathsf K}$ ) is shown to be optimal under the constraint of uncoded cache placement. This caching scheme is further proved to be decodable and optimal under the constraint of uncoded cache placement when (i) ${\mathsf K} {\mathsf r} {\mathsf M}\leq 2 {\mathsf N}$ or ${\mathsf K} {\mathsf r} {\mathsf M}\geq ({\mathsf K}-1) {\mathsf N}$ or ${\mathsf r}\in {1,2, {\mathsf N}-1, {\mathsf N}}$ , and (ii) when the number of distinct demanded files is no larger than four. Finally, a new delivery scheme based on interference alignment which jointly serves the users’ demands is shown to be order optimal to within a factor of 2 under the constraint of uncoded cache placement. As an extension, the above exact and order optimal results can be extended to the worst-case load. As by-products, an extension of the proposed scheme for ${\mathsf M}= {\mathsf N}/ {\mathsf K}$ is shown to reduce the load of state-of-the-art schemes for the coded caching problem where the users can request multiple files; the proposed scheme for distinct demands can be extended to the coded distributed computing problem with a central server, which achieves the optimal transmission load over the binary field.},

These constraints are natural extensions of their one-dimensional counterpart that have been rigorously studied recently. For both of these constraints we present conditions on the size of the cube for which the asymptotic rate of the set of valid arrays approaches 1 as well as conditions for the redundancy to be at most a single symbol. For the first family we present an efficient encoding algorithm that uses a single redundant symbol to encode arbitrary information into a valid array and for the second family we present a similar encoder for the two-dimensional case. The results in the paper are also extended to similar constraints where the sub-array is not necessarily a cube, but a box of arbitrary dimensions and only its volume is bounded.},

It is known that the largest $(L-1)$ -list-decodable code for the Z-channel with error fraction $\tau $ has exponential size (in $n$ ) if $\tau $ is less than a critical value that we call the $(L-1)$ -list-decoding Plotkin point and has constant size if $\tau $ is larger than the threshold. The $(L-1)$ -list-decoding Plotkin point is known to be $L^{-({1}/{L-1})} - L^{-({L}/{L-1})} $ , which equals 1/4 for unique-decoding with $L-1=1 $ . In this paper, we derive various results for the size of the largest codes above and below the list-decoding Plotkin point. In particular, we show that the largest $(L-1)$ -list-decodable code $\varepsilon $ -above the Plotkin point, for any given sufficiently small positive constant $\varepsilon &amp;gt;0 $ , has size $\Theta _{L}(\varepsilon ^{-3/2})$ for any $L-1\ge 1$ .

  abstract     = {In this work, we explore the problem of multi-user linearly-separable distributed computation, where $N$ servers help compute the desired functions (jobs) of $K$ users, and where each desired function can be written as a linear combination of up to $L$ (generally non-linear) subtasks (or sub-functions). Each server computes some of the subtasks, communicates a function of its computed outputs to some of the users, and then each user collects its received data to recover its desired function. We explore the computation and communication relationship between how many servers compute each subtask vs. how much data each user receives. For a matrix $\mathbf {F}$ representing the linearly-separable form of the set of requested functions, our problem becomes equivalent to the open problem of sparse matrix factorization $\mathbf {F} = \mathbf {D}\mathbf {E}$ over finite fields, where a sparse decoding matrix $\mathbf {D}$ and encoding matrix $\mathbf {E}$ imply reduced communication and computation costs respectively. This paper establishes a novel relationship between our distributed computing problem, matrix factorization, syndrome decoding and covering codes. To reduce the computation cost, the above $\mathbf {D}$ is drawn from covering codes or from a here-introduced class of so- called ‘partial covering’ codes, whose study here yields computation cost results that we present. To then reduce the communication cost, these coding-theoretic properties are explored in the regime of codes that have low-density parity check matrices. The work reveals — first for the commonly used one-shot scenario — that in the limit of large $N$ , the optimal normalized computation cost $\gamma \in (0,1)$ is in the range $\gamma \in \left({H_{q}^{-1}\left({\frac {\log _{q}(L)}{N}}\right), H_{q}^{-1}(K/N)}\right)$ — where $H_{q}$ is the $q$ -ary entropy function — and that this can be achieved with normalized communication cost that vanishes as $\sqrt {\log _{q}(N)}/N$ . The above reveals an unbounded coding gain over the uncoded scenario, as well as reveals the role of a certain functional rate $\log _{q}(L)/N$ and functional capacity $H_{q}(\gamma)$ of the system. In the end, we also explore the multi-shot scenario, for which we derive bounds on the computation cost.},

Fundamental properties of sum-rank-metric codes have been studied and some explicit or probabilistic constructions of good sum-rank-metric codes have been proposed. In this paper we give three simple constructions of explicit linear sum-rank-metric codes. In finite length regime, numerous larger linear sum-rank-metric codes with the same minimum sum-rank distances as the previous constructed codes can be derived from our constructions. For example several better linear sum-rank-metric codes over ${\mathbf{F}}_{q}$ with small block sizes and the matrix size $2 \times 2$ are constructed for $q=2, 3, 4$ by applying our construction to the presently known best linear codes. Asymptotically our constructed sum-rank-metric codes are close to the Gilbert-Varshamov-like bound on sum-rank-metric codes for some parameters. Finally we construct a linear MSRD code over an arbitrary finite field ${\mathbf{F}}_{q}$ with various square matrix sizes $n_{1}, n_{2}, \ldots, n_{t}$ satisfying $n_{i} \geq n_{i+1}^{2}+\cdots +n_{t}^{2}$ , $i=1, 2, \ldots, t-1$ , for any given minimum sum-rank distance. There is no restriction on the block lengths $t$ and parameters $N=n_{1}+\cdots +n_{t}$ of these linear MSRD codes from the sizes of the fields ${\mathbf{F}}_{q}$ .},

The analogous problem for classical codes is known to be NP-hard, even in approximate form. For quantum codes, various problems related to decoding are known to be NP-hard, but the hardness of the distance problem has not been studied before. In this work, we show that finding the minimum distance of stabilizer quantum codes exactly or approximately is NP-hard. This result is obtained by reducing the classical minimum distance problem to the quantum problem, using the CWS framework for quantum codes, which constructs a quantum code using a classical code and a graph. A main technical tool used for our result is a lower bound on the so-called graph state distance of 4-cycle free graphs. In particular, we show that for a 4-cycle free graph $G$ , its graph state distance is either $\delta $ or $\delta +1$ , where $\delta $ is the minimum vertex degree of $G$ . Due to a well-known reduction from stabilizer codes to CSS codes, our results also imply that finding the minimum distance of CSS codes is also NP-hard.},

  abstract     = {Huffman Codes are optimal Instantaneous Fixed-to-Variable (FV) codes in which every source symbol can only be encoded by one codeword. Relaxing these constraints permits constructing better FV codes. More specifically, recent work has shown that AIFV- $m$ codes can beat Huffman coding. AIFV- $m$ codes construct an $m$ -tuple of different coding trees between which the code alternates and are only almost instantaneous (AI). This means that decoding a word might require a delay of a finite number of bits. Current algorithms for constructing optimal AIFV- $m$ codes are iterative processes that construct progressively “better sets” of code trees. The processes have been proven to finitely converge to the optimal code but with no known bounds on the convergence rate. This paper derives a geometric interpretation of the space of binary AIFV-2 codes, permitting the development of the first polynomially time-bounded procedure for constructing optimal AIFV codes. This binary-search like procedure will run in $O(n^{3} b)$ time, where $n$ is the number of symbols in the source alphabet and $b$ is the maximum number of bits used to encode any one input probability.},

  abstract     = {Nonconvex optimization plays a key role in multi-user information theory and related fields, but it is usually difficult to solve. The rate region of the Gray–Wyner source coding system (or almost equivalently, the mutual information region) is a typical example in nonconvex optimization, whose single-letter expression was given by Gray and Wyner. However, due to the nonconvexity of the optimization involved in this expression, previously, there was none nontrivial discrete source for which the analytic expression is known. In this paper, we propose a new strategy to solve nonconvex optimization problems. By this strategy, we provide the analytic expression for the doubly symmetric binary source (DSBS), which confirms positively a conjecture of Gray and Wyner in 1974. We also provide the analytic expression of the mutual information region for the Gaussian source, and provide (or recover) the analytic expressions of the lossy Gray–Wyner region for both the DSBS and Gaussian source. Our proof strategy relies on an auxiliary measure technique and the analytical expression of the optimal-transport divergence region.},

This conjecture was known to be true for some parameter regimes, but the validity for all parameters, although suggested by Gaussian tensorization, was previously open. In this paper we construct several counterexamples showing that this conjecture may fail in certain regimes: A simple construction without Hermite polynomial perturbation is proposed, where distributions far from Gaussian are analytically shown to be better than the Gaussian stationary point. As alternatives, we consider perturbation along geodesics under either the $L^{2}$ or Wasserstein-2 metric, showing that the Gaussian stationary point is unstable in a certain regime. Similarity to stability of the Levy-Cramer theorem is discussed. The stability phase transition point admits a simple characterization in terms of the maximum eigenvalue of the Gaussian maximizer. Similar to the Holley-Stroock principle, we can show that in the stable regime the Gaussian stationary point is optimal in a neighborhood under the $L^{\infty }$ -norm with respect to the Gaussian measure. Allowing variable power control, we show that the Gaussian optimizers for the Han-Kobayashi region always lie in the stable regime. Finally, an amended conjecture is proposed.},

  abstract     = {Multi-hop line networks have emerged as an important abstract model for modern and increasingly dense communication networks. In addition, the growth of real-time and mission-critical services has created high demand for and increased research interest in low-latency communications. The combination of these facts motivates a new investigation of data transmission schemes for $L$ -hop line networks from a delay-vs-throughput perspective. To this end, this work defines a metric called the delay amplification factor for a target throughput $R$ , denoted by ${\mathsf {DAF}}(R)$ , which characterizes the growth rate of the (asymptotic) delay with respect to the number of hops. We show that all existing relay schemes, e.g., Decode-&amp;-Forward (DF), have $\lim _{R\nearrow C} {\mathsf {DAF}}(R)=\Omega (L)$ , which is consistent with the decades-old perception that delay grows linearly with respect to $L$ . We then design a scheme satisfying $\lim _{R\nearrow C} {\mathsf {DAF}}(R)=1$ , if the bottleneck hop is the last hop, i.e., its asymptotic delay does not grow with respect to $L$ . The results imply that this linearly growing delay is an artifact of the existing DF designs, and it is possible to surpass it and attain the true fundamental limit with a new delay-centric solution. In the second half of this work, we further show that if variable-length coding and one-bit stop-feedback are allowed, we can relax the condition bottleneck being the last hop and attain $\lim _{R\nearrow C} {\mathsf {DAF}}(R)= 1$ for any arbitrary line networks.},

  abstract     = {In this work we study the capacity of interference-limited channels with memory. These channels model non-orthogonal communications scenarios, such as the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scenario and underlay cognitive communications, in which the interference from other communications signals is much stronger than the thermal noise. Interference-limited communications is expected to become a very common scenario in future wireless communications systems, such as 5G, WiFi6, and beyond. As communications signals are inherently cyclostationary in continuous time (CT), then after sampling at the receiver, the discrete-time (DT) received signal model contains the sampled desired information signal with additive sampled CT cyclostationary noise. The sampled noise can be modeled as either a DT cyclostationary process or a DT almost-cyclostationary process, where in the latter case the resulting channel is not information-stable. In a previous work we characterized the capacity of this model for the case in which the DT noise is memoryless. In the current work we come closer to practical scenarios by modelling the resulting DT noise as a finite-memory random process. The presence of memory requires the development of a new set of tools for analyzing the capacity of channels with additive non-stationary noise which has memory. Our results show, for the first time, the relationship between memory, sampling frequency synchronization and capacity, for interference-limited communications. The insights from our work provide a link between the analog and the digital time domains, which has been missing in most previous works on capacity analysis. Thus, our results can help improving spectral efficiency and suggest optimal transceiver designs for future communications paradigms.},

In this paper, we solve this problem in the scenario where the channel has multiple inputs and multiple outputs (MIMO) and the noise process is generated as the output of a time-invariant state-space model. Our main result is a computable expression for the feedback capacity in terms of a finite-dimensional convex optimization. The solution to the feedback capacity problem is obtained by formulating the finite-block counterpart of the capacity problem as a sequential convex optimization problem which leads in turn to a single-letter upper bound. This converse derivation integrates tools and ideas from information theory, control, filtering and convex optimization. A tight lower bound is realized by optimizing over a family of time-invariant policies thus showing that time-invariant inputs are optimal even when the noise process may not be stationary. The optimal time-invariant policy is used to construct a capacity-achieving and simple coding scheme for scalar channels, and its analysis reveals an interesting relation between a smoothing problem and the feedback capacity expression.},

Unfortunately, the outputs of these tests are imprecise and therefore quantitative group testing methods, which rely on precise measurements, are not applicable. Motivated by the ever-increasing demand to identify individuals infected with SARS-CoV-19, we propose a new model that leverages tropical arithmetic to characterize the PCR testing process. Our proposed framework, termed tropical group testing, overcomes existing limitations of quantitative group testing by allowing for imprecise test measurements. In many cases, some of which are highlighted in this work, tropical group testing is provably more powerful than traditional binary group testing in that it requires fewer tests than classical approaches, while additionally providing a mechanism to identify the viral load of each infected individual. It is also empirically stronger than related works that have attempted to combine PCR, quantitative group testing, and compressed sensing.},

It subsequently studies the effect of the combination policy on the transient behavior of the learning strategy by estimating the adaptation time in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime. In the process, it is discovered that, interestingly, the influence of the combination policy on the transient behavior is insignificant, and thus it is more critical to employ policies that enhance the steady-state performance.

In 1967, Mandelbaum introduced a 2-adic version of classical autocorrelation of binary sequences, called arithmetic autocorrelation, in his research on arithmetic codes. Later, Goresky and Klapper generalized this notion to the nonbinary case and got several properties of arithmetic autocorrelation related to linear shift registers with carry. Recently, Z. Chen et al. showed an upper bound on the arithmetic autocorrelation of binary ${m}$ -sequences and raised a conjecture on the absolute value distribution of the arithmetic autocorrelation of binary ${m}$ -sequences.

  abstract     = {In this article we revisit smoothing bounds in parallel between lattices and codes. Initially introduced by Micciancio and Regev, these bounds were instantiated with Gaussian distributions and were crucial for arguing the security of many lattice-based cryptosystems. Unencumbered by direct application concerns, we provide a systematic study of how these bounds are obtained for both lattices and codes, transferring techniques between both areas. We also consider multiple choices of spherically symmetric noise distributions. We found that the best strategy for a worst-case bound combines Parseval’s Identity, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, and the second linear programming bound, and this holds for both codes and lattices and all noise distributions at hand. For an average-case analysis, the linear programming bound can be replaced by an expected value computation. This alone gives optimal results for spherically uniform noise over random codes and random lattices. This also improves prior Gaussian smoothing bounds for worst-case lattices, but surprisingly this provides even better results with uniform ball noise than for Gaussian (or Bernoulli noise for codes). This counterintuitive situation can be resolved by adequate decomposition and truncation of Gaussian and Bernoulli distributions into a superposition of uniform noise, giving further improvement for those cases, and putting them on par with the uniform cases.},

We propose a joint detection/estimation scheme, which we call Window-Limited CUSUM, that combines the cumulative sum (CUSUM) test with a sliding window-based consistent estimate of the post-change parameters. We characterize the optimal choice of the window size and show that the Window-Limited CUSUM enjoys first-order asymptotic optimality as average run length approaches infinity under the optimal choice of window length. Compared to existing schemes with similar asymptotic optimality properties, our test can be much faster computed because it can recursively update the CUSUM statistic by employing the estimate of the post-change parameters. A parallel variant is also proposed that facilitates the practical implementation of the test. Numerical simulations corroborate our theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {We study sequential probability assignment in the context of online learning under logarithmic loss and obtain tight lower and upper bounds for sequential minimax regret. Sequential minimax regret is defined as the minimum excess loss over data horizon $T$ that a predictor incurs over the best expert in a class, when the samples are presented sequentially and adversarially. Our upper bounds are established by applying Bayesian averaging over a novel “smooth truncated covering” of the expert class. This allows us to obtain tight (minimax) upper bounds that subsume the best known non-constructive bounds in an algorithmic fashion. For lower bounds, we reduce the problem to analyzing the fixed design regret via a novel application of Shtarkov sum adapted to online learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by establishing tight regret bounds for a wide range of expert classes. In particular, we fully characterize the regret of generalized linear function with worst Lipschitz transform functions when the parameters are restricted to a unit norm $\ell _{s}$ ( $s\ge 2$ ) ball of dimension $d$ . We show that the regret grows as $\Theta (d\log T)$ when $d\le O(T^{s/(s+1)-\epsilon })$ for all $\epsilon &amp;gt;0$ (with precise constant 1 when $d\le e^{o(\log T)}$ ) and $\tilde {O}(T^{s/(s+1)})$ when $d\ge \Omega (T^{s/(s+1)})$ . Finally, we show that the Bayesian approach may not always be optimal if the support of the prior is included in the reference class itself.},

We show that in this batched setting, Thompson sampling achieves the same asymptotic performance as in the case where instantaneous feedback is available after each action, provided that the batch sizes increase subexponentially. This result implies that Thompson sampling can maintain its performance even if it receives delayed feedback in $\omega (\log T)$ batches. We further propose an adaptive batching scheme that reduces the number of batches to $O(\log \log T)$ while maintaining the same performance. Although the batched multi-armed bandit setting has been considered in several recent works, previous results rely on tailored algorithms for the batched setting, which optimize the batch structure and prioritize exploration in the beginning of the experiment to eliminate suboptimal actions. We show that Thompson sampling, on the other hand, is able to achieve a similar asymptotic performance in the batched setting without any modifications.},

This paper presents a novel technique called “slow kill,” which utilizes nonconvex constrained optimization, adaptive $\ell _{2}$ -shrinkage, and increasing learning rates. The fact that the problem size can decrease during the slow kill iterations makes it particularly effective for large-scale variable screening. The interaction between statistics and optimization provides valuable insights into controlling quantiles, stepsize, and shrinkage parameters in order to relax the regularity conditions required to achieve the desired level of statistical accuracy. Experimental results on real and synthetic data show that slow kill outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in various situations while being computationally efficient for large-scale data.},

  abstract     = {LASSO regularization is a popular regression tool to enhance the prediction accuracy of statistical models by performing variable selection through the $\ell _{1}$ penalty, initially formulated for the linear model and its variants. In this paper, the territory of LASSO is extended to two-layer ReLU neural networks, a fashionable and powerful nonlinear regression model. Specifically, given a neural network whose output $y$ depends only on a small subset of input $\boldsymbol {x}$ , denoted by $\mathcal {S}^{\star }$ , we prove that the LASSO estimator can stably reconstruct the neural network and identify $\mathcal {S}^{\star }$ when the number of samples scales logarithmically with the input dimension. This challenging regime has been well understood for linear models while barely studied for neural networks. Our theory lies in an extended Restricted Isometry Property (RIP)-based analysis framework for two-layer ReLU neural networks, which may be of independent interest to other LASSO or neural network settings. Based on the result, we advocate a neural network-based variable selection method. Experiments on simulated and real-world datasets show promising performance of the variable selection approach compared with existing techniques.},

This way, we recover known almost tight bounds, but also some new continuity bounds for the relative entropy. Subsequently, we apply our method to the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy (BS-entropy). This yields novel explicit bounds in particular for the BS-conditional entropy, the BS-mutual and BS-conditional mutual information.

The $n$ partite system is called homogenous if the local dimensions $d_{1}=d_{2}=\cdots =d_{n}$ , while it is called heterogeneous if the local dimensions are not all equal. $k$ -uniform sates play an important role in quantum information theory. There are much progress in characterizing and constructing $k$ -uniform states in homogeneous systems. However, the study of entanglement for heterogeneous systems is much more challenging than that for the homogeneous case. There are very few results known for the $k$ -uniform states in heterogeneous systems for $k&amp;gt;3$ . We present two general methods to construct $k$ -uniform states in the heterogeneous systems for general $k$ . The first construction is derived from the error correcting codes by establishing a connection between irredundant mixed orthogonal arrays and error correcting codes. We can produce many new $k$ -uniform states such that the local dimension of each subsystem can be a prime power. The second construction is derived from a matrix $H$ meeting the condition that $H_{A\times \bar {A}}+H^{T}_{\bar {A}\times A}$ has full rank for any row index set $A$ of size $k$ . These matrix construction can provide more flexible choices for the local dimensions, i.e., the local dimensions can be any integer (not necessarily prime power) subject to some constraints. Our constructions imply that for any positive integer $k$ , one can construct $k$ -uniform states of a heterogeneous system in many different Hilbert spaces.},

  abstract     = {The capacity of a channel characterizes the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted through the channel asymptotically faithfully. For a channel with multiple senders and a single receiver, computing its sum capacity is possible in theory, but challenging in practice because of the nonconvex optimization involved. To address this challenge, we investigate three topics in our study. In the first part, we study the sum capacity of a family of multiple access channels (MACs) obtained from nonlocal games. For any MAC in this family, we obtain an upper bound on the sum rate that depends only on the properties of the game when allowing assistance from an arbitrary set of correlations between the senders. This approach can be used to prove separations between sum capacities when the senders are allowed to share different sets of correlations, such as classical, quantum or no-signalling correlations. We also construct a specific nonlocal game to show that the approach of bounding the sum capacity by relaxing the nonconvex optimization can give arbitrarily loose bounds. Owing to this result, in the second part, we study algorithms for non-convex optimization of a class of functions we call Lipschitz-like functions. This class includes entropic quantities, and hence these results may be of independent interest in information theory. Subsequently, in the third part, we show that one can use these techniques to compute the sum capacity of an arbitrary two-sender MACs to a fixed additive precision in quasi-polynomial time. We showcase our method by efficiently computing the sum capacity of a family of two-sender MACs for which one of the input alphabets has size two. Furthermore, we demonstrate with an example that our algorithm may compute the sum capacity to a higher precision than using the convex relaxation.},

  abstract     = {Differential privacy has been an exceptionally successful concept when it comes to providing provable security guarantees for classical computations. More recently, the concept was generalized to quantum computations. While classical computations are essentially noiseless and differential privacy is often achieved by artificially adding noise, near-term quantum computers are inherently noisy and it was observed that this leads to natural differential privacy as a feature. In this work we discuss quantum differential privacy in an information theoretic framework by casting it as a quantum divergence. A main advantage of this approach is that differential privacy becomes a property solely based on the output states of the computation, without the need to check it for every measurement. This leads to simpler proofs and generalized statements of its properties as well as several new bounds for both, general and specific, noise models. In particular, these include common representations of quantum circuits and quantum machine learning concepts. Here, we focus on the difference in the amount of noise required to achieve certain levels of differential privacy versus the amount that would make any computation useless. Finally, we also generalize the classical concepts of local differential privacy, Rényi differential privacy and the hypothesis testing interpretation to the quantum setting, providing several new properties and insights.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by beamformed millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication, we consider the optimal tradeoff between reliable communication rate and state estimation error for a new state-dependent channel model with in-block memory referred to as the binary beam-pointing (BBP) channel. The multiantenna base station (BS) uses a finite beamforming codebook (i.e., discrete beam directions) and associates the target user to the most favorable beam, i.e., the beam directed along the strongest propagation path from BS to the user in 5G and IEEE 802.11ad mmWave communication systems. We model the target user’s Angle-of-Departure (AoD) as the state of a state-dependent channel. Since the AoD remains almost constant over several consecutive time slots, the channel has memory. In addition, we assume the BS receives implicit causal feedback (e.g., modeling a backscatter signal as in radar) and consider a joint communication and sensing (JCAS) problem where the BS is also interested in explicitly estimate the channel state (quantized AoD). We derive a closed-form solution to the capacity of the BBP channel model under the peak input cost constraint. Under the average constraint, we present an implicit capacity result, where the capacity is given as the solution of an optimization problem, and we provide an algorithm for its numerical computation. Finally, for the JCAS problem at hand, we provide the minimum distortion under the peak input constraint and show that this coincides with that obtained by the capacity-achieving strategy. This completely characterizes the capacity-distortion tradeoff for the BBP channel under peak input constraint. For the average constraint case, numerical results show that our capacity-achieving strategy yields a state estimation error very close to the theoretical minimum, showing the near-optimality of the proposed strategy for the JCAS problem under the average cost constraint.},

  abstract     = {Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is recognized as a promising technology for the next-generation wireless networks, which provides significant performance gains over individual sensing and communications (S&amp;C) systems via the shared use of wireless resources. The characterization of the S&amp;C performance tradeoff is at the core of the theoretical foundation of ISAC. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point (P2P) ISAC model under vector Gaussian channels, and propose to use the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB)-rate region as a basic tool for depicting the fundamental S&amp;C tradeoff. In particular, we consider the scenario where a unified ISAC waveform is emitted from a dual-functional ISAC transmitter (Tx), which simultaneously communicates information to a communication receiver (Rx) and senses targets with the help of a sensing Rx. In order to perform both S&amp;C tasks, the ISAC waveform is required to be random to convey communication information, with realizations being perfectly known at both the ISAC Tx and the sensing Rx as a reference sensing signal as in typical radar systems. In this context, we treat the ISAC waveform as a random but known nuisance parameter in the sensing signal model, and define a Miller-Chang type CRB for the analysis of the sensing performance. As the main contribution of this paper, we characterize the S&amp;C performance at the two corner points of the CRB-rate region, namely, $P_{\mathrm{ SC}}$ indicating the maximum achievable communication rate constrained by the minimum CRB, and $P_{\mathrm{ CS}}$ indicating the minimum achievable CRB constrained by the maximum communication rate. In particular, we derive the high-SNR communication capacity at $P_{\mathrm{ SC}}$ , and provide lower and upper bounds for the sensing CRB at $P_{\mathrm{ CS}}$ . We show that these two points can be achieved by the conventional Gaussian signalling and a novel strategy relying on the uniform distribution over the set of semi-unitary matrices, i.e., the Stiefel manifold, respectively. Based on the above-mentioned analysis, we provide an outer bound and various inner bounds for the achievable CRB-rate regions. Our main results reveal a two-fold tradeoff in ISAC systems, consisting of the subspace tradeoff (ST) and the deterministic-random tradeoff (DRT) that depend on the resource allocation and data modulation schemes employed for S&amp;C, respectively. Within this framework, we examine the state-of-the-art ISAC signalling strategies and study a number of illustrative examples, which are validated through numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {We study a general setting of status updating systems in which a set of source nodes provide status updates about some physical process(es) to a set of monitors. The freshness of information available at each monitor is quantified in terms of the Age of Information (AoI), and the vector of AoI processes at the monitors (or equivalently the age vector) models the continuous state of the system. While the marginal distributional properties of each AoI process have been studied for a variety of settings using the stochastic hybrid system (SHS) approach, we lack a counterpart of this approach to systematically study their joint distributional properties. Developing such a framework is the main contribution of this paper. In particular, we model the discrete state of the system as a finite-state continuous-time Markov chain, and describe the coupled evolution of the continuous and discrete states of the system by a piecewise linear SHS with linear reset maps. Using the notion of tensors, we first derive first-order linear differential equations for the temporal evolution of both the joint moments and the joint moment generating function (MGF) for an arbitrary set of age processes. We then characterize the conditions under which the derived differential equations are asymptotically stable. The generality of our framework is demonstrated by recovering several existing results as special cases. Finally, we apply our framework to derive closed-form expressions of the stationary joint MGF in a multi-source updating system under non-preemptive and source-agnostic/source-aware preemptive in service queueing disciplines.},

Suppose that up to $\delta $ deletions occur in each of the concatenated strings. Since deletions alter the lengths of the strings, a fundamental question to ask is: how much redundancy do we need to introduce in $\mathbf {x}$ in order to recover the boundaries of $\mathbf {x}^{1}, \mathbf {x}^{2},\ldots $ ? This boundary problem is equivalent to the problem of designing codes that can detect the exact number of deletions in each concatenated string. In this work, we answer the question above by first deriving converse results that give lower bounds on the redundancy of deletion-detecting codes. Then, we present a marker-based code construction whose redundancy is asymptotically optimal in $\delta $ among all families of deletion-detecting codes, and exactly optimal among all block-by-block decodable codes. To exemplify the usefulness of such deletion-detecting codes, we apply our code to trace reconstruction and design an efficient coded reconstruction scheme that requires a constant number of traces.},

NMDS codes correspond to interesting objects in finite geometry and have nice applications in combinatorics and cryptography. There have been many constructions of NMDS codes, but most of them are focus on fixed $q$ or $k$ , except for constructions from elliptic curves. Roth and Lempel (IEEE Trans. Inf.

Especially, they pointed out that the resultant MDS codes is not linearly equivalent to Reed-Solomn codes. In this paper, the NMDS properties of Roth-Lempel codes will be analyzed. We also obtain the necessary and sufficient condition of Roth-Lempel codes to be NMDS, and further completely determine the weight distributions of Roth-Lempel codes with length $q+2$ and dimension $3\leq k\leq q$ . Besides, by analyzing the upper bound for the code lengths of elliptic curve MDS codes, we illustrate the linearly inequivalence of Roth-Lempel NMDS codes and elliptic curve NMDS codes when their corresponding code lengths exceed $4(q+2\sqrt {q}+1)/5+1$ .},

In such applications, DNA strands are sequenced by reading some subset of their substrings. While previous works considered two extreme cases in which all substrings of pre-defined lengths are read or substrings are read with no overlap for the single string case, this work studies two extensions of this paradigm. The first extension considers the setup in which consecutive substrings are read with some given minimum overlap. First, an upper bound is provided on the attainable rates of codes that guarantee unique reconstruction. Then, efficient constructions of codes that asymptotically meet that upper bound are presented. In the second extension, we study the setup where multiple strings are reconstructed together. Given the number of strings and their length, we first derive a lower bound on the read substrings’ length $\ell $ that is necessary for the existence of multi-strand reconstruction codes with non-vanishing rates. We then present two constructions of such codes and show that their rates approach 1 for values of $\ell $ that asymptotically behave like the lower bound.},

  abstract     = {Racetrack memory is a tape-like structure where data is stored sequentially as a track of single-bit memory cells. The cells are accessed through read/write ports, called heads. When reading/writing the data, the heads stay fixed and the track is shifting. One of the main challenges in developing racetrack memory systems is the limited precision in controlling the track shifts, that in turn affects the reliability of reading and writing the data. A current proposal for combating deletions in racetrack memories is to use redundant heads per-track resulting in multiple copies (potentially erroneous) and recovering the data by solving a specialized version of a sequence reconstruction problem. Using this approach, $k$ -deletion correcting codes of length $n$ , with $d \geq 2$ heads per-track, with redundancy $\log \log n + 4$ were constructed. However, the known approach requires that $k \leq d$ , namely, that the number of heads $d$ is larger than or equal to the number of correctable deletions $k$ . Here we address the question: What is the asymptotically optimal order of redundancy that can be achieved for a $k$ -deletion code ( $k$ is a constant) if the number of heads is fixed at $d$ (due to implementation constraints)? One of our key results is an answer to this question, namely, we construct codes that can correct $k$ deletions, for any $k$ beyond the known limit of $d$ . The codes have asymptotically $8k \log \log n+o(\log \log n)$ redundancy for $d\le k \leq 2d-1$ . In addition, when $k \geq 2d$ , our codes have asymptotically $2 \lfloor k/d\rfloor \log n+o(\log n)$ redundancy, that we prove it is order-wise optimal, specifically, we prove that the redundancy required for correcting $k$ deletions is at least $\lfloor k/2d\rfloor \log n+o(\log n)$ . The encoding/decoding complexity of our codes is $O(n\log ^{2k+1}n)$ . Finally, we ask a general question: What is the order-wise optimal redundancy for codes correcting a combination of at most $k$ deletions and insertions in a $d$ -head racetrack memory? We prove that the redundancy used for a combination of $k$ deletion and insertion errors is asymptotically the same as that needed in the case of k deletion errors.},

Based on these three classes of partial geometries, three classes of LDPC codes and three classes of constant-weight codes are constructed. Codes in these two categories are either cyclic or quasi-cyclic. Designs and constructions of these codes are straightforward and flexible without a need for extensive computer search. It is shown that long high-rate LDPC codes constructed based on the three classes of cyclic partial geometries perform well over the additive white Gaussian noise channel (AWGNC) with iterative decoding algorithm based on belief propagation. They can achieve low error-rates without visible error-floor and their decoding converges rapidly. These LDPC codes also perform well over the binary erasure channel (BEC) and are very effective in correcting phased-bursts of erasures. Based on cyclic partial geometries, a special type of constant-weight codes, called balanced codes, can be constructed. The constant-weight codes constructed based on partial geometries are either optimal or nearly optimal.},

This motivates us to extend the shuffling-sampling channel model of Shomorony and Heckel (2021) to include a wiretapper. Our main result is a characterization of the secure storage capacity of our DNA wiretap channel model, which is the maximum rate at which data can be stored within a pool of DNA molecules so as to be reliably retrieved by an authorized party (Bob), while ensuring that an unauthorized party (Eve) gets almost no information from her observations. Furthermore, our proof of achievability shows that index-based wiretap channel coding schemes are optimal.},

Furthermore, the impact of the number of effective scatterers on the mean and variance was investigated in the moderate-to-high SNR regime with some interesting physical insights.

In this search problem, there is an oracle who knows the instantaneous location of the target at any time. Our task is to query the oracle as few times as possible to accurately estimate the location of the target at any specified time. We first study the case where the oracle’s answer to each query is corrupted by discrete noise and then generalize our results to the case of additive white Gaussian noise. In our formulation, the performance criterion is the resolution, which is defined as the maximal $L_{\infty} $ distance between the true locations and estimated locations. We characterize the minimal resolution of an optimal non-adaptive query procedure with a finite number of queries by deriving non-asymptotic and asymptotic bounds. Our bounds are tight in the first-order asymptotic sense when the number of queries satisfies a certain condition and our bounds are tight in the stronger second-order asymptotic sense when the target moves with a constant velocity. To prove our results, we relate the current problem to channel coding, borrow ideas from finite blocklength information theory and construct bounds on the number of possible quantized target trajectories.},

This paper addresses the general question of whether or not it is possible to find algorithms that can compute the optimal input distribution depending on the channel. For this purpose, the concept of Turing machines is used which provides the fundamental performance limits of digital computers and therewith fully specifies which tasks are algorithmically feasible in principle. It is shown for discrete memoryless channels that it is impossible to algorithmically compute the capacity-achieving input distribution, where the channel is given as an input to the algorithm (or Turing machine). Finally, it is further shown that it is even impossible to algorithmically approximate these input distributions.},

This means that all optimal CN codes come from the usual optimal codes.

  abstract     = {K2 is an LFSR-based dynamic feedback stream cipher and has been standardized by ISO/IEC 18033-4. The fast correlation attack (FCA) is a well-known cryptanalysis tool for LFSR-based stream ciphers. In this paper, we propose a guess-and-determine FCA on a dynamic feedback stream ciphers model. Moreover, we give a fast calculation method to calculate the correlation of the function $F(x,y,z)=x\boxplus _{n} S(y)\boxminus _{n} z$ by directly characterizing subtraction modulo $2^{n}$ . Then we propose a kind of mask structure of the linear approximations of the function $F(x,y,z)$ with high correlations. The structural characteristics of the kind of masks reduce both the time complexity of the fast calculation and the memory complexity of connection matrices, which enables us to efficiently search for linear approximations with high correlations. Based on the structural characteristics and the analysis of the number of active S-boxes of the linear approximations of K2, we present an effective search strategy, where the number of active S-boxes is 4. The best absolute correlation we found is $2^{-24.21}$ . Finally, we study the resistance of K2 against the FCA. For any of the four variants of K2, we give the best key recovery attack so far. The time/data/memory complexity is $O(2^{190.06})/O(2^{189.80})/O(2^{188.80})$ , respectively. The results indicate that the four variants of K2 cannot guarantee the claimed 192-bit and 256-bit security if we ignore the design constraint that the maximum keystream length for a single pair of key and IV is limited to $2^{64}$ . For the full version of K2, we present the first FCA, which is also the best attack result yet. And the time/data/memory complexity is $O(2^{313.57})/O(2^{149.02})/O(2^{148.02})$ , respectively. The large security redundancy indicates that the dynamic feedback structure provides higher security.},

  abstract     = {Secure multi-party computation (MPC) is a fundamental problem in secure distributed computing. An MPC protocol allows a set of $n$ mutually distrusting parties to carry out any joint computation of their private inputs, without disclosing any additional information about their inputs. MPC with information-theoretic security (also called unconditional security ) provides the strongest security guarantees and remains secure even against computationally unbounded adversaries. Perfectly-secure MPC protocols are a class of information-theoretically secure MPC protocols, which provide all the security guarantees in an error-free fashion. The focus of this work is perfectly-secure MPC. Known protocols are designed assuming either a synchronous or asynchronous communication network. It is well known that perfectly-secure synchronous MPC is possible as long as the adversary can corrupt any $t_{s} &amp;lt; n/3$ parties. On the other hand, perfectly-secure asynchronous MPC protocols can tolerate up to $t_{a} &amp;lt; n/4$ corrupt parties. A natural question is does there exist a single MPC protocol for the setting where the parties are not aware of the exact network type and which can tolerate up to $t_{s} &amp;lt; n/3$ corruptions in a synchronous network and up to $t_{a} &amp;lt; n/4$ corruptions in an asynchronous network. We design such a best-of-both-worlds perfectly-secure MPC protocol, provided $3t_{s} + t_{a} &amp;lt; n$ holds. For designing our protocol, we design two important building blocks which are of independent interest. The first building block is a best-of-both-worlds Byzantine agreement (BA) protocol tolerating $t &amp;lt; n/3$ corruptions which remains secure both in a synchronous as well as asynchronous network. The second building block is a polynomial-based best-of-both-worlds verifiable secret-sharing (VSS) protocol, which can tolerate up to $t_{s}$ and $t_{a}$ corruptions in a synchronous and in an asynchronous network respectively.},

Understanding the power of these relaxations on the efficiency of SSSs, measured via a parameter called information ratio , is a long-standing open problem. In this article, we introduce and study an extremely relaxed security notion, called partial security , for which it is only required that any qualified set gains strictly more information about the secret than any unqualified one. To get a meaningful efficiency measure, we normalize the (standard) information ratio of such schemes by an appropriate parameter and refer to the new measure as partial information ratio . We present three main results in this paper. First , we prove that partial and perfect information ratios coincide for the class of linear SSSs. Second , we prove that for the general (i.e., non-linear) class of SSSs, partial and statistical information ratios are equal. Third , we show that partial and almost-perfect information ratios do not coincide for the class of mixed-linear schemes (i.e., schemes constructed by combining linear schemes with different underlying finite fields). We also use the notion of partial secret sharing to strengthen and unify the previous decomposition theorems for constructing SSSs.},

  abstract     = {The Modular Inversion Hidden Number Problem (MIHNP), which was proposed at Asiacrypt 2001 by Boneh, Halevi, and Howgrave-Graham, is summarized as follows: Assume that the $\delta $ most significant bits of $z$ are denoted by ${\mathrm {MSB}}_{\delta }(z)$ . The goal is to retrieve the hidden number $\alpha \in \mathbb {Z}_{p}$ given many samples $\left ({t_{i}, {\mathrm {MSB}}_{\delta }((\alpha + t_{i})^{-1} \bmod {p})}\right)$ for random $t_{i} \in \mathbb {Z}_{p}$ . MIHNP is a significant subset of Hidden Number Problems. Eichenauer and Lehn introduced the Inversive Congruential Generator (ICG) in 1986. It is basically characterized as follows: For iterated relations $v_{i+1}=(av^{-1}_{i}+b)\bmod {p}$ with a secret seed $v_{0} \in \mathbb {Z}_{p}$ , each iteration produces $\mathrm {MSB}_{\delta }(v_{i+1})$ where $i \geq 0$ . The ICG family of pseudorandom number generators is a significant subclass of number-theoretic pseudorandom number generators. Sakai-Kasahara scheme is an identity-based encryption (IBE) system proposed by Sakai and Kasahara. It is one of the few commercially implemented identity-based encryption schemes. We explore the Coppersmith approach for solving a class of modular polynomial equations, which is derived from the recovery issue for the hidden number $\alpha $ in MIHNP and the secret seed $v_{0}$ in ICG, respectively. Take a positive integer $n=d^{3+o(1)}$ for some positive integer constant $d$ . We propose a heuristic technique for recovering the hidden number $\alpha $ or secret seed $v_{0}$ with a probability close to 1 when $\delta /\log _{2} p&amp;gt;\frac {1}{d+1}+o\left({\frac {1}{d}}\right)$ . The attack’s total time complexity is polynomial in the order of $\log _{2} p$ , with the complexity of the LLL algorithm increasing as $d^{\mathcal {O}(d)}$ and the complexity of the Gröbner basis computation increasing as $d^{\mathcal {O}(n)}$ . When $d&amp;gt; 2$ , this asymptotic bound surpasses the asymptotic bound $\delta /\log _{2} p&amp;gt;\frac {1}{3}$ established by Boneh, Halevi, and Howgrave-Graham at Asiacrypt 2001. This is the first time a more precise constraint for solving MIHNP is established, implying that the claim that MIHNP is difficult is violated whenever $\delta /\log _{2} p &amp;lt; \frac {1}{3}$ . Then we study ICG. To our knowledge, we achieve the best performance for attacking ICG to date. Finally, we provide an MIHNP-based lattice approach that recovers the signer’s secret key in the Sakai-Kasahara type signatures when the most (least) significant bits of the signing exponents are exposed. This improves the existing work in this direction.},

Beierle et al. discovered a 3.5-round differential at CRYPTO 2020, which was based on the condition that suitable key-IV pairs are picked, which they termed as &#39;right pair&#39;. They were able to refine their approach by doing so, but they also observed that the acquisition of a right pair requires an average of 2 5 iterations. In our work, we propose a method for achieving the right pairs with the help of listing, so that the extra multiplication of 2 5 in the overall complexity can be avoided. In addition, we present a tactical enhancement in &#39;Probabilistic Neutral Bit&#39;- searching algorithm, a change in complexity computation and a novel attack strategy based on two input-output pairs. We employ them to lower the attack complexity from 2 230.86 to 2 218.95 for the 7-round ChaCha256. Furthermore, after almost ten years, we enhance the complexity of a 6-round 128-bit version of ChaCha (Shi et al: ICISC 2012) by more than 78 million times and for the first time, propose attacks on 7.25-round ChaCha256 and 6.5-round ChaCha128 with time complexities 2 244.85 and 2 121.40 respectively.},

In this setup, each agent receives data that might be generated from a different hypothesis (or state) than the data received by the other agents. In contrast to the related literature on social learning, which focuses on showing that the network achieves consensus, here we study the case where every agent is self-interested and wishes to find the hypothesis that generates its own observations. Moreover, agents do not know which other agents among their peers want to discover the same state as theirs. As a result they do not know which agents they should cooperate with. To enable learning under these conditions, we propose a strategy with adaptive combination weights and study the consistency of the agents’ learning process. The method allows each agent to identify and collaborate with neighbors that observe the same hypothesis, while excluding others, thus resulting in improved performance compared to both non-cooperative learning and cooperative social learning solutions. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of agents’ beliefs and provide conditions that enable all agents to correctly identify their true hypotheses. The theoretical analysis is corroborated by numerical simulations.},

We generalize universal coding as the problem of universal densities with respect to a fixed reference measure on a countably generated measurable space. We show that universal densities, which estimate the differential entropy rate consistently, exist for finite reference measures. Thus finite alphabets are not necessary in some sense. To exhibit a universal density, we adapt the nonparametric differential (NPD) entropy rate estimator by Feutrill and Roughan. Our modification is analogous to Ryabko’s modification of prediction by partial matching (PPM) by Cleary and Witten. Whereas Ryabko considered a mixture over Markov orders, we consider a mixture over quantization levels. Moreover, we demonstrate that any universal density induces a strongly consistent Cesàro mean estimator of conditional density given an infinite past. This yields a universal predictor with the $0-1$ loss for a countable alphabet. Finally, we specialize universal densities to processes over natural numbers and on the real line. We derive sufficient conditions for consistent estimation of the entropy rate with respect to infinite reference measures in these domains.},

While there is a vast literature of distributed algorithms applicable to the problem, statistical and computational guarantees of most of them remain unclear in high dimension. This paper provides a first statistical study of the Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) in the Adapt-Then-Combine (ATC) form. Our theory shows that, under standard notions of restricted strong convexity and smoothness of the loss functions–which hold with high probability for standard data generation models–suitable conditions on the network connectivity and algorithm tuning, DGD-ATC converges globally at a linear rate to an estimate that is within the centralized statistical precision of the model. In the worst-case scenario, the total number of communications to statistical optimality grows logarithmically with the ambient dimension, which improves on the communication complexity of DGD in the Combine-Then-Adapt (CTA) form, scaling linearly with the dimension. This reveals that mixing gradient information among agents, as DGD-ATC does, is critical in high-dimensions to obtain favorable rate scalings.},

Previously, the existence of the all-or-nothing phenomenon for such models was only known in a limited range of parameters. Our work extends the results to all signals with arbitrary sublinear sparsity. Over the past several years, the all-or-nothing phenomenon has been established in various models as an outcome of two seemingly disjoint results: one positive result establishing the “all” half of all-or-nothing, and one impossibility result establishing the “nothing” half. Our main technique in the present work is to show that for noiseless discrete channels, the “all” half implies the “nothing” half, that is, a proof of “all” can be turned into a proof of “nothing.” Since the “all” half can often be proven by straightforward means—for instance, by the first-moment method—our equivalence gives a powerful and general approach towards establishing the existence of this phenomenon in other contexts.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a uniformly dithered 1-bit quantization scheme for high-dimensional statistical estimation. The scheme contains truncation, dithering, and quantization as typical steps. As canonical examples, the quantization scheme is applied to the estimation problems of sparse covariance matrix estimation, sparse linear regression (i.e., compressed sensing), and matrix completion. We study both sub-Gaussian and heavy-tailed regimes, where the underlying distribution of heavy-tailed data is assumed to have bounded moments of some order. We propose new estimators based on 1-bit quantized data. In sub-Gaussian regime, our estimators achieve minimax rates up to logarithmic factors, indicating that our quantization scheme costs very little. In heavy-tailed regime, while the rates of our estimators become essentially slower, these results are either the first ones in an 1-bit quantized and heavy-tailed setting, or already improve on existing comparable results from some respect. Under the observations in our setting, the rates are almost tight in compressed sensing and matrix completion. Our 1-bit compressed sensing results feature general sensing vector that is sub-Gaussian or even heavy-tailed. We also first investigate a novel setting where both the covariate and response are quantized. In addition, our approach to 1-bit matrix completion does not rely on likelihood and represents the first method robust to pre-quantization noise with unknown distribution. Experimental results on synthetic data are presented to support our theoretical analysis.},

We first review the rationale for i.i.d. discrete sources, which involves mapping the data onto the simplex space, and we highlight the links with other well-known related concepts in the literature based on local approximations of information-theoretic measures. Then, the problem is translated to analog sources by mapping the data onto the characteristic space, focusing on the adaptability between the discrete and the analog case and its limitations. The proposed approach gains interpretability and scalability for its use on large data sets, providing a unified rationale for the free regularization parameters. Moreover, the structure of the proposed mapping allows resorting to Szegö’s theorem to reduce the complexity for high dimensional mappings, exhibiting a strong duality with spectral analysis.

In this paper, we provide a unified framework for unitarity estimation, which induces ancilla-efficient algorithms that use $O(\epsilon ^{-2})$ and $O(\sqrt {d}\cdot \epsilon ^{-2})$ calls to $\mathcal {E}$ with coherent and incoherent accesses, respectively, where $d$ is the dimension of the system that $\mathcal {E}$ acts on and $\epsilon $ is the required precision. We further show that both the $d$ -dependence and $\epsilon $ -dependence of our algorithms are optimal. As part of our results, we settle the query complexity of the distinguishing problem for depolarizing and unitary channels with incoherent access by giving a matching lower bound $\Omega (\sqrt {d})$ , improving the prior best lower bound $\Omega (\sqrt [{3}]{d})$ by (Aharonov et al., 2022) and (Chen et al., FOCS 2021).},

  abstract     = {Let $U_{d}$ be a unitary operator representing an arbitrary $d$ -dimensional unitary quantum operation. This work presents optimal quantum circuits for transforming a number $k$ of calls of $U_{d}$ into its complex conjugate $\overline {U_{d}}$ . Our circuits admit a parallel implementation and are proven to be optimal for any $k$ and $d$ with an average fidelity of $\left \langle{ {F}}\right \rangle =\frac {k+1}{d(d-k)}$ . Optimality is shown for average fidelity, robustness to noise, and other standard figures of merit. This extends previous works which considered the scenario of a single call ( $k=1$ ) of the operation $U_{d}$ , and the special case of $k=d-1$ calls. We then show that our results encompass optimal transformations from $k$ calls of $U_{d}$ to $f(U_{d})$ for any arbitrary homomorphism $f$ from the group of $d$ -dimensional unitary operators to itself, since complex conjugation is the only non-trivial automorphism on the group of unitary operators. Finally, we apply our optimal complex conjugation implementation to design a probabilistic circuit for reversing arbitrary quantum evolutions.},

The goal is to determine whether a quantum state is identical to another fixed quantum state, using as few state samples as possible. Rather than general entangled measurements, we consider the less powerful but experimentally friendly Pauli measurements. We follow the standard setting where Pauli measurements are regarded as two-outcome measurements, i.e., each $n$ -qubit Pauli measurement has a one-bit outcome. We prove that for an $n$ -qubit quantum system, the sample complexity of this problem is $\Theta \left({\mathrm {poly}(n)\cdot \frac {4^{n}}{\epsilon ^{2}}}\right)$ if only Pauli measurements are allowed. In other words, we provide simple algorithms to determine whether two $n$ -qubit quantum states, $\rho $ and $\sigma $ , are identical or $\epsilon $ -far in trace distance using Pauli measurements, using $O\left({\min {n^{4},n^{3}+\log ^{3}(1/\epsilon)}\cdot \frac {4^{n}}{\epsilon ^{2}}}\right)$ copies of $\rho $ and $\sigma $ . Interestingly, $\mathcal {O}\left({\frac {4^{n}}{\epsilon ^{2}}}\right)$ copies are not sufficient under this setting.},

Schur squares have important applications in cryptography and private information retrieval schemes, notably in secure multiparty computing or designing bilinear multiplication algorithms in finite extensions of finite fields through the notion of supercodes. Thanks to their exciting applications in cryptography, squares and powers of several linear codes have been investigated. In this paper, we will focus on the Schur square of a relevant well-known subclass of cyclic codes, Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem codes (BCH codes), which have wide applications in communication and storage systems and benefit from explicit defining sets that include consecutive integers, which gives the advantage of analyzing the parameters of BCH codes and their complements. Our main objective is to investigate the parameters of the squares of primitive narrow-sense BCH codes $\mathcal C(\delta)$ and their complements $\mathcal C(\delta)^{c}$ . We will present two sufficient and necessary conditions to guarantee that $\mathcal C^{2}(\delta) \ne \Bbb F_{q}^{n}$ and $\mathcal C^{2}(\delta)^{c} \ne \Bbb F_{q}^{n}$ by giving restrictions on designed distance $\delta $ , where $2 \le \delta \le n$ . Based on these two characterizations, the dimensions and minimum distances of $\mathcal C^{2}(\delta)$ and $\mathcal C^{2}(\delta)^{c}$ are investigated in some cases. The dimensions of these squares are determined explicitly, and lower bounds on the minimum distance are given.},

  abstract     = {Erasure codes have become an integral part of distributed storage systems as a tool for providing data reliability and durability under the constant threat of device failures. In such systems, an $[n, k]$ code over a finite field $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ encodes $k$ message symbols from $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ into $n$ codeword symbols from $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ which are then stored on $n$ different nodes in the system. Recent work has shown that significant savings in storage space can be obtained by tuning $n$ and $k$ to variations in device failure rates. Such a tuning necessitates code conversion : the process of converting already encoded data under an initial $[n^{ I}, k^{ I}]$ code to its equivalent under a final $[n^{ F}, k^{ F}]$ code. The default approach to conversion is to re- encode the data under the new code, which places significant burden on system resources. Convertible codes are a recently proposed class of codes for enabling resource-efficient conversions. Existing work on convertible codes has focused on minimizing the access cost, i.e., the number of code symbols accessed during conversion. Bandwidth, which corresponds to the amount of data read and transferred, is another important resource to optimize during conversions. In this paper, we study the fundamental limits on bandwidth used during code conversion and present constructions for bandwidth-optimal convertible codes. First, we model the code conversion problem using network information flow graphs with variable capacity edges. Second, focusing on MDS codes and an important parameter regime called the merge regime, we derive tight lower bounds on conversion bandwidth. The derived bounds show that conversion bandwidth can be significantly reduced as compared to the default approach even in regions where it has been shown that access cost cannot be reduced. Third, we present a new construction for MDS convertible codes which matches the proposed lower bound and is thus bandwidth-optimal during conversion.},

Given $p\in [{0,1}],\epsilon \in [{0,1/2}]$ , we study 1) the $p$ -bounded constraint: a binary vector of size $n$ is said to be $p$ -bounded if its weight is at most $pn$ , and 2) the $\epsilon $ -balanced constraint: a binary vector of size $n$ is said to be $\epsilon $ -balanced if its weight is within $\big [(1/2-\epsilon)n, (1/2+\epsilon)n\big]$ . Such constraints are crucial in several data storage systems, those regard the information data as two-dimensional (2D) instead of one-dimensional (1D), such as the crossbar resistive memory arrays and the holographic data storage. In this work, efficient encoding/decoding algorithms are presented for binary arrays so that the weight constraint (either $p$ -bounded constraint or $\epsilon $ -balanced constraint) is enforced over every row and every column, regarded as 2D row-column (RC) constrained codes; or over every window (where each window refers to as a subarray consisting of consecutive rows and consecutive columns), regarded as 2D sliding-window (SW) constrained codes. While low-complexity designs have been proposed in the literature, mostly focusing on 2D RC constrained codes where $p=1/2$ and $\epsilon =0$ , this work provides efficient coding methods that work for both 2D RC constrained codes and 2D SW constrained codes, and more importantly, the methods are applicable for arbitrary values of $p$ and $\epsilon $ . Furthermore, for certain values of $p$ and $\epsilon $ , we show that, for sufficiently large array size, there exists linear-time encoding/decoding algorithm that incurs at most one redundant bit.},

The new algorithm reduces the complexity in comparison to a recent fast Chase decoding algorithm for Reed–Solomon (RS) codes by the authors (IEEE Trans.

IT, 2012) for binary BCH codes, the polynomials updated throughout the algorithm of the current paper typically have a much lower degree. To achieve the complexity reduction, we build on a new isomorphism between two solution modules in the binary case, and on a degenerate case of the soft-decision (SD) version of the Wu list decoding algorithm. Roughly speaking, we prove that when the maximum list size is 1 in Wu list decoding of binary BCH codes, assigning a multiplicity of 1 to a coordinate has the same effect as flipping this coordinate in a Chase-decoding trial. The solution-module isomorphism also provides a systematic way to benefit from the binary alphabet for reducing the complexity in bounded-distance hard-decision (HD) decoding. Along the way, we briefly develop the Gröbner-bases formulation of the Wu list decoding algorithm for binary BCH codes, which is missing in the literature.},

In this paper, we introduce a new class of linear coding schemes, called sequential linear schemes , where the encoder sequentially updates a linear state process based on feedback. We then derive the optimal scheme within this class, in a closed form, by formulating a novel Markov decision process and solving it via dynamic programming. We demonstrate that our scheme outperforms the Chance-Love scheme for channels with noisy feedback and coincides with the Shalkwijk-Kailath scheme for channels with noiseless feedback. This problem is an instance of decentralized control without any common information and, to the best of our knowledge, the first such scenario where we can derive analytical solutions using dynamic programming.},

  abstract     = {We propose four finite-length scaling laws to predict the frame error rate (FER) performance in the waterfall region of spatially-coupled low-density parity-check code ensembles under full belief propagation (BP) decoding with a limit on the number of decoding iterations and a scaling law for sliding window decoding, also with limited iterations. The laws for full BP decoding provide a choice between accuracy and computational complexity; a good balance between them is achieved by the law that models the number of decoded bits after a certain number of BP iterations by a time-integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This framework is developed further to model sliding window decoding as a race between the integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and an absorbing barrier that corresponds to the left boundary of the sliding window. The proposed scaling laws yield accurate FER predictions for the semi-structured code ensembles proposed by Olmos and Urbanke.},

  abstract     = {We consider the cache-aided multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel, which consists of a server with $L$ antennas and $K$ single-antenna users, where the server contains $N$ files of equal length and each user is equipped with a local cache of size $M$ files. Each user requests an arbitrary file from library. The objective is to design a coded caching scheme based on uncoded placement and one-shot linear delivery, to achieve the maximum sum Degree-of-Freedom (sum-DoF) with low subpacketization. It was shown in the literature that under the constraint of uncoded placement and one-shot linear delivery, the maximum sum-DoF is $\min \left{{L+\frac {KM}{N},K}\right}$ . However, previously proposed schemes for this setting incurred either an exponential subpacketization order in $K$ , or required specific conditions in the system parameters $L$ , $K$ , $M$ and $N$ . In this paper, we propose a new combinatorial structure called multiple-antenna placement delivery array (MAPDA). Based on MAPDA and Latin square, the first proposed scheme achieves the maximum sum-DoF $\min \left{{L+\frac {KM}{N},K}\right}$ with the subpacketization of $K$ when $\frac {KM}{N}+L=K$ . Subsequently, for the general case we propose a transformation approach to construct an MAPDA from any $g$ -regular PDA (a class of placement delivery arrays for the shared link caching problem where each integer in the array occurs $g$ times). When $g$ -regular PDA corresponds to the Maddah-Ali and Niesen scheme, the resulting MAPDA yields the maximum sum-DoF $\min \left{{L+\frac {KM}{N},K}\right}$ with reduced subpacketization compared to the existing schemes. The general scheme can be extended to the multiple independent single-antenna transmitters (servers) corresponding to the cache-aided interference channel proposed by Naderializadeh et al. and the scenario of transmitters equipped with multiple antennas.},

The paper is focused on the practically important NB LDPC codes over the Galois extension fields GF $(2^{m})$ with $m\le 6$ used with QAM signaling. Performance of NB LDPC coded transmission strongly depends on the mapping of nonbinary symbols to signal constellation points. We obtain a random coding bound on the maximum-likelihood decoding error probability for an ensemble of random irregular NB LDPC codes used with QAM signaling for specific symbol-to-signal point mappings. This bound is based on the ensemble average squared Euclidean distance spectra derived for these mappings. The simulation results for the belief-propagation decoding in the coded modulation schemes with the NB quasi-cyclic (QC)-LDPC codes under different mappings are given. Comparisons with the optimized binary QC-LDPC codes in the WiFi and 5G standards, as well as with the new bound, are performed.},

For such systems, we propose the first known family of codes that allows for both unique string reconstruction and correction of multiple mass errors. We consider two approaches: The first approach pertains to asymmetric error-correction and it is based on introducing redundancy that scales linearly with the number of errors and logarithmically with the length of the string. The construction allows for the string to be uniquely reconstructed based only on its erroneous substring composition multiset. The key idea behind our unique reconstruction approach is to interleave (shifted) Catalan-Bertrand strings with arbitrary binary strings and “reflect” them so as to force prefixes and suffixes of the same length to have different weights. The asymptotic code rate of the scheme is one, and decoding is accomplished via a simplified version of the Backtracking algorithm used for the Turnpike problem. For symmetric errors, we use a polynomial characterization of the mass information and adapt polynomial evaluation code constructions for this setting. In the process, we develop new efficient decoding algorithms for a constant number of composition errors.},

For this purpose, ITIP and other variant algorithms have been developed and implemented, which are all based on solving a linear program (LP). In particular, an identity $f = 0$ is verified by solving two LPs, one for $f \ge 0$ and one for $f \le 0$ . In this paper, we develop a set of algorithms that can be implemented by symbolic computation. Based on these algorithms, procedures for verifying linear information inequalities and identities are devised. Compared with LP-based algorithms, our procedures can produce analytical proofs that are both human-verifiable and free of numerical errors. Our procedures are also more efficient computationally. For constrained inequalities, by taking advantage of the algebraic structure of the problem, the size of the LP that needs to be solved can be significantly reduced. For identities, instead of solving two LPs, the identity can be verified directly with very little computation.},

  abstract     = {Group testing was conceived during World War II to identify soldiers infected with syphilis using as few tests as possible, and it has attracted renewed interest during the COVID-19 pandemic. A long-standing assumption in the probabilistic variant of the group testing problem is that individuals are infected by the disease independently . However, this assumption rarely holds in practice, as diseases often spread through interactions between individuals and therefore cause infections to be correlated. Inspired by characteristics of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, we introduce an infection model over networks which generalizes the traditional i.i.d. model from probabilistic group testing. Under this model, we ask whether knowledge of the network structure can be leveraged to perform group testing more efficiently, focusing specifically on community-structured graphs drawn from the stochastic block model. We prove that a simple community-aware algorithm outperforms the baseline binary splitting algorithm when the model parameters are conducive to “strong community structure.” Moreover, our novel lower bounds imply that the community-aware algorithm is order-optimal in certain parameter regimes. We extend our bounds to the noisy setting and support our results with numerical experiments.},

In particular, we derive the $\delta $ -quadratic terms determined by DFT matrices and BH matrices constructed from 2-level autocorrelation sequences, which yields two type of new contructions. We show that inequivalent BH matrices produce different CSSs and CCCs, which proves that our constructed CSSs and CCCs are new. As a consequence of the first type of the constructions, not only a large number of $p$ -ary CSSs and CCCs of size $p$ ( $p$ prime) have been proposed, which were never reported in the literature, but also a theory linking these CSSs of $p$ -ary sequences and the generalized Reed-Muller codes proposed by Kasami et al. is shown. These codes enjoy good error-correcting capability, tightly controlled PMEPR, and significantly extend the range of coding options for applications of OFDM using $p^{n}$ subcarriers. As a consequence of the second type of the constructions, we reveal an extremely fascinating hidden connection between the sequences in aperiodic CSSs and CCCs and the sequences with ideal period 2-level autocorrelation, through their trace representations and permutation polynomials over finite fields.},

This makes them unsuitable in a cloud-based outsourced storage systems where users seek to store and share their files with their collaborators who stay offline until they want to access the file. To address this concern, Boyd et al. designed an offline assisted group key exchange ( $\textsf {OAGKE}$ ) protocol that offers forward secrecy. The core component of their $\textsf {OAGKE}$ protocol is a variant of key encapsulation mechanism ( $\textsf {KEM}$ ) called blinded $\textsf {KEM}$ ( $\textsf {BKEM}$ ). However, their constructions of $\textsf {BKEM}$ are susceptible to quantum attacks. This work proposes an isogeny-based $\textsf {BKEM}$ and a forward secure $\textsf {OAGKE}$ that is secure against adversaries equipped with quantum computers. Our construction of $\textsf {BKEM}$ is based on the Commutative Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman ( $\textsf {CSIDH}$ ) cryptosystem. We provide a formal security proof demonstrating the security of our scheme. Furthermore, we manifest an instantiation of our $\textsf {BKEM}$ from $\textsf {CSIDH-512}$ parameter set.

Motivated by compressive sensing, the robust mean estimation problem is formulated as the minimization of the $\ell _{0}$ -‘norm’ of an outlier indicator vector , under a second moment constraint on the datapoints. The $\ell _{0}$ -‘norm’ is then relaxed to the $\ell _{p}$ -norm ( $0&amp;lt; p\leq 1$ ) in the objective, and it is shown that the global minima for each of these objectives are order-optimal and have optimal breakdown point for the robust mean estimation problem. Furthermore, a computationally tractable iterative $\ell _{p}$ -minimization and hard thresholding algorithm is proposed that outputs an order-optimal robust estimate of the population mean. The proposed algorithm (with breakdown point $\approx 0.3$ ) does not require prior knowledge of the fraction of outliers, in contrast with most existing algorithms, and for $p=1$ it has near-linear time complexity. Both synthetic and real data experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art robust mean estimation methods.},

  abstract     = {Two main concepts studied in machine learning theory are generalization gap (difference between train and test error) and excess risk (difference between test error and the minimum possible error). While information-theoretic tools have been used extensively to study the generalization gap of learning algorithms, the information-theoretic nature of excess risk has not yet been fully investigated. In this paper, some steps are taken toward this goal. We consider the frequentist problem of minimax excess risk as a zero-sum game between the algorithm designer and the world. Then, we argue that it is desirable to modify this game in a way that the order of play can be swapped. We then prove that, under some regularity conditions, if the world and designer can play randomly the duality gap is zero and the order of play can be changed. In this case, a Bayesian problem surfaces in the dual representation. This makes it possible to utilize recent information-theoretic results on minimum excess risk in Bayesian learning to provide bounds on the minimax excess risk. We demonstrate the applicability of the results by providing information theoretic insight on two important classes of problems: classification when the hypothesis space has finite VC-dimension, and regularized least squares.},

  abstract     = {We present a unified technique for sequential estimation of convex divergences between distributions, including integral probability metrics like the kernel maximum mean discrepancy, $\varphi $ -divergences like the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and optimal transport costs, such as powers of Wasserstein distances. This is achieved by observing that empirical convex divergences are (partially ordered) reverse submartingales with respect to the exchangeable filtration, coupled with maximal inequalities for such processes. These techniques appear to be complementary and powerful additions to the existing literature on both confidence sequences and convex divergences. We construct an offline-to-sequential device that converts a wide array of existing offline concentration inequalities into time-uniform confidence sequences that can be continuously monitored, providing valid tests or confidence intervals at arbitrary stopping times. The resulting sequential bounds pay only an iterated logarithmic price over the corresponding fixed-time bounds, retaining the same dependence on problem parameters (like dimension or alphabet size if applicable). These results are also applicable to more general convex functionals, like the negative differential entropy, suprema of empirical processes, and V-Statistics.},

In this work, we analyze the probabilistic version of the error-correcting procedure for general noise. We generalize the Knill-Laflamme conditions for probabilistically correctable errors. We show that for some noise channels, the initial information has to be encoded into a mixed state to maximize the probability of successful error correction. Finally, the probabilistic error-correcting procedure offers an advantage over the deterministic procedure. Reducing the probability of successful error correction allows for correcting errors generated by a broader class of noise channels. Significantly, if the errors are caused by a unitary interaction with an auxiliary qubit system, we can probabilistically restore a qubit state by using only one additional physical qubit.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we present an in-depth study of average-case quantum distances introduced in Maciejewski et al. (2022). The average-case distances approximate, up to the relative error, the average Total-Variation (TV) distance between measurement outputs of two quantum processes, in which quantum objects of interest (states, measurements, or channels) are intertwined with random quantum circuits. Contrary to conventional distances, such as trace distance or diamond norm, they quantify average-case statistical distinguishability via random quantum circuits. We prove that once a family of random circuits forms an $\delta $ -approximate 4-design, with $\delta =o(d^{-8})$ , then the average-case distances can be approximated by simple explicit functions that can be expressed via simple degree two polynomials in objects of interest. For systems of moderate dimension, they can be easily explicitly computed – no optimization is needed as opposed to diamond norm distance between channels or operational distance between measurements. We prove that those functions, which we call quantum average-case distances, have a plethora of desirable properties, such as subadditivity w.r.t. tensor products, joint convexity, and (restricted) data-processing inequalities. Notably, all distances utilize the Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) norm, which provides this norm with a new operational interpretation. We also provide upper bounds on the maximal ratio between worst-case and average-case distances, and for each of them, we provide an example that saturates the bound. Specifically, we show that for each dimension $d$ this ratio is at most $d^{\frac {1}{2}}, d, d^{\frac {3}{2}}$ for states, measurements, and channels, respectively. To support the practical usefulness of our findings, we study multiple examples in which average-case quantum distances can be calculated analytically.},

  abstract     = {Entanglement resources can increase transmission rates substantially. Unfortunately, entanglement is a fragile resource that is quickly degraded by decoherence effects. In order to generate entanglement for optical communication, the transmitter and the receiver first prepare entangled spin-photon pairs locally, and then the photon at the transmitter is sent to the receiver through an optical fiber or free space. Without feedback, the transmitter does not know whether the entangled photon has reached the receiver. The present work introduces a new model of unreliable entanglement assistance, whereby the communication system operates whether entanglement assistance is present or not. While the sender is ignorant, the receiver knows whether the entanglement generation was successful. In the case of a failure, the receiver decodes less information. In this manner, the effective transmission rate is adapted according to the assistance status. Regularized formulas are derived for the classical and quantum capacity regions with unreliable entanglement assistance, characterizing the tradeoff between the unassisted rate and the excess rate that can be obtained from entanglement assistance. It is further established that time division between entanglement-assisted and unassisted coding strategies is optimal for the noiseless qubit channel, but can be strictly suboptimal for a noisy channel.},

In full-diversity scenarios where the coherence time is at least $T\geq (K+1)M$ , the proposed constellation design criterion is based on the asymptotic expression of the multiuser pairwise error probability (PEP) derived by Brehler and Varanasi (2001). In non-full diversity scenarios, for which the previous PEP expression is no longer valid, the proposed design criteria are based on proxies of the PEP recently proposed by Ngo and Yang (2021). Although both the PEP expression and its bounds or proxies were previously considered intractable for optimization, in this work we derive their respective unconstrained gradients. These gradients are in turn used in the optimization of the proposed cost functions in different Riemannian manifolds representing different power constraints. In particular, in addition to the standard unitary space-time modulation (USTM) leading to optimization on the Grassmann manifold, we consider a more relaxed per-codeword power constraint leading to optimization on the so-called oblique manifold , and an average power constraint leading to optimization on the so-called trace manifold . Equipped with these theoretical tools, we design multiuser constellations for the MIMO MAC in full-diversity and non-full-diversity scenarios with state-of-the-art performance in terms of symbol error rate (SER).},

  abstract     = {To account for the massive uncoordinated random access scenario, which is relevant for the Internet of Things, Polyanskiy et al. (2017) proposed a novel formulation of the multiple-access problem, commonly referred to as unsourced multiple access, where all users employ a common codebook and the receiver decodes up to a permutation of the messages. In this paper, we extend this seminal work to the case where the number of active users is random and unknown a priori . We define a random-access code accounting for both misdetection (MD) and false alarm (FA), and derive a random-coding achievability bound for the Gaussian multiple access channel. Our bound captures the fundamental trade-off between MD and FA probabilities. It suggests that the lack of knowledge of the number of active users entails a small penalty in energy efficiency when the target MD and FA probabilities are high. However, as the target MD and FA probabilities decrease, the energy efficiency penalty becomes more significant. For example, in a typical IoT scenario with framelength 19200 complex channel uses and 25–300 active users in average, the required energy per bit to achieve both MD and FA probabilities below $10^{-1}$ , predicted by our bound, is only 0.5–0.7 dB higher than that predicted by the bound in Polyanskiy et al. (2017) for a known number of active users. This gap increases to 3–4 dB when the target MD probability and/or FA probability is below $10^{-3}$ . Taking both MD and FA into account, we use our bound to benchmark the energy efficiency of slotted-ALOHA with multi-packet reception, of a decoder that simply treats interference as noise, and of some recently proposed unsourced multiple access schemes. Numerical results suggest that, when the target MD and FA probabilities are high, it is effective to estimate the number of active users, then treat this estimate as the true value, and use a coding scheme that performs well for the case of known number of active users. However, this approach becomes energy inefficient when the requirements on MD and FA probabilities are stringent.},

  abstract     = {Distributed computing, in which a resource-intensive task is divided into subtasks and distributed among different machines, plays a key role in solving large-scale problems. Coded computing is a recently emerging paradigm where redundancy for distributed computing is introduced to alleviate the impact of slow machines (stragglers) on the completion time. We investigate coded computing solutions over elastic resources, where the set of available machines may change in the middle of the computation. This is motivated by recently available services in the cloud computing industry (e.g., EC2 Spot, Azure Batch) where low-priority virtual machines are offered at a fraction of the price of the on- demand instances but can be preempted on short notice. Our contributions are three-fold. We first introduce a new concept called transition waste that quantifies the number of tasks existing machines must abandon or take over when a machine joins/leaves. We then develop an efficient method to minimize the transition waste for the cyclic task allocation scheme recently proposed in the literature (Yang et al. ISIT’19). Finally, we establish a novel solution based on finite geometry achieving zero transition wastes given that the number of active machines varies within a fixed range.},

  abstract     = {Permutation codes and multi-permutation codes have been widely considered due to their various applications, especially in flash memory. In this paper, we consider permutation codes and multi-permutation codes against a burst of stable deletions. In particular, we propose a construction of permutation codes correcting a burst stable deletion of length $s$ , with redundancy $\log n+ 2\log \log n+O(1{)}$ . Compared to the previous known results, our improvement relies on a different strategy to retrieve the missing symbol on the first row of the array representation of a permutation. We also generalize our constructions for multi-permutations and the variable length burst model. Furthermore, we propose a linear-time encoder with optimal redundancy for single stable deletion correcting permutation codes.},

  abstract     = {In the literature, most of the known high-rate $(n,k)$ MDS array codes with the optimal repair property only support a single repair degree (i.e., the number of helper nodes contacted during a repair process) $d$ , where $k\le d\le n-1$ . However, in practical storage systems, the number of available nodes changes frequently. Thus, it is preferred to construct $(n,k)$ MDS array codes with multiple repair degrees and the optimal repair property for all nodes. To the best of our knowledge, only two high-rate MDS array codes have such properties in the literature, which were proposed by Ye and Barg (IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 63(10), 2001–2014, 2017). However, their sub-packetization levels are relatively large. In this paper, we present a generic construction method that can convert some MDS array codes with a single repair degree into ones with multiple repair degrees and optimal repair property for a set of nodes, while the repair efficiency/degrees of the remaining nodes can be kept. As an application of the generic construction method, an explicit construction of high-rate MDS array code with multiple repair degrees and the optimal access property for all nodes is obtained over a small finite field by choosing the code proposed by Vajha et al. as the base code. Especially, the sub-packetization level is much smaller than that of the two codes proposed by Ye and Barg concerning the same parameters $n$ and $k$ .},

  abstract     = {Synthetic polymer-based data storage seems to be a particularly promising candidate that could help to cope with the ever-increasing demand for archival storage requirements. It involves designing molecules of distinct masses to represent the respective bits {0,1}, followed by the synthesis of a polymer of molecular units that reflects the order of bits in the information string. Reading out the stored data requires the use of a tandem mass spectrometer, that fragments the polymer into shorter substrings and provides their corresponding masses, from which the composition , i.e. the number of 1s and 0s in the concerned substring can be inferred. Prior works have dealt with the problem of unique string reconstruction from the set of all possible compositions, called composition multiset . This was accomplished either by determining which string lengths always allow unique reconstruction, or by formulating coding constraints to facilitate the same for all string lengths. Additionally, error-correcting schemes to deal with substitution errors caused by imprecise fragmentation during the readout process, have also been suggested. This work builds on this research by extending previously considered error models, mainly confined to substitution of compositions. To this end, we define new error models that consider insertions of spurious compositions and deletions of existing ones, thereby corrupting the composition multiset. We analyze if the reconstruction codebook proposed by Pattabiraman et al. is indeed robust to such errors, and if not, propose new coding constraints to remedy this.},

  abstract     = {Group testing is a technique that can reduce the number of tests needed to identify infected members in a population, by pooling together multiple diagnostic samples. Despite the variety and importance of prior results, traditional work on group testing has typically assumed independent infections. However, contagious diseases among humans, like SARS-CoV-2, have an important characteristic: infections are governed by community spread, and are therefore correlated. In this paper, we explore this observation and we argue that taking into account the community structure when testing can lead to significant savings in terms of the number of tests required to guarantee a given identification accuracy. To show that, we start with a simplistic (yet practical) infection model, where the entire population is organized in (possibly overlapping) communities and the infection probability of an individual depends on the communities (s)he participates in. Given this model, we compute new lower bounds on the number of tests for zero-error identification and design community-aware group testing algorithms that can be optimal under assumptions. Finally, we demonstrate significant benefits over traditional, community-agnostic group testing via simulations using both noiseless and noisy tests.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates adaptive streaming codes over a three-node relayed network. In this setting, a source node transmits a sequence of message packets to a destination with help of a relay. The source-to-relay and relay-to-destination links are unreliable and introduce at most $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$ packet erasures, respectively. The destination node must recover each message packet within a strict delay constraint $T$ . The paper presents a new construction of streaming codes for all feasible parameters ${N_{1}, N_{2}, T}$ . Our work improves upon the construction in Fong et al. by adapting the relaying strategy based on the erasure patterns from source to relay. Specifically, the code employs the notion of symbol estimates, which allows the relay to forward information about symbols before it can decode that symbol, and variable-rate encoding, which decreases the rate used to encode a packet as more erasures affect that packet. The codes proposed in this paper achieve rates higher than the ones proposed by Fong et al. whenever $N_{2} &amp;gt; N_{1}$ , and achieve the same rate when $N_{2} \leq N_{1}$ , in which case the rate is optimal. The paper also presents an upper bound on the achievable rate that takes into account erasures in both links in order to bound the rate in the second link. The upper bound is shown to be tighter than a trivial bound that considers only the erasures in the second link.},

This work studies analytical properties of the conditional expectation by characterizing various derivative identities. The paper consists of two parts. In the first part of the paper, a general derivative identity for the conditional expectation is derived. Specifically, for the Markov chain $ {\mathbf{U}}\leftrightarrow {\mathbf{X}}\leftrightarrow {\mathbf{Y}}$ , a compact expression for the Jacobian matrix of $ \mathbb {E}[ \psi ( {\mathbf{Y}}, {\mathbf{U}})| {\mathbf{Y}}= {\mathbf{y}}]$ for a smooth function $\psi $ is derived. In the second part of the paper, the main identity is specialized to the exponential family and two main applications are shown. First, it is demonstrated that, via various choices of the random vector $ {\mathbf{U}}$ and function $\psi $ , one can recover and generalize several known identities (e.g., Tweedie’s formula) and derive some new ones. For example, a new relationship between conditional expectations and conditional cumulants is established. Second, it is demonstrated how the derivative identities can be used to establish new lower bounds on the estimation error. More specifically, using one of the derivative identities in conjunction with a Poincaré inequality, a new lower bound on the minimum mean squared error, which holds for all prior distributions on the input signal, is derived. The new lower bound is shown to be tight in the high-noise regime for the additive Gaussian noise setting.},

For this system, we characterize the fundamental type-II error exponents region, i.e., the type-II error exponents that the various DCs can achieve simultaneously, under expected-rate constraints. Our results show that this fundamental exponents region is boosted compared to the region under maximum-rate constraints, and that it depends on the permissible type-I error probabilities. When all DCs have equal permissible type-I error probabilities, the exponents region is rectangular and all DCs can simultaneously achieve their optimal type-II error exponents. When the DCs have different permissible type-I error probabilities, a tradeoff between the type-II error exponents at the different DCs arises. New achievability and converse proofs are presented. For the achievability, a new multiplexing and rate-sharing strategy is proposed. The converse proof is based on applying different change of measure arguments in parallel and on proving asymptotic Markov chains. For the special cases $K \in {2,3}$ , and for arbitrary $K\geq 2$ when all permissible type-I error probabilities at the various DCs are equal, we provide simplified expressions for the exponents region; a similar simplification is conjectured for the general case.},

Compared to low-density parity-check codes, however, the performance of short-length polar codes have rooms for improvement that could hinder its adoption by a wider class of applications. As part of the program that addresses the performance issue at short length, it is crucial to understand how fast binary memoryless symmetric channels polarize. A number, called scaling exponent, was defined to measure the speed of polarization and several estimates of the scaling exponent were given in literature. As of 2022, the tightest overestimate is 4.714 made by Mondelli, Hassani, and Urbanke in 2015. We lower the overestimate to 4.63. The idea behind this improvement is that, instead of describing the relation between a channel ${W}$ and its children ${W}^ {\scriptscriptstyle {\boxed {\star}}}$ and ${W}^ {\bigcirc \!\!\! \star}$ , we describe the relation between ${W}$ and its grandchildren $ {W}^{\scriptscriptstyle {\boxed {\star}} \, {\scriptscriptstyle {\boxed {\star}}} }$ , ${W}^{\scriptscriptstyle {\boxed {\star}}\, {{\bigcirc \!\! \star} }}$ , ${W}^{{\bigcirc \!\!\! \star}\,\,{\scriptscriptstyle {\boxed {\star}}} }$ , and $ {W}^{{\bigcirc \!\!\! \star}\,{\bigcirc \!\!\! \star} }$ .

  abstract     = {The Matrix-based Rényi’s entropy enables us to directly measure information quantities from given data without the costly probability density estimation of underlying distributions, thus has been widely adopted in numerous statistical learning and inference tasks. However, exactly calculating this new information quantity requires access to the eigenspectrum of a semi-positive definite (SPD) matrix $A$ which grows linearly with the number of samples $n$ , resulting in a $O(n^{3})$ time complexity that is prohibitive for large-scale applications. To address this issue, this paper takes advantage of stochastic trace approximations for matrix-based Rényi’s entropy with arbitrary $\alpha \in \mathbb {R}^{+}$ orders, lowering the complexity by converting the entropy approximation to a matrix-vector multiplication problem. Specifically, we develop random approximations for integer-order $\alpha $ cases and polynomial series approximations (Taylor and Chebyshev) for fractional $\alpha $ cases, leading to a $O(n^{2}sm)$ overall time complexity, where $s, m \ll n$ denote the number of vector queries and the polynomial order respectively. We theoretically establish statistical guarantees for all approximation algorithms and give explicit order of $s$ and $m$ with respect to the approximation error $\epsilon $ , showing optimal convergence rate for both parameters up to a logarithmic factor. Large-scale simulations and real-world applications validate the effectiveness of the developed approximations, demonstrating remarkable speedup with negligible loss in accuracy.},

This technique is used to derive upper bounds on the mismatch capacity of discrete memoryless channels as well as the reliability function with a mismatched decoding metric. Unlike previous works, our bounding technique exploits also the inherent symmetric requirement from the codewords, leading to these new upper bounds. Since the computations of most of the known bounds on the mismatch capacity are rather complicated, we further present a method to obtain relaxed bounds that are easier to compute. As an example, we analyze the obtained bounds in the binary-input channels case.

Furthermore, the identification capacity region of the compound multiple-input multiple-output broadcast channel can be larger than the transmission capacity region. This is a departure from the single-user behavior of identification, since the identification capacity of a single-user channel equals the transmission capacity.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of covert communication over binary-input discrete memoryless channels with mismatched decoding, in which a sender wishes to reliably communicate with a receiver whose decoder is fixed and possibly sub-optimal, and simultaneously to ensure that the communication is covert with respect to a warden. We present a single-letter lower bound and two single-letter upper bounds on the information-theoretically optimal throughput as a function of the given decoding metric, channel laws, and the desired level of covertness. These bounds match for a variety of scenarios of interest, such as (i) when the channel between the sender and receiver is a binary-input binary-output channel, and (ii) when the decoding metric is particularized to the so-called erasures-only metric. The lower bound is obtained based on a modified random coding union bound with pulse position modulation (PPM) codebooks, coupled with a non-standard expurgation argument. The upper bounds are based on the idea of translating the mismatched-decoding error of the original channel to the decoding error of an auxiliary channel.},

We show that the maximal communication rate (normalized by $\log n$ ) equals ${\frac{1}{ 2}} ( \textsf {rank}(P_{Z|X})-1)$ whenever $P_{Z|X}$ is strictly positive. This is done by establishing a converse bound matching the achievability of Makur. The two main ingredients of our proof are: 1) a sharp bound on the Kullback-Leibler divergence of a uniformly sampled vector from a type class and observed through a DMC to an iid vector; and 2) the covering $\varepsilon $ -net of a probability simplex with Kullback-Leibler divergence as a metric. In addition to strictly positive DMC we also find the noisy permutation capacity for $q$ -ary erasure channels, the Z-channel and others.},

We then employ this classical result to derive a tight energy-constrained continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy.

  abstract     = {We consider zero-error communication over a two-transmitter deterministic adversarial multiple access channel (MAC) governed by an adversary who has access to the transmissions of both senders (hence called omniscient ) and aims to maliciously corrupt the communication. None of the encoders, jammer and decoder is allowed to randomize using private or public randomness. This enforces a combinatorial nature of the problem. Our model covers a large family of channels studied in the literature, including all deterministic discrete memoryless noisy or noiseless MACs. In this work, given an arbitrary two-transmitter deterministic omniscient adversarial MAC, we characterize when the capacity region: 1) has nonempty interior (in particular, is two-dimensional); 2) consists of two line segments (in particular, has empty interior); 3) consists of one line segment (in particular, is one-dimensional); 4) or only contains (0,0) (in particular, is zero-dimensional). This extends a recent result by Wang et al. (201 9) from the point-to-point setting to the multiple access setting. Indeed, our converse arguments build upon their generalized Plotkin bound and involve delicate case analysis. One of the technical challenges is to take care of both “joint confusability” and “marginal confusability”. In particular, the treatment of marginal confusability does not follow from the point-to-point results by Wang et al. Our achievability results follow from random coding with expurgation.},

  abstract     = {We consider here the identification of change-points on large-scale data streams. The objective is to find the most efficient way of combining information across data stream so that detection is possible under the smallest detectable change magnitude. The challenge comes from the sparsity of change-points when only a small fraction of data streams undergo change at any point in time. The most successful approach to the sparsity issue so far has been the application of hard thresholding such that only local scores from data streams exhibiting significant changes are considered and added. However the identification of an optimal threshold is a difficult one. In particular it is unlikely that the same threshold is optimal for different levels of sparsity. We propose here a sparse likelihood score for identifying a sparse signal. The score is a likelihood ratio for testing between the null hypothesis of no change against an alternative hypothesis in which the change-points or signals are barely detectable. By the Neyman-Pearson Lemma this score has maximum detection power at the given alternative. The outcome is that we have a scoring of data streams that is successful in detecting at the boundary of the detectable region of signals and change-points. The likelihood score can be seen as a soft thresholding approach to sparse signal and change-point detection in which local scores that indicate small changes are down-weighted much more than local scores indicating large changes. We are able to show sharp optimality of the sparsity likelihood score in the sense of achieving successful detection at the minimum detectable order of change magnitude as well as the best constant with respect this order of change.},

By employing finer studies of the number of solutions of certain equations over finite fields, we prove that $F(x)$ is locally-APN and determine its differential spectrum. We emphasize that computer experiments show that this class of locally-APN power functions covers all Niho type locally-APN power functions for $2\leq m\leq 10$ .

When the characteristic is not small, the state-of-the-art algorithms for solving DLP are the number field sieve (NFS) and its variants. In the relation collection step, to translate the relations between prime ideals to those of elements one needs to use the Schirokauer map. Besides, if the number field has non-trivial automorphisms, one can use them to accelerate the factor-base logarithms computation. However, the Schirokauer map is not compatible with automorphisms. To exploit automorphism efficiently, we focus on the method to construct fields in NFS such that the fields on both sides have non-trivial automorphisms with the logarithms of units being zero: 1) we construct two families of CM polynomials of arbitrary even degree with small coefficients, corresponding to the automorphisms being $x\mapsto -x$ or $x\mapsto 1/x$ ; 2) we show how to combine these polynomials with the JLSV1 and Conjugation polynomial selection methods on both sides; and 3) we also generalize our method to the multiple number field sieve and the extended tower number field sieve.},

  abstract     = {The cross-correlation between two maximum length sequences ( $m$ -sequences) of the same period has been studied since the end of 1960s. One open conjecture by Helleseth states that the cross-correlation between any two $p$ -ary $m$ -sequences takes on the value −1 for at least one shift provided that the decimation $d$ obeys $d\equiv 1\,({\mathrm{ mod}}\, p-1)$ . This was known as the −1 conjecture. Up to now, the −1 conjecture was confirmed for the following decimations: (1) Niho-type decimations, i.e., $d=s(p^{n/{2}}-1)+1$ , where $s$ is an integer; (2) all the complete permutation polynomial (CPP) exponents $d$ satisfying $d\equiv 1\, ({\mathrm{ mod}}\, p-1) $ ; and (3) the additional families of decimations tabulated in this paper. In this paper, we first discuss the connection between the −1 conjecture on cross-correlation of $m$ -sequences and CPP exponents, then we confirm the −1 conjecture for a new type of decimations by giving a new class of CPP exponents. The decimations are of the type $d=1+l{(p^{rtm}-1)}/{(r+1)}$ over ${\mathbb F}_{p^{rtm}}$ , where $p$ is a prime, $r+1$ is an odd prime satisfying $p^{r/{2}} \equiv -1\,({\mathrm{ mod}}\, r+1)$ , $t$ is an odd integer ( $t&amp;gt;2$ if $p=2$ ) with $\gcd (t,r)=1$ , and $m$ is a positive integer. We transform the problem of determining whether $d$ is a CPP exponent into that of investigating the existence of irreducible polynomials over $\mathbb {F}_{p}$ with degree $t$ satisfying a congruence equation. By a theorem given by Rosen that considered the number of irreducible polynomials with a special congruence relation, we prove that $d$ is a CPP exponent over ${\mathbb F}_{p^{rtm}}$ for sufficiently large $t$ . When $m$ is odd, our new CPP exponents are of Niho type; thus, we give a new class of CPP exponents of Niho type. When $m$ is even, we obtain a new class of CPP exponents which are not of Niho type. As a consequence, we show that the −1 conjecture is true for $d=1+l{(p^{rtm}-1)}/{(r+1)}$ when $t$ is a sufficiently large integer.},

  abstract     = {A common goal in many research areas is to reconstruct an unknown signal $\mathbf {x}$ from noisy linear measurements. Approximate message passing (AMP) is a class of low-complexity algorithms that can be used for efficiently solving such high-dimensional regression tasks. Often, it is the case that side information (SI) is available during reconstruction, for example in online learning applications. For this reason, a novel algorithmic framework that incorporates SI into AMP, referred to as approximate message passing with side information (AMP-SI), has been recently introduced. In this work, we provide rigorous performance guarantees for AMP-SI when there are statistical dependencies between the signal and SI pairs and the entries of the measurement matrix are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian. We also allow for statistical dependencies within the elements of the signal itself, by considering a flexible AMP-SI framework incorporating both separable and non-separable denoisers. The AMP-SI performance is shown to be provably tracked by a scalar iteration referred to as state evolution (SE). Moreover, we provide numerical examples that demonstrate empirically that the SE can predict the AMP-SI mean square error accurately.},

We often correct for biased sampling of summary statistics with matching methods and importance weighting. In this paper, we study nearest neighbor matching (NNM), which makes estimates of population quantities from biased samples by substituting unobserved variables with their nearest neighbors in the biased sample. We show that NNM is $L^{2}$ -consistent in the absence of smoothness and boundedness assumptions in finite dimensions. We discuss applications of NNM, outline the barriers to generalizing this work to separable metric spaces, and compare NNM to inverse probability weighting.},

  abstract     = {We deal with two complementary questions about approximation properties of ReLU networks. First, we study how the uniform quantization of ReLU networks with real-valued weights impacts their approximation properties. We establish an upper-bound on the minimal number of bits per coordinate needed for uniformly quantized ReLU networks to keep the same polynomial asymptotic approximation speeds as unquantized ones. We also characterize the error of nearest-neighbour uniform quantization of ReLU networks. This is achieved using a new lower-bound on the Lipschitz constant of the map that associates the parameters of ReLU networks to their realization, and an upper-bound generalizing classical results. Second, we investigate when ReLU networks can be expected, or not, to have better approximation properties than other classical approximation families. Indeed, several approximation families share the following common limitation: their polynomial asymptotic approximation speed of any set is bounded from above by the encoding speed of this set. We introduce a new abstract property of approximation families, called $\infty $ -encodability, which implies this upper-bound. Many classical approximation families, defined with dictionaries or ReLU networks, are shown to be $\infty $ -encodable. This unifies and generalizes several situations where this upper-bound is known.},

For $3 \leq k \leq O(\sqrt {n})$ , using techniques from universal compression, the optimal prediction risk in Kullback-Leibler divergence is shown to be $\Theta \left({\frac {k^{2}}{n}\log \frac {n}{k^{2}}}\right)$ , in contrast to the optimal rate of $\Theta \left({\frac {\log \log n}{n}}\right)$ for $k=2$ previously shown in Falahatgar et al. (2016). These rates, slower than the parametric rate of $O\left({\frac {k^{2}}{n}}\right)$ , can be attributed to the memory in the data, as the spectral gap of the Markov chain can be arbitrarily small. To quantify the memory effect, we study irreducible reversible chains with a prescribed spectral gap. In addition to characterizing the optimal prediction risk for two states, we show that, as long as the spectral gap is not excessively small, the prediction risk in the Markov model is $O\left({\frac {k^{2}}{n}}\right)$ , which coincides with that of an iid model with the same number of parameters. Extensions to higher-order Markov chains are also obtained.},

Here, we develop a degree-corrected tensor block model with estimation accuracy guarantees. We present the phase transition of clustering performance based on the notion of angle separability, and we characterize three signal-to-noise regimes corresponding to different statistical-computational behaviors. In particular, we demonstrate that an intrinsic statistical-to-computational gap emerges only for tensors of order three or greater. Further, we develop an efficient polynomial-time algorithm that provably achieves exact clustering under mild signal conditions.

Here we study a remarkably simple, low-dimensional, single-parameter family of quantum channels with exotic quantum information-theoretic features. As the simplest example from this family, we focus on a qutrit-to-qutrit channel that is intuitively obtained by hybridizing together a simple degradable channel and a completely useless qubit channel. Such hybridizing makes this channel’s capacities behave in a variety of interesting ways. For instance, the private and classical capacity of this channel coincide and can be explicitly calculated, even though the channel does not belong to any class for which the underlying information quantities are known to be additive. Moreover, the quantum capacity of the channel can be computed explicitly, given a clear and compelling conjecture is true. This “spin alignment conjecture,” which may be of independent interest, is proved in certain special cases and additional numerical evidence for its validity is provided. Finally, we generalize the qutrit channel in two ways, and the resulting channels and their capacities display similarly rich behavior. In a companion paper, we further show that the qutrit channel demonstrates superadditivity when transmitting quantum information jointly with a variety of assisting channels, in a manner unknown before.},

  abstract     = {Mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) are highly symmetric bases on complex Hilbert spaces, and the corresponding rank-1 projective measurements are ubiquitous in quantum information theory. In this work, we study a recently introduced generalisation of MUBs called mutually unbiased measurements (MUMs). These measurements inherit the essential property of complementarity from MUBs, but the Hilbert space dimension is no longer required to match the number of outcomes. This operational complementarity property renders MUMs highly useful for device-independent quantum information processing. It has been shown that MUMs are strictly more general than MUBs. In this work we provide a complete proof of the characterisation of MUMs that are direct sums of MUBs. We then construct new examples of MUMs that are not direct sums of MUBs. A crucial technical tool for this construction is a correspondence with quaternionic Hadamard matrices, which allows us to map known examples of such matrices to MUMs that are not direct sums of MUBs. Furthermore, we show that—in stark contrast with MUBs—the number of MUMs for a fixed outcome number is unbounded. Next, we focus on the use of MUMs in quantum communication. We demonstrate how any pair of MUMs with $d$ outcomes defines a $d$ -dimensional superdense coding protocol. Using MUMs that are not direct sums of MUBs, we disprove a recent conjecture due to Nayak and Yuen on the rigidity of superdense coding, for infinitely many dimensions. The superdense coding protocols arising in the refutation reveal how shared entanglement may be used in a manner heretofore unknown.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are envisioned as a potentially transformative technology for future wireless communications. However, RISs’ inability to process signals and the attendant increased channel dimension have brought new challenges to RIS-assisted systems, including significantly increased pilot overhead required for channel estimation. To address these problems, several prior contributions that enhance the hardware architecture of RISs or develop algorithms to exploit the channels’ mathematical properties have been made, where the required pilot overhead is reduced to be proportional to the number of RIS elements. In this paper, we propose a dimension-independent channel state information (CSI) acquisition approach in which the required pilot overhead is independent of the number of RIS elements. Specifically, in contrast to traditional signal transmission methods, where signals from the base station (BS) and the users are transmitted in different time slots, we propose a novel method in which signals are transmitted from the BS and the user simultaneously during CSI acquisition. With this method, an electromagnetic interference random field (IRF) will be induced on the RIS, and we propose the structure of sensing RIS to capture its features. Moreover, we develop three algorithms for parameter estimation in this system, in which one of the proposed vM-EM algorithm is analyzed with the fixed-point perturbation method to obtain an asymptotic achievable bound. In addition, we also derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and an asymptotic expression for characterizing the best possible performance of the proposed algorithms. Simulation results verify that our proposed signal transmission method and the corresponding algorithms can achieve dimension-independent CSI acquisition for beamforming.},

The basic algorithm for solving the partial-inverse problem is a common parent algorithm of a Berlekamp–Massey algorithm, a Euclidean algorithm, and yet another algorithm, all of which are obtained as easy variations of the basic algorithm. Decoding Gabidulin codes can be reduced to the partial-inverse problem via a key equation with a new converse.

Using a novel description of polar codes as monomial codes through negative monomials, we prove the equivalence between the notion of decreasing monomial codes and the universal partial order (UPO) framework for polar codes; this property is widely believed to hold true but a formal proof was missing. We further provide a rigorous mathematical connection between code word permutations and affine transformations, an important link to understand the considered automorphisms. Based on this mathematical formalisms, we analyze the algebraic properties of the affine automorphisms group of polar codes, providing a novel description of its structure. We classify automorphisms such that all automorphisms in the same class lead to the same result under permutation decoding, which gives rise to the concept of redundant automorphisms. Mathematically this is achieved by introducing equivalence classes of affine automorphisms under AE-based decoding. For practical application, we provide an algorithm to compute representatives for the equivalence classes, such that one automorphism from each equivalence class can be selected for use in AE decoding. A numerical analysis of the error correction performance of AE decoding of polar codes, based on equivalence classes, concludes the paper.},

We model this problem via an adversarial noise, presenting a formal framework and a series of techniques to obtain upper and lower bounds on the network’s (1-shot) capacity, improving on the best currently known results. In particular, we show that traditional cut-set bounds are not tight in general in the presence of a restricted adversary, and that the non-tightness of these is caused precisely by the restrictions imposed on the noise (and not, as one may expect, by the alphabet size). We also show that, in sharp contrast with the typical situation within network coding, capacity cannot be achieved in general by combining linear network coding with end-to-end channel coding, not even when the underlying network has a single source and a single terminal. We finally illustrate how network decoding techniques are necessary to achieve capacity in the scenarios we examine, exhibiting capacity-achieving schemes and lower bounds for various classes of networks.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the decoding of fountain codes where the received symbols may have errors. It is motivated by the application of fountain codes in DNA-based data storage systems where the inner code decoding, which generally has undetectable errors, is performed before the outer fountain code decoding. We propose a novel and efficient decoding algorithm, namely basis-finding algorithm (BFA), followed by three implementations. The key idea of the BFA is to find a basis of the received symbols, and then use the most reliable basis elements to recover the source symbols with the inactivation decoding. Gaussian elimination is used to find the basis and to identify the most reliable basis elements. As a result, the BFA has polynomial time complexity. For random fountain codes, we are able to derive some theoretical bounds for the frame error rate (FER) of the BFA. Extensive simulations with Luby transform (LT) codes show that, the BFA has significantly lower FER than the belief propagation (BP) algorithm except for an extremely large amount of received symbols, and the FER of the BFA generally decreases as the average weight of basis elements increases.},

  abstract     = {One pervasive challenge in providing a high quality-of-service for live communication is to recover lost packets in real-time. Streaming codes are a class of erasure codes that are designed for such strict, low-latency streaming communication settings. Motivated by applications that transmit messages whose sizes vary over time, such as live video streaming, this paper considers the setting of streaming codes under variable-size messages. In practice, streaming codes operate in an “online” setting where the sizes of the future messages are unknown. “Offline” codes, in contrast, have access to the sizes of all messages, including future ones. This paper introduces the first online rate-optimal streaming codes for communicating over a burst-only packet loss channel for two broad parameter regimes. These two online codes match the rates of optimal offline codes for the two settings despite the apparent advantage of the offline setting. This paper further establishes that online codes cannot attain the optimal rate for offline codes for all remaining parameter settings.},

According to the classification of the quotient space of $\mathrm {RM}(6,6)/\mathrm {RM}(3,6)$ , we classify all 7-variable Boolean functions into 66 types. Firstly, we prove 62 types (among 66) cannot have third-order nonlinearity 21; Secondly, we prove that any function in the remaining 4 types can be transformed into a type (6, 10) function, if its third-order nonlinearity is 21; Finally, we transform type (6, 10) functions into a specific form, and prove the functions in that form cannot achieve the third-order nonlinearity 21 (with the assistance of computers). By the way, we prove that the affine transformation group over any finite field can be generated by two elements.},

The finite-length (elementary) trapping and (fully) absorbing set enumerators for unstructured irregular GLDPC code ensembles are derived using generating functions. An efficient method to evaluate the asymptotic trapping and (fully) absorbing set distributions is presented, which requires solving a system of equations. Using this method, the asymptotic distribution of trapping and (fully) absorbing sets are evaluated for some example GLDPC code ensembles. Experimental results show that the proposed definitions yield graph structures that are harmful for bit flipping decoders. The generating function approach is also used to derive the finite-length and asymptotic trapping and (elementary) absorbing set enumerators for non-binary irregular LDPC code ensembles.},

Of particular interest are the exceptional ones, as defined in 2018 by the first author and Zhou, for which partial classification results are known. In this paper we propose a unified algebraic description of $\mathbb {F}_{q^{n}}$ -linear maximum rank distance codes, introducing the notion of exceptional linear maximum rank distance codes of a given index. Such a connection naturally extends the notion of exceptionality for a scattered polynomial in the rank metric framework and provides a generalization of Moore sets in the monomial MRD context. We move towards the classification of exceptional linear MRD codes, by showing that the ones of index zero are generalized Gabidulin codes and proving that in the positive index case the code contains an exceptional scattered polynomial of the same index.},

  abstract     = {The problem of learning a channel decoder is considered for two channel models. The first model is an additive noise channel whose noise distribution is unknown and nonparametric. The learner is provided with a fixed codebook and a dataset comprised of independent samples of the noise, and is required to select a precision matrix for a nearest neighbor decoder in terms of the Mahalanobis distance. The second model is a non-linear channel with additive white Gaussian noise and unknown channel transformation. The learner is provided with a fixed codebook and a dataset comprised of independent input-output samples of the channel, and is required to select a matrix for a nearest neighbor decoder with a linear kernel. For both models, the objective of maximizing the margin of the decoder is addressed. Accordingly, for each channel model, a regularized loss minimization problem with a codebook-related regularization term and hinge-like loss function is developed, which is inspired by the support vector machine paradigm for classification problems. Expected generalization error bounds for the error probability loss function are provided for both models, under optimal choice of the regularization parameter. For the additive noise channel, a theoretical guidance for choosing the training signal-to-noise ratio is proposed based on this bound. In addition, for the non-linear channel, a high probability uniform generalization error bound is provided for the hypothesis class. For each channel, a stochastic sub-gradient descent algorithm for solving the regularized loss minimization problem is proposed, and an optimization error bound is stated. The performance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated through several examples.},

Given any constants $0 &amp;lt; \alpha, \varepsilon &amp;lt; 1/2$ , and an arbitrary bipartite graph with $N$ vertices on the left, $M &amp;lt; N$ vertices on the right, and left degree $D$ such that any left subset $S$ of size at most $\alpha N$ has at least $(1- \varepsilon)|S|D$ neighbors, we show that the corresponding linear code given by parity checks on the right has distance at least roughly $\frac {\alpha N}{2 \varepsilon }$ . This is strictly better than the best known previous result of $2(1- \varepsilon) \alpha N$ Sudan, (2000), Viderman, (2013) whenever $\varepsilon &amp;lt; 1/2$ , and improves the previous result significantly when $\varepsilon $ is small. Furthermore, we show that this distance is tight in general, thus providing a complete characterization of the distance of general expander codes. Next, we provide several efficient decoding algorithms, which vastly improve previous results in terms of the fraction of errors corrected, whenever $\varepsilon &amp;lt; \frac {1}{4}$ . Finally, we also give a bound on the list-decoding radius of general expander codes, which beats the classical Johnson bound in certain situations (e.g., when the graph is almost regular and the code has a high rate). Our techniques exploit novel combinatorial properties of bipartite expander graphs. In particular, we establish a new size-expansion tradeoff, which may be of independent interests.},

Specifically, we derive achievable refined asymptotics under both the joint excess-distortion probability (JEP) and the separate excess-distortion probabilities (SEP) criteria. For both second-order and moderate deviations asymptotics, we consider two types of codebooks: the spherical codebook where each codeword is drawn independently and uniformly from the surface of a sphere and the i.i.d. Gaussian codebook where each component of each codeword is drawn independently from a Gaussian distribution. We establish the achievable second-order rate-region under JEP and we show that under SEP any memoryless source satisfying mild moment conditions is strongly successively refinable. When specialized to a Gaussian memoryless source (GMS), our results provide an alternative achievability proof with specific code design. We show that under JEP and SEP, the same moderate deviations constant is achievable. For large deviations asymptotics, we only consider the i.i.d. Gaussian codebook since the i.i.d. Gaussian codebook has better performance than the spherical codebook in this regime for the one layer mismatched rate-distortion problem (Zhou et al., 2019). We derive achievable exponents of both JEP and SEP and specialize our results to a GMS, which appears to be a novel result of independent interest.},

We apply this algorithm to rate distortion and its variants including the quantum setting, and show the usefulness of our general algorithm. In fact, existing applications of Arimoto-Blahut algorithm to rate distortion theory make the optimization of the weighted sum of the mutual information and the cost function by using the Lagrange multiplier. However, in rate distortion theory, it is needed to minimize the mutual information under the constant constraint for the cost function. Our algorithm directly solves this minimization.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) interference networks with arbitrary number of transmitters and receivers, where both the transmitters and receivers are equipped with caches. The main goal is to design content placement and delivery schemes that minimize the worst case normalized delivery time (NDT). First, we propose a delivery scheme for the cache-aided Single-Input-Multiple-Output (SIMO) interference networks. Then, we obtain the achievable NDT of the cache-aided MIMO interference networks using the decomposition property of splitting each multi-antenna transmitter into multiple single antenna transmitters. Furthermore, we derive an information-theoretic bound on the optimal NDT of the cache-aided MIMO interference network. Analytical results show that the proposed scheme is within a multiplicative gap of 2 from the derived lower bound independent of all system parameters for any uncoded cache placement scheme. We also derive a novel delivery scheme for the cache-aided Multi-Input-Single-Output (MISO) interference network outperforming our proposed scheme for the cache-aided MIMO interference network. The numerical results show the superiority of our proposed scheme over the state-of-the-art schemes in the literature. Our results show that the coded caching gain has a more significant contribution in reducing the transmission latency than the spatial multiplexing gain. Our results indicate that the receive-antennas become more effective in reducing the NDT than the transmit-antennas in the presence of caches at the receiver-side. In addition, we show that increasing the number of transmit-antennas has a higher gain in reducing the NDT than adding more transmitters in the cache-aided MISO interference network.},

In this paper, we explore the block fading optical wireless communication (OWC) channels and characterize the DMT in the presence of both optical peak- and average-power constraints. Three different fading distributions are considered, which reflect different channel conditions. In each channel condition, we obtain the optimal DMT when the block length is sufficiently large, and we also derive the lower and upper bounds of the DMT curve when the block length is small. These results are dramatically different from the existing DMT results in radio-frequency (RF) channels. These differences may be due to the fact that the optical input signal is real and bounded, while its RF counterpart is usually complex and unbounded.},

The pre-change observations are assumed to be stationary with a known distribution, while the post-change observations are allowed to be non-stationary with some possible parametric uncertainty in their distributions. In particular, it is assumed that the cumulative Kullback-Leibler divergence between the post-change and the pre-change distributions grows in a certain manner with time after the change-point. For the case where the post-change distributions are known, a universal asymptotic lower bound on the delay is derived, as the false alarm rate goes to zero. Furthermore, a window-limited Cumulative Sum (CuSum) procedure is developed, and shown to achieve the lower bound asymptotically. For the case where the post-change distributions have parametric uncertainty, a window-limited (WL) generalized likelihood-ratio (GLR) CuSum procedure is developed and is shown to achieve the universal lower bound asymptotically. Extensions to the case with dependent observations are discussed. The analysis is validated through numerical results on synthetic data. The use of the WL-GLR-CuSum procedure in monitoring pandemics is also demonstrated.},

Based on the results, we develop two types of linearly convergent IB solvers, with one improves the performance of convergence over existing solvers while the other can be independent to the relevance-compression trade-off. Moreover, our results apply to PF, yielding a new class of linearly convergent PF solvers. Empirically, the proposed IB solvers IB obtain solutions that are comparable to the Blahut-Arimoto-based benchmark and is convergent for a wider range of the penalty coefficients than existing solvers. For PF, our non-greedy solvers can characterize the privacy-utility trade-off better than the clustering-based greedy solvers.},

  abstract     = {This work proposes a decentralized architecture, where individual agents aim at solving a classification problem while observing streaming features of different dimensions and arising from possibly different distributions. In the context of social learning, several useful strategies have been developed, which solve decision making problems through local cooperation across distributed agents and allow them to learn from streaming data. However, traditional social learning strategies rely on the fundamental assumption that each agent has significant prior knowledge of the underlying distribution of the observations. In this work we overcome this issue by introducing a machine learning framework that exploits social interactions over a graph, leading to a fully data-driven solution to the distributed classification problem. In the proposed social machine learning (SML) strategy, two phases are present: in the training phase, classifiers are independently trained to generate a belief over a set of hypotheses using a finite number of training samples; in the prediction phase, classifiers evaluate streaming unlabeled observations and share their instantaneous beliefs with neighboring classifiers. We show that the SML strategy enables the agents to learn consistently under this highly-heterogeneous setting and allows the network to continue learning even during the prediction phase when it is deciding on unlabeled samples. The prediction decisions are used to continually improve performance thereafter in a manner that is markedly different from most existing static classification schemes where, following training, the decisions on unlabeled data are not re-used to improve future performance.},

  abstract     = {Conditional Time-Memory-Data Trade-off (TMDTO) attack given by Biryukov and Shamir can be reduced to the following problem: “Find the minimum number of state bits that should be fixed in order to recover the maximum number of state bits by utilizing the keystream bits and value of rest of the state bits”. As per our literature survey, existing algorithms search for state bits that should be fixed (as minimum as possible) in order to recover the maximum possible state bits directly through the keystream bits. However, those algorithms are cipher specific and require extensive manual effort in analyzing the keystream bit equations. In this manuscript, we have constructed an automated framework that is easy to implement and solves the above problem (for the case when bits are fixed to 0) for any NLFSR based stream cipher with better complexity, thereby reducing manual efforts. However, we do not claim any global optimum for fixed bits. We tried to reduce the number of fixed bits as much as possible. To show that our algorithm is applicable to a majority of NLFSR based stream ciphers, we implement it on three different stream ciphers: LIZARD, GRAIN-128a and ESPRESSO. It improves all existing TMDTO results on these ciphers. The framework involves modelling keystream bit equations into a set of linear constraints, which is then solved by using a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver, Gurobi. The advantages of our automated framework over other methods are that we can achieve better results with far less effort, and it can be applied to any stream cipher of a similar structure with very ease. To the best of our knowledge, our MILP model is the first work that converts the conditional TMDTO of a stream cipher into a linear optimization problem. As a consequence, for LIZARD cipher, we reduce the number of fixed bits by 20 bits from the previous best result when the number of recovered bits is 18. In the case of GRAIN-128a, the highest reduction in the number of fixed bits is by 34 bits when the number of recovered bits is 35. Lastly, for ESPRESSO cipher, the reduction is by 7 bits when the number of recovered bits is 35.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of constructing secure cryptographic hash functions from subverted ideal primitives. Hash functions are used to instantiate Random Oracles in cryptographic protocols. The indifferentiability security notion is a popular tool to certify the structural soundness of a hash design for such instantiations. In CRYPTO 2018, Russell, Tang, Yung, and Zhou introduced the notion of crooked-indifferentiability to extend this paradigm even when the underlying primitive of the hashing mode is subverted. They showed that an $n$ -to- $n$ -bit function implemented using Enveloped XOR construction (EXor) with $3n+1$ many independent $n$ -to- $n$ -bit functions and $3n^{2}$ -bit random seed can be proven secure asymptotically in the crooked-indifferentiability setting. Unfortunately, known techniques to prove crooked-indifferentiability are extremely complicated, and no practical hashing mode has been analyzed in this setting. 1) We introduce new techniques to prove crooked-indifferentiability. We establish that upper bounding the subversion probability of a chaining query is sufficient to argue subversion resistance of a standard indifferentiable mode of operation. Our technique links standard indifferentiability and crooked-indifferentiability and circumvents the complications of proving the consistency of the simulator in the crooked setting. 2) We prove crooked-indifferentiability of the sponge construction when the underlying primitive is modelled as an $n$ -to- $n$ -bit random function. Our proofs only require $n$ -bit randomly chosen but fixed IV and do not mandate any independent function requirement. The result naturally extends to the Merkle-Damgård domain extension with prefix-free padding. Our results minimize required randomness and solve the main open problem raised by Russell, Tang, Yung, and Zhou.},

  abstract     = {Minimal linear codes have important applications in secure communications, including in the framework of secret sharing schemes and secure multi-party computation. A lot of research have been carried out to derive codes with few weights (but more importantly, being minimal) using algebraic or geometric approaches. One of the main power and fructify algebraic methods is based on the design of those codes by employing functions over finite fields. Li et al. (2021) have recently identified some binary linear codes with few weights from two classes of two-to-one functions. In this paper, our ultimate objective is to expand the class of codes derived from the paper of Li et al. by proposing larger classes of binary linear codes with few weights via generic constructions involving other known families of two-to-one functions over the finite field $\mathbb {F}_{2^{n}}$ of order $2^{n}$ . We succeed in constructing such codes, and we also completely determine their weight distributions. The linear codes presented in this paper differ in parameters from those known in the literature. Besides, some of them are optimal concerning the well-known Griesmer bound. Notably, we prove that our codes are either optimal or almost optimal with respect to the online Database of Grassl. We next observe that the derived binary linear codes also have the minimality property for most cases. We then describe the access structures of the secret-sharing schemes based on their dual codes. Finally, we solve two problems left open in the paper by Li et al. (more specifically, a complete solution to Problem 2 and a partial solution to Problem 1).},

The goal of PIR-PCSI is to allow a user to efficiently retrieve a desired message ${W}_{{\theta }}$ , which is one of $K$ independent messages that are stored at a server, while utilizing private side information of a linear combination of a uniformly chosen size- $M$ subset ( ${\mathcal {S}}\subset [K]$ ) of messages. The settings PIR-PCSI-I and PIR-PCSI-II correspond to the constraints that ${\theta }$ is generated uniformly from $[K]\setminus {\mathcal {S}}$ , and $ {\mathcal {S}}$ , respectively. In each case, $({\theta }, {\mathcal {S}})$ must be kept private from the server. The capacity is defined as the supremum over message and field sizes, of achievable rates (number of bits of desired message retrieved per bit of download) and is characterized by Heidarzadeh et al. for PIR-PCSI-I in general, and for PIR-PCSI-II for $M&amp;gt;(K+1)/2$ as $(K-M+1)^{-1}$ . For $2\leq M\leq (K+1)/2$ the capacity of PIR-PCSI-II remains open, and it is conjectured that even in this case the capacity is $(K-M+1)^{-1}$ . We show the capacity of PIR-PCSI-II is equal to $2/K$ for $2 \leq M \leq \frac {K+1}{2}$ , which is strictly larger than the conjectured value, and does not depend on $M$ within this parameter regime. Remarkably, half the side-information is found to be redundant. We also characterize the infimum capacity (infimum over fields instead of supremum), and the capacity with private coefficients. The results are generalized to PIR-PCSI-I ( $\theta \in [K]\setminus \mathcal {S}$ ) and PIR-PCSI ( $\theta \in [K]$ ) settings.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of identifying the best arm in a multi-armed bandit environment when each arm is a time-homogeneous and ergodic discrete-time Markov process on a common, finite state space. The state evolution on each arm is governed by the arm’s transition probability matrix (TPM). A decision entity that knows the set of arm TPMs but not the exact mapping of the TPMs to the arms, wishes to find the index of the best arm as quickly as possible, subject to an upper bound on the error probability. The decision entity selects one arm at a time sequentially, and all the unselected arms continue to undergo state evolution (restless arms). For this problem, we derive the first-known problem instance-dependent asymptotic lower bound on the growth rate of the expected time required to find the index of the best arm, where the asymptotics is as the error probability vanishes. Further, we propose a sequential policy that, for an input parameter $R$ , forcibly selects an arm that has not been selected for $R$ consecutive time instants. We show that this policy achieves an upper bound that depends on $R$ and is monotonically non-increasing as $R\to \infty $ . The question of whether, in general, the limiting value of the upper bound as $R\to \infty $ matches with the lower bound, remains open. We identify a special case in which the upper and the lower bounds match. Prior works on best arm identification have dealt with (a) independent and identically distributed observations from the arms, and (b) rested Markov arms, whereas our work deals with the more difficult setting of restless Markov arms.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study community detection when we observe $m$ sparse networks and a high dimensional covariate matrix, all encoding the same community structure among $n$ subjects. In the asymptotic regime where the number of features $p$ and the number of subjects $n$ grow proportionally, we derive an exact formula of asymptotic minimum mean square error (MMSE) for estimating the common community structure in the balanced two block case using an orchestrated approximate message passing algorithm. The formula implies the necessity of integrating information from multiple data sources. Consequently, it induces a sharp threshold of phase transition between the regime where detection (i.e., weak recovery) is possible and the regime where no procedure performs better than random guess. The asymptotic MMSE depends on the covariate signal-to-noise ratio in a more subtle way than the phase transition threshold. In the special case of $m=1$ , our asymptotic MMSE formula complements the pioneering work Deshpande et al., (2018) which found the sharp threshold when $m=1$ . A practical variant of the theoretically justified algorithm with spectral initialization leads to an estimator whose empirical MSEs closely approximate theoretical predictions over simulated examples.},

  abstract     = {We seek an entropy estimator for discrete distributions with fully empirical accuracy bounds. As stated, this goal is infeasible without some prior assumptions on the distribution. We discover that a certain information moment assumption renders the problem feasible. We argue that the moment assumption is natural and, in some sense, minimalistic — weaker than finite support or tail decay conditions. Under the moment assumption, we provide the first finite-sample entropy estimates for infinite alphabets, nearly recovering the known minimax rates. Moreover, we demonstrate that our empirical bounds are significantly sharper than the state-of-the-art bounds, for various natural distributions and non-trivial sample regimes. Along the way, we give a dimension-free analogue of the Cover-Thomas result on entropy continuity (with respect to total variation distance) for finite alphabets, which may be of independent interest. Additionally, we resolve all of the open problems posed by Jürgensen and Matthews, 2010.},

  abstract     = {Consider the task of estimating a 3-order $n \times n \times n$ tensor from noisy observations of randomly chosen entries in the sparse regime. We introduce a similarity based collaborative filtering algorithm for estimating a tensor from sparse observations and argue that it achieves sample complexity that nearly matches the conjectured computationally efficient lower bound on the sample complexity for the setting of low-rank tensors. Our algorithm uses the matrix obtained from the flattened tensor to compute similarity, and estimates the tensor entries using a nearest neighbor estimator. We prove that the algorithm recovers a finite rank tensor with maximum entry-wise error (MEE) and mean-squared-error (MSE) decaying to 0 as long as each entry is observed independently with probability $p = \Omega (n^{-3/2 + \kappa })$ for any arbitrarily small $ \kappa &amp;gt; 0$ . More generally, we establish robustness of the estimator, showing that when arbitrary noise bounded by $ \boldsymbol { \varepsilon }\geq 0$ is added to each observation, the estimation error with respect to MEE and MSE degrades by ${\sf poly}(\boldsymbol { \varepsilon })$ . Consequently, even if the tensor may not have finite rank but can be approximated within $ \boldsymbol { \varepsilon }\geq 0$ by a finite rank tensor, then the estimation error converges to ${\sf poly}(\boldsymbol { \varepsilon })$ . Our analysis sheds insight into the conjectured sample complexity lower bound, showing that it matches the connectivity threshold of the graph used by our algorithm for estimating similarity between coordinates.},

To tackle corresponding constrained minimization (respectively maximization) problems by a newly developed dimension-free bare (pure) simulation method, is the main goal of this paper. Almost no assumptions (like convexity) on the set of constraints are needed, within our discrete setup of arbitrary dimension, and our method is precise (i.e., converges in the limit). As a side effect, we also derive an innovative way of constructing new useful distances/divergences. To illustrate the core of our approach, we present numerous solved cases. The potential for wide-spread applicability is indicated, too; in particular, we deliver many recent references for uses of the involved distances/divergences and entropies in various different research fields (which may also serve as an interdisciplinary interface).},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the two-timescale transmission scheme for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where the beamforming at the base station (BS) is adapted to the rapidly-changing instantaneous channel state information (CSI), while the nearly-passive beamforming at the RIS is adapted to the slowly-changing statistical CSI. Specifically, we first consider a system model with spatially independent Rician fading channels, which leads to tractable expressions and offers analytical insights on the power scaling laws and on the impact of various system parameters. Then, we analyze a more general system model with spatially correlated Rician fading channels and consider the impact of electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by any uncontrollable sources present in the considered environment. For both case studies, we apply the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator to estimate the aggregated channel from the users to the BS, utilize the low-complexity maximal ratio combining (MRC) detector, and derive a closed-form expression for a lower bound of the achievable rate. Besides, an accelerated gradient ascent-based algorithm is proposed for solving the minimum user rate maximization problem. Numerical results show that, in the considered setup, the spatially independent model without EMI is sufficiently accurate when the inter-distance of the RIS elements is sufficiently large and the EMI is mild. In the presence of spatial correlation, we show that an RIS can better tailor the wireless environment. Furthermore, it is shown that deploying an RIS in a massive MIMO network brings significant gains when the RIS is deployed close to the cell-edge users. On the other hand, the gains obtained by the users distributed over a large area are shown to be modest.},

Secondly, by studying deeply the construction of linear codes in this paper, we find a necessary and sufficient condition of the linear codes to be minimal and to be violated the AB condition. As a result, we get three infinite families of minimal linear codes violating the AB condition.

The current paper constructs error-correcting codes for simultaneously correcting short (tandem) duplications and at most $p$ edits, where a short duplication generates a copy of a substring with length $\leq 3$ and inserts the copy following the original substring, and an edit is a substitution, deletion, or insertion. Compared to the state-of-the-art codes for duplications only, the proposed codes correct up to $p$ edits (in addition to duplications) at the additional cost of roughly $8p(\log _{q} n) (1+o(1))$ symbols of redundancy, thus achieving the same asymptotic rate, where $q\ge 4$ is the alphabet size and $p$ is a constant. Furthermore, the time complexities of both the encoding and decoding processes are polynomial when $p$ is a constant with respect to the code length.},

  abstract     = {The intersection ${\mathbf{C}}\bigcap {\mathbf{C}}^{\perp }$ ( ${\mathbf{C}}\bigcap {\mathbf{C}}^{\perp _{h}}$ ) of a linear code ${\mathbf{C}}$ and its Euclidean dual ${\mathbf{C}}^{\perp }$ (Hermitian dual ${\mathbf{C}}^{\perp _{h}}$ ) is called the Euclidean (Hermitian) hull of this code. It is natural to consider the hull-variation problem when a linear code ${\mathbf{C}}$ is transformed to an equivalent code ${\mathbf{v}} \cdot {\mathbf{C}}$ . In this paper we introduce the maximal hull dimension as an invariant of a linear code with respect to the equivalent transformations. Then some basic properties of the maximal hull dimension are studied. We prove that for a nonnegative integer $h$ satisfying $0 \leq h \leq n-1$ , a linear $[2n], [n]_{q}$ self-dual code is equivalent to a linear $h$ -dimension hull code. On the opposite direction we prove that a linear LCD code over ${\mathbf{F}}_{2^{s}}$ satisfying $d\geq 2$ and $d^{\perp } \geq 2$ is equivalent to a linear one-dimension hull code under a weak condition. Several new families of LCD negacyclic codes and LCD BCH codes over ${\mathbf{F}}_{3}$ are also constructed. Our method can be applied to the generalized Reed-Solomon codes and the generalized twisted Reed-Solomon codes to construct arbitrary dimension hull MDS codes. Some new entanglement-assisted quantum error-correction (EAQEC) codes including MDS and almost MDS EAQEC codes are constructed. Many EAQEC codes over small fields are constructed from optimal Hermitian self-dual codes.},

  abstract     = {Let ${\mathcal C}$ be an $[n, k]$ linear code over the finite field ${\mathbb F}_{q}$ . Let $d_{I}({\mathcal C})$ denote its insertion-deletion (insdel for short) distance, which characterizes the insdel error-correcting capability of ${\mathcal C}$ . To determine the insdel distances of linear codes is a very challenging problem. In this paper we propose a strict half-Singleton upper bound $d_{I}({\mathcal C}) \leq 2(n-2k+1)$ if ${\mathcal C}$ does not contain the codeword with all 1s, which generalizes the half-Singleton bound on the insdel distances of linear codes due to Cheng-Guruswami-Haeupler-Li, and a stronger direct upper bound $d_{I}({\mathcal C}) \leq 2(d_{H}({\mathcal C})-t)$ under a weak condition, where $t\geq 1$ is a positive integer determined by the generator matrix and $d_{H}({\mathcal C})$ denotes the Hamming distance of ${\mathcal C}$ . A sufficient condition for a linear code attaining the strict half-Singleton bound is given. We prove that the code length of an optimal binary linear insdel code with respect to the (strict) half-Singleton bound is about twice its dimension and conjecture that optimal binary linear insdel codes have exact parameters $[{2k, k, 4}]$ or $[{2k+1, k, 4}]$ with respect to the half-Singleton bound or the strict half-Singleton bound, respectively. Moreover, interestingly explicit optimal linear insdel codes attaining the (strict) half-Singleton bound, with the code length being independent of the finite field size, are given.},

Delsarte’s LP is the weakest member of this family and our LP yields increasingly tighter upper bounds on the rate as its control parameter increases. Numerical experiments show significant improvement compared to Delsarte. These convincing numerical results, and the large variety of tools available for asymptotic analysis, give us hope that our work will lead to new improved asymptotic upper bounds on the possible rate of linear codes. A slightly prior work by Coregliano, Jeronimo and Jones offers a closely related family of linear programs which converges to the true bound. Here we provide a new proof of convergence for the same LPs.},

In this work, a vertical-horizontal framework is proposed for building RRCs from MDS array codes and regenerating codes (RCs). Particularly for RRCs with the minimum storage (i.e., MSRR codes), the framework is further improved to achieve lower sub-packetization. As a key for building MSRR codes, MSR codes (i.e., RCs with the minimum storage) with improved sub-packetization level are also developed. Applying the newly derived MSR codes into the vertical-horizontal framework, MSRR codes with an improved sub-packetization level are explicitly constructed, and those achieving the lowest sub-packetization by far are proved to exist over sufficiently large fields.},

Roughly speaking, this happens when the metric space is (i) expanding and (ii) well-spread, and (iii) a certain random variable on the boundary of a ball has a small tail. As applications, we show that the volume of intersection of balls in Hamming, Johnson spaces and symmetric groups decay exponentially as their centers drift apart. To verify condition (iii), we prove some large deviation inequalities ‘on a slice’ for functions with Lipschitz conditions. We then use these estimates on intersection volumes to 1) obtain a sharp lower bound on list-decodability of random q-ary codes, confirming a conjecture of Li and Wootters, and 2) improve the classical bound of Levenshtein from 1971 on constant weight codes by a factor linear in dimension, resolving a problem raised by Jiang and Vardy. Our probabilistic point of view also offers a unified framework to obtain improvements on other Gilbert-Varshamov type bounds, giving conceptually simple and calculation-free proofs for $q$ -ary codes, permutation codes, and spherical codes. Another consequence is a counting result on the number of codes, showing ampleness of large codes.},

Recently, explicit constructions of cooperative MSR codes were given by Ye (IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 2020) with sub-packetization level $(d-k+h)(d-k+1)^{n}$ . Specifically, the sub-packetization level is $(h+1)2^{n}$ when $d=k+1$ . In this paper, we propose a new cooperative repair scheme by means of the inter-instance pairing and intra-instance pairing inherited from the perfect code which reduces the sub-packetization to $2^{n}$ when $(h+1)|2^{n}$ and $(2\ell +1)2^{n}$ when $h+1=(2\ell +1)2^{m}$ for $\ell \ge 1$ , $m\ge 0$ with $d=k+1$ helper nodes. That is to say, the sub-packetization is $h + 1 $ times or $2^{m}$ times less than Ye’s. It turned out to be the best result so far known.},

Based on the mutual information spectrum analysis, the maximum achievable rate of ReRAM channel with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) binary inputs is derived as an explicit function of channel parameters such as the distribution of cell selector failures and channel noise level. Due to the randomness of cell selector failures, the ReRAM channel demonstrates multi-status characteristic. For each status, it is shown that as the array size is large, the fraction of cells affected by sneak paths approaches a constant value. Therefore, the mutual information spectrum of the ReRAM channel is formulated as a mixture of multiple stationary channels. Maximum achievable rates of the ReRAM channel with different settings, such as single- and across-array codings, with and without data shaping, and optimal and treating-interference-as-noise (TIN) decodings, are compared. These results provide valuable insights on the code design for ReRAM.},

Recently, a notion of strongly separable matrix has been introduced, which has the same identifying ability as a disjunct matrix, but has larger rate. In this paper, we use a modified probabilistic method to improve the lower bounds for the rate of strongly separable matrices. Using this method, we also improve the lower bounds for some well-known combinatorial structures, including locally thin set families and cancellative set families.},

In this system, the receiver cannot control the access to these sequences and can only draw from these sequences, unaware which sequence has been drawn. Further, the drawn sequences are susceptible to errors. In this paper, a suitable channel model that models this input-output relationship is analyzed and its information capacity is computed for a wide range of parameters and a general class of drawing distributions. This generalizes previous results for the noiseless case and specific drawing distributions. The analysis can guide future DNA-based data storage experiments by establishing theoretical limits on achievable information rates and by proposing decoding techniques that can be useful for practical implementations of decoders.},

By studying the error probability of the code over an auxiliary channel, we find a lower bound to the probability of error of mismatched decoding. The bound is shown to decay exponentially for coding rates smaller than a new upper bound to the mismatch capacity which is established in this paper. For rates higher than the new upper bound, the error probability is shown to be bounded away from zero. The new upper bound is shown to improve over previous upper bounds to the mismatch capacity.},

  abstract     = {To tackle a challenge in high-dimensional complex features information processing, this study extends the permanent scale Wigner distribution and the single scale $k$ -Wigner distribution (kWD, formerly known as $\tau $ -Wigner distribution) to a novel multiscale parameterized Wigner distribution. That is the so-called $\mathbf {K}$ -Wigner distribution (KWD) which is able to use different scales to extract different types of features at different dimensions. Heisenberg-type uncertainty inequalities of the KWD are established, giving rise to the tightest universal attainable lower bound for all functions on the uncertainty product in time-KWD and Fouier transform-KWD domains, and two versions of attainable lower bounds for complex-valued functions. The obtained results solve an important concern regarding the limit of the KWD’s time-frequency resolution influenced by the parameter matrix. As an application, the derived uncertainty inequalities are applied to estimate the bandwidth in KWD domains. The time-frequency resolution performance of the multiscale KWD, as compared with that of the single scale kWD, is investigated in details. The optimal parameter matrix of the KWD achieving the best performance is then generated, which solves an important concern regarding the KWD’s parameter matrix selection. Examples are also carried out to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed technique.},

In this article, we introduce the notion of vectorial bent-negabent functions and show that in general for a vectorial bent-negabent function $F\colon {\mathbb {F}} _{2}^{2m} \rightarrow {\mathbb {F}} _{2}^{k}$ we necessarily have that $k \leq m-1$ . We specify a class of vectorial bent-negabent functions of maximal output dimension $m-1$ by using a set of linear complete mappings. On the other hand, we propose several methods (one of which is generic) of specifying vector spaces of nonlinear complete mappings which then induce vectorial bent-negabent functions (whose dimension is not maximal) having a certain number of component functions outside the completed Maiorana-McFarland class. Finally, we derive an upper bound on the maximum number of bent-negabent components for mappings $F\colon {\mathbb {F}} _{2}^{2m} \rightarrow {\mathbb {F}} _{2}^{k}$ , where $m \leq k \leq 2m$ , and identify some families of these functions reaching this upper bound.},

We extend Björck’s classification result of two-valued CAZAC sequences by providing a complete classification of all almost 2-valued (i.e., two-valued except for the first position which uses a third value) CASAC sequences. While Björck’s original work dealt only with primes p, we extend his ideas to any abelian group of order $v\equiv 1\pmod {4}$ , as opposed to restricting just to the prime fields GF(p). Björck sequences have better ambiguity function than Zadoff-Chu sequences, making them suitable for radar and communications applications in the presence of high Doppler shifts. In fact, the discrete narrow band ambiguity function has an optimal bound in case of Björck sequences (as opposed to Gauss sequences). A one-parameter infinite family of CASAC we construct would have applications in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) areas. Toward MIMO applications, we introduce a performance measure we term as cross merit factor to study cross correlation behavior, generalizing the well-known notion of Golay Merit Factor (GMF).},

  abstract     = {Networks with hop-by-hop flow control occur in several contexts, from data centers to systems architectures (e.g., wormhole-routing networks on chip). A worst-case end-to-end delay in such networks can be computed using Network Calculus (NC), an algebraic theory where traffic and service guarantees are represented as curves in a Cartesian plane. NC uses transformation operations, e.g., the min-plus convolution, to model how the traffic profile changes with the traversal of network nodes. NC allows one to model flow-controlled systems, hence one can compute the end-to-end service curve describing the minimum service guaranteed to a flow traversing a tandem of flow-controlled nodes. However, while the algebraic expression of such an end-to-end service curve is quite compact, its computation is often intractable from an algorithmic standpoint: data structures tend to grow quickly to unfeasibly large sizes, making operations intractable, even with as few as three hops. In this paper, we propose computational and algebraic techniques to mitigate the above problem. We show that existing techniques (such as reduction to compact domains ) cannot be used in this case, and propose an arsenal of solutions, which include methods to mitigate the data representation space explosion as well as computationally efficient algorithms for the min-plus convolution operation. We show that our solutions allow a significant speedup, enable analysis of previously unfeasible case studies, and - since they do not rely on any approximation - still provide exact results.},

The A rbitrarily V arying W iretap C hannel (AVWC) provides information-theoretical bounds on how much information can be exchanged even in the presence of an active attacker. If the active attacker has non-causal side information, situations in which a legitimate communication system has been hacked can be modeled. We investigate the AVWC with non-causal side information at the jammer for the case that there exists a best channel to the eavesdropper. Non-causal side information means that the transmitted codeword is known to an active adversary before it is transmitted. By considering the maximum error criterion, we also allow messages to be known at the jammer before the corresponding codeword is transmitted. A single-letter formula for the C ommon R andomness (CR)-assisted secrecy capacity is derived. Additionally, we provide a formula for the CR-assisted secrecy capacity for the cases where the channel to the eavesdropper is strongly degraded, strongly noisier, or strongly less capable with respect to the main channel. Furthermore, we compare our results to the CR-assisted secrecy capacity for the cases of maximum error criterion but without non-causal side information at the jammer (blind adversary), maximum error criterion with non-causal side information of the messages at the jammer (semi-blind adversary), and the case of average error criterion without non-causal side information at the jammer (blind adversary).},

  abstract     = {Gradient-related first-order methods have become the workhorse of large-scale numerical optimization problems. Many of these problems involve nonconvex objective functions with multiple saddle points, which necessitates an understanding of the behavior of discrete trajectories of first-order methods within the geometrical landscape of these functions. This paper concerns convergence of first-order discrete methods to a local minimum of nonconvex optimization problems that comprise strict-saddle points within the geometrical landscape. To this end, it focuses on analysis of discrete gradient trajectories around saddle neighborhoods, derives sufficient conditions under which these trajectories can escape strict-saddle neighborhoods in linear time, explores the contractive and expansive dynamics of these trajectories in neighborhoods of strict-saddle points that are characterized by gradients of moderate magnitude, characterizes the non-curving nature of these trajectories, and highlights the inability of these trajectories to re-enter the neighborhoods around strict-saddle points after exiting them. Based on these insights and analyses, the paper then proposes a simple variant of the vanilla gradient descent algorithm, termed Curvature Conditioned Regularized Gradient Descent (CCRGD) algorithm, which utilizes a check for an initial boundary condition to ensure its trajectories can escape strict-saddle neighborhoods in linear time. Convergence analysis of the CCRGD algorithm, which includes its rate of convergence to a local minimum, is also presented in the paper. Numerical experiments are then provided on a test function as well as a low-rank matrix factorization problem to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.},

In this paper, we focus on the class of trees that are arguably even more fundamental, namely homogeneous trees in which each pair of nodes that forms an edge has the same correlation $\rho $ . We ask whether we are able to further reduce the error probability of learning the structure of the homogeneous tree model when active learning is allowed. Our figure of merit is the error exponent , which quantifies the exponential rate of decay of the error probability with an increasing number of data samples. We design and analyze an algorithm Active Learning A lgorithm for T rees with H omogeneous E dges (ACTIVE-LATHE), which surprisingly boosts the error exponent by at least 40\% when $\rho $ is at least 0.8. For all other values of $\rho $ , we also observe commensurate, but more modest, improvements in the error exponent. Our analysis hinges on judiciously exploiting the minute but detectable statistical variation of the samples to allocate more data to parts of the graph in which we are less confident of being correct.},

The resulting method is called density convoluted support vector machine (DCSVM). We argue that the DCSVM is particularly more interesting than the standard SVM in the context of high-dimensional classification. We systematically study the rate of convergence of the elastic-net penalized DCSVM under general random design setting. We further develop novel efficient algorithm for computing elastic-net penalized DCSVM. Simulation studies and ten benchmark datasets are used to demonstrate the superior classification performance of elastic-net DCSVM over other competitors, and it is demonstrated in these numerical studies that the computation of DCSVM can be more than 100 times faster than that of the SVM.},

Initially, there is a single vertex affected by the cascade (the source) and the cascade spreads in discrete time steps across the network. Although the cascade evolution is hidden, one observes a noisy measurement of the evolution at each time step. Given this information, we aim to reliably estimate the cascade source as fast as possible. We investigate Bayesian and minimax formulations of the source estimation problem, and derive near-optimal estimators for simple cascade dynamics and network topologies. In the Bayesian setting, samples are taken until the error of the Bayes-optimal estimator falls below a threshold. For the minimax setting, we design a novel multi-hypothesis sequential probability ratio test. These optimal estimators require $\log \log n / \log (k - 1)$ observations for a $k$ -regular tree network, and $(\log n)^{\frac {1}{\ell + 1}}$ observations for a $\ell $ -dimensional lattice. We then discuss conjectures on source estimation in general topologies. Finally, we provide simulations which validate our theoretical results on trees and lattices, and illustrate the effectiveness of our methods for estimating the sources of cascades on Erdős-Rényi graphs.},

  abstract     = {The problem of finding a unique low dimensional decomposition of a given matrix has been a fundamental and recurrent problem in many areas. In this paper, we study the problem of seeking a unique decomposition of a low rank matrix $\boldsymbol Y\in \mathbb R ^{p\times n}$ that admits a sparse representation. Specifically, we consider $\boldsymbol Y= \boldsymbol A \boldsymbol X $ where the matrix $\boldsymbol A\in \mathbb R^{p\times r}$ has full column rank, with $r &amp;lt; \min {n,p}$ , and the matrix $\boldsymbol X\in \mathbb R^{r\times n}$ is element-wise sparse. We prove that this low rank, sparse decomposition of $\boldsymbol Y$ can be uniquely identified, up to some intrinsic signed permutation. Our approach relies on solving a nonconvex optimization problem constrained over the unit sphere. Our geometric analysis for its nonconvex optimization landscape shows that any strict local solution is close to the ground truth, and can be recovered by a simple data-driven initialization followed with any second order descent algorithm. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by numerical experiments. 1},

  abstract     = {The multicategory support vector machine (MSVM) has been widely used for multicategory classification. Despite its widespread popularity, regular MSVM cannot provide direct probabilistic results and suffers from excessive computational cost, as it is formulated on the hinge loss function and it solves a sum-to-zero constrained quadratic programming problem. In this study, we propose a general refinement of regular MSVM, termed as the simplex-based proximal MSVM (SPMSVM). Our SPMSVM uses a novel family of squared error loss functions in place of the hinge loss and it removes the explicit sum-to-zero constraint by the simplex structure. Consequently, the SPMSVM only requires solving an unconstrained linear system, leading to closed-form solutions. In addition, the SPMSVM can be cast into a weighted regression problem so that it is scalable for large-scale applications. Moreover, the SPMSVM naturally yields an estimate of the conditional category probability, which is more informative than regular MSVM. Theoretically, the SPMSVM is shown to include many existing MSVMs as its special cases, and its asymptotic and finite-sample statistical properties are well established. Simulations and real examples show that the proposed SPMSVM is a stable, scalable and competitive classifier.},

  abstract     = {The fundamental communication problem in the wireless Internet-of-Things (IoT) is to discover a massive number of devices and to provide them with reliable access to shared channels. Oftentimes these devices transmit short messages randomly and sporadically. This paper proposes a novel signaling scheme for grant-free massive access, where each device encodes its identity and/or information in a sparse set of tones. Such transmissions are implemented in the form of orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). Under some mild conditions and assuming device delays to be bounded unknown multiples of sampling intervals, sparse OFDMA is proved to enable arbitrarily reliable asynchronous device identification and message decoding with a codelength that is $O(K(\log K+\log S + \log N))$ , where $N$ denotes the device population, $K$ denotes the actual number of active devices, and $\log S$ is essentially equal to the number of information bits each device can send. The computational complexity for discovery and decoding can be made to be $O(K(\log K)(\log K+\log S+\log N)+K^{2}\log K)$ . As a proof of concept, a specific design is proposed to identify up to 200 active devices out of $N=2^{96}$ possible devices with up to 20 samples of delay, moderate signal-to-noise ratios, and fading. If the device population is $N=2^{48}$ instead, each active device can also transmit 48 bits to the access point at the same time. The codelength compares much more favorably with those of standard slotted ALOHA and carrier-sensing multiple access (CSMA) schemes.},

However, no infinite family of negacyclic codes supporting an infinite family of 3-designs has been reported in the literature. This is the main motivation of this paper. Let $q=p^{m}$ , where $p$ is an odd prime and $m \geq 2$ is an integer. The objective of this paper is to present an infinite family of cyclic codes over ${\mathrm {GF}}(q)$ supporting an infinite family of 3-designs and two infinite families of negacyclic codes over ${\mathrm {GF}}(q^{2})$ supporting two infinite families of 3-designs. The parameters and the weight distributions of these codes are determined. The subfield subcodes of these negacyclic codes over ${\mathrm {GF}}(q)$ are studied. Three infinite families of almost MDS codes are also presented. A constacyclic code over ${\mathrm {GF}}(4)$ supporting a 4-design and seven open problems are also presented in this paper.},

We obtain some basic properties and bounds of generalized $b$ -symbol weights which are called Singleton-like bounds for generalized $b$ -symbol weights. As examples, we calculate the generalized weight matrices for simplex codes and Hamming codes. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a linear code to be a $b$ -symbol MDS code by using the generator matrix and the parity check matrix of this linear code.

In this parameter setting, all previous constructions require the field size $\ell =\Omega _{h} (N^{h-1-o(1)})$ . It remains challenging to improve this bound.

  abstract     = {The construction of polar codes with code length $n=2^{m}$ involves $m$ layers of polar transforms. In this paper, we observe that after each layer of polar transforms, one can swap certain pairs of adjacent bits to accelerate the polarization process. More precisely, if the previous bit is more reliable than its next bit under the successive decoder, then switching the decoding order of these two adjacent bits will make the reliable bit even more reliable and the noisy bit even noisier. Based on this observation, we propose a new family of codes called the Adjacent-Bits-Swapped (ABS) polar codes. We add a permutation layer after each polar transform layer in the construction of the ABS polar codes. In order to choose which pairs of adjacent bits to swap in the permutation layers, we rely on a new polar transform that combines two independent channels with 4-ary inputs. This new polar transform allows us to track the evolution of every pair of adjacent bits through different layers of polar transforms, and it also plays an essential role in the successive cancellation list (SCL) decoder for the ABS polar codes. Extensive simulation results show that ABS polar codes consistently outperform standard polar codes by $0.15 \mathop {\mathrm {dB}}\nolimits $ — $0.3 \mathop {\mathrm {dB}}\nolimits $ when we use CRC-aided SCL decoder with list size 32 for both codes.

As an immediate corollary, we show that $q$ -ary codes tolerating a fraction $1-(1+2\delta)/q$ of adversarial deletions must also have rate approaching 0. Our techniques include string regularity arguments and a structural lemma that classifies binary strings by their oscillation patterns. Leveraging these tools, we find in any large code two strings with similar oscillation patterns, which is exploited to find a long common subsequence.},

  abstract     = {Recursive list decoding of Reed-Muller (RM) codes, with moderate list size, is known to approach maximum-likelihood (ML) performance of short length $(\leq 256)$ RM codes. Recursive decoding employs the Plotkin construction to split the original code into two shorter RM codes with different rates. In contrast to the standard approach which decodes the lower-rate code first, the method in this paper decodes the higher-rate code first. This modification enables an efficient permutation-based decoding technique, with permutations being selected on the fly from the automorphism group of the code using soft information from a channel. Simulation results show that the error-rate performance of the proposed algorithms, enhanced by a permutation selection technique, is close to that of the automorphism-based recursive decoding algorithm with similar complexity for short RM codes, while our decoders perform better for longer RM codes. In particular, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithms achieve near-ML performance for short RM codes and for RM codes of length $2^{m}$ and order $m-3$ with reasonable complexity.},

This paper strengthens this known result by establishing an entropic version of the central limit theorem that ensures a stronger mode of convergence using the relative entropy. This upgrade in convergence is shown at the expense of extra regularity conditions, which can be considered as mild. To prove this result, ancillary results on order statistics are derived, which might be of independent interest. For instance, a rather general bound on the moments of order statistics, and an upper bound on the mean squared error of estimating the $p \in (0,1)$ -th quantile of an unknown cumulative distribution function, are derived. Finally, a discussion on the necessity of the derived conditions for convergence and on the rate of convergence and monotonicity of the relative entropy is provided.},

  abstract     = {Conventionally, posterior matching is investigated in channel coding and block encoding contexts – the source symbols are equiprobably distributed and are entirely known by the encoder before the transmission. In this paper, we consider a streaming source, whose symbols progressively arrive at the encoder at a sequence of deterministic times. We derive the joint source-channel coding (JSCC) reliability function for streaming over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) with feedback. We propose a novel instantaneous encoding phase that operates during the symbol arriving period and achieves the JSCC reliability function for streaming when followed by a block encoding scheme that achieves the JSCC reliability function for a classical source whose symbols are fully accessible before the transmission. During the instantaneous encoding phase, the evolving message alphabet is partitioned into groups whose priors are close to the capacity-achieving distribution, and the encoder determines the group index of the actual sequence of symbols arrived so far and applies randomization to exactly match the distribution of the transmitted index to the capacity-achieving one. Surprisingly, the JSCC reliability function for streaming is equal to that for a fully accessible source, implying that the knowledge of the entire symbol sequence before the transmission offers no advantage in terms of the reliability function. For streaming over a symmetric binary-input DMC, we propose a one-phase instantaneous small-enough difference (SED) code that not only achieves the JSCC reliability function, but also, thanks to its single-phase time-invariant coding rule, can be used to stabilize an unstable linear system over a noisy channel. For equiprobably distributed source symbols, we design low complexity algorithms to implement both the instantaneous encoding phase and the instantaneous SED code. The algorithms group the source sequences into sets we call types, which enable the encoder and the decoder to track the priors and the posteriors of source sequences jointly, leading to a log-linear complexity in time. While the reliability function is derived for non-degenerate DMCs, i.e., DMCs whose transition probability matrix has all positive entries, for degenerate DMCs, we design a code with instantaneous encoding that achieves zero error for all rates below Shannon’s joint source-channel coding limit.},

We prove that the codebook mismatch can be fully compensated by using a mismatched additive decoding metric that achieves the random coding error exponent of (non-linear) constant composition codes. As the coding rate tends to the mutual information, the optimal mismatched metric approaches the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) metric, showing that codebook mismatch with MAP metric is capacity-achieving for the optimal input assignment.},

The first bound stems from Gaussian maximum-entropy considerations and depends on the power spectral density (PSD) function of the process. While the PSD function cannot always be calculated in a closed-form, we also propose a second bound, which merely relies on some finite collection of auto-covariance values of the process. Both of the bounds consist of a one-dimensional integral, while the second bound also consists of a minimization problem over a bounded region, hence they can be efficiently calculated numerically. In some models that appear naturally in various disciplines and that consist of infinitely large alphabets, assessing the related entropy rates may be a complicated numerical problem. In such cases, we argue that the new proposed bounds can still be efficiently calculated. Examples are also provided to show that the new bounds outperform the standard existing ones.},

  abstract     = {While the $k$ th order empirical entropy is an accepted measure of the compressibility of individual sequences on classical text collections, it is useful only for small values of $k$ and thus fails to capture the compressibility of repetitive sequences. In the absence of an established way of quantifying the latter, ad-hoc measures like the size $z$ of the Lempel–Ziv parse are frequently used to estimate repetitiveness. The size $b \le z$ of the smallest bidirectional macro scheme captures better what can be achieved via copy-paste processes, though it is NP-complete to compute, and it is not monotone upon appending symbols. Recently, a more principled measure, the size $\gamma $ of the smallest string attractor , was introduced. The measure $\gamma \le b$ lower-bounds all the previous relevant ones, while length- $n$ strings can be represented and efficiently indexed within space $O\left({\gamma \log \frac {n}{\gamma }}\right)$ , which also upper-bounds many measures, including $z$ . Although $\gamma $ is arguably a better measure of repetitiveness than $b$ , it is also NP-complete to compute and not monotone, and it is unknown if one can represent all strings in $o(\gamma \log n)$ space. In this paper, we study an even smaller measure, $\delta \le \gamma $ , which can be computed in linear time, is monotone, and allows encoding every string in $O\left({\delta \log \frac {n}{\delta }}\right)$ space because $z = O\left({\delta \log \frac {n}{\delta }}\right)$ . We argue that $\delta $ better captures the compressibility of repetitive strings. Concretely, we show that (1) $\delta $ can be strictly smaller than $\gamma $ , by up to a logarithmic factor; (2) there are string families needing $\Omega \left({\delta \log \frac {n}{\delta }}\right)$ space to be encoded, so this space is optimal for every $n$ and $\delta $ ; (3) one can build run-length context-free grammars of size $O\left({\delta \log \frac {n}{\delta }}\right)$ , whereas the smallest (non-run-length) grammar can be up to $\Theta (\log n/\log \log n)$ times larger; and (4) within $O\left({\delta \log \frac {n}{\delta }}\right)$ space, we can not only represent a string but also offer logarithmic-time access to its symbols, computation of substring fingerprints, and efficient indexed searches for pattern occurrences. We further refine the above results to account for the alphabet size $\sigma $ of the string, showing that $\Theta \left({\delta \log \frac {n\log \sigma }{\delta \log n}}\right)$ space is necessary and sufficient to represent the string and to efficiently support access, fingerprinting, and pattern matching queries.},

In social learning, agents solve a distributed multiple hypothesis testing problem by performing two operations at each instant: first, agents incorporate information from private observations to form their beliefs over a set of hypotheses; second, agents combine the entirety of their beliefs locally among neighbors. Within a sufficiently informative environment and as long as the connectivity of the network allows information to diffuse across agents, these algorithms enable agents to learn the true hypothesis. Instead of sharing the entirety of their beliefs, this work considers the case in which agents will only share their beliefs regarding one hypothesis of interest, with the purpose of evaluating its validity, and draws conditions under which this policy does not affect truth learning. We propose two approaches for sharing partial information, depending on whether agents behave in a self-aware manner or not. The results show how different learning regimes arise, depending on the approach employed and on the inherent characteristics of the inference problem. Furthermore, the analysis interestingly points to the possibility of deceiving the network, as long as the evaluated hypothesis of interest is close enough to the truth.},

Firstly, we unify many well-known structures which share similar procedures between the decryption and the encryption, and give a sufficient and necessary condition for this structure to be bijective, which reveals many new insights into the Feistel structure as well as the Lai-Massey structure. Secondly, we analyze the security of the unified structure against the known cryptanalysis. By extending the dual structure from a Feistel structure to the unified structure, we prove that a differential of the unified structure is impossible if and only if it is a zero-correlation linear hull of its dual structure, which presents a generalized link between the impossible differential and zero-correlation linear cryptanalysis shown in CRYPTO 2015. Significantly, several constraints on the linear components of the cipher and the permutation on the branches of the cipher are specified to make the structure resilient to differential and linear cryptanalysis. Furthermore, in the case that the order of the permutation equals the number of the branches $n$ , we prove that there always exist a $(3n-1)$ -round impossible differential and a $(3n-1)$ -round zero-correlation linear hull of the structure, and also present an algorithm to construct these distinguishers.

This shows in particular that the only quadratic APN functions (up to ${\mathsf {CCZ}}$ -equivalence) over $\mathbb {L}\times \mathbb {L}$ that satisfy the so-called subfield property are the Gold functions and the function $\kappa: \mathbb {F}_{64} \to \mathbb {F}_{64}$ which is the only known APN function that is equivalent to a permutation over $\mathbb {L}\times \mathbb {L}$ up to ${\mathsf {CCZ}}$ -equivalence as shown in Browning et al.

Deciding whether there exist other quadratic APN functions ${\mathsf {CCZ}}$ -equivalent to permutations that satisfy subfield property or equivalently, generalizing $\kappa $ to higher dimensions was an open problem listed for instance in Carlet (2015) as one of the interesting open problems on cryptographic functions.},

We consider distributed storage systems with $n$ nodes, in which the original data can be recovered from any subset of $k=d$ nodes, and the content of any node can be retrieved from those of any $d$ helper nodes. Moreover, we consider two secrecy constraints, namely, Type-I, where the message remains secure against an eavesdropper with access to the content of any subset of up to $\ell $ nodes, and Type-II, in which the message remains secure against an eavesdropper who can observe the incoming repair data from all possible nodes to a fixed but unknown subset of up to $\ell $ compromised nodes. Two classes of secure determinant codes are proposed for Type-I and Type-II secrecy constraints. Each proposed code can be designed for a range of per-node storage capacity and repair bandwidth for any system parameters. They lead to two achievable secrecy trade-offs, for Type-I and Type-II security.},

We quantify how the signal and noise interact in different regions of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and report the resulting peculiar spectral behavior of GL. In addition, we explore the impact of chosen kernel bandwidth on the spectrum of GL over different regions of SNR, which lead to an adaptive choice of kernel bandwidth that coincides with the common practice in real data.

The object under consideration in this paper is the conditional mean of $\mathbf {X}$ given $\mathbf {Y}={\mathbf{y}}$ , that is ${\mathbf{y}} \mapsto \mathbb {E} [\mathbf {X}| \mathbf {Y}={\mathbf{y}}]$ . Several identities in the literature connect $\mathbb {E}[\mathbf {X}| \mathbf {Y}={\mathbf{y}}]$ to other quantities such as the conditional variance, score functions, and higher-order conditional moments. The objective of this paper is to provide a unifying view of these identities. In the first part of the paper, a general derivative identity for the conditional mean estimator is derived. Specifically, for the Markov chain $\mathbf {U}\leftrightarrow \mathbf {X}\leftrightarrow \mathbf {Y}$ , it is shown that the Jacobian matrix of $\mathbb {E}[\mathbf {U}| \mathbf {Y}={\mathbf{y}}]$ is given by $\boldsymbol {\mathsf {K}}_{ \mathbf {N}}^{-1} \boldsymbol {\mathsf {Cov}} (\mathbf {X}, \mathbf {U}| \mathbf {Y}={\mathbf{y}})$ where $\boldsymbol {\mathsf {Cov}} (\mathbf {X}, \mathbf {U}| \mathbf {Y}={\mathbf{y}})$ is the conditional covariance. In the second part of the paper, via various choices of the random vector $\mathbf {U}$ , the new identity is used to recover and generalize many of the known identities and derive some new identities. First, a simple proof of the Hatsel and Nolte identity for the conditional variance is shown. Second, a simple proof of the recursive identity due to Jaffer is provided. The Jaffer identity is then further explored, and several equivalent statements are derived, such as an identity for the higher-order conditional expectation (i.e., $\mathbb {E}[\mathbf {X}^{k}| \mathbf {Y}]$ ) in terms of the derivatives of the conditional expectation. Third, a new fundamental connection between the conditional cumulants and the conditional expectation is demonstrated. In particular, in the univariate case, it is shown that the $k$ -th derivative of the conditional expectation is proportional to the $(k+1)$ -th conditional cumulant. A similar expression is derived in the multivariate case.},

We show that convex programs with this atomic norm as a regularizer provide near-optimal sample complexity and error rate guarantees for sparse phase retrieval and sparse PCA. While we do not know how to solve the convex programs exactly with an efficient algorithm, for the phase retrieval case we carefully analyze the program and its dual and thereby derive a practical heuristic algorithm.

More importantly, it copes effectively with the challenging cases wherein the subspaces characterizing the classes are partially or fully overlapping. The SSM metric matches the subspaces characterizing the vector sets of the test and the classes by minimizing the distance between respective soft-projection matrices constructed from the vector sets. We prove the consistency of the solution for the high signal-to-noise-ratio limit, and also for the large-sample limit, conditioned on the noise being white. Experimental results, demonstrating the superiority of the SSM solution over the existing PCA-based solutions, especially in the challenging cases of overlapping subspaces, are included.},

Here, we go beyond these matrices, and prove an analytical formula for the reconstruction performance of convex generalized linear models with rotationally-invariant data matrices with arbitrary bounded spectrum, rigorously confirming, under suitable assumptions, a conjecture originally derived using the replica method from statistical physics. The proof is achieved by leveraging on message passing algorithms and the statistical properties of their iterates, allowing to characterize the asymptotic empirical distribution of the estimator. For sufficiently strongly convex problems, we show that the two-layer vector approximate message passing algorithm (2-MLVAMP) converges, where the convergence analysis is done by checking the stability of an equivalent dynamical system, which gives the result for such problems. We then show that, under a concentration assumption, an analytical continuation may be carried out to extend the result to convex (non-strongly) problems. We illustrate our claim with numerical examples on mainstream learning methods such as sparse logistic regression and linear support vector classifiers, showing excellent agreement between moderate size simulation and the asymptotic prediction.},

  abstract     = {We address online combinatorial optimization when the player has a prior over the adversary’s sequence of losses. In this setting, Russo and Van Roy proposed an information theoretic analysis of Thompson Sampling based on the information ratio, allowing for elegant proofs of Bayesian regret bounds. In this paper we introduce three novel ideas to this line of work. First we propose a new quantity, the scale-sensitive information ratio, which allows us to obtain more refined first-order regret bounds (i.e., bounds of the form $O(\sqrt {L^{*}})$ where $L^{*}$ is the loss of the best combinatorial action). Second we replace the entropy over combinatorial actions by a coordinate entropy, which allows us to obtain the first optimal worst-case bound for Thompson Sampling in the combinatorial setting. We additionally introduce a novel link between Bayesian agents and frequentist confidence intervals. Combining these ideas we show that the classical multi-armed bandit first-order regret bound $ \widetilde {O}(\sqrt {d L^{*}})$ still holds true in the more challenging and more general semi-bandit scenario. This latter result improves the previous state of the art bound $ \widetilde {O}(\sqrt {(d+m^{3})L^{*}})$ by Lykouris, Sridharan and Tardos. Moreover we sharpen these results with two technical ingredients. The first leverages a recent insight of Zimmert and Lattimore to replace Shannon entropy with more refined potential functions in the analysis. The second is a Thresholded Thompson Sampling algorithm, which slightly modifies the original algorithm by never playing low-probability actions. This thresholding results in fully $T$ -independent regret bounds when $L^{*}\leq \overline {L} ^{*}$ is almost surely upper-bounded, which we show does not hold for ordinary Thompson Sampling.},

  abstract     = {Though learning has become a core component of modern information processing, there is now ample evidence that it can lead to biased, unsafe, and prejudiced systems. The need to impose requirements on learning is therefore paramount, especially as it reaches critical applications in social, industrial, and medical domains. However, the non-convexity of most modern statistical problems is only exacerbated by the introduction of constraints. Whereas good unconstrained solutions can often be learned using empirical risk minimization, even obtaining a model that satisfies statistical constraints can be challenging. All the more so, a good one. In this paper, we overcome this issue by learning in the empirical dual domain, where constrained statistical learning problems become unconstrained and deterministic. We analyze the generalization properties of this approach by bounding the empirical duality gap—i.e., the difference between our approximate, tractable solution and the solution of the original (non-convex) statistical problem—and provide a practical constrained learning algorithm. These results establish a constrained counterpart to classical learning theory, enabling the explicit use of constraints in learning. We illustrate this theory and algorithm in rate-constrained learning applications arising in fairness and adversarial robustness.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider asymptotically exact support recovery in the context of high dimensional and sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). Our main results describe four regimes of interest based on information theoretic and computational considerations. In regimes of “low” sparsity we describe a simple, general, and computationally easy method for support recovery, whereas in a regime of “high” sparsity, it turns out that support recovery is information theoretically impossible. For the sake of information theoretic lower bounds, our results also demonstrate a non-trivial requirement on the “minimal” size of the nonzero elements of the canonical vectors that is required for asymptotically consistent support recovery. Subsequently, the regime of “moderate” sparsity is further divided into two sub-regimes. In the lower of the two sparsity regimes, we show that polynomial time support recovery is possible by using a sharp analysis of a co-ordinate thresholding type method. In contrast, in the higher end of the moderate sparsity regime, appealing to the “Low Degree Polynomial” Conjecture, we provide evidence that polynomial time support recovery methods are inconsistent. Finally, we carry out numerical experiments to compare the efficacy of various methods discussed.},

  abstract     = {The max-relative entropy together with its smoothed version is a basic tool in quantum information theory. In this paper, we derive the exact exponent for the asymptotic decay of the small modification of the quantum state in smoothing the max-relative entropy based on purified distance. We then apply this result to the problem of privacy amplification against quantum side information, and we obtain an upper bound for the exponent of the asymptotic decreasing of the insecurity, measured using either purified distance or relative entropy. Our upper bound complements the earlier lower bound established by Hayashi, and the two bounds match when the rate of randomness extraction is above a critical value. Thus, for the case of high rate, we have determined the exact security exponent. Following this, we give examples and show that in the low-rate case, neither the upper bound nor the lower bound is tight in general. This exhibits a picture similar to that of the error exponent in channel coding. Lastly, we investigate the asymptotics of equivocation and its exponent under the security measure using the sandwiched Rényi divergence of order $s\in (1,2]$ , which has not been addressed previously in the quantum setting.},

  abstract     = {There are various ways to quantify the communication capabilities of a quantum channel. In this work we introduce the communication value (cv) of quantum channel, which describes the optimal probability of guessing the channel input from its output. By connecting to prior work on zero-error channel simulation, we show that the cv and its entanglement-assisted variant also offer dual interpretations as the classical communication cost for perfectly simulating different aspects of a channel using non-signaling resources. Our study involves characterizing the communication value as a generalized conditional min-entropy over the cone of separable operators. Using this characterization, we evaluate the cv for all qubit channels and higher-dimensional channels with certain symmetries. We find that the any entanglement-breaking channel has multiplicative cv when used in parallel with any other channel; the same is shown to hold for Pauli channels and partially depolarizing channels. In contrast, the cv is found to be non-multiplicative for a subset of the well-known Werner-Holevo channels. A final component of this work investigates relaxations of the channel cv to other cones such as the set of operators having a positive partial transpose (PPT).},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the massive random access problem in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels. Specifically, we derive achievability and converse bounds on the minimum energy-per-bit required for each active user to transmit $J$ bits with blocklength $n$ , power $P$ , and $L$ receive antennas under a per-user probability of error (PUPE) constraint, in the cases with and without a priori channel state information at the receiver (CSIR and no-CSI). In the case of no-CSI, we consider both the settings with and without the knowledge of the number $K_{a}$ of active users at the receiver. Numerical evaluation shows that the gap between achievability and converse bounds is less than 2.5 dB for the CSIR case and less than 4 dB for the no-CSI case in most considered regimes. Under the condition that the distribution of $K_{a}$ is known in advance, the uncertainty of the exact value of $K_{a}$ entails only a small penalty in terms of energy efficiency. Our results show the significance of MIMO for the massive random access problem. As an example, we show that the spectral efficiency grows approximately linearly with the number of receive antennas in the case of CSIR, whereas the growth rate decreases in the case of no-CSI. Moreover, in the case of no-CSI, we demonstrate the suboptimality of the pilot-assisted scheme, especially when the number of active users is large. Building on non-asymptotic results, assuming all users are active and $J=\Theta (1)$ , we obtain scaling laws of the number of supported users as follows: when $L = \Theta \left ({n^{2}}\right)$ and $P=\Theta \left ({\frac {1}{n^{2}}}\right)$ , one can reliably serve $K = \mathcal {O}(n^{2})$ users in the case of no-CSI; under mild conditions in the case of CSIR, the PUPE requirement is satisfied if and only if $\frac {nL\ln KP}{K}=\Omega \left ({1}\right)$ .},

Controlling them calls for a different approach. Symbol-pair codes have been proposed as a solution. The error-correcting capability of such a code depends on its minimum pair distance instead of the usual minimum Hamming distance. Longer codes can be conveniently constructed from known shorter ones by a matrix-product approach. The parameters of a matrix-product code can be determined from the parameters of the ingredient codes. We construct a new family of maximum distance separable (MDS) symbol-pair matrix-product codes. Codes which are permutation equivalent to matrix-product codes may have improved minimum pair distances. We present four new families of MDS symbol-pair codes and a new family of almost MDS symbol-pair codes. The codes in these five new families are permutation equivalent to matrix-product codes. Each of our five constructions identifies permutations that can increase the minimum pair distances. We situate the new families among previously known families of MDS symbol-pair codes to highlight the versatility of our matrix-product construction route.},

However, the repair of a failed node of PMDS codes still requires a large amount of communication if the group size is large. Recently, PMDS array codes with each local code being an MSR code were introduced to reduce the repair bandwidth further. However, they require extensive rebuilding access and unavoidably a significant sub-packetization level. In this paper, we first propose two constructions of PMDS array codes with two global parities that have smaller sub-packetization levels and much smaller finite fields than the existing one. One construction can support an arbitrary number of local parities and has $(1+\epsilon)$ -optimal repair bandwidth (i.e., $(1+\epsilon)$ times the optimal repair bandwidth), while the other one is limited to two local parities but has significantly smaller rebuilding access and its sub-packetization level is only 2. In addition, we present a construction of PMDS array code with three global parities, which has a smaller sub-packetization level as well as $(1+\epsilon)$ -optimal repair bandwidth, the required finite field is significantly smaller than existing ones.},

This enables a multiplicative improvement over the classic uncoded caching with respect to the transmission rates required in the delivery phase of the content. Since its introduction, coded caching has eliceted significant research interest as a result of which several different schemes have been proposed over the last few years. This work focuses on the fundamental case of coded caching with uncoded prefetching. In this case, the users’ caches are filled with uncoded content during a prefetching phase in order to best serve the request made by each user during a subsequent delivery phase. This important case has recently received a complete information-theoretic characterization. However, reaching the information-theoretic optimality imposes a significant computational imbalance among the users. To mitigate this imbalance, we perform a complete computational analysis of the two major forms of coded caching with uncoded prefetching, namely centralized and decentralized. Furthermore, we propose a new information-theoretically optimal method for the delivery phase that achieves a significant computational improvement compared to the state of the art.},

  abstract     = {In the problem of classical group testing one aims to identify a small subset (of size $d$ ) of diseased individuals/defective items in a large population (of size $n$ ). This process is based on a minimal number of suitably-designed group tests on subsets of items, where the test outcome is positive iff the given test contains at least one defective item. Motivated by physical considerations, such as scenarios with imperfect test apparatus, we consider a generalized setting that includes as special cases multiple other group-testing-like models in the literature. In our setting the test outcome is governed by an arbitrary monotonically increasing (stochastic) test function $f(\cdot)$ , with the test outcome being positive with probability $f(x)$ , where $x$ is the number of defectives tested in that pool. This formulation subsumes as special cases a variety of noiseless and noisy group-testing models in the literature. Our main contributions are as follows. Firstly, for any monotone test function $f(\cdot)$ we present a non-adaptive scheme that with probability $1-\varepsilon $ identifies all defective items. Our scheme requires at most ${\mathcal{ O}}\left ({{\Psi (f)} d\log \left ({\frac {n}{\varepsilon }}\right)}\right)$ tests, where ${\Psi (f)}$ is a suitably defined “sensitivity parameter” of $f(\cdot)$ , and is never larger than ${\mathcal{ O}}(d^{1+o(1)})$ , but indeed can be substantially smaller for a variety of $f(\cdot)$ . Secondly, we argue that any non-adaptive group testing scheme needs at least $\Omega \left ({(1-\varepsilon) {\psi (f)} d\log \left ({\frac {n} d}\right)}\right)$ tests to ensure high reliability recovery. Here ${\psi (f)}$ is a suitably defined “concentration parameter” of $f(\cdot)$ , and ${\psi (f)}\in \Omega {(1)}$ . Thirdly, we prove that our sample-complexity bounds for generalized group testing are information-theoretically near-optimal for a variety of sparse-recovery group-testing models in the literature. That is, for any “noisy” test function $f(\cdot)$ (i.e., $0 &amp;lt; f(0) &amp;lt; f(d) &amp;lt; 1$ ), and for a variety of “(one-sided) noiseless” test functions $f(\cdot)$ (i.e., either $f(0)=0$ , or $f(d)=1$ , or both) studied in the literature we show that $\frac {\Psi (f)} {\psi (f)} \in \Theta (1)$ . As a by-product we tightly characterize the heretofore open information-theoretic order-wise sample-complexity for the well-studied model of threshold group-testing. For general (near)-noiseless test functions $f(\cdot)$ we show that $\frac {\Psi (f)} {\psi (f)} \in {\mathcal{ O}}(d^{1+o(1)})$ . We also demonstrate a “natural” test-function $f(\cdot)$ whose sample complexity scales “extremally” as $\Theta (d^{2}\log n)$ , rather than $\Theta (d\log n)$ as in the case of classical group-testing. Some of our techniques may be of independent interest – in particular our achievability requires a delicate saddle-point approximation, our impossibility proof relies on a novel bound relating the mutual information of pair of random variables with the mean and variance of a specific function, and as a by-product of our proof showing that our sample-complexity upper and lower bounds are close we derive novel structural results about monotone functions.},

  abstract     = {In classical information theory, a causal relationship between two variables is typically modelled by assuming that, for every possible state of one of the variables, there exists a particular distribution of states of the second variable. Let us call these two variables the causal and caused variables, respectively. We shall assume that both variables are continuous and one-dimensional. In this work we consider a procedure to transform each variable, using transformations that are differentiable and strictly increasing. We call these increasing transformations. Any causal relationship (as defined here) is associated with a channel capacity, which is the maximum rate that information could be sent if the causal relationship was used as a signalling system. Channel capacity is unaffected when the two variables are changed by use of increasing transformations. For any causal relationship we show that there is always a way to transform the caused variable such that the entropy associated with the caused variable is independent of the value of the causal variable. Furthermore, the resulting universal entropy has an absolute value that is equal to the channel capacity associated with the causal relationship. This observation may be useful in statistical applications. Also, for any causal relationship, it implies that there is a ‘natural’ way to transform a continuous caused variable. We also show that, with additional constraints on the causal relationship, a natural increasing transformation of both variables leads to a transformed causal relationship that has properties that might be expected from a well-engineered measuring device.},

  abstract     = {This work addresses the problem of learning the topology of a network from the signals emitted by the network nodes. These signals are generated over time through a linear diffusion process, where neighboring nodes exchange messages according to the underlying network topology, and aggregate them according to a certain combination matrix. We consider the demanding setting of graph learning under partial observability, where signals are available only from a limited fraction of nodes, and we want to establish whether the topology of these nodes can be estimated faithfully, despite the presence of possibly many latent nodes. Recent results examined this problem when the network topology is generated according to an Erdős-Rényi random model. However, Erdős-Rényi graphs feature homogeneity across nodes and independence across edges, while, over several real-world networks, significant heterogeneity is observed between very connected “hubs” and scarcely connected peripheral nodes, and the edge construction process entails significant dependencies across edges. Preferential attachment random graphs were conceived primarily to fill these gaps. We tackle the problem of graph learning over preferential attachment graphs by focusing on the following setting: first-order vector autoregressive models equipped with a stable Laplacian combination matrix, and a network topology drawn according to the popular Bollobás-Riordan preferential attachment model. The main result established in this work is that a combination-matrix estimator known as Granger estimator achieves graph learning under partial observability.},

The mean vector and covariance matrix under each hypothesis are not known, they also do not have special structure other than the covariance matrices are partially ordered in the positive definite cone with their difference positive semi-definite. An example of such a problem is the detection of Gaussian random signal in Gaussian noise. Non-informative priors are imposed on the unknown parameters for computing the marginals and evaluating the Bayes factor test statistic, where the prior for the covariance matrix is applied to the Cholesky factorization of the precision matrix. For the null hypothesis, we propose conjugate priors for the unknowns. For the alternative hypothesis, we propose uniform prior on the mean vector, and a class of objective priors that encompasses the Jeffreys, Independence Jeffreys, Geisser and Cornfield, Haar Measure and Reference priors for the precision matrix. The proposed priors enable closed-form expressions for the marginals and lead to an objective Bayes factor having the posteriors mainly governed by the data. The proposed detector is analyzed for justifying the priors used, deriving the theoretical moments, and approximating the false alarm and detection probability densities by the shifted Gamma distributions. The developed detector exhibits improvement in detection performance over the energy detector (ED) and the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT).},

CZCPs can be crucial in designing optimal training sequences for broadband spatial modulation (SM) systems over frequency-selective channels. In this paper, we focus on designing new CZCPs with large cross Z-complementary ratio (CZCR). A construction framework of CZCPs with a large ZCZ ratio is proposed using Turyn’s method on some seed CZCPs and GCPs. By choosing suitably the seed CZCPs, we obtain 24 classes of new CZCPs with large CZCR. Especially, if the GCP is strengthened, our resultant CZCPs have the maximum $\mathrm {\mathbf{CZCR}}\approx \frac {M-1}{M}$ for $M\in {6,12,24,28,48,56}$ . We also obtain optimal CZCPs with new parameters (28, 13), (48, 23), (56, 27), (96, 47) and (112, 55), which can be extended to $(96N,47N)$ -CZCPs and $(112N,55N)$ -CZCPs respectively for any Golay number $N$ .},

Elements of this class have been used frequently for block cipher designs and coding theory. In this article, we further investigate this corpus using new approaches, specifically from two-to-one (2-to-1) functions and (in some cases) using the graph indicators introduced by Carlet in 2020. In our constructions of involutions over the finite field $\mathbb {F}_{2^{n}}$ of order $2^{n}$ , we shall intensively use 2-to-1 mappings over $\mathbb {F}_{2^{n}}$ . More specifically, we present a new constructive method to design involutions from 2-to-1 mappings through their graph indicator and derive new involutions from known 2-to-1 mappings. Besides, we also propose several new classes of 2-to-1 mappings, including 2-to-1 hexanomials, 2-to-1 mappings of the form $(x^{2^{k}}+x+\delta)^{s_{1}}+(x^{2^{k}}+x+\delta)^{s_{2}}+cx$ , and 2-to-1 mappings from linear 2-to-1 mappings. We also exhibit the corresponding involutions of the constructed 2-to-1 mappings. Furthermore, an infinite family of involutions with differential uniformity at most 4 (EA-inequivalent to the inverse function) is obtained. Finally, we highlight that all our derived families of involutions have no fixed point, further accentuating their cryptographic interest.},

We reformulate the problem as the optimization of a renewal-reward process, and propose an online sampling strategy based on the Robbins-Monro algorithm. We prove that the proposed algorithm satisfies the sampling frequency constraint. Moreover, when the transmission delay is bounded and its distribution is absolutely continuous, the average AoI obtained by the proposed algorithm converges to the minimum AoI when the number of samples $K$ goes to infinity with probability 1. We show that the optimality gap decays with rate $\mathcal {O}\left ({\ln K/K}\right)$ , and the proposed algorithm is minimax rate optimal.

This framework first models the structure of all the possible rotational-XOR differential (abbreviated to “RXD”) trails and introduces a method to calculate this structure round by round. Based on this approach, an automatic method is proposed for searching RXD trails. In this method, four strategies are proposed to derive better result and improve the efficiency. Unlike previous automations, the time complexity for this framework can be pre-computed, which is bounded by ${\mathcal{ O}}\left ({{c\cdot n\cdot R^{2}\cdot C_{n}^{n_{1}}} }\right)$ (where $n$ is the block size, $n_{1}$ is the number of active bits for the starting point of automatic method, $R$ is the length of the targeted rounds and $c$ is a fixed constant). Under the given strategies and searching subspaces, the derived RXD trails are guaranteed to be optimal. To prove the correctness and efficiency, this framework is applied to all the ten variants for SIMON and three variants for Simeck. When compared with previous RXD trails, the best improvement is up to three rounds. To validate the correctness of the derived rotational-XOR differential trails, a concrete experiment on Simeck32 is conducted and the experimental result complies with the theoretical analysis. As far as we know, for all the variants of Simeck, current longest distinguishers over all the cryptanalytic methods are obtained in this paper.},

  abstract     = {Two major challenges in distributed learning and estimation are 1) preserving the privacy of the local samples; and 2) communicating them efficiently to a central server, while achieving high accuracy for the end-to-end task. While there has been significant interest in addressing each of these challenges separately in the recent literature, treatments that simultaneously address both challenges are still largely missing. In this paper, we develop novel encoding and decoding mechanisms that simultaneously achieve optimal privacy and communication efficiency in various canonical settings. In particular, we consider the problems of mean estimation and frequency estimation under $\varepsilon $ -local differential privacy and $b$ -bit communication constraints. For mean estimation, we propose the SQKR mechanism, a scheme based on Kashin’s representation and random sampling, with order-optimal estimation error under both constraints. We further apply SQKR to distributed SGD and obtain a communication efficient and (locally) differentially private distributed SGD protocol. For frequency estimation, we present the RHR mechanism, a scheme that leverages the recursive structure of Walsh-Hadamard matrices and achieves order-optimal estimation error for all privacy levels and communication budgets. As a by-product, we also construct a distribution estimation mechanism that is rate-optimal for all privacy regimes and communication constraints, extending recent work that is limited to $b=1$ and $\varepsilon =O(1)$ . Our results demonstrate that intelligent encoding under joint privacy and communication constraints can yield a performance that matches the optimal accuracy achievable under either constraint alone. In other words, the optimal performance is determined by the more stringent of the two constraints, and the less stringent constraint can be satisfied for free.},

  abstract     = {In the group testing problem, the goal is to identify a subset of defective items within a larger set of items based on tests whose outcomes indicate whether any defective item is present. This problem is relevant in areas such as medical testing, DNA sequencing, and communications. In this paper, we study a doubly-regular design in which the number of tests-per-item and the number of items-per-test are fixed. We analyze the performance of this test design alongside the Definite Defectives (DD) decoding algorithm in several settings, namely, (i) the sub-linear regime $k=o(n)$ with exact recovery, (ii) the linear regime $k=\Theta (n)$ with approximate recovery, and (iii) the size-constrained setting, where the number of items per test is constrained. Under setting (i), we show that our design together with the DD algorithm, matches an existing achievability result for the DD algorithm with the near-constant tests-per-item design, which is known to be asymptotically optimal in broad scaling regimes. Under setting (ii), we provide novel approximate recovery bounds that complement a hardness result regarding exact recovery. Lastly, under setting (iii), we improve on the best known upper and lower bounds in scaling regimes where the maximum test size grows with the total number of items.},

  abstract     = {The classical statistical learning theory implies that fitting too many parameters leads to overfitting and poor performance. That modern deep neural networks generalize well despite a large number of parameters contradicts this finding and constitutes a major unsolved problem towards explaining the success of deep learning. While previous work focuses on the implicit regularization induced by stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we study here how the local geometry of the energy landscape around local minima affects the statistical properties of SGD with Gaussian gradient noise. We argue that under reasonable assumptions, the local geometry forces SGD to stay close to a low dimensional subspace and that this induces another form of implicit regularization and results in tighter bounds on the generalization error for deep neural networks. To derive generalization error bounds for neural networks, we first introduce a notion of stagnation sets around the local minima and impose a local essential convexity property of the population risk. Under these conditions, lower bounds for SGD to remain in these stagnation sets are derived. If stagnation occurs, we derive a bound on the generalization error of deep neural networks involving the spectral norms of the weight matrices but not the number of network parameters. Technically, our proofs are based on controlling the change of parameter values in the SGD iterates and local uniform convergence of the empirical loss functions based on the entropy of suitable neighborhoods around local minima.},

The matrices $\boldsymbol {A}_{k}$ are known and mutually independent for different $k$ . We introduce a novel gradient descent (GD) based solution called AltGD-Min. We show that, if the $\boldsymbol {A}_{k}\text{s}$ are i.i.d. with i.i.d. Gaussian entries, and if the right singular vectors of ${ \boldsymbol {X}}^{\ast}$ satisfy the incoherence assumption, then $\epsilon $ -accurate recovery of ${ \boldsymbol {X}}^{\ast}$ is possible with order $(n+q) r^{2} \log (1/\epsilon)$ total samples and order $mq nr \log (1/\epsilon)$ time. Compared with existing work, this is the fastest solution. For $\epsilon &amp;lt; r^{1/4}$ , it also has the best sample complexity. A simple extension of AltGD-Min also provably solves LR Phase Retrieval, which is a magnitude-only generalization of the above problem. AltGD-Min factorizes the unknown ${ \boldsymbol {X}}$ as ${ \boldsymbol {X}}= { \boldsymbol {U}} \boldsymbol {B} $ where ${ \boldsymbol {U}}$ and $\boldsymbol {B}$ are matrices with $r$ columns and rows respectively. It alternates between a (projected) GD step for updating ${ \boldsymbol {U}}$ , and a minimization step for updating $\boldsymbol {B}$ . Its each iteration is as fast as that of regular projected GD because the minimization over $\boldsymbol {B}$ decouples column-wise. At the same time, we can prove exponential error decay for it, which we are unable to for projected GD. Finally, it can also be efficiently federated with a communication cost of only $nr$ per node, instead of $nq$ for projected GD.},

  abstract     = {The CP decomposition for high dimensional non-orthogonal spiked tensors is an important problem with broad applications across many disciplines. However, previous works with theoretical guarantee typically assume restrictive incoherence conditions on the basis vectors for the CP components. In this paper, we propose new computationally efficient composite PCA and concurrent orthogonalization algorithms for tensor CP decomposition with theoretical guarantees under mild incoherence conditions. The composite PCA applies the principal component or singular value decompositions twice, first to a matrix unfolding of the tensor data to obtain singular vectors and then to the matrix folding of the singular vectors obtained in the first step. It can be used as an initialization for any iterative optimization schemes for the tensor CP decomposition. The concurrent orthogonalization algorithm iteratively estimates the basis vector in each mode of the tensor by simultaneously applying projections to the orthogonal complements of the spaces generated by other CP components in other modes. It is designed to improve the alternating least squares estimator and other forms of the high order orthogonal iteration for tensors with low or moderately high CP ranks, and it is guaranteed to have second or higher order convergence when the error of any given initial estimator is bounded by a small constant. Our theoretical investigation provides estimation accuracy and convergence rates for the two proposed algorithms. Both proposed algorithms are applicable to deterministic tensor, its noisy version, and the order- $2K$ covariance tensor of order- $K$ tensor data in a factor model with uncorrelated factors. Simulation experiments demonstrate significant practical superiority of our approach over existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Divergence measures have a long association with statistical inference, machine learning and information theory. The density power divergence and related measures have produced many useful (and popular) statistical procedures, which provide a good balance between model efficiency on one hand and outlier stability or robustness on the other. The logarithmic density power divergence, a particular logarithmic transform of the density power divergence, has also been very successful in producing efficient and stable inference procedures; in addition it has also led to significant demonstrated applications in information theory. The success of the minimum divergence procedures based on the density power divergence and the logarithmic density power divergence (which also go by the names $\beta $ -divergence and $\gamma $ -divergence, respectively) make it imperative and meaningful to look for other, similar divergences which may be obtained as transforms of the density power divergence in the same spirit. With this motivation we search for such transforms of the density power divergence, referred to herein as the functional density power divergence class. The present article characterizes this functional density power divergence class, and thus identifies the available divergence measures within this construct that may be explored further for possible applications in statistical inference, machine learning and information theory.},

This minimization corresponds to the common approach of training a neural network with weight decay. We quantify the performance (mean-squared error) of these neural network estimators when the data-generating function belongs to the second-order Radon-domain bounded variation space. This space of functions was recently proposed as the natural function space associated with shallow ReLU neural networks. We derive a minimax lower bound for the estimation problem for this function space and show that the neural network estimators are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors. This minimax rate is immune to the curse of dimensionality. We quantify an explicit gap between neural networks and linear methods (which include kernel methods) by deriving a linear minimax lower bound for the estimation problem, showing that linear methods necessarily suffer the curse of dimensionality in this function space. As a result, this paper sheds light on the phenomenon that neural networks seem to break the curse of dimensionality.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of estimating the structure of structurally similar graphical models in high dimensions. This problem is pertinent in multi-modal or multi-domain datasets that consist of multiple information domains, each modeled by one probabilistic graphical model (PGM), e.g., in brain network modeling using different neuroimaging modalities. Induced by an underlying shared causal source, the domains, and subsequently their associated PGMs, can have structural similarities. This paper focuses on Gaussian and Ising models and characterizes the information-theoretic sample complexity of estimating the structures of a pair of PGMs in the degree-bounded and edge-bounded subclasses. The PGMs are assumed to have $p$ nodes with distinct and unknown structures. Their similarity is accounted for by assuming that a pre-specified set of $q$ nodes form identical subgraphs in both PGMs. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the sample complexity for a bounded probability of error are characterized. The necessary conditions are information-theoretic (algorithm-independent), delineating the statistical difficulty of the problem. The sufficient conditions are based on deploying maximum likelihood decoders. While the specifics of the results vary across different subclasses and parameter regimes, one key observation is that in specific subclasses and regimes, the sample complexity varies with $p$ and $q$ according to $\Theta (\log (p-q))$ . For Ising models, a low complexity, online structure estimation (learning) algorithm based on multiplicative weights is also proposed. Numerical evaluations are also included to illustrate the interplay among different parameters on the sample complexity when the structurally similar graphs are recovered by a maximum likelihood-based graph decoder and the proposed online estimation algorithm.},

A key observation behind the theorem for the strong converse exponent of asymptotic binary quantum state discrimination is that the regularized measured Rényi $\alpha $ -divergence coincides with the sandwiched Rényi $\alpha $ -divergence when $\alpha &amp;gt;1$ . Moreover, it also follows from the same theorem that to achieve this, it is sufficient to consider 2-outcome measurements (tests) for any number of copies (this is somewhat surprising, as achieving the measured Rényi $\alpha $ -divergence for $n$ copies might require a number of measurement outcomes that diverges in $n$ , in general). In view of this, it seems natural to expect the same when $\alpha &amp;lt; 1$ ; however, we show that this is not the case. In fact, we show that even for commuting states (classical case) the regularized quantity attainable using 2-outcome measurements is in general strictly smaller than the Rényi $\alpha $ -divergence (which is unique in the classical case). In the general quantum case this shows that the above “regularized test-measured” Rényi $\alpha $ -divergence is not even a quantum extension of the classical Rényi divergence when $\alpha &amp;lt; 1$ , in sharp contrast to the $\alpha &amp;gt;1$ case.},

In the context of the resource theory approach to thermodynamics, this generalization allows one to study transformations by Gibbs-preserving maps that are in addition time-translation symmetric. We find a sufficient condition for the existence of catalytic transformations and a characterization of an asymptotic relaxation of the relation. For classical and certain quantum pairs the characterization is in terms of explicit monotone quantities related to the sandwiched quantum Rényi divergences. In the general quantum case the relevant quantities are given only implicitly. Nevertheless, we find a large collection of monotones that provide necessary conditions for asymptotic or catalytic transformations. When applied to time-translation symmetric maps, these give rise to second laws that constrain state transformations allowed by thermal operations even in the presence of catalysts.},

First, we extend the setting and the scheme presented by Muralidhar et al. to a much more general topology that supports both a much denser range of users and the coexistence of users connected to different numbers of caches, all while maintaining the astounding coding gains — here proven to be exactly optimal — associated with the combinatorial topology. This is achieved, for this generalized topology, with a novel information-theoretic converse that we present here, which establishes, together with the scheme, the exact optimal performance under the assumption of uncoded placement. We subsequently consider different connectivity ensembles, including the very general scenario of the entire ensemble of all possible network connectivities/topologies, where any subset of caches can serve any arbitrary number of users. For these settings, we develop novel converse bounds on the optimal performance averaged over the ensemble’s different connectivities. This novel analysis of topological ensembles leaves open the possibility that currently-unknown topologies may yield even higher gains, a hypothesis that is part of the bigger question of which network topology yields the most caching gains.},

A fundamental concept of such a system is the secrecy capacity, which represents the maximum amount of information that can be stored for each unit of storage space under the requirements of secure distributed computing. A capacity-achieving code is designed for matrix multiplication, a computing subroutine widely used in machine learning applications. The code allows fast parallel decoding and unequal data allocation in the clouds. Such a flexibility leads naturally to the idea of optimizing data allocation to minimize the computing time. Given any feasible storage budget, the optimal solution is derived, characterizing explicitly the fundamental tradeoff between storage and computing. Furthermore, it is shown via majorization theory that the whole tradeoff curve improves if the cloud computing rates are more even. Experiments on Amazon EC2 clusters are conducted, corroborating our theoretical observations and the negligibility of decoding overhead.},

The polynomial is said to be unbiased if the distribution of $f(x)$ for a uniform input $x \in \mathbb {F} ^{n}$ is close to the uniform distribution over $\mathbb {F}$ , and is called biased otherwise. The polynomial is said to have low rank if it can be expressed as a composition of a few lower degree polynomials. Green and Tao [Contrib. Discrete Math 2009] and Kaufman and Lovett [FOCS 2008] showed that bias implies low rank for fixed degree polynomials over fixed prime fields. This lies at the heart of many tools in higher order Fourier analysis. In this work, we extend this result to all prime fields (of size possibly growing with $n$ ). We also provide a generalization to nonprime fields in the large characteristic case. However, we state all our applications in the prime field setting for the sake of simplicity of presentation. Using the above generalization to large fields as a starting point, we are also able to settle the list decoding radius of fixed degree Reed-Muller codes over growing fields. The case of fixed size fields was solved by Bhowmick and Lovett [STOC 2015], which resolved a conjecture of Gopalan-Klivans-Zuckerman [STOC 2008]. Here, we show that the list decoding radius is equal the minimum distance of the code for all fixed degrees, even when the field size is possibly growing with $n$ . Additionally, we effectively resolve the weight distribution problem for Reed-Muller codes of fixed degree over all fields, first raised in 1977 in the classic textbook by MacWilliams and Sloane [Research Problem 15.1 in Theory of Error Correcting Codes].},

  abstract     = {Classical error-correcting codes under the Hamming metric are used to correct substitution and erasure errors. Motivated by the limitations of the reading process in high density data storage systems, a new class of codes called symbol-pair (metric) codes was designed to protect against pair errors in symbol-pair read channels. For a given alphabet of size $q$ and given values of $n$ and $d$ with $1\leq d\leq n$ , let $A_{p}(n,d,q)$ denote the largest possible code size for which there exists a $q$ -ary code of length $n$ with minimum pair-distance at least $d$ . In this paper, new upper and lower bounds on $A_{p}(n,d,q)$ are presented. Several examples are included to illustrate our main results; some examples are optimal in the sense that they meet the corresponding bounds, and the rest examples are meant to show that our bounds may perform better than some of the previously known ones in certain cases. In addition, we show that any symbol-pair code over $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ can be viewed as a Hamming metric code over $\mathbb {F}_{q^{2}}$ with the same parameters. Consequently, the theory of classical codes over $\mathbb {F}_{q^{2}}$ can be used directly to symbol-pair codes; in particular, by virtue of this result, some known results can be reobtained immediately.},

  abstract     = {Insertion and deletion (insdel for short) codes have recently attracted a lot of attention due to their applications in many interesting fields such as DNA storage, DNA analysis, race-track memory error correction and language processing. The present paper mainly studies limits and constructions of insdel codes. The paper can be divided into two parts. The first part focuses on various bounds, while the second part concentrates on constructions of insdel codes. Although the insdel-metric Singleton bound has been derived before, it is still unknown if there are any nontrivial codes achieving this bound. Our first result shows that any nontrivial insdel codes do not achieve the insdel-metric Singleton bound. The second bound shows that every $[n,k]$ Reed-Solomon code has insdel distance upper bounded by $2n-4k+4$ and it is known in literature that an $[n,k]$ Reed-Solomon code can have insdel distance $2n-4k+4$ as long as the field size is sufficiently large. The third bound shows a trade-off between insdel distance and code alphabet size for codes achieving the Hamming-metric Singleton bound. In the second part of the paper, we first provide a non-explicit construction of nonlinear codes that can approach the insdel-metric Singleton bound arbitrarily when the code alphabet size is sufficiently large. The second construction gives two-dimensional Reed-Solomon codes of length $n$ and insdel distance $2n-4$ with field size $q=O(n^{5})$ . The non-explicit construction of insdel codes is based on constant-weight $L^{1}$ -codes that are introduced in this paper. We first establish a relation between constant-weight $L^{1}$ -codes and insdel codes. Based on this relation, we construct constant-weight $L^{1}$ -codes with reasonable parameters and subsequently give insdel codes approaching the insdel-metric Singleton bound. Via automorphism group of rational function field, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which a two-dimensional Reed-Solomon code of length $n$ has insdel distance $2n-4$ . Based on this criterion, we present a construction of $q$ -ary two-dimensional Reed-Solomon codes of length $n$ and insdel distance $2n-4$ with $q=O(n^{5})$ . Though this is worse than the current best field size, we provide a new angle to look into the problem.},

We propose two novel decoding algorithms for inference from multiple received sequences, both combining the inner code and channel to a joint hidden Markov model to infer symbolwise a posteriori probabilities (APPs). The first decoder computes the exact APPs by jointly decoding the received sequences, whereas the second decoder approximates the APPs by combining the results of separately decoded received sequences and has a complexity that is linear with the number of sequences. Using the proposed algorithms, we evaluate the performance of decoding multiple received sequences by means of achievable information rates and Monte-Carlo simulations. We show significant performance gains compared to a single received sequence. In addition, we succeed in improving the performance of the aforementioned coding scheme by optimizing both the inner and outer codes.},

  abstract     = {Spatially-coupled (SC) codes, known for their threshold saturation phenomenon and low-latency windowed decoding algorithms, are ideal for streaming applications and data storage systems. SC codes are constructed by partitioning an underlying block code, followed by rearranging and concatenating the partitioned components in a convolutional manner. The number of partitioned components determines the memory of SC codes. In this paper, we investigate the relation between the performance of SC codes and the density distribution of partitioning matrices. While adopting higher memories results in improved SC code performance, obtaining finite-length, high-performance SC codes with high memory is known to be computationally challenging. We break this computational bottleneck by developing a novel probabilistic framework that obtains (locally) optimal density distributions via gradient descent. Starting from random partitioning matrices abiding by the obtained distribution, we perform low-complexity optimization algorithms that minimize the number of detrimental objects to construct high-memory, high-performance quasi-cyclic SC codes. We apply our framework to various objects of interest, from the simplest short cycles, to more sophisticated objects such as concatenated cycles aiming at finer-grained optimization. Simulation results show that codes obtained through our proposed method notably outperform state-of-the-art SC codes with the same constraint length and optimized SC codes with uniform partitioning. The performance gain is shown to be universal over a variety of channels, from canonical channels such as additive white Gaussian noise and binary symmetric channels, to practical channels underlying flash memory and magnetic recording systems.},

  abstract     = {Many emerging multimedia streaming applications involve multiple users communicating under strict latency constraints. In this paper we study streaming codes for a network involving two source nodes, one relay node and a destination node. In this paper’s setting, each source node transmits a stream of messages, through the relay, to a destination, who is required to decode the messages under a strict delay constraint. For the case of a single source node, a class of streaming codes has been proposed by Fong et al., using the concept of delay-spectrum. The current paper presents a novel framework, which constructs streaming codes for a relayed multi-user setting by sequentially constructing the codes for each link. This requires a characterization of the set of all achievable delay spectra for a given rate, blocklength and number of erasures, beyond the specific choice considered by Fong et al. This characterization is presented in the paper for systematic codes. Using this novel framework, the first proposed scheme involves greedily selecting the rate on the link from relay to destination and using properties of the delay-spectrum to find feasible streaming codes that satisfy the required delay constraints. A closed form expression for the achievable rate region is provided, and conditions for when the proposed scheme is optimal are established by a natural outer bound. The second proposed scheme builds upon this approach, but uses a numerical optimization-based approach to improve the achievable rate region over the first scheme. Experimental results show that the proposed schemes achieve significant improvements over baseline schemes based on single-user codes.},

In earlier works, these codes have been studied in the context of codes with locality. The notion of locality has been extended to hierarchical locality, which allows for locality to gradually increase in levels with the increase in the number of erasures. We consider the locality constraints imposed by codes with two-level hierarchical locality and define maximally recoverable codes with hierarchical locality. We characterize the set of all erasure patterns which can be corrected by hierarchical data-local and hierarchical local maximally recoverable codes (MRC). We show that by carefully puncturing coordinates of the code, hierarchical local MRC can be reduced to hierarchical data-local MRC. Based on picking elements of finite fields and their extensions, all of which satisfy certain linear independence properties, we provide a generic construction of parity check matrix of hierarchical local MRC for all parameters. By appropriately modifying parity check matrices of local MRCs with limited parities, we also give constructions of hierarchical local MRCs with limited parities. Finally, we also derive a lower bound on the field size of hierarchical local MRCs.},

  abstract     = {Let $X$ be a random vector valued in $\mathbb {R}^{m}$ such that $\|X\|_{2} \le 1$ almost surely. For every $k\ge 3$ , we show that there exists a sigma algebra $\mathcal {F}$ generated by a partition of $\mathbb {R}^{m}$ into $k$ sets such that $\|\mathrm {Cov}(X) - \mathrm {Cov}(\mathbb {E}[X\mid \mathcal {F}]) \|_{\mathrm {F}} \lesssim \frac {1}{\sqrt {\log {k}}}$ . This is optimal up to the implicit constant and improves on a previous bound due to Boedihardjo, Strohmer, and Vershynin. Our proof provides an efficient algorithm for constructing $\mathcal {F}$ and leads to improved accuracy guarantees for $k$ -anonymous or differentially private synthetic data. We also establish a connection between the above problem of minimizing the covariance loss and the pinning lemma from statistical physics, providing an alternate (and much simpler) algorithmic proof in the important case when $X \in {\pm 1}^{m}/\sqrt {m}$ almost surely.},

  abstract     = {We study the richness of the ensemble of graphical structures (i.e., unlabeled graphs) of the one-dimensional random geometric graph model defined by $n$ nodes randomly scattered in [0, 1] that connect if they are within the connection range $r\in [{0,1}]$ . We provide bounds on the number of possible structures which give universal upper bounds on the structural entropy that hold for any $n$ , $r$ and distribution of the node locations. For fixed $r$ , the number of structures is $\Theta (a^{2n})$ with $a=a(r)=2 \cos {\left ({\frac {\pi }{\lceil 1/r \rceil +2}}\right)}$ , and therefore the structural entropy is upper bounded by $2n\log _{2} a(r) + O(1)$ . For large $n$ , we derive bounds on the structural entropy normalized by $n$ , and evaluate them for independent and uniformly distributed node locations. When the connection range $r_{n}$ is $O(1/n)$ , the obtained upper bound is given in terms of a function that increases with $n r_{n}$ and asymptotically attains 2 bits per node. If the connection range is bounded away from zero and one, the upper and lower bounds decrease linearly with $r$ , as $2(1-r)$ and $(1-r)\log _{2} e$ , respectively. When $r_{n}$ is vanishing but dominates $1/n$ (e.g., $r_{n} \propto \ln n / n$ ), the normalized entropy is between $\log _{2} e \approx 1.44$ and 2 bits per node. We also give a simple encoding scheme for random structures that requires 2 bits per node. The upper bounds in this paper easily extend to the entropy of the labeled random graph model, since this is given by the structural entropy plus a term that accounts for all the permutations of node labels that are possible for a given structure, which is no larger than $\log _{2}(n!) = n \log _{2} n {-} n + O(\log _{2} n)$ .},

  abstract     = {Graphical data arises naturally in several modern applications, including but not limited to internet graphs, social networks, genomics and proteomics. The typically large size of graphical data argues for the importance of designing universal compression methods for such data. In most applications, the graphical data is sparse, meaning that the number of edges in the graph scales more slowly than $n^{2}$ , where $n$ denotes the number of vertices. Although in some applications the number of edges scales linearly with $n$ , in others the number of edges is much smaller than $n^{2}$ but appears to scale superlinearly with $n$ . We call the former sparse graphs and the latter heavy-tailed sparse graphs. In this paper we introduce a universal lossless compression method which is simultaneously applicable to both classes. We do this by employing the local weak convergence framework for sparse graphs and the sparse graphon framework for heavy-tailed sparse graphs.},

Under the criterion that stipulates minimization of the Type II error subject to a (constant) upper bound $\epsilon $ on the Type I error, we characterize the set of encoding rates and exponent for both discrete memoryless and memoryless vector Gaussian settings. For the DM setting, we provide a converse proof and show that it is achieved using the Quantize-Bin-Test scheme of Rahman and Wagner. For the memoryless vector Gaussian setting, we develop a tight outer bound by means of a technique that relies on the de Bruijn identity and the properties of Fisher information. In particular, the result shows that for memoryless vector Gaussian sources the rate-exponent region is exhausted using the Quantize-Bin-Test scheme with Gaussian test channels; and there is no loss in performance caused by restricting the sensors’ encoders not to employ time sharing. Furthermore, we also study a variant of the problem in which the source, not necessarily Gaussian, has finite differential entropy and the sensors’ observations noises under the null hypothesis are Gaussian. For this model, our main result is an upper bound on the exponent-rate function. The bound is shown to mirror a corresponding explicit lower bound, except that the lower bound involves the source power (variance) whereas the upper bound has the source entropy power. Part of the utility of the established bound is for investigating asymptotic exponent/rates and losses incurred by distributed detection as function of the number of sensors.},

In this paper we study questions related to the computability of the bandwidth of computable bandlimited signals. To this end we employ the concept of Turing computability, which exactly describes what is theoretically feasible and can be computed on a digital computer. Recently, it has been shown that there exist computable bandlimited signals with finite energy, the actual bandwidth of which is not a computable number, and hence cannot be computed on a digital computer. In this work, we consider the most general class of band-limited signals, together with different computable descriptions thereof. Among other things, our analysis includes a characterization of the arithmetic complexity of the bandwidth of such signals and yields a negative answer to the question of whether it is at least possible to compute non-trivial upper or lower bounds for the bandwidth of a bandlimited signal. Furthermore, we relate the problem of bandwidth computation to the theory of oracle machines. In particular, we consider halting and totality oracles, which belong to the most frequently investigated oracle machines in the theory of computation.},

In this paper, we analyze the nonasymptotic performance of ESPRIT and spatial-smoothing ESPRIT with finitely many snapshots and finite SNR. We show that the absolute frequency estimation error of ESPRIT (or spatial-smoothing ESPRIT) is bounded from above by $C\frac {\max \left {{\sigma, \sigma ^{2}}\right }}{\sqrt {L}}$ with overwhelming probability, where $\sigma ^{2}$ denotes the Gaussian noise variance, $L$ is the number of snapshots and $C$ is a coefficient independent of $L$ and $\sigma ^{2}$ , if and only if the true frequencies can be localized by ESPRIT (or spatial-smoothing ESPRIT) without noise or with infinitely many snapshots. Our results are obtained by deriving new matrix perturbation bounds and generalizing the classical Schur product theorem, which may be of independent interest. Extensions to MUSIC and spatial-smoothing MUSIC are also made. Numerical results are provided corroborating our analysis.},

First of all, we convert TSF into a more inclusive problem called tensor completion with arbitrary sampling (TCAS), which is to restore a tensor from a subset of its entries sampled in an arbitrary manner. While it is known that, in the framework of Tucker low-rankness, it is theoretically impossible to identify the target tensor based on some arbitrarily selected entries, in this work we shall show that TCAS is indeed tackleable in the light of a new concept called convolutional low-rankness, which is a generalization of the well-known Fourier sparsity. Then we introduce a convex program termed Convolution Nuclear Norm Minimization (CNNM), and we prove that CNNM succeeds in solving TCAS as long as a sampling condition—which depends on the convolution rank of the target tensor—is obeyed. This theory provides a meaningful answer to the fundamental question of what is the minimum sampling size needed for making a given number of forecasts. Experiments on univariate time series, images and videos show encouraging results.},

We propose a new coding scheme based on random algebraic codes–coset codes in particular–of asymptotically large block-length. We analyze its performance and derive a single-letter information-theoretic inner bound. This bound subsumes the largest known inner bound and improves upon it strictly for identified examples.

By leveraging the uniform power allocation in the frequency domain for all the admissible carriers (a necessary condition for beating the existing periodic correlation lower bound of SCSs), we present a tighter correlation lower bound and show that it is achievable by our proposed SCS families including multiple SCS sets with zero correlation zone properties.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents flexible storage codes, a class of error-correcting codes that can recover information from a flexible number of storage nodes. As a result, one can make better use of the available storage nodes in the presence of unpredictable node failures and reduce the data access latency. Assume a storage system encodes $k\ell $ information symbols over a finite field $\mathbb {F}$ into $n$ nodes, each of size $\ell $ symbols. The code is parameterized by a set of tuples ${(R_{j},\ell _{j}): 1 \le j \le a}$ , satisfying $\ell _{1} &amp;lt; \ell _{2} &amp;lt; {\dots } &amp;lt; \ell _{a} = \ell $ and $R_{1}&amp;gt;R_{2}&amp;gt; {\dots }&amp;gt;R_{a}$ , such that the information symbols can be reconstructed from any $R_{j}$ nodes, each node accessing $\ell _{j}$ symbols, for any $1 \le j \le a$ . In other words, the code allows a flexible number of nodes for decoding to accommodate the variance in the data access time of the nodes. Code constructions are presented for different storage scenarios, including LRC (locally recoverable) codes, PMDS (partial MDS) codes, and MSR (minimum storage regenerating) codes. We analyze the latency of accessing information and perform simulations on Amazon clusters to show the efficiency of the presented codes.},

  abstract     = {Convex optimization with feedback is a framework where a learner relies on iterative queries and feedback to arrive at the minimizer of a convex function. It has gained considerable popularity thanks to its scalability in large-scale optimization and machine learning. The repeated interactions, however, expose the learner to privacy risks from eavesdropping adversaries that observe the submitted queries. In this paper, we study how to optimally obfuscate the learner’s queries in convex optimization with first-order feedback, so that their learned optimal value is provably difficult to estimate for an eavesdropping adversary. We consider two formulations of learner privacy: a Bayesian formulation in which the convex function is drawn randomly, and a maximin formulation in which the function is fixed and the adversary’s probability of error is measured with respect to a minimax criterion. Suppose that the learner wishes to ensure the adversary cannot estimate accurately with probability greater than $1/L$ for some $L &amp;gt; 0$ . Our main results show that the query complexity overhead is additive in $L$ in the maximin formulation, but multiplicative in $L$ in the Bayesian formulation. Compared to existing learner-private sequential learning models with binary feedback, our results apply to the significantly richer family of general convex functions with full-gradient feedback. Our proofs rely on tools from the theory of Dirichlet processes, as well as a novel strategy designed for measuring information leakage under a full-gradient oracle.},

Yet, it is known that accurately generating private, synthetic data of certain kinds is NP-hard. We develop a statistical framework for differentially private synthetic data, which enables us to circumvent the computational hardness of the problem. We consider the true data as a random sample drawn from a population $\Omega $ according to some unknown density. We then replace $\Omega $ by a much smaller random subset $\Omega ^{\ast}$ , which we sample according to some known density. We generate synthetic data on the reduced space $\Omega ^{\ast}$ by fitting the specified linear statistics obtained from the true data. To ensure privacy we use the common Laplacian mechanism. Employing the concept of Rényi condition number, which measures how well the sampling distribution is correlated with the population distribution, we derive explicit bounds on the privacy and accuracy provided by the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This work establishes that the physical layer can be used to perform information-theoretic authentication in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, as long as the adversary is not omniscient. The model considered consists of an encoder, decoder, and adversary, where the adversary knows the message given to the encoder, has a non-causal noisy observation of the encoder’s transmission and may use unlimited transmission power, while the decoder observes a noisy version of the sum of the encoder and adversary’s outputs. A method to modify a generic existing channel code to enable authentication is presented. This method relies on injecting message-dependent noise into the transmission and accepting the transmission as authentic only if the correct noise levels for the decoded message are observed. One drawback to this method is that the encoder must still transmit a low-power signal in the case where there is no message to send. It is shown that this modification costs an asymptotically negligible amount of the coding rate, while still enabling authentication as long as the adversary’s observation is not noiseless. Also notable is that this modification is not (asymptotically) a function of the statistical characterization of the adversary’s channel and no secret key is required. We believe these features will pave the way for a robust practical implementation. Using these results, the channel-authenticated capacity is calculated and shown to be equal to the non-adversarial channel capacity. As our results will show, information-theoretic authentication in AWGN channels is possible without the need for the legitimate party to have a model-based advantage over the adversary. While this modular scheme is designed for use in the given channel model, it is applicable to a wide range of settings.},

By now, there exists a variety of results which show that a wide range of functions can be approximated with sometimes surprising accuracy by these outputs. For example, it is known that the set of functions that can be approximated with exponential accuracy (in terms of the number of parameters used) includes, on one hand, very smooth functions such as polynomials and analytic functions and, on the other hand, very rough functions such as the Weierstrass function, which is nowhere differentiable. In this paper, we add to the latter class of rough functions by showing that it also includes refinable functions. Namely, we show that refinable functions are approximated by the outputs of deep ReLU neural networks with a fixed width and increasing depth with accuracy exponential in terms of their number of parameters. Our results apply to functions used in the standard construction of wavelets as well as to functions constructed via subdivision algorithms in Computer Aided Geometric Design.},

  abstract     = {Riemannian Gaussian distributions were initially introduced as basic building blocks for learning models which aim to capture the intrinsic structure of statistical populations of positive-definite matrices (here called covariance matrices). While the potential applications of such models have attracted significant attention, a major obstacle still stands in the way of these applications: there seems to exist no practical method of computing the normalising factors associated with Riemannian Gaussian distributions on spaces of high-dimensional covariance matrices. The present paper shows that this missing method comes from an unexpected new connection with random matrix theory. Its main contribution is to prove that Riemannian Gaussian distributions of real, complex, or quaternion covariance matrices are equivalent to orthogonal, unitary, or symplectic log-normal matrix ensembles. This equivalence yields a highly efficient approximation of the normalising factors, in terms of a rather simple analytic expression. The error due to this approximation decreases like the inverse square of dimension. Numerical experiments are conducted which demonstrate how this new approximation can unlock the difficulties which have impeded applications to real-world datasets of high-dimensional covariance matrices. The paper then turns to Riemannian Gaussian distributions of block-Toeplitz covariance matrices. These are equivalent to yet another kind of random matrix ensembles, here called “acosh-normal” ensembles. Orthogonal and unitary “acosh-normal” ensembles correspond to the cases of block-Toeplitz with Toeplitz blocks, and block-Toeplitz (with general blocks) covariance matrices, respectively.},

Each subset of nodes with cardinality $d$ is generated independently as an order- $d$ hyperedge with a certain probability that depends on the ground-truth communities that the $d$ nodes belong to. The goal is to exactly recover the $k$ hidden communities based on the observed hypergraph. We show that there exists a sharp threshold such that exact recovery is achievable above the threshold and impossible below the threshold (apart from a small regime of parameters that will be specified precisely). This threshold is represented in terms of a quantity which we term as the generalized Chernoff-Hellinger divergence between communities. Our result for this general model recovers prior results for the standard SBM and $d$ -HSBM with two symmetric communities as special cases. En route to proving our achievability results, we develop a polynomial-time two-stage algorithm that meets the threshold. The first stage adopts a certain hypergraph spectral clustering method to obtain a coarse estimate of communities, and the second stage refines each node individually via local refinement steps to ensure exact recovery.},

This distributional theory in turn allows one to construct valid and short confidence intervals for both the unseen tensor entries and the unknown tensor factors. The proposed inferential procedure enjoys several important features: (1) it is fully adaptive to noise heteroscedasticity, and (2) it is data-driven and automatically adapts to unknown noise distributions. Furthermore, our findings unveil the statistical optimality of nonconvex tensor completion: it attains un-improvable $\ell _{2}$ accuracy—including both the rates and the pre-constants—when estimating both the unknown tensor and the underlying tensor factors.},

Recently there has been progress in the ultra-high dimensional setting when the sample size $n$ is fixed and the dimension $p$ tends to infinity. Despite these advances, the correlation screening framework suffers from practical, methodological and theoretical deficiencies. For instance, previous correlation screening theory requires that the population covariance matrix be sparse and block diagonal. This block sparsity assumption is however restrictive in practical applications. As a second example, correlation and partial correlation screening requires the estimation of dependence measures, which can be computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a unifying approach to correlation and partial correlation mining that is not restricted to block diagonal correlation structure, thus yielding a methodology that is suitable for modern applications. By making connections to random geometric graphs, the number of highly correlated or partial correlated variables are shown to have compound Poisson finite-sample characterizations, which hold for both the finite $p$ case and when $p$ tends to infinity. The unifying framework also demonstrates a duality between correlation and partial correlation screening with theoretical and practical consequences.},

Thus, a vast amount of literature is devoted to finding tight and computable bounds on these capacities. We add a new viewpoint by giving operationally motivated bounds on several capacities, including the quantum capacity and private capacity of a quantum channel and the one-way distillable entanglement and private key of a quantum state. These bounds are generally phrased in terms of capacity quantities involving the complementary channel or state. As a tool to obtain these bounds, we discuss partial orders on quantum channels and states, such as the less noisy and the more capable order. Our bounds help to further understand the interplay between different capacities, as they give operational limitations on superadditivity and the difference between capacities in terms of the information-theoretic properties of the complementary channel or state. They can also be used as a new approach towards numerically bounding capacities, as discussed with some examples.},

In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that solves this problem in ${\mathrm{ poly}}(\log (N), r, 1/\varepsilon)$ time, where $r$ is the lower rank of $\rho $ and $\sigma $ , and $\varepsilon $ is the desired precision, provided that the purifications of $\rho $ and $\sigma $ are prepared by quantum oracles. This algorithm exhibits an exponential speedup over the best known algorithm (based on quantum state tomography) which has time complexity polynomial in $N$ .},

Weconcatenate alternant codes with any linear code achievingthe classical GV bound to construct Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes. We show that the concatenated code can achieve the quantum GV bound asymptotically and can approach the Hashing bound for asymmetric Pauli channels. By combing Steane’s enlargement construction of CSS codes, we derive a family of enlarged stabilizer codes achieving the quantum GV bound for enlarged CSS codes asymptotically. Asapplications, we derive two families of fast encodable and decodable CSS codes with parameters $\mathscr {Q}_{1}=[[N,\Omega (\sqrt {N}),\Omega (\sqrt {N})]]$ , and $\mathscr {Q}_{2}=[[N,\Omega (N/\log N),\Omega (N/\log N)/\Omega (\log N)]]$ . We show that $\mathscr {Q}_{1}$ can be encoded very efficiently by circuits of size $O(N)$ and depth $O(\sqrt {N})$ . For an input error syndrome, $\mathscr {Q}_{1}$ can correct any adversarial error of weight up to half the minimum distance bound in $O(N)$ time. $\mathscr {Q}_{1}$ can also be decoded in parallel in $O(\sqrt {N})$ time by using $O(\sqrt {N})$ classical processors. For an input error syndrome, we proved that $\mathscr {Q}_{2}$ can correct a linear number of ${X}$ -errors with high probability and an almost linear number of ${Z}$ -errors in $O(N)$ time.

However, there has not been a general, necessary and sufficient, and operational separability condition to determine whether an arbitrary quantum state is entangled or separable. In this paper, we show that whether a quantum state is entangled or not is determined by a threshold within the quantum state. We first introduce the concept of finer and optimal separable states based on the properties of separable states in the role of higher-level witnesses. Then we show that any bipartite quantum state can be decomposed into a convex mixture of its optimal entangled state and its optimal separable state. Furthermore, we show that whether an arbitrary quantum state is entangled or separable, as well as positive partial transposition (PPT) or not, is determined by the robustness of its optimal entangled state to its optimal separable state with reference to a crucial threshold. Moreover, for an arbitrary quantum state, we provide operational algorithms to obtain its optimal entangled state, its optimal separable state, its best separable approximation (BSA) decomposition, and its best PPT approximation decomposition. And the open question of how to calculate the BSA in high-dimension systems is partially done.},

The upper bound is obtained borrowing concepts from convex geometry and it extends to MIMO channels notable results from the geometric analysis on the capacity of scalar Gaussian channels. Relying on a sphere packing argument and on the renowned Steiner’s formula, the proposed upper bound depends on the intrinsic volumes of the constraint region, i.e., functionals defining a measure of the geometric features of a convex body. The tightness of the bound is investigated at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for any arbitrary convex amplitude constraint region, for any channel matrix realization, and any dimension of the MIMO system. In addition, two variants of the upper bound are proposed: one is useful to ensure the feasibility in the evaluation of the bound and the other to improve the bound’s performance in the low SNR regime. Finally, the upper bound is specialized for two practical transmitter configurations, either employing a single power amplifier for all transmitting antennas or a power amplifier for each antenna.},

  abstract     = {Multiple groupcasting over the broadcast channel (BC) is studied in a special setting. In particular, an inner bound is obtained for the $K$ -receiver discrete memoryless (DM) BC for the diamond message set which consists of four groupcast messages: one desired by all receivers, one by all but two receivers, and two more desired by all but each one of those two receivers. The inner bound is based on rate-splitting and superposition coding and is given in explicit form herein as a union over coding distributions of four-dimensional polytopes. This inner bound is then shown to be the capacity for a certain class of partially ordered DM BCs with order defined via the less noisy condition. When specialized to the so- called combination network, which is a class of three-layer (two-hop) broadcast networks parameterized by $2^{K}{-}1$ finite-and-arbitrary-capacity noiseless links from the source node in the first layer to as many nodes of the second layer, our top-down approach from the DM BC to the combination network yields an explicit inner bound as a single polytope via the identification of a single coding distribution. This inner bound consists of inequalities which are then identified to be within the class of generalized cut-set outer bounds recently obtained by Salimi et al for broadcast networks. We hence establish the capacity region of the general $K$ -user combination network for the diamond message set, and do so in explicit and structured form. Such a result implies a certain strength of our inner bound for the DM BC in that it (a) produces a hitherto unknown capacity region when specialized to the combination network and (b) may capture many combinatorial aspects of the capacity region of the $K$ -receiver DM BC itself for the diamond message set. Moreover, we extend that inner bound by adding binning to it. As in the no-binning case, we provide the more general inner bound in explicit form.},

  abstract     = {A novel class of achievable rate regions is obtained for the general $K$ -receiver discrete memoryless broadcast channel over which two groupcast messages are to be transmitted, with each message required by an arbitrary group of receivers. The associated achievability schemes are parameterized by an expansion of the message set which then determines how random coding techniques are employed. These techniques include generalized versions of up-set message-splitting, the generation of possibly multiple auxiliary codebooks for certain compositions of split messages using superposition coding with subset inclusion order, partial interference decoding at all receivers in general, joint unique decoding at receivers that desire both messages, and non-unique or indirect decoding at receivers that desire only one of the two messages. The generality of the proposed class of schemes implies new achievable rate regions for problems previously not considered as well as those that were studied before, with specific members of that class having rate regions that coincide with previously found capacity regions for special classes of broadcast channels with two private or two nested groupcast messages, wherein the group of receivers desiring one message is contained in that desiring the other. Moreover, new capacity results are established for certain partially ordered classes of broadcast channels for a class of two non-nested groupcast messages. To further show the strength of the proposed achievable rate regions we consider the so-called combination network as a test case. When specialized to the combination network, some members of the class of inner bounds are shown, via converse results, to result in the capacity region when the two messages are (a) intended for two distinct sets of $K{-}1$ receivers each and (b) nested, in which one message is intended for one or two (common) receivers and both messages are intended for all other (private) receivers. In the latter two nested messages cases, we hence recover, in a top-down manner, previous results by Bidokhti, Prabhakaran, and Diggavi, obtained therein using lower complexity network coding schemes based on rate-splitting and linear superposition coding but tailored to the combination network, while in the first case we obtain a new capacity result for a non-nested message set, which was hitherto unknown. Furthermore, we show the achievability of rate pairs in two interesting examples of combination networks, with three and four common receivers each. These examples were proposed in the previous literature to show the sub-optimality of the aforementioned rate-splitting and linear superposition coding scheme, and hence to motivate the additional consideration of a pre-encoding technique and a block-Markov linear superposition coding for the combination network, with the latter then lifted to the general broadcast channel. Our results suggest that the proposed framework here for the general broadcast channel when specialized to the combination network is strong enough to incorporate the enhancements afforded by those two latter techniques, thereby implying that perhaps block-Markov superposition coding is not necessary in the general broadcast channel. Moreover, there is a trade-off between the complexity of the coding scheme within the class of schemes we propose when applied to the combination network and that of the determination of the distribution of the auxiliary random variables and the encoding function that achieve the capacity region. This may have interesting implications for the general broadcast channel as well.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of designing low-redundancy codes in settings where one must correct deletions in conjunction with substitutions or adjacent transpositions; a combination of errors that is usually observed in DNA-based data storage. One of the most basic versions of this problem was settled more than 50 years ago by Levenshtein, who proved that binary Varshamov-Tenengolts codes correct one arbitrary edit error, i.e., one deletion or one substitution, with nearly optimal redundancy. However, this approach fails to extend to many simple and natural variations of the binary single-edit error setting. In this work, we make progress on the code design problem above in three such variations: 1) We construct linear-time encodable and decodable length- $n$ non-binary codes correcting a single edit error with nearly optimal redundancy $\log n+O(\log \log n)$ , providing an alternative simpler proof of a result by Cai et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2021). This is achieved by employing what we call weighted VT sketches, a new notion that may be of independent interest. 2) We show the existence of a binary code correcting one deletion or one adjacent transposition with nearly optimal redundancy $\log n+O(\log \log n)$ . 3) We construct linear-time encodable and list-decodable binary codes with list-size 2 for one deletion and one substitution with redundancy $4\log n+O(\log \log n)$ . This matches the Gilbert-Varshamov existential bound up to an $O(\log \log n)$ additive term.},

By turning this problem into a graph edge-labeling problem, we are able to determine the maximum size of codes when $k=3,4$ and $t=2,3$ for a given ground set. The constructions are based on combinatorial designs, matching decompositions and edge coloring schemes. Furthermore, we improve the upper bound for balanced $(t,k,v)$ set codes with all integers $2\leq t &amp;lt; k &amp;lt; v$ . By the powerful probabilistic argument–Kahn’s Theorem, we show that the improved upper bound for any fixed integers $2 \leq t &amp;lt; k$ is asymptotically tight when $v$ goes to infinity.},

  abstract     = {An $(n,k)$ recoverable property array code is composed of $m\times n$ arrays such that any $k$ out of $n$ columns suffice to retrieve all the information symbols, where $n &amp;gt; k$ . Note that maximum distance separable (MDS) array code is a special $(n,k)$ recoverable property array code of size $m\times n$ with the number of information symbols being $km$ . Expanded-Blaum-Roth (EBR) codes and Expanded-Independent-Parity (EIP) codes are two classes of $(n,k)$ recoverable property array codes that can repair any one symbol in a column by locally accessing some other symbols within the column, where the number of symbols $m$ in a column is a prime number. By generalizing the constructions of EBR and EIP codes, we propose new $(n,k)$ recoverable property array codes, such that any one symbol can be locally recovered and the number of symbols in a column can be not only a prime number but also a power of an odd prime number. Also, we present an efficient encoding/decoding method for the proposed generalized EBR (GEBR) and generalized EIP (GEIP) codes based on the LU factorization of a Vandermonde matrix. We show that the proposed decoding method has less computational complexity than existing methods. Furthermore, we show that the proposed GEBR codes have both a larger minimum symbol distance and a larger recovery ability of erased lines for some parameters when compared to EBR codes. We also present a necessary and sufficient condition of enabling EBR codes to recover any $r$ erased lines of a slope for any parameter $r$ , which was an open problem. Moreover, we show that EBR codes can recover any $r$ consecutive erased lines of any slope for any parameter $r$ .},

  abstract     = {This paper gives some theory and efficient design of binary block codes capable of controlling the deletions of the symbol “0” (referred to as 0-deletions) and/or the insertions of the symbol “0” (referred to as 0-insertions). This problem of controlling 0-deletions and/or 0-insertions (referred to as 0-errors) is shown to be equivalent to the efficient design of $L_{1}$ metric asymmetric error control codes over the natural alphabet, ${\mathbf{I}}\!{\mathbf{I}}\!\!{\mathbf{N}}$ . In this way, it is shown that the $t 0$ -insertion correcting codes are actually capable of controlling much more; namely, they can correct $t 0$ -errors, detect $(t+1)\,\,0$ -errors and, simultaneously, detect all occurrences of only 0-deletions or only 0-insertions in every received word (briefly, they are $t$ -Symmetric 0-Error Correcting/ $(t+1)$ -Symmetric 0-Error Detecting/All Unidirectional 0-Error Detecting ( $t$ -Sy0EC/ $(t+1)$ -Sy0ED/AU0ED) codes). From the relations with the $L_{1}$ distance error control codes, new improved bounds are given for the optimal $t 0$ -error correcting codes. Optimal non-systematic code designs are given. Decoding can be efficiently performed by algebraic means using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA).},

  abstract     = {Locally repairable codes have become a key instrument in large-scale distributed storage systems. This paper focuses on the construction of locally repairable codes with $(r,\delta)$ -locality that achieve equality in the Singleton-type bound. We use matrix-product codes to propose two constructions of $q$ -ary optimal $(r,\delta)$ locally repairable codes of lengths up to $q^{2}+q$ . The ingredients in the matrix-product codes are linear maximum distance separable codes. We give another construction of optimal $(r,\delta)$ locally repairable codes by using optimal locally repairable codes as ingredients in the matrix-product approach. The codes in this third construction have unbounded lengths not divisible by $(r+\delta -1)$ . The three constructions of optimal $(r,\delta)$ locally repairable codes constructed here are new. Previously constructed codes in the literature have not covered the same sets of parameters. Our construction proposals are flexible since one can easily vary $r$ and $\delta $ to come up with particular parameters that can suit numerous scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Laplacian distribution is widely used to model the differences between correlated continuous or nonbinary signals, e.g., the predictive residues of videos. Usually, distributed coding of correlated nonbinary sources, e.g., distributed video coding, is implemented by binary or nonbinary Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. In this paper, as an alternative, we attempt using nonbinary Distributed Arithmetic Coding (DAC) to implement distributed coding of uniform nonbinary sources with Laplace-distributed correlation. To analyze $Q$ -ary DAC for uniform $Q$ -ary sources, following the methodology developed in our prior work for binary DAC, we define and deduce Coset Cardinality Spectrum (CCS) from both fixed-length and variable-length perspectives, whose physical meanings are explained in detail; while for binary DAC, our prior work totally ignored the subtle difference between these two perspectives. Compared with binary DAC, an important advantage of nonbinary DAC is that, the mapping from source symbols to coding intervals is so flexible that there are many parameters that can be tuned to achieve better performance; while for binary DAC, there are very few tunable parameters, making it very hard to achieve better performance. This paper proposes a simple method to map source symbols onto coding intervals, which results in a very lightweight codec, while possessing a good Manhattan distance distribution. Then this paper deduces the formula of path metrics for decoder design by making use of CCS. All theoretical analyses are perfectly verified by simulation results. Most important, experimental results show that $Q$ -ary DAC achieves significantly better performance than LDPC codes for distributed coding of uniform $Q$ -ary sources with Laplace-distributed correlation.},

  abstract     = {Compute–forward is a coding technique that enables receiver(s) in a network to directly decode one or more linear combinations of the transmitted codewords. Initial efforts focused on Gaussian channels and derived achievable rate regions via nested lattice codes and single-user (lattice) decoding as well as sequential (lattice) decoding. Recently, these results have been generalized to discrete memoryless channels via nested linear codes and joint typicality coding, culminating in a simultaneous-decoding rate region for recovering one or more linear combinations from $K$ users. Using a discretization approach, this paper translates this result into a simultaneous-decoding rate region for a wide class of continuous memoryless channels, including the important special case of Gaussian channels. Additionally, this paper derives a single, unified expression for both discrete and continuous rate regions via an algebraic generalization of Rényi’s information dimension.},
