  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a one-of-a-kind thermal-based variable impedance module to be used towards developing a variable impedance actuator. Unlike other variable impedance actuators, where the impedance adjustment modules employ a mechanism to regulate their impedance, this novel module does it through controlling temperature of a thermoplastic polymer Polycaprolactone. The viscoelastic properties of polycaprolactone are temperature-dependent, increasing the rigidity when it is cooling down and softening when it is heating up. To change the temperature, thermo-electric Peltiers are embedded into the design. Preliminary experiments have shown that this module is able to adjust its impedance through changing the temperature. The simplicity and lightness of the proposed off-line impedance adjustment approach make it a suitable choice when the actuator’s size, weight, and compactness are the main concerns. This is because the proposed design is highly scalable, and by scaling down the size of the module, its performance regarding the speed of impedance adjustment would increase.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic actuation of untethered small-scale helical devices (USHDs) shows great potential for targeted drug delivery or as minimally invasive surgical tools in the human body. However, ensuring the success of therapeutic interventions in anatomically challenging regions, such as neck vascular networks with winding pathways and branching, demands the incorporation of precise image feedback and a robust control method. How to construct a control method with precise navigation ability in complex and hard-to-reach body districts is still a challenging work. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop control strategy for the USHD based on a permanent-magnet robotic (PMR) system inside a three-dimensional (3-D) vascular model with blood. First, the 3-D vascular model is reconstructed using 2-D ultrasound images. Second, the point-to-point closed-loop control of the USHD is performed under ultrasound guidance, and the control input is obtained to act on both the PMR system and the ultrasound system. Next, the USHD navigates the different pathways of the 3-D vascular model under the proposed control strategy. Finally, our in vitro experimental results indicate that the maximum mean absolute position error between the target point of each branch and the actual position reached by the USHD (length and diameter of 6 mm and 1.5 mm, respectively) is 6.4±3.8 mm and 4.2±2.8 mm when the blood flow rate is 16.6 mL/min, which corresponds to 28% of the maximum venous flow rate.},

  abstract     = {Rigid lower limb exoskeletons (LLEs) have limited flexibility while soft exosuits lack load bearing capability. To address this contradiction, inspired by ankle biotensegrity, a Bionic Ankle Tensegrity Exoskeleton (BATE) that combines rigid and soft structures is proposed to match the multi-degree-of-freedom (DOF) motion range of human ankle joint. Tensegrity structures utilize self-stress equilibrium and are self-supporting, enabling BATE to transfer loads to the ground via soft strings and provide load bearing capability. However, modeling and analyzing the load bearing capabilities poses challenges due to the high dimensionality and non-linearity of tensegrity structures, as well as complex human-exoskeleton interaction forces. Therefore, we establish a modeling and analysis method of BATE using the principle of minimum potential energy. We introduce bearing stiffness to evaluate load bearing capability. Finally, simulation and experiments consistently validate that the BATE can withstand an external interaction force in different joint postures and has considerable load bearing capability. The results indicate that the bearing stiffness of BATE depends on material stiffness. These features provide some biological hints to adjust bearing stiffness according to human body weight. Overall, this bionic design highlights advantages over current LLEs and provides new ideas for high-performance exoskeletons.},

Reliability of time and frequency domain features was investigated through clusters separability properties and classification performances. Those features able to provide accuracy greater than 90% were selected and further investigated by a holdout scheme, i.e., decreasing the amount of data for training the learning models (60%, 50%, 40%, and 30%). Key findings of the study are as follows. Firstly, single-feature approach appeared suitable for early decoding shoulder movements, thus supporting reduced recording setup. Time domain features related to the instantaneous variations of signal amplitude produced the best results but frequency domain features showed comparable performances, suggesting no favored domain for feature extraction. Eventually, autoregressive coefficients suffered from a reduced amount of data used for training. Outcomes of this study can support the design of myoelectric control schemes, based on transient EMG data, for driving shoulder joint assistive devices.},

Postural control tests were conducted on a force platform and with an IMU during standing and crouching. Our findings indicate that exoskeleton use resulted in higher physical effort, perceived effort, and user frustration. Moreover, wearing the exoskeleton showed an augmented periodic stability, which is related to more constant strides, gait movements showed reduced smoothness, which is related to difficulties to adapt the strides in response to gait perturbations. Nevertheless, the exoskeleton exhibited better stability during stance, notably reducing medio-lateral displacement by over 30%. Finally, we found an increase in cognitive effort linked to exoskeleton use. These outcomes offer valuable insights into the comprehensive influence of exoskeletons on gait performance and user experience.},

The usage of a robotic arm to maneuver a permanent external magnet (EPM) for controlling the motion of a magnetic capsule within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract has been successfully demonstrated in pre-clinical scenarios. However, current control strategies struggle to navigate the capsule under realistic scenarios. In this work, the authors deduce a set of motion primitives for the EPM that optimize the navigation force provided to the capsule by reducing the contact force. Such motion primitives consider, for the first time, the resistance force introduced due to the contact between the endoscopic capsule and the GI tract. The results show that the proposed motion primitives enable the capsule to manage realistic scenarios, such as a 30 mm soft obstacle mimicking the compression of an organ, while a 10 mm obstacle would impede state-of-the-art strategies. In summary, the proposed control strategy improves the magnetically-driven endoscopic capsule navigation by optimizing the locomotion force and reducing by ~81% the contact force applied to the GI wall with a consequent reduction of the endoluminal stress.},

  abstract     = {Knee braces and exoskeletons can increase stability, provide support, and functionally assist ambulation. Researchers have studied knee kinematics for decades and have used that knowledge to produce knee exoskeletons with a variety of kinematic designs inspired by the anatomical knee. Traditionally lower limb and knee exoskeletons have been evaluated using optical motion capture, force plates, inertial sensors, and simulation. There have been few, if any, studies that capture both knee brace position and underlying bone position in live human subjects. We developed an approach to evaluate the relative motion between a knee brace and the underlying bony anatomy using MRI. We performed a study on four healthy subjects to test this approach using a pin joint, representative of many standard braces and commercial exoskeletons, and a prototype bio-inspired knee brace that more closely matches the kinematics of a live human knee. We report the Euclidean distance, displacement with respect to the anatomical coordinate systems, and the orientation of the brace with respect to the femur and tibia using data from three static knee positions. The average Euclidean distance of brace shift with respect to the tibia and the femur, for the pin joint and the bio joint, ranged from $17.0mm \pm 6.3mm$ to $23.8mm \pm 12.0mm$ . Our results suggest that brace movement resulting in alignment errors are likely due to soft tissue compliance, and variability of knee brace donning, rather than differences in the chosen knee brace design kinematics. MRI presents limitations including static and non-weightbearing positioning of the subject, as well as constrained body positioning resulting in reduced range of motion at the knee. Our evaluation approach can be used to supplement but not replace traditional evaluation methods to assess their knee exoskeleton designs and to study how the skin motion and initial alignment effects interact with their kinematic design.},

  abstract     = {Deducing the 3D structure of endoscopic scenes from images is exceedingly challenging. In addition to deformation and view-dependent lighting, tubular structures like the colon present problems stemming from their self-occluding and repetitive anatomical structure. In this paper, we propose SimCol, a synthetic dataset for camera pose estimation in colonoscopy, and a novel method that explicitly learns a bimodal distribution to predict the endoscope pose. Our dataset replicates real colonoscope motion and highlights the drawbacks of existing methods. We publish 18k RGB images from simulated colonoscopy with corresponding depth and camera poses and make our data generation environment in Unity publicly available. We evaluate different camera pose prediction methods and demonstrate that, when trained on our data, they generalize to real colonoscopy sequences, and our bimodal approach outperforms prior unimodal work. Our project and dataset can be found here: https://www.github.com/anitarau/simcol.},

Failures can prolong procedure time and introduce complications such as cerebrospinal fluid leaks and headaches. Therefore, an effective needle insertion guidance method is desired. In this work, we present a complete lumbar puncture guidance system with the integration of (1) a wearable mechatronic ultrasound imaging device, (2) volume-reconstruction and bone surface estimation algorithms and (3) two alternative augmented reality user interfaces for needle guidance, including a HoloLens-based and a tablet-based solution. We conducted a quantitative evaluation of the end-to-end navigation accuracy, which shows that our system can achieve an overall needle navigation accuracy of 2.83 mm and 2.76 mm for the Tablet-based and the HoloLens-based solutions, respectively. In addition, we conducted a preliminary user study to qualitatively evaluate the effectiveness and ergonomics of our system on lumbar phantoms. The results show that users were able to successfully reach the target in an average of 1.12 and 1.14 needle insertion attempts for Tablet-based and HoloLens-based systems, respectively, exhibiting the potential to reduce the failure rates of lumbar puncture procedures with the proposed lumbar-puncture guidance.},

  abstract     = {Background: Two player games have been suggested to be more motivating than single-player games when applied to neurorehabilitation. This work aimed to contrast cooperative and competitive forms of therapeutic gaming. Methods: An air hockey computer game was played by twenty dyads of subacute stroke patients who did not know each other beforehand. Using an arm-weight compensating exoskeleton robot, each dyad tested four modes: i) single-player competitive, ii) single-player cooperative, iii) two-player competitive, and iv) two-player cooperative. For each mode, the patients rated statements of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) subscales interest/enjoyment and effort/importance. Hand velocity was used to estimate the participants’ actual effort in the task. Results: Sixteen patients preferred one of the two two-player modes. On intrinsic motivation, no effect of two-player modes as opposed to single-player modes could be found. However, patients rated competitive modes more interesting ( $\text{p}=$ 0.044) in the IMI and exercised in those modes with higher effort (p &lt; 0.001) compared to cooperative modes. Conclusions: Two-player modes played by unfamiliar co-players are preferred by some of the subacute patients and were as motivating and intense as single-player modes, but no more. This result contrasts with other studies with familiar co-players where the two-player modes were found to be more motivating.},

  abstract     = {Human-robot shared control is an effective approach to enhancing the efficiency of surgical operations, as it integrates the strengths of both humans and robots. The use of conventional robot-assisted surgery, where the surgeon is solely responsible for manipulation, is limited when it comes to complex surgical procedures that require real-time manipulations such as mandibular angle split osteotomy and decompressive laminectomy. With the rising demands of manipulation, we proposed a shared control framework which automates surgical subtasks like milling-path following. These subtasks have demands on contact control, orientation control, and positional control. The robot provides hands-on hapic transparency and milling-path control with a virtual-fixture-based hybrid force/position methods simultaneously in real-time. The hybrid task’s decomposition method is derived from Frenet-Serret frames and can be adaptive to patients’ movement. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated on a 7 DOF manipulator. Results of the lateral positions/force indicated that with the osteotomy shared control framework, lateral positional errors and transparent force errors can be constrained within 0.7mm and 1.35 N (2.52 N considering noises), which is superior to the average deviation of surgeons with free hand (up to 5.0 mm) and the extra payloads to hands due to weight (around 10.0 N).},

  abstract     = {Surgical robots nowadays have an increasingly important role in surgery, and the accurate surgical instrument segmentation is one of important prerequisites for their stable operations. However, this task is against with some challenging factors, such as scaling transformation, specular reflection, etc. Recently, transformer has shown their superior segmentation performance in the field of image segmentation, which has a strong remote dependence detection capability. However, it could not well capture locality and translation invariance. In this paper, taking the advantages of transformer and CNN, a hybrid CNN-Transformer attention network, named HCTA-Net, is proposed for automatic surgical instrument segmentation. To be able to better extract more comprehensive feature information from surgical images, a dual-path encoding unit is proposed for effective feature representation of local detail feature and global contexts. Meanwhile, an attention-based feature enhancement (AFE) module is proposed for feature complementary of dual-path encoding networks. In addition, to mitigate the issue of limited processing capacity associated with simple connections, a multi-dimension attention (MDA) module is built to process the intermediate features from three directions, including width, height and space, to filter the interference features while emphasizing the key feature regions of local feature maps. Further, an additive attention enhancement (AAE) module is introduced for further feature enhancement of local feature maps. Finally, in order to obtain more multi-scale global information, a multi-scale context fusion (MCF) module is proposed at the bottleneck layer to obtain different receptive fields to enrich feature representation. Experimental results show that proposed HCTA-Net network can achieve superior segmentation performance on surgical instruments compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) segmentation models.},

However, due to their critical nonlinearities and distinct time-sequential characteristics of motion states, the modeling of inverse kinematics remains challenging. This work proposes a model-free method based on a timing input neural network (TINN) model to obtain the inverse kinematics mapping relationship of tendon-actuated medical continuum manipulators. The new TINN model improves the traditional fully connected neural network (FNN) model’s ability to process time-sequential information through a sampling layer consisting of a modified window function positioned in front of the core layers. The lightweight fully connected structure of TINN’s core layers can be trained effectively with fewer epochs or less time compared with the long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Furthermore, this lightweight structure maintains the robustness and accuracy of the TINN model when the training data volume decreases. Through experimental validation on two kinds of tendon-actuated continuum manipulators, this TINN-based model-free method shows high accuracy and strong robustness against the decrease of training data volume, as well as high transferability. Meanwhile, the TINN model’s effective utilization of feedback data results in higher precision in closed-loop control compared to traditional model-based PID controllers in free space and under various payload conditions.},

  abstract     = {The flexible ureteroscope suffers from complex inherent motion hysteresis behaviors due to the lengthy and slender configuration with a typical diameter of less than 3mm, the manual cable-driven approach via tendon-sheath mechanism for force and motion transmission and the associated nonlinear dead zone caused by tendon slackening at around the zero position. The highly constrained intraluminal environment and the lack of sensor integration have further limited the feedback acquisition for closed-loop control. Therefore, the hysteresis compensation for the ureteroscopes has become more essential but remains challenging. To address the associated hand-eye incoordination, limited control accuracy, and increased surgical risks, this work presents an analytical modeling and feedforward compensation method for the ureteroscope based on a modified generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii (MGPI) model. The designed model cascades a piecewise-linear-envelope-function-based symmetric generalized PI model (SGPI) and a two-sided dead zone model (DZ) to characterize the backlash, asymmetric hysteresis, and nonlinear dead zones. The feedforward compensator has been analytically derived and integrated into a motorized ureteroscope platform. Experimental results indicated that the proposed model has successfully captured the complex hysteresis with a modeling error of only 1.44% within a wide motion range of 440°. The tracking experiments of periodic and non-periodic signals have been performed. The results indicated that the proposed compensator has significantly suppressed the hysteresis by 60%~70% under different circumstances. Comparison simulations and experiments with other compensators have also demonstrated its advantages.},

  abstract     = {Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a globally prevalent, chronic childhood neurodevelopmental disorder that may persist into adulthood. Early medical intervention can alleviate ADHD’s impact on children. While certain advanced technologies have emerged for ADHD diagnosis using electroencephalography (EEG) signals, a crucial trade-off arises between heightened computational demands and reduced success rates due to inadequate signal analysis and temporal mapping. To overcome this challenge, we introduce two approaches: a smoothed-pseudo Wigner-Ville time-frequency (T-F) feature-based support vector machine (spWV-SVMrbf) and a novel hybrid integration of expanded-EEGNetwork with long short-term memory (expEEGNetwork-LSTM). The spWV-SVMrbf utilized diverse band-energy information, whereas the expEEGNetwork-LSTM captured temporal nuances of the EEG signal, for classifying ADHD children. We evaluated our models’ efficacy on two publicly available ADHD datasets to test their applicability and reliability. The experimental outcomes reveal an approximately 1-9% enhancement in the classification efficiency compared to existing state-of-the-art machine and deep learning frameworks. Importantly, there was no significant difference found in the performance between the two datasets. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the spWV T-F energies, as well as the expEEGNetwork’s temporal learning, can elevate the precision of EEG-based ADHD diagnostic systems. This suggests the potential usefulness of our models in real-time applications.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to tackle the issues of unavailable or insufficient clinical ultrasound (US) data and meaningful annotations to enable bone segmentation and registration for US-guided spinal surgery. Although US-based spine surgery is being more widely utilized, the development of robot-assisted surgical navigation algorithms for this approach is still impeded by the limitation of insufficient training data. Moreover, due to the characteristics of US imaging, it is difficult to clearly annotate bone surfaces, which leads to a sub-optimal inference capacity of the trained model. Hence, we propose an in silico bone US simulation framework that synthesizes realistic US images from diagnostic computed tomography (CT) volumes. Afterward, using these simulated bone US images, we train a lightweight vision transformer model that can achieve accurate and on-the-fly bone segmentation for spinal sonography. In the validation experiments, a realistic US simulation is conducted by deriving from the diagnostic spinal CT volume to facilitate a radiation-free US-guided pedicle screw placement procedure. When the proposed approach is employed for training the bone segmentation task, the Chamfer distance reaches 0.599 mm; when it is applied to CT-US registration, the associated bone segmentation accuracy yields 0.93 Dice score, and the registration accuracy achieved based on the segmented point cloud reaches 0.13~3.37 mm in a complication-free manner. While bone US images exhibit strong echoes at the medium interface, the model may be unable to distinguish between thin interfaces and bone surfaces by simply relying on small neighborhood information. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose to utilize a long-range contrast learning module (LCLM) to fully explore the long-range differences between the candidates and their surrounding pixels. Comprehensive experiment results demonstrate that the proposed CT $\rightarrow $ US simulation dramatically increases the US segmentation performance without any labeled US bone samples, and the proposed LCLM is effective at precisely determining the position of the US region of interest (RoI) on bones.},

Most patients with severe MR are over the age of 75, which makes open-heart surgery challenging. Thus, minimally invasive surgeries using transcatheter approaches are gaining popularity. This paper proposes the next generation of a robotic transcatheter delivery system for the mitral valve implant that focuses on the design of the actuation system, modeling, and task space control. The proposed actuation system is compact while still enabling bidirectional torsion, bending, and prismatic joint motion. A pulley structure is employed to actuate the torsion and bending joints using only one motor per joint in conjunction with an antagonistic passive spring to reduce tendon slack. The robotic transcatheter is also optimized to increase its stability and reduce bending deflection. An inverse kinematics model (with an optimization algorithm), singularity analysis method, and joint hysteresis and compensation model are developed and verified. Finally, a task space controller is also proposed. Experiments, including trajectory tracking and demonstrations of the robot motion in an ex vivo porcine heart and a phantom heart through a tortuous path are presented.},

The new tool allowed for needle reorientation with only one hand, unlike the standard tool that requires the use of both hands to reorient the needle during surgical intervention. The present paper extends our previous work by enhancing the design of the new tool, manufacturing 1–1 scale working prototype, mounting and controlling the tool actuators, and integrating a modified master device to remotely control the new tool. The functionality and grasping capabilities of the developed prototype was tested using the research kit of da Vinci surgical system (dVRK). Moreover, the performance of the new tool was evaluated by a group of surgeons based on the standard NASA Task Load Index (TLX). The results validate the proposed design and its manufacturability and suggest that the tool can effectively enhance the needle manipulation and improve the surgeon’s dexterity.},

  abstract     = {Interventional lung biopsy is an effective way to diagnose lung diseases. However, traditional bronchoscopy lacks maneuverability in complex bronchi. A multi-segment soft continuum robot with full-dimensional bending capability is proposed in this study. The manipulator features a 3.5 mm outer diameter and a 2.6 mm internal working channel. Mechanical assembly, hysteresis, friction, and drive rope extension nonlinear errors lead to deviations in the kinematic model of the continuum robot. The proposed hybrid kinematic model includes a multi-segment decoupling constant curvature model coupled with a particle swarm optimization-based back propagation neural network error compensation model. The dual-joystick master-slave heterogeneous operation mode is based on configuration space incremental mapping. The operation mode is used to complete position accuracy comparison experiments of the continuum robot with the compensation model. With the error compensation model, the mean Euclidean position error accuracy of the single-segment continuum manipulator motion experiment is improved by about 60%. The mean Euclidean position error accuracy of the double-segment continuum manipulator motion experiment is improved by about 70%. Pulmonary intervention target sampling experiments are performed in a bronchial model of the lung. The experimental results indicate that the proposed multi-segment soft continuum robot has full-dimensional dexterous guidance and potential utility.},

  abstract     = {Optical tracking system (OTS) plays a significant role in orthopedic surgeries to track the relative position and orientation between the surgical tool and the patient’s lesion via markers. Typically, OTS is placed in a fixed pose and remains static throughout the surgery. However, the measurement volume (MV) of OTS is limited. With the movements of the surgical tool or the patient, the markers might move beyond the MV, causing navigation failure. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a real-time optimization-based tracking method to actively adjust the observation view of the OTS and guarantee the consistency of intraoperative navigation. Specifically, the continuously tracking of markers is formulated into an optimization problem, where minimum and maximum angle optimization functions are designed to ensure surgical safety. The dynamic accuracy of the OTS is also evaluated to be reliable during the adjusting process. Ultimately, simulations and phantom experiments are performed on an active navigation system to verify the effectiveness of the proposed optimization tracking method. Experimental results show that the OTS can always track all markers when confronted with moving markers. The navigation robot successfully keeps the markers within the MV of the OTS.},

Here, a new modular endoscopic laser scanner system test-bed was designed and fabricated for conducting experiments into control strategies. This new system used a continuous wave (CW) laser system specifically designed for the task. Experiments into biological tissue ablation with this new system were compared with experiments previously conducted using a pulsed laser system. The torque required to accurately position the light beam of the flexible fiber optic cable was derived by solving Maxwell’s equations. The new test-bed again included a photo-detector sensor, which was used to position the laser beam on the tissue and provide closed-loop feedback control. With this arrangement, laser beam tracking errors were shown to be smaller than in the original pulsed laser experiments, and the tissue ablation patterns were repeatable. Trials on biological tissue (chicken meat) with this new physical test-bed proved that the tissue ablation pattern experiments were consistent, robust, and accurate. A COMSOL simulation of heat propagation then showed that consistency between the experimental and the simulation results. It also gave indicators for additional test-bed design changes that are required for optimizing the control of laser beam/biological tissue ablation.},

Several treatments are available, ranging from physical therapy to surgery. However, these treatments are usually complex, costly, and long. Robotic exoskeletons could provide longer, more frequent, and personalized training sessions with quantified data on the gait characteristics. Unfortunately, very few pediatric exoskeletons are available compared to those for adults. Therefore, design guidelines are needed for the development of pediatric exoskeletons to facilitate market entry. This article proposes design considerations through an in-depth review of the available pediatric lower-limb exoskeletons. This research has identified nine exoskeletons with at least one actuated joint at the ankle level and discussed their clinical, mechanical, and control characteristics. Although all the identified exoskeletons use electric motors to reduce their weight, improvements must be made to further minimize it. In addition, these exoskeletons need to be more easily adaptable to the user’s morphology. Impedance control methods are commonly used, which ensures the interaction safety. However, they should be more personalized to the specific neurological deficiencies. Furthermore, stronger validation of these exoskeletons is required through clinical trials.},

PDT has equivalent complication rates to surgical tracheostomy but can be performed at the ICU bedside, eliminating delays in the procedure. However, PDT complications associated with initial needle insertion into the trachea still exist and can cause severe consequences such as pneumothorax, major haemorrhage, and death. Robotic technology is a powerful adjunct to assist manual surgery, improving procedural safety and accuracy. Whilst robotic surgery of the airway has become established, there is limited research and guidance regarding robotics to assist tracheostomy insertions. This study aims to identify design requirements that map clinical needs to design details and motivate the development of a scientific design framework in robotic tracheostomy. A literature search in Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science on topics relevant to robotic tracheostomy was conducted. Clinical requirements were evaluated by distributing an online questionnaire to professional clinicians. Thirteen eligible studies were presented, from which 36 design requirements in four categories were collected. We present a design framework to inform the development of robotic tracheostomy with key requirements validated for suitability by relevant healthcare professionals.},

We designed and built a robotic ankle-foot prosthesis with off-board actuation and control to serve as a platform for biomechanical lower limb loss research. Our prosthesis fits inside of a shoe during walking and attaches to standard clinical prosthesis componentry, including carbon fiber prosthetic footplates and pyramid adapters. Our novel mechanical architecture implements a custom torsion spring in parallel with the ankle joint to allow for dorsiflexion and plantarflexion torque control with a single off-board actuator. Benchtop tests show that our prosthesis has peak plantarflexion torques greater than 175 Nm and a torque control bandwidth of 6.1 Hz. Walking experiments with two participants with lower limb loss indicate that the prosthesis can achieve low torque tracking errors and push-off power greater than the biological ankle during walking. This device will enable future experiments on amputee gait biomechanics, human-robot interaction, and prosthesis control.},

One of the key areas of research in developing these assistive devices is ensuring safe human-machine interaction, which requires both a safe mechanical system and an effective assistive control framework. Therefore, we present a novel human cooperative control framework for exoskeletons with variable stiffness actuators to assist users during both the swing and stance phases of walking and other motion sequences such as sit-to-stand. The control framework estimates the user’s joint torques during the swing and stance phases using an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and inverse kinematics, respectively. Using the Lower-Limb Exoskeleton with Serial Elastic Actuators (L2Exo-SE) as an example, the control approach was validated for its applicability to exoskeletons with compliant actuators. The validation results reveal a reduction of the average user’s joint torque during gait by 63.6%-78.4% for the hip and 40.8%-50.2% for the knee compared to non-assisted walking. Furthermore, we introduce an automatic stiffness selection for the serial elasticity of the variable stiffness actuator (VSA) based on the gait phases and the active human joint torque. The stiffness variation increases the physical human-robot interaction during the swing phase while maintaining a high control bandwidth during the stance phase.},

  abstract     = {Tremor is one of the most common movement disorders with the highest prevalence in the upper limb. Apart from medication or surgery, the mechanical suppression of the involuntary movement with an orthosis can be used as alternative treatment. Here we propose a controlled energy dissipating suppression orthosis using a mechanical brake. For this approach, we focused on improved wearability with voluntary movement preservation and ergonomics while providing tremor suppression. The novelty of this orthosis is the decentralization of the tremor suppression mechanism and the integration of textiles in the orthosis structure. We performed computational and test bench simulations of a controlled two-state brake with a 1D human model to optimize the brake duration and timing. The objective was to optimize the trade-off between tremor suppression and voluntary movement suppression. The textile-integrated prototype, with the optimized parameter, was validated in a proof-of-concept case study with a tremor-affected person performing activities of daily living. With the optimized parameters, we achieved a tremor suppression of 78.8%, 66.5%, and 40.8% for the simulation, test bench, and case study, respectively as measured by the change in power spectral density (PSD) at the tremor frequency peak. While minimizing the voluntary movement suppression in the simulation and test bench by introducing the trajectory distance as new validation method (23.7% and 31.2%), no voluntary movements suppression was measured in the case study using PSD analysis.

  abstract     = {Neuroendoscopic approach to deep-brain targets imparts deformation of the ventricles and adjacent parenchyma, limiting the accuracy of conventional neuronavigation. We report a method for 3D endoscopic reconstruction and registration via simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for real-time guidance with or without robotic assistance. The aim is to permit augmented video overlay of structures registered from preoperative or intraoperative 3D images within and beyond the endoscopic field of view for more accurate targeting in the presence of deep-brain deformation. Phantom studies were performed to evaluate geometric accuracy and uncertainty in distinct scenarios of limited data (feature sparsity and scene occlusion), demonstrating performance over a broad range of challenges to endoscopic data. Reconstruction and registration accuracy were maintained even with up to 40% loss in feature density or 120° of the visual scene occluded. Overall, the method achieved a high degree of geometric accuracy, with target registration error of 1.02 mm and runtime supporting real-time guidance (3.45 Hz, representing $\text{a}16\times $ speedup with SLAM approach compared to previous work). The studies establish essential quantitative performance characteristics and validation that are essential to future translation to clinical studies.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a novel continuum overtube that consists of a notched tendon-driven 2-DOF continuum joint and a distal deployable structure driven by a flexible screw rod. A smooth bending shape with constant curvature is achieved by adopting an overlapped area between notches to generate uniform stress distribution. The distal deployable structure provides an extensive triangulation for bimanual operations. The presented design achieves high flexibility, sufficient loading and anti-twisting capacity, and an improved layout of functional channels for flexible robotic endoscopy. Design optimization is performed to optimize structural parameters for performance investigation and improvement. The proposed continuum joint achieves an average distal positioning error of 1.48% and 1.20% within [−115°, 115°] in the two bending planes with minor hysteresis errors of less than 1.5%, indicating the outstanding constant bending curvature characteristics for kinematic modeling and control. The loading capacity achieves 4.27N and provides significant advantages in terms of sufficient rigidity over the commercial endoscope. The designed deployable structure has significantly improved operational triangulation, which can effectively support bimanual operations with two instruments for complex operations. Meanwhile, the torsional stiffness of the designed continuum joint reaches a considerable value of 8.73mNm/° and provides stable support for instruments during operations. Ex-vivo experiments of gastric tissue biopsy have been performed to verify the feasibility of the presented design in a practical scenario.},

It reports two types of constrained motion: i) Bilateral Constrained Motion, also called Remote Centre Motion (RCM), and ii) Unilaterally Constrained Motion (UCM). To deal with the constrained motion of a surgical tool when performing a path-following task inside a cavity, we investigated methods that combine the two tasks operating in a hierarchical manner. The proposed solutions were successfully evaluated, first on our simulator that mimics realistic conditions of middle ear surgery, then on an experimental platform. Different validation scenarios were carried out experimentally to assess quantitatively and qualitatively each developed approach. Although ultimate precision was not the goal of this letter, our concept is validated with enough accuracy $(\leq 100 ~\mu m)$ for the ear surgery.},

  abstract     = {Continuum manipulators have demonstrated promising potential for flexible access and complicated operation and thus have been emerging and introduced in robot-assisted flexible endoscopy. However, due to their inherent structural compliance and strong nonlinearities, developing an accurate and robust control framework remains challenging. This paper proposes a model-free control method based on the Model-Free Adaptive Control (MFAC) algorithm to accomplish the trajectory tracking for two kinds of continuum manipulators by solely utilizing the robotic system’s real-time input/output data. The presented controller discretizes and dynamically linearizes the motion process of the continuum actuator to obtain a dynamic linearization data (DLD) model. This DLD model can be derived from a pseudo-partial derivative (PPD) matrix updated based on the I/O measurement data for the iterative operation. The stability of the presented MFAC controller can be mathematically guaranteed in theory to provide generality, and the control framework demonstrates a low computational cost and real-time control capability. The superior performance of the presented controller is firstly validated in MATLAB simulations and then compared with the other two controllers. Through experimental validation on two kinds of continuum manipulators, the model-free control framework shows high tracking accuracy and good robustness against the system uncertainty and external disturbances, as well as high transferability.},

With the problems of traditional tracking systems being cost and the need to redesign surgical tools to accommodate markers, there has been a shift towards image-based, markerless tracking techniques. This study introduces a network capable of detecting and localising tools in 3D using a monocular setup. For training and validation, a novel dataset, 3dStool, was produced, and the network was trained to obtain a mean Dice coefficient of 85.0% for detection, along with a mean position and orientation error of 5.5mm and 3.3° respectively. The presented method is significantly more versatile than various state of the art solutions, as it requires no prior knowledge regarding the 3D structure of the tracked tools. The results were compared to standard pose estimation networks using the same dataset and demonstrated lower errors along most metrics.In addition, the generalisation capabilities of the proposed network were explored by performing inference on a previously unseen pair of scissors.},

An innovative robot-assisted catheterization system (RACS) based on braided sleeves was thus developed to aid interventionalists during cardiovascular procedures. The RACS allows navigating instruments through the vasculature with continuous uninterrupted motion. The complete design and characterization of the developed RACS are presented and experimentally evaluated. The RACS’ capability to track dynamic motion is demonstrated. Hereto, heart motion is estimated and fed into a dedicated motion controller. It is further demonstrated that tissue tracking performance can be improved by compensating for hysteresis present along the instrument’s length and incorporating a rate-dependent Bouc-Wen model in the motion control strategy. Here, a practical method based on multi-core FBG-inscribed fiber technology is presented for continuous instrument pose tracking. A velocity controller is cascaded with a force control loop to enable instrument tip contact force tracking. An experimental comparison between three different force control strategies was carried out on a benchtop laboratory setup resembling a dynamically moving heart wall. Results confirmed the superior performance of the cascaded force-velocity controller with Bouc-Wen hysteresis compensation. Finally, the RACS system was validated through in-vivo experiments on a living swine which demonstrated its ability to successfully navigate instruments toward the heart.},

  abstract     = {Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has evolved as an effective method for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. Recently, soft robotic catheters using soft materials have attracted considerable attention thanks to their ability to navigate through intricate anatomical structures and perform precisely controlled movements. However, current systems are powered by rigid pull-wire mechanism, showing substantial nonlinear hysteresis and high force loss. Furthermore, they require several actuators to manipulate the bending tip for working in the intricate anatomical corners of the internal organs. For thrombus removal, the approach of stent retrieval via a catheter has various drawbacks including difficult manipulation, insufficient retrieval force, and complexity. Herein, new soft robotic catheters are introduced to address these challenges. The new catheters can achieve bidirectional bending motion and spiral shapes using a single soft actuation source. They are equipped with a portable and ergonomic control interface. Mathematical models for the bending effector are developed and experimentally validated. The new soft robotic catheters potentially allow for quicker and more accurate manipulation to reach any target inside the cardiac and GI regions, enabling faster and more targeted ablation and thrombus removal therapy to enhance patient outcomes.},

In this systematic review, we summarize the research in the field of lower limb prosthetic control using EMG. Four different online databases were searched until June 2022: Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and Science Direct. We included articles that reported systems for controlling a prosthetic leg (with an ankle and/or knee actuator) by decoding gait intent using EMG signals alone or in combination with other sensors. A total of 1,331 papers were initially assessed and 121 were finally included in this systematic review. The literature showed that despite the burgeoning interest in research, controlling a leg prosthesis using EMG signals remains challenging. Specifically, regarding EMG signal quality and stability, electrode placement, prosthetic hardware, and control algorithms, all of which need to be more robust for everyday use. In the studies that were investigated, large variations were found between the control methodologies, type of research participant, recording protocols, assessments, and prosthetic hardware.},

  abstract     = {This paper reviews model-based and model-free approaches for continuous prediction of human joint motion using surface electromyography (EMG) signals. The review focuses on approaches that solve the regression problem of continuously decoding motion from EMG as opposed to classification or discrete gesture identification methods. Model-based approaches use physics-based models to capture the dynamics of the muscles; and musculoskeletal geometry to estimate muscle forces and joint torques. Model-free machine learning and deep learning architectures employ training to learn the statistical regularities in the data to make predictions. Model-free approaches work well for real-time applications with better scalability for multiple muscle inputs and lower computational costs while model-based approaches are insightful and capture the essence of underlying muscle activation and contraction dynamics. Integrating model-free techniques to complement parametric models is a good practice for improving generalization of EMG-based predictions. The strengths and limitations of the two paradigms are compared based on scalability, performance, computational efficiency, and robustness for applications in robotics and biomechanics. We expand on previous review works with recent studies to draw inferences about the knowledge gaps and opportunities for future research. We hope this review serves as a comprehensive guide for current and prospective researchers interested in joint mechanics prediction using EMG.},

  abstract     = {Working overhead for long periods of time is a difficult task that often places a high workload on the shoulder and leads to injury. Occupational exoskeletons are an emerging technology that is gaining momentum in the construction and manufacturing industries, as they can reduce workload and improve work efficiency. The purpose of this article is to provide an up-to-date overview of the various exoskeletons that have been developed to support “overhead” tasks that require prolonged or repetitive lifting of the arms. The article presents the current state of development of these technologies, focusing on the different types of actuators, mechanical structures, and sensing/control strategies. We assess their feasibility and highlight challenges that are considered barriers to large-scale adoption of industrial exoskeletons. Based on these results, we identify and analyze the design criteria and considerations in manufacturing exoskeletons for overhead work that can contribute to the further development of exoskeletons for shoulder support.},

This literature study focuses on computer-assisted platforms used to aid KA, emphasizing intraoperative tools, computer navigation, and virtual simulations. A literature search on IEEE Xplore and PubMed was done. Findings indicate that semi-automatic KA uses various technologies to assist surgeons intraoperatively. Working tools can be patient-specific but need to be more ergonomic. Surgeons benefit from robust localization and path planning techniques of computer-assisted navigation intraoperatively. Virtual KA platforms somewhat mirror the actual procedure but need to integrate more surgical actions and procedures. Augmented virtuality enables anatomic 3D planning of the procedure, giving the surgical team adequate clarity and freedom. There is grand potential for robotic KA in the future, and future research should ensure its reliability and clinical adaptability.},

  abstract     = {Surgeons cannot directly touch the patient’s tissue in robot-assisted minimally invasive procedures. Instead, they must palpate using instruments inserted into the body through trocars. This way of operating largely prevents surgeons from using haptic cues to localize visually undetectable structures such as tumors and blood vessels, motivating research on direct and indirect force sensing. We propose an indirect force-sensing method that combines monocular images of the operating field with measurements from IMUs attached externally to the instrument shafts. Our method is thus suitable for various robotic surgery systems as well as laparoscopic surgery. We collected a new dataset using a da Vinci Si robot, a force sensor, and four different phantom tissue samples. The dataset includes 230 one-minute-long recordings of repeated bimanual palpation tasks performed by four lay operators. We evaluated several network architectures and investigated the role of the network inputs. Using the DenseNet vision model and including inertial data best-predicted palpation forces (lowest average root-mean-square error and highest average coefficient of determination). Ablation studies revealed that video frames carry significantly more information than inertial signals. Finally, we demonstrated the model’s ability to generalize to unseen tissue and predict shear contact forces.},

  abstract     = {Safe manipulation of soft tissue in robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) is a challenging task for surgeons. The conventional solution is to introduce tactile sensors to measure the tool-tissue interaction force, and then transmit the signal back to the surgeon to enable manual force control. However, since the RMIS-forceps is very small, even the hand tremor of the surgeon could lead to unstable force applied to the tissue. To cope with this problem, we present a compliant constant-force mechanism (CFM) in this article to achieve stable force regulation of RMIS forceps. The proposed CFM is comprised of a pair of symmetrical compliant slider-crank mechanisms, whose mechanical behavior can be described by a pseudo-rigid-body (PRB) model. Cross-spring-based compliant joints are also introduced to improve the model accuracy, while the magnitude of the generated constant force can be adjusted by using detachable slider-crank mechanisms with different force configurations. In this work, the proposed CFM is selective-laser-sintered with polyamide (PA2200) and is actuated by a linear motor. Experiments were also conducted and successfully validated the constant-force performance of the proposed CFM. Furthermore, a grasping test of artificial artery was also performed, which demonstrated the application of the developed CFM system in RMIS.},

Due to noisy signals, deformability of instruments, and environmental disturbances, conventional shape sensing methods using direct FBG measurements are far from accurate and stable, especially for long devices. The localization errors will substantially accumulate with the increase of sensing lengths. To tackle this challenge, we propose a generic 3-D shape graph to optimize the entire shape of flexible instruments globally and account for the accumulative errors in both spatial and temporal domains. By leveraging the geometry configurations of FBG cores as the measurement model, a robust dynamic filtering approach is introduced for iterative curvature and twist estimation, which guarantees edge constraints of the graph-based shape optimization. Dedicated experiments are processed to validate our sensing approach in both structured and unstructured environments, where a robotic-assisted colonoscope system embedded with a multi-core FBG fiber is manipulated for the evaluations of bending as well as paths following in 3-D space. The results demonstrate the superiority of our framework as a promising solution for 3-D shape reconstruction of flexible instruments and continuum robots in terms of accuracy, robustness, and fast response compared to state-of-the-art works.},

  abstract     = {Pathologies affecting the respiratory system can lead to a debilitating decrease in quality of life and can be fatal. To test medical devices and implants for the human respiratory system, a simulation system that can reproduce multiple respiratory features is necessary. Currently available respiratory simulators only focus on reproducing flow rate profiles of breathing while coughing simulators focus on aerosol analysis. In this paper we propose a novel, bioinspired robotic simulator that can physically replicate both breathing and coughing flow rate characteristics of healthy adults. We conducted a study on 31 healthy adult participants to gather the flow rate measurement of normal breathing, deep breathing, breathing while running and coughing. Coughing flow rate profiles vary considerably between participants, making an accurate simulation of coughs a challenge. To enable cough flow rate simulation, a new methodology based on the identification of four cough phases, Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release (ADSR) and their parametrization was devised. This methodology leads to the unprecedented ability to reproduce diverse and complex coughing flow rate profiles. Our simulator is able to reproduce respiratory flows with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.8 L/min between normal participant breathing and its simulation, 5% of the maximum flow rate simulated for that participant (pMFR), an RMSE of 10.08 L/min for deep breathing, 18% of the pMFR and an RMSE of 13.29 L/min for exertion breathing, 17% of pMFR. For the simulation of an average cough we recorded an RMSE of 51.43 L/min, 13% of the pMFR and for a low flow rate cough an RMSE of 12.38 L/min, 9.5% of the pMFR. The presented simulator matches the fundamentals of human breathing and coughing, advancing the current capability of respiratory system simulators.},

Although several factors affect the friction in these systems, only two factors, the friction coefficient and the curvature angle of the sheaths, are taken into account in this theoretical model. Thus, understanding friction behavior still remains a significant limitation of control system performance for robotic systems that use tendon-driven mechanisms. This study aims to develop an improved friction model to more accurately determine the friction in tendon-driven systems. It considers the physical properties of the tendons and the sheaths by calculating the contact area and the adhesion force between them. The proposed friction model was verified by simulation and benchtop experiments, and compared with the Capstan formula. The results demonstrate that the error is reduced between 45% and 95% depending on the tendon angle and the sheath curvature. Thus, the proposed friction model can be used to characterize the friction between the tendons and sheaths in tendon-driven wearable devices, which could result in improved accuracy and better control of these devices.},

  abstract     = {In neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), preterm infants lie down immobile for long hours in a particular position, which makes them susceptible to develop pressure ulcers (PUs). These are developed due to continuous constant contact pressure generated by the self-weight of the infants with bed surfaces on their sensitive skin, which is 60% less than the thickness of an adult and hampers blood flow from the subcutaneous areas. Therefore, it is necessary to change the posture in a periodic manner. Hospitals manage the position changes by nursing staff, which is of limited effect and puts additional loads on them. Hence, in this paper, an anti-pressure ulcer bed was designed and tested to prevent pressure ulcers and also help in reducing the effort of nurses. The contact pressure of both the neonatal phantom and neonatal baby with the silicone-made bed surface was automatically varied by fluid pressure in the multi-channels based on the actuation mechanism (which rises alternately in inflated regions and falls in deflated regions), and it was measured using the force sensors. The demonstrated work was carried out in finite element modeling (FEM) using Abaqus to validate the results. We anticipate that it’ll reduce the risk of pressure ulcers, confirming the designed bed’s performance.},

  abstract     = {Exoscopes are a promising tool for neurosurgeons, offering improved visualisation and ergonomics compared with traditional surgical microscopes. They consist of an external scope that projects the surgical field onto a 2D or 3D monitor, providing a wider field of view and better access to the surgical site. Despite the advantages, exoscopes present some limitations, such as the need for manual or foot joystick repositioning, which can disrupt the flow of the procedure and increase the risk of user error. In this study, a markerless visual-servoing approach for autonomous exoscope control is proposed to address these limitations and enhance the ergonomics and reduce the physical and cognitive load compared with traditional joystick control. The system uses visual information from the operating field to control the exoscope, eliminating the need for markers or additional tracking devices. The proposed approach was validated using a 7-DOF robotic manipulator with a stereo camera in an eye-in-hand configuration. Results showed that the system achieved 89% accuracy in detecting the target and tracking its movement with a tracking error ranging from 0.50± 0.17 cm for low-speed movements to 1.38± 0.73 cm for high-speed movements. The proposed system also demonstrated improved efficiency, with a shorter execution time of 72.07± 19.36 s compared with 106.52± 18.50 s for the foot-joystick control. Additionally, the time out of the FoV was significantly higher in the joystick control mode and the frequency of appearance of the instrument in the centre of the image was higher when using the proposed system. The NASA TLX results indicated lower physical and cognitive load compared with the joystick control-based modality.},

For ankle joint, we developed six robot-assisted muscle strength training modes, namely, continuous passive motion (CPM), isotonic, isometric, isokinetic, centripetal and centrifugal exercise. The paper aims to evaluate the performance of different robot-assisted training modes based on angle/torque and surface electromyography (sEMG) characteristics. The sEMG characteristics were used to extract the features of the degree of muscle activation, while the angle/torque information were used to calculate the endurance ratio (ER), peak torque (PT) and torque acceleration energy (TAE). Experimental results showed that the level of the degree of muscle activation, PT and TAE in CPM were low, and ER was about 1. For isotonic exercise, isometric exercise and isokinetic exercise, most of the evaluation indexes including the degree of muscle activation, PT and TAE increased significantly compared with CPM (For isotonic exercise, ER is 1.09 ± 0.25, $r$ (LG) is 0.0538 ± 0.0171, $r$ (MG) is 0.0430 ± 0.0116, $r$ (SO) is 0.0642 ± 0.0178; For isometric exercise, PT is 0.72 ± 0.16, TAE is 2.15 ± 0.51, $r$ (TA) is 0.0532 ± 0.0256; For isokinetic exercise, PT is 0.72 ± 0.16, TAE is 1.99 ± 0.82).

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel cable-driven exoskeleton (BiEXO) for the upper limb including shoulder and elbow joints. BiEXO is made of carbon fiber that is inspired by the Bamboo structure. The key components of BiEXO are carbon fiber tubes that mimic bamboo tubes. A combined driver is developed for BiEXO with two cable-driven mechanisms (CDMs) and a power transmission belt (PTB). The CDMs are used for shoulder and elbow flexion/extension movement utilizing cables to mimic the skeletal muscle’s function, while the PTB system drives a shoulder link to mimic the scapula joint for shoulder abduction/adduction movement. Simulation studies and evaluation experiments were performed to demonstrate the efficacy of the overall system. To determine the strength-to-weight of the bamboo-inspired links and guarantee high buckling strength in the face of loads imposed from the user side to the structure, finite element analysis (FEA) was performed. The results show that the carbon fiber link inspired by bamboo has more strength in comparison to the common long carbon fiber tube. The kinematic configuration was modeled by the modified Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) notation. The mean absolute error (MAE) was 5.9 mm, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 6 mm. In addition, verification experiments by tracking the trajectory in Cartesian space and the wear trials on a subject were carried out on the BiEXO prototype. The satisfactory results indicate BiEXO to be a promising system for rehabilitation or assistance in the future.},

Most work to-date has assessed soft actuator performance with simple benchtop experiments that may not be representative of the boundary conditions on the human body. We propose a new methodology to measure torques directly in-situ on the body and then use this technique to make a detailed comparison of two versions of a soft wearable shoulder assistance robot. The impact of a number of factors are considered, such as actuator design, garment anchoring, material hysteresis, arm pose, and inflation pressure. Many of these factors are not present on the benchtop and are found to significantly affect torque production. We compare results obtained on a simple benchtop test fixture with two on-body settings: an idealized mannequin and actual human subjects. The mannequin and human results were similar, but differed significantly from the benchtop, further motivating the need for on-body testing. Moving forward, we believe that the ability to directly quantify device performance in-situ will be critical to develop new design, modeling, and control strategies for wearable robots.},

However, current personalized strategies require accurate models or large amounts of training data, which are not suitable for soft exoskeletons due to human-robot interaction uncertainties and low data acquisition efficiency. This paper presents a framework of Model-Agnostic Personalized Knowledge Adaptation (MPKA) consisting of two modules of Soft-to-Rigid Kinematics Model (SRKM) and Data-Driven Personalized Adaptation (DDPA) to generate a personalized strategy. Specifically, the first SRKM module is used to simplify and convert uncertain and time-varying HRI model to a certain and fixed model. The second DDPA module is used to accelerate model adaptation to new individuals using meta-learning with less data, based on the learned knowledge from the previous subjects. The experiments were conducted on three different sized platforms, four healthy and one post-stroke subjects, respectively. The results demonstrate that the MPKA can generate personalized models for new individuals more rapidly with less data than a pre-trained neural network, and the personalized models can obtain better control accuracy by over 62% than mechanism-based mathematical model. The proposed method has the potential to provide personalized rehabilitation strategies, which can improve effectiveness of rehabilitation.},

Previous work has used machine learning predictors as a means of continuously estimating locomotor intent. Although previous studies perform gait phase classification and joint-level angular prediction, there are currently no studies that compare joint-level prediction performance at various phases of gait. As such, the purpose of this offline study was to analyze how machine learning and deep learning models perform at predicting future joint angles during various phases of gait. EMG, IMU, and joint kinematics collected during level-ground walking from thirty participants and data was separated into six distinct gait phases. Random forest, long short-term memory (LSTM), and bidirectional LSTM was used to predict lower-limb joint angles during the phases of gait. Results indicate that bidirectional LSTM is the most robust performer across the gait cycle, with a mean prediction RMSE of 1.42-5.71 degrees. Our study shows how deep learning methods, such as bidirectional LSTM, can accurately estimate joint angles throughout the gait cycle. Furthermore, we propose future work of deploying models which accurately predict future joint angles throughout the gait cycle for users to sufficiently operate a wearable exoskeleton during locomotion.},

  abstract     = {The ability to accurately and automatically segment surgical instruments is one of the important prerequisites for reasonable and stable operation of surgical robots. The utilization of deep learning in medical image segmentation has gained widespread recognition in recent years, leading to the proposition of multiple network models designed for the segmentation of diverse medical images, among which the most effective one is U-Net and its variants. Nevertheless, these existing networks also have various drawbacks, such as limited contextual representation capability, insufficient local feature processing, etc. In order to solve the above problems so that more accurate surgical instrument segmentation performance can be obtained, a transformer-based multi-scale attention network is proposed, referred to as TMA-Net, for surgical instrument segmentation from endoscopic images to serve robot-assisted surgery. To enable more accurate extraction of image features, a dual-branch encoder structure is proposed to obtain stronger contexts. Further, to address the problem that the simple skip connection is insufficient for local feature processing, an attention feature fusion (AFF) module and an additive attention and concatenation (AAC) module are proposed for effective feature learning to filter out the irrelevant information in the low-level features. Furthermore, a multi-scale context fusion (MCF) block is introduced to enhance the local feature maps and capture multi-scale contextual information. The efficacy of proposed TMA-Net is demonstrated through experimentation on publicly available surgical instrument segmentation datasets, including Endovis2017 and UW-Sinus-Surgery-C/L. The results show that proposed TMA-Net outperforms existing methods in terms of surgical instrument segmentation accuracy.},

Problems, such as large number of parameters, low training efficiency, and poor interpretability, are encountered in mainstream models because of the high complexity of fMRI and brain networks. To solve these problems, a novel structure feature combined graph neural network (SFC-GNN) with a low number of parameters is proposed. In particular, SFC-GNN is composed of 1) the graph convolution layer of the brain region perception and 2) the node pooling layer of the graph structure feature (GSF). It also receives the sparse brain graph modeled by each subject’s fMRI as input. Especially, the GSF layer can select brain regions that are important for classification, thereby localizing all active regions related to brain disease. Moreover, a group network is constructed according to the correlation among subjects, and SFC-GNN can be extended further to a node classification model to achieve better diagnosis performance. The proposed method has been validated on the ABIDE and ADNI datasets, thereby showing the effectiveness of our proposed method in various experiments.},

Our approach leverages labeled data from common surgical training tasks such as Suturing, Needle Passing, and Knot Tying to jointly train a model with both labeled and unlabeled data. Pseudo labels are generated for the unlabeled data through an iterative manner that incorporates uncertainty estimation to ensure accurate labeling. We evaluate our method on a virtual reality simulated training task (Ring Transfer) using data from the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). The results show that trainees with robotic assistance have significantly higher expert probability compared to these without any assistance, $p &amp;lt; 0.05$ , which aligns with previous studies showing the benefits of robotic assistance in improving training proficiency.

This work presents a multimodal robotic assistance approach for solo LSC. Multimodality provides a set of instrument interaction modes that allows the surgeon to operate in close vicinity with the patient. It increases situational awareness and avoids miscommunication while ensuring safe vaginal vault exposure. The robotic setup is experimentally validated by ten gynecologists who performed a vaginal mesh fixation task on a box trainer. When compared to manual surgery, it was found that robotic assistance allows the solo surgeon to operate as fast (24.07 ± 1.63 min vs. 23.75 ± 1.54 min, $p = 0.49$ ) and with lower peak forces (12.23 ± 3.03 N vs. 9.26 ± 1.41 N, $p = 0.02$ ) applied to the vaginal vault. The results are promising as they show that the multimodal approach allows for robot-assisted solo surgery. This way, it frees clinicians from non-ergonomic tasks while maintaining similar surgery times and quality. Moreover, it reduces the risk of overtensioning of the vaginal tissue.},

  abstract     = {This work proposes a novel flexible manipulator consisting of a series of 2-DOF vertebrae based on a ball-and-socket joint that is connected by a ball-shaped surface and a cup-shaped socket and constrained by pins for circumferential rotation. This manipulator can demonstrate outstanding torsional stiffness since the circumferential rotation between the vertebrae is constrained by four ball pins. The point contact between ball pins and guideways effectively reduces the friction between the vertebrae, thus allowing the designed manipulator to yield a smooth bending shape with constant curvature. This manipulator features high axial and torsional stiffness, excellent bending performance, sufficient loading capacity, and convenient integration with surgical instruments. Moreover, the excellent torsional stiffness enables this manipulator to efficiently transfer torque and be applied in in-situ torsional motion, effectively addressing the typical issue of limited dexterity for torsional motion. The kinematic modeling of the proposed manipulator under in-situ torsional motion has been derived, and its workspace has been analyzed. A robotic system has been assembled, and experiments have verified the proposed design and modeling validity. The results show that the maximum position errors in bending motion are 2.39% (horizontal direction) and 1.98% (vertical direction), and its torsional stiffness is 21.13N $\cdot $ mm/deg, which is 46 times higher than that of a typical spherical flexible manipulator (SFM). Such merits support this manipulator excellently performing the in-situ torsional motion with a maximum average position error of 3.58%. Furthermore, a phantom test of the larynx has been performed to verify the potential of clinical feasibility.},

  abstract     = {In Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS), wire-driven hyper-redundant manipulators are widely used because of their flexibility, dexterity, and miniaturization. However, due to their limited structural stiffness, wire-elongation and unwanted distortion in the shape may occur during payload handling. For example, the surgical payload at the end-effector can distort an endoscope and cause positional deviation of the end-effector. In this paper, an endoscopic manipulator with robust Engaging Rolling Joints (ERJs) is proposed, where each ERJ is deployed with a pair of Auxiliary Super-elastic Ribbons (ASRs). Based on the design, we also developed a prediction model for shape-distortion, which is able to numerically predict the shape of the manipulator under payload applied to the end-effector. Experiments were conducted to verify that the ERJ and the ASR can better reject unwanted disturbances in shape prediction. The test results showed that the predicted distorted shape is in good agreement with the actual shape; the average prediction errors for the distal angle and position deflections were measured at 8.63% and 7.71%, respectively. We believe that the presented technique will help to improve the performance of the rolling joint manipulator by compensating the predicted shape-distortion.},

Then, the OPS is coupled to the 3D A* algorithm to obtain the 3D-OPS A* algorithm, which initially lowers the muscle resistance. In addition, a musculoskeletal model of a fractured pelvis is constructed based on the OpenSim platform, and the model’s validity is verified using data comparison and in vitro experiments. Finally, the OpenSim API is combined with the 3D-OPS A* algorithm to obtain 3D-OPSF A*, which is used to search for the reduction path with the least muscle resistance. Results show that the OPS-based path planning algorithm lowers muscle resistance by 49.4% on average compared to traditional and 3D A* planning. Compared to 3D-OPS A*, 3D-OPSF A* achieves 12.8% lower muscle resistance. The path planned by the 3D-OPSF A* algorithm significantly lowers muscle resistance, optimizes the robot payload intensity, and enhances the safety of the surgery. This study will be of great reference value for future research on intelligent path planning for pelvic fracture closed reduction surgical robots.},

  abstract     = {Children with cerebral palsy suffer from balance deficits that may greatly reduce their quality of life. However, recent advancements in robotics allow for balance rehabilitation paradigms that provide greater control of the training environment and more robust measurement techniques. Previous works have shown functional balance improvement using standing surface perturbations and compliant surface balancing. Visual feedback during balance training has also been shown to improve postural balance control. However, the combined effect of these interventions has not been evaluated. This paper presents a robot-aided rehabilitation study for children with cerebral palsy on a side-specific performance-adaptive compliant surface with perturbations. Visual feedback of the participant’s center of pressure and weight distribution were used to evaluate successful balance and trigger perturbations after a period of successful balancing. The platform compliance increased relative to the amount of successful balance during each training interval. Two participants trained for 6 weeks including 10, less than 2 hours long, training sessions. Improvements in functional balance as assessed by the Pediatric Balance Scale, Timed 10 Meter Walk Test, and 5 Times Sit-to-Stand Test were observed for both participants. There was a reduction in fall risk as evidenced by increased Virtual Time to Contact and an increase in dynamic postural balance supported by a faster Time to Perturb, Time to Stabilize, and Percent Stabilized. A mixed improvement in static postural balance was also observed. This paper highlights the feasibility of robot-aided rehabilitation interventions as a method of balance therapy for children with cerebral palsy.},

  abstract     = {Atherosclerosis is a medical condition that causes buildup of plaque in the blood vessels and narrowing of the arteries. Surgeons often treat this condition through angioplasty with catheter placements. Continuum guidewire robots offer significant advantages for catheter placements due to their dexterity. Tracking these guidewire robots and their surrounding workspace under fluoroscopy in real-time can be useful for visualization and accurate control. This paper discusses algorithms and methods to track the shape and orientation of the guidewire and the surrounding workspaces of phantom vasculatures in real-time under C-arm fluoroscopy. The shape of continuum guidewires is found through a semantic segmentation architecture based on MobileNetv2 with a Tversky loss function to deal with class imbalances. This shape is refined through medial axis filtering and parametric curve fitting to quantitatively describe the guidewire’s pose. Using a constant curvature assumption for the guidewire’s bending segments, the parameters that describe the joint variables are estimated in real-time for a tendon-actuated COaxially Aligned STeerable (COAST) guidewire robot and tracked through its traversal of an aortic bifurcation phantom. The accuracy of the tracking is ˜90% and the execution times are within 100 ms, and hence this method is deemed suitable for real-time tracking.},

  abstract     = {The tendon-sheath mechanism (TSM) has been widely applied in flexible endoscopy (FE) and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) owing to its advantages of remote force and displacement transmission, size reduction, compactness, and convenient implementation. However, the positioning accuracy of TSMs is highly restrained by the motion hysteresis due to the complex friction condition between the tendon and sheath. The hysteresis phenomenon has posed significant challenges for modeling and controlling TSMs. This paper proposes a modified Bouc-Wen-based mathematical model to characterize the asymmetric hysteresis loop with distinct inflection points. The model parameters are decoupled, facilitating identification and reducing computational costs. Moreover, the model has retained the Bouc-Wen model structure, allowing for efficient derivation of the feedforward compensator based on the inverse multiplicative structure. The compensator was derived and cascaded with the TSM system to suppress the hysteresis phenomenon. Totally 120 trials of experiments were conducted to validate the proposed model and the feedforward control scheme on the two TSMs with different accumulated curvatures of 180° and 360°. The results indicated that the proposed method achieved a 25.5% and 43.9% lower estimation and compensation error than the classical Bouc-Wen model. Further, it is worth noting that the model parameter identification time consumption has been significantly reduced to 5.8ms. The proposed model and the feedforward compensator can effectively linearize the TSM system and further facilitate delicate operations in robot-assisted surgical procedures.},

  abstract     = {Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an effective minimally-invasive treatment used for a variety of solid tumor cancers, including lung, breast, kidney, pancreatic, and liver. However, effective RFA for abdominal tumors relies on accurate ablation needle targeting, which can be a challenging task due to respiratory motion. This paper presents the design, fabrication, modeling, and benchtop characterization of a CT-guided parallel robot, and a novel respiration motion compensation protocol (RMCP) for effective robot-assisted abdominal RFA needle placement. The robot consists of a Stewart platform with a friction drive roller insertion module for autonomous needle deployment. Strain energy models are used to predict needle insertion force, the primary technical contribution of this work, providing a mean error of 0.490.28 N. The free-space accuracy characterization experiments indicate that the robotic platform is able to provide a needle tip position and orientation accuracy of 2.000.75 mm and 0.810.48°, respectively. A dynamic targeting experiment using an ex-vivo liver indicates an improvement in position and orientation error of 57% and 30%, respectively, when using the proposed RMCP. Finally, an animal study using a sexually-mature swine undergoing assisted respiration at nine breaths per minute indicates a 77% reduction in additional insertion displacement when using the RMCP.},

As one typical example, the pre-operative space where the patient-specific surgical plan is usually made needs to be accurately aligned with the patient space where the surgical procedures are conducted. The registration task still attracts a lot of research efforts, partially because establishing the point correspondences between two point sets (PSs) under noise, outliers and partial overlapping is a non-trivial problem. More specifically, in CAOS, (a) the intra-operative points only cover a small partial region of the pre-operative whole model; (b) the acquired intra-operative points are usually noisy and contains outliers.

The device embodies a spring-pulley anti-gravity system to minimize torque requirements and has torque sensors on each joint for safe and smooth interaction with the user. The AGREE control system, which employs a loadcell-based impedance control method, offers various modes of human-robot interaction, such as passive-assisted, active-assisted, and active-resistive exercises. Results from our experimental characterization demonstrate that the exoskeleton is capable of both compliant and rigid behavior, providing a wide range of haptic impedance and transparent behavior to both user-generated and therapist-generated forces.

These latter are specific to the type of movement and can be classified by pattern recognition algorithms. However, phantom mobility generates fatigue that could impact classification metrics. This study explored whether daily phantom movement training at home with no other feedback than inherent somatosensory information can impact the classification success rate. Kinematics and muscle activity were compared between before and after a two-month home training in six major upper limb amputees. Surface EMG patterns were classified to quantify a potential change in the features space with training. Our results showed that this type of training induces faster, smoother, and richer phantom mobility. However, classification metrics did not change with training. When including the new types of movements achievable after training, accuracy did not decrease, indicating that muscle activation patterns associated with these movements were sufficiently different not to interfere with the already existing movement classes. Thus, although phantom training with only somatosensory feedback increases the overall phantom movement capacity, it does not increase the classification success rate. Yet, it is possible that paired with other forms of feedback, phantom training could improve this success rate.},

  abstract     = {With the advancement in computing and robotics, it is necessary to develop fluent and intuitive methods for interacting with digital systems, augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) interfaces, and physical robotic systems. Hand motion recognition is widely used to enable these interactions. Hand configuration classification and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint angle detection is important for a comprehensive reconstruction of hand motion. Surface electromyography (sEMG) and other technologies have been used for the detection of hand motions. Forearm ultrasound images provide a musculoskeletal visualization that can be used to understand hand motion. Recent work has shown that these ultrasound images can be classified using machine learning to estimate discrete hand configurations. Estimating both hand configuration and MCP joint angles based on forearm ultrasound has not been addressed in the literature. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning pipeline for predicting the MCP joint angles. The results for the hand configuration classification were compared by using different machine learning algorithms. Support vector classifier with different kernels, multi-layer perceptron, and the proposed CNN have been used to classify the ultrasound images into 11 hand configurations based on activities of daily living. Forearm ultrasound images were acquired from 6 subjects instructed to move their hands according to predefined hand configurations. Motion capture data was acquired to get the finger angles corresponding to the hand movements at different speeds (0.5 Hz, 1 Hz, &amp; 2 Hz) for the index, middle, ring, and pinky fingers. Average classification accuracy of 82.7 ± 9.7% for the proposed CNN and over 80% for SVC for different kernels was observed on a subset of the dataset. An average RMSE of $7.35^{\circ }\pm 1.3$ ° was obtained between the predicted and the true MCP joint angles. A low latency (6.25 - 9.1 Hz) pipeline has been proposed for estimating both MCP joint angles and hand configuration aimed at real-time control of human-machine interfaces.},

  abstract     = {Mechanical stimulation-conditioned transcranial magnetic stimulation (Mstim-cTMS) is a neuromodulation technique that transiently enhances neural excitability through paired peripheral and cortical stimulation. Importantly, the temporal inter-stimulus interval (ISI) must fall within an individual’s specific ISI window (ISI-W) to induce neuromodulatory effects. Currently, ISI-W identification is inefficient, incrementally applying Mstim-cTMS within a wide search range. This paper aims to test a real-time, closed-loop framework that decreases the number of trials required to obtain individualized ISI-Ws by implementing a previously developed statistical regression algorithm. Each Mstim-cTMS trial consisted of peripheral mechanical stimulation using a precise, tapping robot paired with transcranial magnetic stimulation to the motor cortex. Neuromodulation was characterized by measuring resulting motor evoked potentials (MEPs). The closed-loop process estimated the effective ISI-W by iterating Mstim-cTMS at statistically determined ISIs based on the detected MEPs. The estimated ISI-Ws of two subjects had an average correlation coefficient of 0.84 with their reference windows obtained using the conventional search method. The estimation reduced the number of required Mstim-cTMS trials by an average of 93.8%. The results indicate the proposed method’s potential for decreasing Mstim-cTMS startup durations. Future rehabilitation and neurophysiological studies can benefit from efficiently updating ISI-Ws to account for long-term neural variability.},

How to maximize the user’s metabolic benefit and reduction of muscle fatigue are the primary objectives of assistance patterns optimization. For the exosuit controller, accurate gait phase estimation and appropriate assistance force profile are crucial factors. To gain an accurate real-time gait phase estimation, a neural network algorithm based on multi-modal information fusion was developed. The eigenvector of which was composed of Euler angles and gyroscope data of four Inertial Measurement units fixed on thigh and calf, and gait period estimated by force sensing resistor installed on foot insoles. The mean squared error of the model is below 3 ms and the regression coefficient R exceeds 0.999 when walking at a speed of 1.5 m/s. For the assistance force profile, which was designed based on the characteristics of soleus muscle dynamics. Wherein the biomechanics of walking were derived from simulation with OpenSim software. Compared with wearing an exosuit without assistance and with assistance, the metabolic demand was reduced by an average of 7.5%, and the average peak value and RMS of calf muscles involved in palntarflexion were decreased to different degrees. Our research illustrates the feasibility of neural network-based real-time gait phase estimation and assistance strategy design obtained by simulating muscle dynamics in the OpenSim software.},

  abstract     = {Background: Quantitative movement analysis is significant in clinic decision-making for neurological diseases. However, current methods fail to be widely used due to expensive equipment and professional workers. Methods: To make movement analysis more accessible even in remote areas, this paper provides a quantitative movement analysis framework based monocular camera analyzing gait parameters automatically. A size-aligned method is formulated to recover scaled information uncertain in a single view under scaled restrictions from body size and geometric constraints among subject joints’ positions. The image key points are the subject joints’ positions in images and the scaling key points are processed by the size-aligned method. The attention mechanism fuses deep representations learned from image key points and scaling key points respectively. The fused representations are decoded to provide final analyses. Results: The suggested learning framework can analyze parameters with strong correlations to the ground truth according to experimental results on a dataset for cerebral palsy: cadence $(r=0.81)$ , speed $(r=0.78)$ , step length $(r=0.78)$ , knee flexion at maximum extension $(r=0.85)$ , gait deviation indexes $(r=0.75)$ , and asymmetric in gait deviation indexes $(r=0.55)$ . Conclusion: The encouraging findings show that it is feasible to quantitatively assess patients’ lower limb movement ability using a monocular camera.},

  abstract     = {We investigated the use of repetitive control (RC) to enhance force control during human-robot interaction in quasi-periodic tasks. We first developed a two-mass spring damper model and formulated three different RCs under force control: a nth 1 order RC (RC-1), a nth 3 order RC designed for random period error (RC-RPE), and a nth 3 order RC designed for constant period error (RC-RPE). Then, we quantified the performance of these three RCs through simulations and experiments conducted on a bench top linear platform, subject to nominal cyclical inputs (input signal and RC frequency: 0.5 Hz), and subject to inputs with random and constant period errors. During evaluation, we compared the performance achieved with the RCs with the one achievable with a passive proportional controller (PPC), subject to known theoretical limits for passivity and coupled stability. In nominal simulation conditions, the RC-1 reduced force error most effectively to 0.7% of the error measured with PPC. In real-world nominal experiments the RC-RPE most effectively reduced force error to 17% of the error achieved with the PPC. Subject to inputs with constant period errors, the three RCs performed similarly and better than PPC for period error values below 0.02 Hz, with the RC-CPE performing the best above 0.02 Hz period error. Subject to inputs with random period errors, all RCs performed better than PPC up to 0.09 Hz of period error, with RC-1 significantly outperforming the two other RCs. Our results indicate that RC can be successfully integrated into force control schemes to improve performance beyond the one achievable with a PPC, in the range of period variability expected in applications such as assistance or rehabilitation of cyclical human movements.},

  abstract     = {In remote, rural, and disadvantaged areas, telesurgery can be severely hindered by limitations of communication infrastructure. In conventional telesurgery, delays as small as 300ms can produce fatal surgical errors. To mitigate the effect of communication delays during telesurgery, we introduce a semi-autonomous system that decouples the user interaction from the robot execution. This system uses a physics-based simulator where a surgeon can demonstrate individual surgical subtasks, with immediate graphical feedback. Each subtask is performed asynchronously, unaffected by communication latency, jitter, and packet loss. A surgical step recognition module extracts the intended actions from the observed surgeon-simulation interaction. The remote robot can perform each one of these actions autonomously. The action recognition system leveraged a transfer learning approach that minimized the data needed during training, and most of the learning is obtained from simulated data. We tested this system in two tasks: fluid-submerged peg transfer (resembling bleeding events) and surgical debridement. The system showed robustness to delays of up to 5 seconds, maintaining a performance rate of 87% for peg transfer and 88% for debridement. Also, the framework reduced the completion time under delays by 45% and 11% during peg transfer and debridement, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Steerable needles are desired for many applications within the medical field. One such application is high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy. In this paper, an adaptive control system is proposed to provide control of the planar bending angle or deflection distance of a tendon-driven continuum joint, which can be inserted as the stylet in a commercial hollow needle for HDR brachytherapy. Proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controllers are a common method of control. However, significant tuning may be required to achieve the desired dynamic response, and the tuned gains may not achieve the desired response in a different environment or if the system model varies. Steerable needles must navigate through tissues of differing viscoelastic properties and the use of nitinol for the joint and tendons of a steerable needle leads to change in the system parameters due to change in the phase of the nitinol material. In this article, we propose the real-time adaptation of PID gains using model reference adaptive control techniques to control the planar bending angle or deflection distance of a steerable stylet and needle system.},

  abstract     = {Dense depth estimation plays a crucial role in developing context-aware computer-assisted intervention systems. However, it is a challenging task due to low image quality and highly dynamic surgical environment. The task is further complicated by the difficulty in acquiring per-pixel ground truth depth data in a surgical setting. Recent works on self-supervised depth estimation use image reconstruction (i.e., the warped images) as supervisory signal, which helps to eliminate the requirement of ground truth depth annotations but also causes over-smoothed depth predictions. Additionally, most existing depth estimation methods are built upon static laparoscopic images, ignoring rich temporal information. To address these challenges, we propose a novel spatiotemporal vision transformers-based self-supervised depth estimation method, referred as SVT-SDE. Unlike previous works, SVT-SDE features a novel spatiotemporal vision transformers (SVT) architecture, which can learn complementary visual and temporal information from the input stereoscopic video clips. We further introduce high-frequency-based supervisory signal, which helps to preserve fine-grained details of depth estimation. Results from experiments conducted on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SVT-SDE over the state-of-the-art self-supervised depth estimation methods.},

Surgical robots performed well in conjunction with machine learning, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), allowing them to be used in complex environments, such as cutting a pre-determined pattern on soft tissue with surgical scissors and gripper. There is no doubt that soft tissue is deformable, so using a tensioning policy can determine appropriate tension direction from the pinch point at any time to have an accurate cut in the pre-determined trajectory. In this study, we used the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to find an optimal tensioning policy for cutting soft tissues. In addition, we used an evolutionary algorithm with the operators appropriate to the problem and the learned tensioning policy to find the sequence of tensioning actions. The objective of this study is to determine the optimal tensioning policy and the best tensioning action sequence. The experimental results show that using the learned policy results in smaller damage and error and lead to the highest scores compared to the previous studies.},

The minimally-invasive procedure is performed by registering the robot and preoperative images to the surgical scene using multi-view image-based 2D/3D registration with no external fiducial attached to the body. The performance of the system is evaluated through experimental sawbone studies as well as cadaveric experiments with intact soft tissues. In the cadaver experiments, distance errors of 3.28 mm and 2.64 mm for entry and target points and orientation error of 2.30° are calculated. Moreover, the mean surface distance error of 2.13 mm with translational error of 4.47 mm is reported between injected and planned cement profiles. The experimental results demonstrate the first application of the proposed Robot-Assisted combined Drilling and Injection System (RADIS), incorporating biomechanical planning and intraoperative fiducial-less 2D/3D registration on human cadavers with intact soft tissues.},
