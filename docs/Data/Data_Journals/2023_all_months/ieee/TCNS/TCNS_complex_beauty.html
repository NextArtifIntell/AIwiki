  abstract     = {This article studies the human-in-the-loop (HiTL) time-varying formation-containment tracking control (TVFCT) problem of general linear multiagent systems (MASs). The MASs consist of a nonautonomous tracking leader, multiple formation leaders and followers, and all agents are subject to unknown disturbances. A human operator is deployed to supervise and regulate the entire team by sending a command signal to the tracking leader. The control input of the tracking leader should be combined with the human operator but not available to other agents. First, a local observer associated with each agent is constructed to provide asymptotic state estimation, in which the observer error system is disturbance-free. Also, interval observers are established for the neighborhood TVFCT errors, where the disturbance of the current agent is aggregated with the disturbances and input signals of its neighbors into an unknown input. Meanwhile, a distributed asymptotic unknown input reconstruction (UIR) mechanism is proposed that decouples the control input of the current agent. The consequent control protocol is designed by combining the local observer and distributed UIR scheme. Finally, the theoretical results are verified in multirobot formation-containment control.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the problem of consensus-based distributed optimization, where a network of agents, abstracted as a directed graph, aims to minimize the sum of all agents&#39; cost functions collaboratively. In the existing distributed optimization approaches (Push-Pull/AB) for directed graphs, all the agents exchange their states with neighbors to achieve the optimal solution with a constant step size, which may lead to the disclosure of sensitive and private information. For privacy preservation, we propose a novel state-decomposition-based gradient tracking approach (SD-Push-Pull) for distributed optimization over directed networks that preserves differential privacy, which is a strong notion that protects agents&#39; privacy against an adversary with arbitrary auxiliary information. The main idea of the proposed approach is to decompose the gradient state of each agent into two substates. Only one substate is exchanged by the agent with its neighbors over time, and the other one is not shared. That is to say, only one substate is visible to an adversary, protecting the sensitive information from being leaked. It is proved that under certain decomposition principles, a bound for the suboptimality of the proposed algorithm can be derived, and the differential privacy is achieved simultaneously. Moreover, the tradeoff between differential privacy and the optimization accuracy is also characterized. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The objective of this article is to study and characterize the role and the importance of information in achieving a feedback (Nash) equilibrium strategy in linear quadratic (LQ) differential games whenever the underlying players are distributed over a (physical or logic) network. It is assumed that each player should achieve a desired goal, quantified by an individual cost functional, in a competitive dynamic environment—captured by an interconnection network —by relying only on the information and data exchanged with other players according to a prescribed information network: The objective of this article is to establish the value of such an information exchange pattern toward achieving a more favorable (social) equilibrium. Interestingly, it is not assumed that the interconnection network and the information network coincide. Moreover, since the ability to achieve a certain Nash equilibrium strategy may be lost even by removing a single communication link in the network—thus partially limiting the use of the metrics discussed above—in the second part of this article, we also consider the value of the information in forming approximate Nash equilibrium strategies, namely, the so-called &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\varepsilon$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -Nash equilibria.

We consider finite horizon MFGs with a large population of homogeneous players, sequentially making strategic decisions. Each player observes a private state and a mean-field population state representing the empirical distribution of other players&#39; states. The mean-field state is common information among all the players in the game. Vasal (2020) provided a sequential decomposition algorithm to compute mean field equilibrium for such games in linear time than exponential as in prior literature. We extended the idea of sequential decomposition to propose a model-free RL algorithm for these games using expected Sarsa (Mishra et al., 2020). In this article, we provide detailed convergence proofs for our algorithm. In addition, we propose an inverse reinforcement learning algorithm for MFGs with unknown reward functions. The proposed algorithm learns the reward function by studying an expert&#39;s behavior, and then computes the optimal policy. We illustrate our results using a cyber-physical security example.},

A novel weight learning algorithm (WLA) is introduced such that neither the network connectivity nor a sequence of history records is required to achieve resilient consensus. The critical idea is to dynamically update the interaction weights among neighbors learnt from their credibility measurement. Basically, we define a reward function that is inversely proportional to the state difference to its neighbor, and then adjust the credibility based on the reward derived at the present step and the previous credibility. In such a way, the interaction weights are updated at every step, which integrates the historic information and degrades the influences from faulty nodes. Four classes of faulty nodes are considered, and both fixed and stochastic topologies are involved in this article. Furthermore, we apply this novel approach in a clock synchronization problem. By updating the logical clock skew and offset via the corresponding weight learning algorithms (WLA), the logical clock synchronization is eventually achieved regardless of faulty nodes.

To clarify a counterintuitive issue in existing work, a different innovation-based linear attack policy fusing all available information is proposed. First, the evolution of a posteriori estimation error covariance with FDI attacks is derived. Then, explicit solutions of optimal stealthy attack coefficients are obtained without solving optimization problems numerically. The condition under which there exist multiple optimal attacks is analyzed. In addition, an easy-to-check criterion for comparing two information fusion methods in scalar systems is given.

The proposed strategy relies on a model predictive control to switch between problem formulations corresponding to normal operating conditions and burst conditions. The optimal control problems are formulated as nonconvex nonlinear programs, where the action of fixed-speed pumps and control valves (nonreturn and bidirectional) is modeled exactly and burst remedial interventions are represented using time-dependent connectivity matrices. We propose an efficient solution method based on reformulations and approximations of the nonconvex objectives and constraints and apply the proposed strategy to the adaptive control of an operational WDN during a burst incident. The numerical experiments show that the computed burst control settings allow to partially or completely restore customer supply following the detection of a burst while maintaining minimum water levels in the network tanks and without increasing the cost of pumping operations. The results suggest that the proposed adaptive control strategy can be implemented alone, to mitigate the impact of bursts incidents in WDNs at minimum cost, or to complement traditional remedial interventions.},

The moving formation is guided by the motions of two or more agents, which are referred to as leaders , and the other follower agents track the leaders by maintaining bearing constraints to neighbors. The proposed control schemes are designed based on a backstepping technique and sliding mode control. The latter is employed to attenuate known bounded disturbances present in the vessels&#39; dynamics.

These communication problems lead to degradation in system performance, which may even cause instability. By utilizing an idle-time-based scheduling policy with a predefined deadline constraint on the actuator side, we transform the affiliated integrated system into a stochastic model with constant input delay. For such an implementation, we propose a set of Riccati-type stabilization conditions, which are necessary and sufficient. It is remarkable that the stabilizing control policy is designed based on the feedback of the optimal estimate with minimum mean square error. Moreover, for the scalar system, we study the uniqueness and existence property of the maximum sampling period, and derive its close form representation in terms of system parameters, service capability, and packet dropout rate.},

The control design is defined as a linear quadratic regulator graphical problem, where the performance function couples the subsystems&#39; dynamics. We first present a model-free discrete-time RL algorithm based on online behaviors without using system dynamics. This could become a prohibitively long learning process for larger networks. To remedy this issue, we develop an efficient model-free RL algorithm based on dynamic mode decomposition. This decomposition method reduces the size of the measured data while the dynamic information of the original network is still retained. This algorithm is then implemented online. The proposed methodology is validated using examples of a consensus network and a power system network.},

Blind and passive methods to identify such influence pathways/couplings from data are central to many applications. However, dynamically related data streams originating at different sources are prone to corruption caused by asynchronous time stamps of different streams, packet drops, and noise. Such imperfect information may be present in the entire observation period and, hence, is not detected by change detection algorithms that require an initial clean observation period. In this article, we provide a novel approach to detect the location of corrupt agents as well as present an algorithm to learn the structure of radial dynamical systems despite corrupted data streams. In particular, we show that our approach provably learns the true radial structure if the unknown corrupted nodes are at least three hops away from each other. Our theoretical results are further validated in a test dynamical network.},

This problem is particularly relevant to detecting forced oscillations in electric power networks. We express measurements as an additive model comprising the initial state and inputs grouped over time, both expanded in terms of the basis functions (i.e., impulse response coefficients). Using this model, with probabilistic guarantees, we recover the locations and simultaneously estimate the initial state and forcing inputs using a variant of the group linear absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. Specifically, we provide upper bounds on 1) the probability that the group LASSO estimator incorrectly identifies the locations and 2) the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\ell _{2}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -norm of the estimation error. Our bounds depend on the number of measurements, inputs, and sensors; the sensor noise variance; and the minimum singular value of the observability and impulse response matrices.

Finally, we validate the performance of the estimator on synthetic models and the IEEE 68-bus, 16-machine power system.},

By exploiting the lifting technique, the sampling periods for both sensors and the state of the system are uniform. It is assumed that the phenomenon of fading measurements, which better describes practical engineering, arises stochastically, and the attenuation coefficients of which are described by a set of random variables with known statistical properties. In order to fully utilize the limited communication resources, RRP is introduced in the sensor-to-filter channel. Considering the measurement outliers, a saturation function is adopted in the filter structure to suppress the anomalous innovations so as to reduce the negative impact of the outliers. By means of the matrix difference equation, an upper bound is first obtained on the filtering error covariance, and the filter gain is designed to minimize the obtained upper bound by partial derivation. Moreover, the exponential boundedness of the filtering error dynamics is analyzed in the mean square sense. Finally, a numerical simulation example is given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed recursive security filtering scheme.},

The mode of attack of the adversaries is to corrupt the sensor measurements of some of the agents, while the communication and information processing capabilities of those agents remain unaffected. To ensure that all the agents, both normal and those under attack, are able to correctly estimate the parameter value, the Resilient Estimation through Weight Balancing (REWB) algorithm is introduced. The only condition required for the REWB algorithm to guarantee resilient estimation is that at any given point in time, less than half of the total number of agents are under attack. This article discusses the development of the REWB algorithm using the concepts of weight balancing of directed graphs and the consensus+innovation approach for linear estimation. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the performance of our algorithm over directed graphs under different conditions of adversarial attacks.},

  abstract     = {In social psychology, it is well known that the evolution of opinion dynamics in a society depends not only on the current opinions of individuals, but also on the past opinions stored in memory. However, it is still difficult to clearly characterize and analyze the memory influence on opinion dynamics in social networks, especially in coopetitive (cooperative and competitive) networks. In this article, we propose a novel model of opinion dynamics to describe the memory influence in coopetitive networks. In this model, memory and memoryless communication rules are simultaneously proposed for the opinion update mechanism. In terms of the network topological structure and the graph spectrum, sufficient and/or necessary conditions are, respectively, established to ensure that the opinion is nonstationary polarization, nonstationary consensus, and neutral. We employ Kahneman&#39;s seminal experiment on choices in risky and riskless contexts to interpret the results obtained in this article. Simulation analysis shows that the memory capacity of the individual is inversely proportional to the speeds of ultimate opinion formation, and the opinions reach a persistent disagreement when the individuals are very confident.},

The problem is tackled in a novel moving horizon estimation (MHE) framework, while taking into account the limited communication capabilities and the restricted computational power and memory, which are distributed across the network. The proposed design is motivated by the fact that in a decentralized setting, a Luenberguer-based framework is unable to leverage the full potential of the available local information. A method is derived to solve a relaxed version of the resulting optimization problem. It can be synthesized offline and its stability can be assessed prior to deployment. It is shown that the proposed approach allows for significant improvement on the performance of recent Luenberger-based filters. Furthermore, we show that a state-of-the-art distributed MHE solution with comparable requirements underperforms in comparison to the proposed solution.},

In this article, we design a novel control architecture that prevents their existence. In particular, first, we propose to encode the sensor outputs into a randomly changing lower dimensional space obtained by means of principal component analysis. Such a transformation ensures optimal information reconstruction on the controller&#39;s side, and it prevents the attacker from accessing the original sensor measurements, nullifying the possibility of perfect stealthy attacks. Then, on the controller&#39;s side, we design a passive Gaussian anomaly detector that leverages the output of an unknown input observer ad hoc designed to estimate the system&#39;s states and unknown inputs simultaneously. It is formally shown that the proposed detection strategy is able to discover the presence of replay and covert attacks. Simulation results obtained considering a quadruple water tank system confirm the capability of the developed architecture.},

An auxiliary signal that contains a component to measure the (weighted) mean changing rates of measurement errors is employed and, hence, the induced event-triggered mechanism is termed as a mean-rate one. By incorporating this auxiliary signal into dynamic event-triggering conditions, the new mean-rate event-triggered mechanism can ensure closed-loop input-to-state stability with respect to external disturbances. To further improve transmission performance, a concept of weak time regularization is given and proved, where similar to traditional time regularization, no events can be triggered within a user-specified lower bound, but differently, the positiveness of this user-specified parameter is not necessary in excluding Zeno behavior. Finally, a nonlinear example is simulated to illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the theoretical results.},

Considering the limited network bandwidth and the impact of deception attacks simultaneously, we propose an attack-probability-dependent adaptive event-triggered mechanism. Not only can it reduce the number of controller updates, but it can also adapt to the variation of system dynamics subject to deception attacks. A mathematical model is established for the closed-loop system under stochastic deception attacks. Then, a time-dependent looped functional is constructed to reduce the conservatism of stability results. The norm of the system state is estimated, and based on the discrete-time Lyapunov theory, a less conservative stability criterion is derived. Then, an easy-to-implement design algorithm for the controller gain is given so that the exponential stabilization in the mean square sense can be realized for the MJS subject to stochastic deception attacks.

The algorithm combines stochastic gradients with tracking in an asynchronous push-sum framework and obtains a sublinear convergence rate, matching the rate of the centralized stochastic gradient descent applied to the nonconvex minimization.

In the prescreening stage, the plausible candidates of PDC configurations are identified based on a graph theory-based multimedian function (MMF). In this article, a computationally efficient meta-heuristic algorithm is used to address scalability. In the candidate selection stage, two different algorithms, namely, Suurballe&#39;s and Dijkstra&#39;s, are employed to identify the best of those plausible PDC configurations as the final design. This technique not only minimizes the hop paths between PMUs and PDCs, but also ensures network resiliency against single PMU, PDC, or communication link failure by incorporating the roles of PMUs in power grid observability into routing policy.

Due to the continuous and impulsive nature of the clocks and the network, we introduce a hybrid system model to effectively capture the dynamics of the system and the proposed hybrid algorithm. Moreover, the hybrid algorithm allows each agent to estimate the skew of its internal clock in order to allow for synchronization to a common timer rate. We provide sufficient conditions guaranteeing the synchronization of the timers, exponentially fast, with robustness.

Agents can only communicate through directed communication graphs. In addition, there are coupling constraints between agent decisions in the same cluster. Under the widely used assumptions, two distributed algorithms are proposed to solve the NE of the multicluster game based on gradient descent, state feedback, and consensus protocol. The convergence of the two algorithms is analyzed by singular perturbation analysis and variational analysis. The theoretical results show that the first algorithm achieves exponential convergence when the parameters are certain, while the other algorithm also achieves global asymptotic convergence when the parameters are uncertain.

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a novel stochastic binary resetting algorithm for networks of pulse-coupled oscillators (or, simply, agents) to reach global synchronization. The algorithm is simple to state: Every agent in a network oscillates at a common frequency. Upon completing an oscillation, an agent generates a Bernoulli random variable to decide whether it sends pulses to all of its out-neighbors or it stays quiet. Upon receiving a pulse, an agent resets its state by following a binary phase update rule. We show that such an algorithm can guarantee global synchronization of the agents almost surely as long as the underlying information flow topology is a rooted directed graph. The proof of the result relies on the use of a stochastic hybrid dynamical system approach. Toward the end of this article, we present numerical demonstrations for the validity of the result and numerical studies about the units of time needed to reach synchronization for networks with various information flow topologies.},

A fully distributed event-trigger-based observer is proposed to estimate the state of the leader, where global information is not required and the leader&#39;s system matrices are identified in finite time. An intermittent event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is also designed to avoid continuously monitored triggered conditions. For actuator attacks, a compensator, based on a distributed normal state predictor, is developed to recover paralyzed states. Theoretical analysis shows that an MAS steered by our proposed fully distributed adaptive resilient scheme achieves output synchronization, and Zeno-behaviors are excluded.

First, based on a distributed exact penalty method, the original optimization problem is translated to a problem of standard assignment without consensus constraints. Then, a novel DSAPA by combining the smoothing approximation with Nesterov&#39;s accelerated schemes, is proposed. In addition, we provide a systematic analysis to derive an upper bound on the convergence rate in terms of the objective function based on penalty function and to choose the optimal step size accordingly.

A large number of agents interact noncooperatively in a population game by selecting strategies based on their payoffs. Each agent is allowed to revise its strategy repeatedly with an average frequency referred to as the revision rate. We are interested in the case where an agent&#39;s current strategy directly influences the revision rate. Existing stability results for this case assume that a memoryless potential game generates the strategies&#39; payoffs. This article extends these results to allow for payoff mechanisms that can be either dynamic or memoryless games that do not have to be potential. To make our analysis concrete, we assume that the agents&#39; revision preferences follow a so-called pairwise comparison protocol. These protocols are ubiquitous because they operate fully decentralized and with minimal information requirements (they need to access only the payoff values, not the mechanism).

In addition, communication networks are vulnerable to attacks from agents outside the game as well as communication failures. In this article, we propose a distributed NE seeking algorithm that is robust against adversarial agents that transmit noise, random signals, constant singles, deceitful messages, as well as being resilient to external factors such as dropped communication, jammed signals, and man-in-the-middle attacks. The core issue that makes the problem challenging is that agents have no means of verifying if the information they receive is correct, i.e., there is no “ground truth.” To address this problem, we use an observation graph, which gives truthful action information, in conjunction with a communication graph, which gives (potentially incorrect) information. By filtering information obtained from these two graphs, we show that our algorithm is resilient against adversarial agents and converges to the NE.},

For networks in which delays increase with the number of links, we establish the existence of a fundamental performance tradeoff that arises from control architecture. In particular, we utilize consensus dynamics with single- and double-integrator agents to show that, if delays increase fast enough, a sparse controller with nearest neighbor interactions can outperform the centralized one with all-to-all communication topology.},

However, the theory for nonlinear agents using probing inputs is far less developed, relying on dynamics linearization and, thus, cannot be applied to networks with nonsmooth or discontinuous dynamics. In this article, we use global convergence properties of the network, which can be ensured using passivity theory, to present a network identification method for nonlinear agents. We do so by linearizing the steady-state equations rather than the dynamics, achieving a sub-cubic time algorithm for network identification. We also study the problem of network identification from a complexity theory standpoint, showing that the presented algorithms are optimal in terms of time complexity. We demonstrate the presented algorithm in two case studies with discontinuous dynamics.},

The idea of the minimum learning parameter is adopted and the sector characteristic of the hysteresis quantizer is cleverly used, so that the computational complexity of the control law is reduced. A reasonable relationship between the local synchronization error and the transformed error is established by the proposed error transformation, which is the key to solving the problem that the agents with different quantizers can achieve synchronization and meet the prescribed performance.

  abstract     = {Mathematical characterization of switched systems based on automata is one of the most challenging problems in the context of hybrid dynamical systems. This article investigates the mathematical representation and stabilization of a class of slowly and fastly switched linear systems with automata in the hybrid coupling framework. To address such an issue, by using the semitensor product of matrices, a so-called “automation-dependent switched linear system” is established to generalize the traditional switched system, which is characterized mathematically in the new form of a hybrid dynamic system consisting of a continuous-time differential equation and a discrete-time difference equation. Moreover, a novel automation-dependent constrained switching scheme is developed for the stabilization of the proposed model with unstable subsystems. Next, by designing slow mode-dependent average dwell time (S-MDADT), fast mode-dependent average dwell time (F-MDADT), slow cycle-dependent cycle dwell time (S-CDCDT), and fast cycle-dependent cycle dwell time (F-CDCDT) switching laws, a generalized stabilization lemma for automation-dependent switched nonlinear systems with both stable and unstable modes inside and outside the cycle is derived in the terms of digital transformations and multiple Lyapunov functions. Furthermore, based on the stabilizability criteria of the nonlinear case, by setting digital transformations and linear matrix inequalities, a new stabilization theorem for automation-dependent switched linear systems with unstable subsystems is obtained. It should be noted that the proposed scheme provides a more precise estimation of the upper and lower bounds for the dwell time of the system with unstable modes. Finally, a practical converter circuit example and a numerical example are given to show the validity of the designed techniques.},

We estimate the performance of the system by analytically establishing upper and lower bounds on the expected time needed for the novel state to replace the original one. Such bounds are expressed as functions of the control policy adopted and of the network structure, and establish fundamental limitations on the system&#39;s performance. Leveraging these results, we classify network structures depending on the possibility of achieving a fast spread of the novel state (i.e., complete replacement in a time growing logarithmically with the network size) using simple open-loop control policies. Finally, we propose a feedback control policy that using little knowledge of the network and of the system&#39;s evolution at a macroscopic level, allows for a substantial speed up of the spreading process, guaranteeing fast spread on topologies where simple open-loop control policies are not sufficient.

  abstract     = {In decentralized networked supervisory control of discrete-event systems (DESs), the local supervisors observe event occurrences subject to observation delays to make correct control decisions. Delay co-observability describes whether these local supervisors can make sufficient observations. In this article, we provide an efficient way to verify delay co-observability. For each controllable event, we partition the specification language into a finite number of sets such that strings in different sets have different lengths. For each set, we construct a verifier to check if delay co-observability holds for the controllable event. The computational complexity of the proposed approach is polynomial with respect to the number of states, the number of events, and the upper bounds on observation delays and only exponential with respect to the number of local supervisors. It has a lower complexity order than the existing approaches. In addition, we investigate the relationship between the decentralized supervisory control of networked DESs and the decentralized fault diagnosis of networked DESs and show that delay &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$K$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -codiagnosability is transformable to delay co-observability.

  abstract     = {In large-scale networked control systems (NCSs), an important issue is how to guarantee the system performance under the limited network bandwidth and stochastic cyberattacks. Centralized event-triggering mechanisms (ETMs) are now regarded as a desirable solution to ease the bandwidth pressure, but the application in large-scale NCSs is constrained by overall management complexity. In this article, we will first propose a software-defined centralized ETM to cost-efficiently conduct an event-triggering decision based on global system states to ensure system transmission performance. Then, by taking deception attacks, which can hardly be detected and pose serious threats to NCSs into account, we study a secure control problem over a large-scale NCS with the presented centralized ETM. The considered deception attacks compromise controller-to-actuator channels, and the specific behaviors of the attacks on different channels are depicted by different Bernoulli processes. To solve the problem, a formal model of the envisioned large-scale system is established, the sufficient conditions that achieve the uniformly ultimately bounded stability of the formulated system are analyzed, and then the controller gains are designed accordingly. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is finally validated by an illustrative example.},

First of all, an event-based data transmission scheme is proposed to solve the fixed-time secure leader-following consensus in the occurrence of connective-preserved DoS attacks. Besides, a novel measurement error is developed to avoid Zeno behavior. However, the initial communication topology may inevitably be disconnected by malicious adversaries. To solve this difficulty, a new fixed-time secure observer is designed to estimate the leader information. Moreover, a self-triggered control strategy is proposed, which not only avoids the continuous communication but also restores the secure leader-following consensus subject to connective-preserved/broken DoS attacks. Then, the characteristic of the allowable connective-preserved/broken DoS attacks can be obtained. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

It is more practical yet challenging to deal with static systems under ideal environments. Barycentric coordinates based on the relative distance are used to characterize the positions between agents. The sign coefficients are introduced to guarantee that the sum of barycentric coordinates is equal to one, thus eliminating the constraint that the agent needs to be located in the convex hull. Using the newly designed iteration-varying gains, a robust distributed estimation method based on iterative learning is proposed. The key to accurate localization is to construct an appropriate approximator via introducing two iterative-varying gains into the localization scheme. The convergence in the sense of mathematical expectation is proved. The simulation examples and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Specifically, by exploiting the interplay of tools from the Laplace transformation and algebraic graph theory, we demonstrate that with the developed distributed algorithm, all agents reach consensus, while the boundedness of all closed-loop signals remains unchanged. In addition, we apply the developed algorithm to tackle the rendezvous control problem for networked nonholonomic mobile robots with unknown dynamic parameters.

In the transmission-constrained consensus problem, we obtain the necessary and sufficient condition that agents can converge to state consensus. Furthermore, a more general case is studied in which the system reaches an equilibrium. Based on some techniques of stability theory, the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the system equilibrium point can be proven, which means the system can reach an asymptotically stable equilibrium. Moreover, the state values of the equilibrium are only decided by the network structure and transmission constraint functions but not the agents&#39; initial states.

By extending the adaptive law from scalar form to matrix form, only one adaptive coupling gain matrix is employed to adjust the feedback control gain and coupling weight simultaneously, which provides considerable convenience for analysis and application of the consensus tracking protocol. Theoretical identification of the effectiveness of the integrated design approach is presented by using the Lyapunov stability theory with the Lyapunov function partly constructed by the trace-norm of the adaptive coupling gain matrix. Furthermore, the integrated adaptive control approach is extended to achieve robust consensus tracking with a leader having nonzero inputs.

For this problem, we present and prove a theorem on the uniqueness of a generalized solution for a broad class of nonideal pressure-density relations that satisfy a monotonicity property. Furthermore, we develop a Newton–Raphson algorithm for numerical solution of the steady-state problem, which is made possible by a systematic nondimensionalization of the equations. The developed algorithm has been extensively tested on benchmark instances and shown to converge robustly to a generalized solution. Previous results indicate that the steady-state network flow equations for an ideal gas are difficult to solve by the Newton–Raphson method because of its extreme sensitivity to the initial guess. In contrast, we find that nondimensionalization of the steady-state problem is key to robust convergence of the Newton–Raphson method. We identify criteria based on the uniqueness of solutions under which the existence of a nonphysical generalized solution found by a nonlinear solver implies nonexistence of a physical solution, i.e., infeasibility of the problem. Finally, we compare pressure and flow solutions based on ideal and nonideal equations of state to demonstrate the need to apply the latter in practice.

We focus on an integrative framework powered by a model-free deep RL method that can address different flavors of the control problem (e.g., with or without control inputs; having attractor states or a subset of the state space as the target domain). The method is agnostic to the distribution of probabilities for the next state; hence, it does not use the probability transition matrix. The time complexity is only linear on the time steps or interactions between the agent (deep RL) and the environment (PBN), during training.

Furthermore, emphasis is placed on scheduling the load shedding when there exist some priorities on the loads. To solve the EDP and the load shedding problem in a distributed setting, we develop a method that combines the dual decomposition approach and the extragradient-based strategy. Notably, this work provides a fixed step size-based scheme for a strongly convex resource allocation problem considering general nonaffine coupled constraints. We show that the proposed algorithm converges to the optimal solution under the assumption that the underlying graph is undirected. In addition, the method has an ergodic convergence rate of O(1/k) in terms of the optimality residuals and the constraint violations.

  abstract     = {We present two optimization approaches to minimize the impact of sensor falsification attacks in linear time-invariant systems controlled by estimate-based feedback. We accomplish this by finding observer and controller gain matrices that minimize outer ellipsoidal bounds that contain the reachable set of attack-induced states. To avoid trivial solutions, we involve a covariance-based &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\Vert H\Vert _{2}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; closed-loop performance constraint. This exposes a tradeoff between system security and closed-loop performance and demonstrates that only small concessions in performance can lead to large gains in our reachability-based security metric. We provide both a nonlinear optimization based on geometric sums and a fully convexified approach formulated with linear matrix inequalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these tools on two numerical case studies.},

To avoid the asynchronous pitfall where only vector parts of rigid bodies reach agreement on some identical value but scalar parts do not, multiplicative quaternion errors are incorporated to develop attitude synchronization protocols for rigid bodies with absolute attitude measurements. In this work, it is shown that global synchronization of networked rigid bodies is achieved if and only if the directed topology is quasistrongly connected. Simultaneously, a novel double-energy-function analysis method, equipped with an ordering permutation technique for the scalar parts and a coordinate transformation mechanism, is constructed for the quaternion behavior analysis of networked rigid bodies. In particular, global synchronization works well with our analysis method, regardless of the highly nonlinear and strongly coupling problems resulting from multiplicative quaternion errors, which seriously hinder the traditional analysis of global synchronization for networked rigid bodies. Simulations for networked spacecraft are presented to validate global synchronization performances under different directed topologies.},

For the purpose of avoiding directly employing global information, a finite-time fully distributed adaptive observer under a directed communication graph is proposed to estimate the exosystem without using global information. In addition, a finite-time estimation algorithm is given to estimate the solutions of linear parameter-varying regulation equations without knowing exosystem matrix a prior. This is based on a fully distributed cooperative output regulation controller which is formulated so that the linear parameter-varying multiagents system can achieve cooperative output regulation, which extends the applicability of the existing works of time-invariant systems to parameter-varying settings.},

Based on this UIO, we design a continuous consensus controller by introducing a decay function, which remains positive into the term that is used to eliminate the effects of the leader&#39;s nonzero inputs. And by using the multiple Lyapunov functions method, we prove that asymptotical consensus can be achieved if the average dwell time is greater than a positive threshold. Second, we design a continuous consensus controller based on a reduced-order UIO that can significantly simplify calculations. Finally, we give two examples of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles to verify the theoretical results.

A novel DoS attack strategy with pause and restart rules was proposed, in which the attacker pauses the attack for a while to restore energy after a failed attack attempt. The restart rule was described based on Markov chain modeling of the attacking period. The transition matrix and stationary distribution of the Markov chain model were also presented. To maximize the attack effect, the optimal restart rule of the proposed strategy was investigated.

  abstract     = {In modern society, individuals&#39; opinions on various topics evolve as the result of their continuous interactions and are shaped by interpersonal influences and individual social power. Friedkin&#39;s reflected appraisal theory reveals how social power evolves along discussion sequences as a consequence of direct and indirect interpersonal influence over issue outcomes. This reflected appraisal theory also suggests how, in enduring social groups, a form of concentrated power in an entrenched minority arises as a near iron law of influence network dynamics. Motivated by theoretical and empirical findings, this article studies oligarchic influence systems, i.e., systems in which the social power is accumulated within a small group of individuals. First, we propose a new mathematical model of the reflected appraisal mechanism and illustrate how, under appropriate conditions, this model leads the influence system to asymptotically converge to an oligarchy. Second and most important, we address the data-driven social power estimation problem, i.e., we propose algorithms to unveil oligarchies in influence networks along issue sequences. Our algorithmic approach is based upon 1) casting the problem of learning social power as a sparse recovery problem and 2) estimating individuals&#39; social power directly from the observation of initial and final average opinions, without the burdensome intermediate step of social influence recovery. We prove that the social power estimation can be performed with partial sampling of initial opinions and we derive theoretical bounds on the estimation error in terms of the number of observations. We study sample complexity and computational requirements of the proposed methods. Finally, our findings are validated via numerical experiments.},

In this work, the coordination of conventional (slow) frequency containment reserves (FCR) with FFR is treated as a decentralized model-matching problem. The design results in a dynamic virtual power plant (DVPP), whose aggregated output fulfills the system operator’s (SO’s) requirements in all time-scales, while accounting for the capacity and bandwidth limitation of participating devices. This is illustrated in a 5-machine representation of the Nordic synchronous grid. In the Nordic grid, stability issues and bandwidth limitations associated with nonminimum phase zeros of hydropower is a well-known problem. By simulating the disconnection of a 1400 MW importing dc link, it is shown that the proposed DVPP design allows for coordinating fast FFR from wind, with slow FCR from hydro, while respecting dynamic limitations of all participating devices. The SO’s requirements are fulfilled in a realistic low-inertia scenario without the need to install battery storage or to waste wind energy by curtailing the wind turbines.},

  abstract     = {This article considers the problem of distributed state estimation of a linear time-invariant system by a network of sensors in a discrete-time setting. Specifically, we consider a consensus-based distributed Kalman filter where each sensor updates its estimate in two steps: 1) a consensus step dictated by a weighted and 2) a directed communication graph followed by a local Luenberger filtering step. For a given network, we show that the suboptimal filtering gains that minimize an upper bound of a quadratic filtering cost can be computed only by exchanging state estimates and their covariance matrices among agents. The resulting dynamics for the network’s covariance matrices are represented by a set of coupled algebraic Riccati equations (CAREs) that can be analyzed to ensure stability. Next, we connect some of the results from the Markovian jump linear systems literature regarding the underlying CARE dynamics to the distributed estimation problem, and provide separate necessary and sufficient conditions for successful estimation. We show that the notion of strong detectability plays an important role in the stability of the filter matrices and ensures that the noise-free error dynamics exponentially converge to zero. We then utilize the notion of weak detectability to provide necessary conditions in terms of the network topology and self-weights of the communication graph. We further demonstrate how these notions of detectability can be combined to search for feasible network topologies and weights that ensure this suboptimal performance. Numerical examples are given to illustrate these results.},

  abstract     = {This article presents the equilibrium analysis of a game composed of heterogeneous electric vehicles (EVs) and a power distribution system operator (DSO) as the players, and charging station operators (CSOs) and a transportation network operator (TNO) as coordinators. Each EV tries to pick a charging station as its destination and a route to get there at the same time. However, the traffic and electrical load congestion on the roads and charging stations lead to the interdependencies between the optimal decisions of EVs. CSOs and the TNO need to apply some tolling to control such congestion. On the other hand, the pricing at charging stations depends on real-time distributional locational marginal pricing, which is determined by the DSO after solving the optimal power flow over the power distribution network. This article also takes into account the local and the coupling/infrastructure constraints of EVs, along with transportation and distribution networks. This problem is modeled as a generalized aggregative game, and then a decentralized learning method is proposed to obtain an equilibrium point of the game, which is known as variational generalized Wardrop equilibrium. The existence of such an equilibrium point and the convergence of the proposed algorithm to it are proven. We undertake numerical studies on the Savannah city model and the IEEE 33-bus distribution network and investigate the impact of various characteristics on demand and prices.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a decentralized safe control (DSC) approach for distributed cyber-physical systems based on conducting reachability analysis in real time. Each agent can periodically compute the local reachable set from its current local time to some time instant in the near future, and then broadcast a message containing the computed reachable set to the other agents via a shared communication channel. By comparing its own reachable set to unsafe regions such as obstacles, and received reachable sets in a peer-to-peer manner, the agent can predict if any collision may exist shortly. In this circumstance, the agent can utilize the unsafe intersection of its computed reachable set, the unsafe regions, and the received reachable sets to recalculate a new set of waypoints and update its corresponding control strategies. As a result, our DSC approach can ensure a distributed system achieving a mission goal with a collision-free guarantee. For evaluation, we applied the proposed DSC method to perform decentralized control, in real time, a group of quadcopters conducting a distributed patrol mission with safety guarantees.},

Next, we associate the nodes of these frameworks to the robotic agents of rigid cooperative manipulation schemes and we express the object-agent internal forces by using the graph rigidity matrix, which encodes the infinitesimal rigid body motions of the system. Moreover, we show that the associated cooperative manipulation grasp matrix is related to the rigidity matrix via a range-nullspace relation, based on which we provide novel results on the relation between the arising interaction and internal forces and, consequently, on the energy-optimal force distribution on a cooperative manipulation system.

A novel clock rigidity theory is proposed and its topological condition is proved to have a close relationship to bearing rigidity. Based on clock rigidity, a graphical approach for analyzing the joint position and clock problem is investigated. It is shown that a position-clock framework with certain graph properties can be uniquely determined up to some trivial variations corresponding to both position and clock parameters.

However, it has proven difficult to characterize the traffic produced by ETC a priori . Rollout ETC addresses this issue by using a triggering and control law that is implicitly defined by the solution to an optimal control problem (OCP), instead of an explicit one as in classical ETC. This allows to directly incorporate predefined constraints on the transmission traffic as well as on states and inputs. In this article, we examine the practically relevant case when outputs instead of state measurements are available, and measurements as well as the LTI plant are subject to uncertainties. To address these challenges, we adapt methods from robust tube-based model predictive control and propose three different strategies to implement an error feedback in an NCSs setup, the applicability of which depends on the capabilities of the actuator. We establish recursive feasibility, robust constraint satisfaction, and convergence. Finally, we illustrate our results in a numerical example.},

First, an attack model with the worst-case malicious behaviors is employed to simulate the adversarial environment, which can remove some general constraints about attackers. Then, a novel state decomposition mean-subsequence-reduce algorithm is proposed, which cannot only ensure the accurate consensus but also exhibit a high level of privacy preservation for initial states and the strong resilience to adversaries. Second, a series of different decomposition functions is used to decompose the initial state of each agent into two substates, and different linear integration functions are also adopted to combine two substates into original states. Moreover, the different weights of two substates are employed to describe the interaction. Third, a step-size sequence is introduced to realize the resilient consensus and to generate greater uncertainty. It is proven that the privacy of the initial states can be preserved even if all neighbors of one regular agent are compromised to adversarial agents. Furthermore, a sufficient and necessary condition, associated with the time-varying directed network, is obtained to realize resilient consensus.

It is shown under what conditions taking coarse samples from a network will contain the same amount of information as a finer set of samples. Our goal is to estimate the initial condition of linear time-invariant networks using a set of noisy measurements. The observability condition is reformulated as the frame condition, where one can easily trace the location and time stamps of each sample. We compare the estimation quality of various sampling strategies using estimation measures, which depend on the spectrum of the corresponding frame operators. Using properties of the minimal polynomial of the state matrix, deterministic and randomized methods are suggested to construct observability frames. Intrinsic tradeoffs assert that collecting samples from fewer subsystems dictates taking more samples (in average) per subsystem. Three scalable algorithms are developed to generate sparse space–time sampling strategies with explicit error bounds.},

  abstract     = {Engineered cyberphysical systems are growing increasingly large and complex. These systems require scalable controllers that robustly satisfy state and input constraints in the presence of additive noise: such controllers should also be accompanied by theoretical guarantees on feasibility and stability. In our companion paper, we introduced distributed and localized model predictive control (DLMPC) for large-scale linear systems; DLMPC is a scalable closed-loop MPC scheme in which subsystems need only exchange local information in order to synthesize and implement local controllers. In this article, we provide recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability guarantees for DLMPC. We leverage the system level synthesis framework to express the maximal positive robust invariant set for the closed-loop system and its corresponding Lyapunov function in terms of the closed-loop system responses. We use the invariant set as the terminal set for DLMPC, and show that this guarantees feasibility with minimal conservatism. We use the Lyapunov function as the terminal cost, and show that this guarantees stability. We provide fully distributed and localized algorithms to compute the terminal set offline, and also provide necessary additions to the online DLMPC algorithm to accommodate coupled terminal constraint and cost. In all algorithms, only local information exchange is necessary, and computational complexity is independent of the global system size: we demonstrate this analytically and experimentally. This is the first distributed MPC approach that provides minimally conservative yet fully distributed guarantees for recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability in the nominal and robust settings.},

In this problem, two strategic agents compete to attract the nonstrategic agents to adopt opinions as closer to theirs as possible, by connecting with these nonstrategic agents and allocating their strengths on these connections. Therefore, a two-person zero-sum competitive game is characterized. We develop mathematical tools to provide some useful properties of the game, including the partial derivatives and positive definiteness of the payoff functions, based on which the Nash equilibrium of the game is analyzed. We rigorously examine that each player will allocate his or her strengths according to the susceptibilities, the intrinsic opinions, and the costs of the nonstrategic agents, along with the weighted column-sums of the row-stochastic matrix, which describes the interpersonal influences of the network if the network satisfies a condition. Otherwise, a Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm is proposed with simplex constraints by which each strategic agent can asymptotically learn its optimal strategy.

Uncertainties are considered as granular fuzzy numbers that are represented via horizontal membership functions and relative distance measurement (RDM) arithmetic. It is first proved that there exists a crisp solution to a fuzzy linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. This proof creates a bridge such that multidimensional RDM arithmetic that has been devoted to linear functions so far could be entered into some problems with nonlinear functions. Then, an algorithm is proposed for the consensus of the MASs with uncertainty. Here, by proving the existence of a crisp solution for fuzzy LMI, we are able to prove that the proposed algorithm can ensure achieving consensus. Furthermore, the gain coefficients obtained for this fuzzy system are crisp numbers and can be applied to real systems in practical applications. Finally, the final value of consensus is calculated as a fuzzy number to present a better understanding of the effect of uncertainty on the final value of consensus. In addition, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is shown in a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {The increasing presence of large-scale distributed systems highlights the need for scalable control strategies where only local communication is required. Moreover, in safety-critical systems, it is imperative that such control strategies handle constraints in the presence of disturbances. In response to this need, in this article, we present the distributed and localized model-predictive control (DLMPC) algorithm for large-scale linear systems. DLMPC is a distributed closed-loop model-predictive control (MPC) scheme, wherein only local state and model information needs to be exchanged between subsystems for the computation and implementation of control actions. We use the system-level synthesis framework to reformulate the centralized MPC problem and show that this allows us to naturally impose localized communication constraints between subcontrollers. The structure of the resulting problem can be exploited to develop an alternating-direction-method-of-multipliers-based algorithm that allows for a distributed and localized computation of closed-loop control policies. We demonstrate that the computational complexity of the subproblems solved by each subsystem in DLMPC is independent of the size of the global system. DLMPC is the first MPC algorithm that allows for the scalable computation and implementation of distributed closed-loop control policies and deals with additive disturbances. In our companion paper, we show that this approach enjoys recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability.},

Given a complex network topology with specific governing dynamics, the proposed framework finds an optimal allocation of edge weights that minimizes such vulnerability measure(s) at the node(s) for which we expect perturbations to occur by solving a tractable semidefinite programming problem. We specify the mathematical model to high-voltage electric grids, where each node corresponds to a voltage phase angle associated with a bus and edges correspond to transmission lines. Edge weights are determined by the susceptance values along the transmission lines. In this application, frequency synchronization is increasingly challenged by the integration of renewable energy, yet is imperative to the grid&#39;s health and functionality. Our framework helps to alleviate this challenge by optimizing the placement of renewable generation and the susceptance values along the transmission lines.},

Instead of adopting the conventional noise-based protocols driven by Brownian motion, a novel G-noise communication protocol is first proposed to realize the consensus. Moreover, the consensus protocol not only contains time-varying and nonlinear characteristics but also focuses on DoS attacks. The protocol driven by the G-Brownian motion is characterized in the sublinear expectation framework, which leads to the infeasibility of the existing theory. To overcome the difficulty, a new theoretical framework is established to develop a consensus criterion. More specifically, first, the nonzero property of MASs is introduced to ensure the rationality of the construction for the Lyapunov function. Then, a sufficient criterion for guaranteeing the consensus of MASs is demonstrated by utilizing the Lyapunov method, graph theory, and stochastic analysis theory, which depends on DoS duration, noise intensity, and G-Brownian motion parameters. Ultimately, theoretical results are associated with islanded microgrid systems with numerical simulation being exploited.},

  abstract     = {This work considers a network of autonomous agents that exploit the superposition property of the wireless channel for achieving max-consensus under communication constraints. In technical applications, superposition (or interference) is traditionally avoided by physically separating transmissions from different agents, e.g., by employing time-division multiple access or frequency-division multiple access protocols. In contrast, Over-the-Air computation relies on simultaneous transmissions of signals in the same frequency band to boost performance. This article extends the results presented by Molinari et al. 2021 in a significant way: Rather than requiring a new and hardly accessible technology that allows simultaneous receiving and transmission of signals (full-duplex), we present a solution based on cheap and ubiquitous half-duplex technology. However, half-duplex technology only allows agents to either receive or transmit at a given time, hence requiring agents to be grouped into clusters. The proposed method, first, enables each cluster to achieve max-consensus within itself. Then, agents belonging to more than one cluster spread the information across different clusters that are, in general, not synchronized. The proposed max-consensus protocol can deal with asynchronism and allows the network to achieve max-consensus within a finite number of steps. Simulations confirm our theoretical results.},

To this end, decentralized methods have been popular for their computational scalability, while enabling data ownership by utility stakeholders. However, decentralization also requires sharing network flow estimates over public channels raising privacy concerns. In this article, we propose a differential privacy driven, alternating direction method of multipliers approach for decentralized, mixed integer optimization of operations and maintenance problems which preserves the privacy of network flow estimates. We prove strong privacy guarantees by leveraging the linear relationship between the phase angles and flow. To address challenges associated with the mixed integer and dynamic nature of the problem, we introduce an exponential moving average-based consensus mechanism to enhance convergence, coupled with a control chart-based convergence criteria to improve stability. Our results demonstrate that our privacy preserving approach is robust to a range of noise levels and operational scenarios, delivering solutions on par with benchmark methods.},

In each round, each agent receives a noisy measurement of the system&#39;s average value and then updates its value. This value is then perturbed by random drift. We assume that both noise and drift are Gaussian. We prove that a distributed weighted-average algorithm optimally minimizes the deviation of each agent from the average value, and for every round. Interestingly, this optimality holds even in the centralized setting, where a master agent can gather all the agents&#39; measurements and instruct a move to each one.

We propose a distributed stochastic generalized Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm in a partial-decision information setting based on the Douglas–Rachford operator splitting scheme, which relaxes assumptions in the existing literature. The proposed algorithm updates players&#39; local decisions through augmented best-response schemes and subsequent projections onto the local feasible sets, which comprise most of the computational workload. The projected stochastic subgradient method is applied to provide approximate solutions to the augmented best-response subproblems for each player. The Robbins–Siegmund theorem is leveraged to establish the main convergence results to a true Nash equilibrium using the proposed inexact solver. Finally, we illustrate the validity of the proposed algorithm via two numerical examples: 1) a stochastic Nash–Cournot distribution game and 2) a multiproduct assembly problem with the two-stage model.},

Faced with the high-power-charging load from trams, the cooperative control protocol is widely adopted to charge onboard supercapacitors due to the properties of reducing current overshoot and imbalance. However, the charging system under the protocol inevitably suffers from potential fault data from physical malfunctions or cyberattacks. To deal with it, in this article, a reliable cooperative control strategy (RCCS) is designed to alleviate the effects of fault data regardless of where it comes from and protect the system&#39;s performance. Specifically, first, we introduce the cooperative charging system model and analyze the causes and effects of fault data. Then, we provide a total current control protocol (TCCP) and a data cooperative-screening control protocol (CSCP) to deal with fault data from the physical layer and cyberlayer, respectively. Combining TCCP and CSCP, RCCS is designed and the system stability is proved based on Lyapunov stability analysis under RCCS. Finally, both simulations and experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {For state-dependent cooperation-competition networks, the output bipartite consensus problem of heterogeneous uncertain agents is studied in this article. In our framework, all the agents are described by second-order continuous-time nonlinear systems with different intrinsic dynamics, and the agents&#39; uncertainties are characterized by unknown parameters in the intrinsic term. Then, the edge evolution rules with hysteresis coefficients are proposed via the classification strategy. To solve this problem, the distributed Lyapunov-based redesign method with the potential function term is first applied to such a second-order heterogeneous uncertain multiagent system. Through the three-step correlation design, the explicit expressions of the distributed controllers and the unknown parameter estimators are obtained, and it is shown that the state-dependent cooperation-competition network is always connected and maintains structural balance for all time if an initial structurally balanced and connected network topology is provided. On this basis, it follows from the total Lyapunov function that output bipartite consensus can be achieved asymptotically for the heterogeneous uncertain multiagent system. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to validate the structural balance of state-dependent networks and output bipartite consensus of heterogeneous uncertain agents.},

  abstract     = {This article presents control strategies based on time-varying convergent higher order control barrier functions for a class of leader–follower multiagent systems under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks. Each agent is assigned a local STL task that may be dependent on the behavior of agents involved in other tasks. We consider one or more than one leader in the multiagent system. The leader has knowledge about the associated tasks and controls the performance of the subgroup-involved agents. The followers are not aware of the tasks and do not have any control authority to reach them. They follow the leader commands indirectly, according to their dynamics interconnections, for the task satisfaction. We further assume that the input-to-state stability property for the multiagent system is fulfilled. First, robust solutions for the task satisfaction, based on the leader&#39;s accessibility to the follower agents&#39; states, are suggested. In addition, using the notion of higher order barrier functions, individual barrier certificates for each agent evolving in a formation dynamic structure are proposed. For the case of the presence of more leaders in the subgroups, we provide decentralized barrier certificates. Our approach finds solutions to guarantee the satisfaction of STL tasks independent of the agents&#39; initial conditions.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the finite-time output-feedback cooperative formation problem of multiple marine surface vessels (MSVs) without using velocity information, where each MSV contains unknown time-varying actuator faults, ocean disturbances, and model uncertainties. Considering the performance specifications and requirements in practice, the formation errors and velocities are also required to change in a predefined compact set. Aiming at the challenge of unknown input gain caused by unknown time-varying multiplicative faults, a novel nonlinear extended state observer with an adaptive law is first constructed, which cannot only recover unmeasurable velocities from position-heading information but also simultaneously compensate for ocean disturbances, model uncertainties, and additive faults. Subsequently, combining the barrier Lyapunov function and the nonlinear tracking differentiator technique, a unified finite-time output-feedback cooperative control framework is developed, including both kinematics and kinetics, to prevent constraint deviation and avoid the computational complexity of the traditional backstepping method. Using finite-time stability theory, the designed output feedback cooperative controller can ensure that the desired cooperative performance is achieved within a finite time and tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin while ensuring that the closed-loop system is semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation examples are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Multiple leader and follower graphical games constitute challenging problems for aerospace and robotics applications. One of the challenges is to address the mutual interests among the followers with an optimal control point of view. In particular, the traditional approaches treat the output containment problem by introducing selfish followers where each follower only considers their own utility. In this article, we propose a differential output containment game over directed graphs where the mutual interests among the followers are addressed with an objective functional that also considers the neighboring agents. The obtained output containment error system results in a formulation where outputs of all followers prove to converge to the convex hull spanned by the outputs of leaders in a game optimal manner. The output containment problem is solved using the &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathscr{H}_\infty$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; output feedback method, where the new necessary and sufficient conditions are presented. Another challenge is to design distributed Nash equilibrium control strategies for such games, which cannot be achieved with the traditional quadratic cost functional formulation. Therefore, a modified cost functional that provides both Nash and distributed control strategies in the sense that each follower uses the state information of its own and neighbors is presented. Furthermore, an &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathscr{L}_{2}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; gain bound of the output containment error system that experiences worst-case disturbances with respect to the &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathscr{H}_\infty$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; criterion is investigated.

Synchronization and time delay are two common phenomena in real life. In aircraft formation, the latter&#39;s trajectory is consistent with the former&#39;s, but there exists a time gap when they arrive at the same position, which illustrates that time delay can happen in the process of synchronization. According to the delay step depending on initial states or not, two types of delay synchronization are proposed: 1) weak and 2) strong delay synchronization. Compared with synchronization, delay synchronization is only the theoretical generalization and has different application fields. Using the results of limit sets, several criteria for delay synchronization of the DBN and RBN are derived. This article provides an important result that delay synchronization of the DBN and RBCN can be equivalent to set stabilization of the augmented BCN, then the necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained. Moreover, two algorithms are established to design all time-optimal state feedback controllers. Finally, two examples are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the results.},

We begin by developing a model-based inverse RL algorithm including two update loops:1) an inner-loop optimal control update and 2) an outer-loop inverse optimal control (IOC) update. We then introduce a model-free inverse RL algorithm that uses online behaviors of the expert and learner MAS without knowing their dynamics. The optimal control and IOC are solved as subproblems in both proposed inverse RL algorithms. The reward functions that the learner MAS finds are proven to be both stabilizing and nonunique. Simulated case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed inverse RL algorithms.},

These approaches converge to a locally optimal solution; however, there is no guarantee on the quality of the locally optimal solution with respect to the globally optimal solution. We propose distributed algorithms for the coverage problem in convex continuous, nonconvex continuous, and metric graphs. We consider subadditive sensing functions, which capture scenarios where the service quality of a location is proportional to the distance between the robot and the location. For these sensing functions, we provide the first constant factor approximation algorithms for the distributed coverage problem. We also characterize the time and communication complexity of the proposed algorithm and show that the robots converge to a near-optimal solution in polynomial time. The approximation factor guarantees on the solution quality requires twice the conventional communication range; however, the extensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides a close to optimal solution with the conventional communication range as well, and outperforms several existing algorithms in convex, nonconvex continuous environments and metric graphs.},

  abstract     = {Highly nonlinear stochastic time-varying coupled systems are first considered in which the coupling structure is time-variant. It is worth pointing out that aperiodically intermittent control (AIC) is considered to achieve the stability of highly nonlinear stochastic time-varying coupled systems. Since the existing research methods for processing AIC are not suitable for stochastic highly nonlinear systems, a new Halanay-type differential inequality with higher order nonlinear terms that extend the existing Halanay-type differential inequalities is established. Then, with the help of the Lyapunov method, some techniques of inequalities, and the graph theory, two stabilization criteria are presented to guarantee the exponential stabilization for highly nonlinear stochastic time-varying coupled systems. Finally, as an application of our results, the modified time-varying coupled Van der Pol-Duffing oscillators are studied via AIC with numerical simulations provided.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by practical applications involving randomness, e.g., the power market model, the transportation model, and the signal transmission model, this article investigates the stochastic generalized Nash equilibrium (SGNE) problem where the cost function of each player is influenced by a stochastic variable. Employing the operator splitting technique, stochastic approximation scheme, and variance reduction scheme, this article develops a distributed primal–dual algorithm with full-decision information for seeking the SGNE, in which a fully connected interference graph is used for transmitting information among players. Considering the case that players cannot know all other players&#39; decisions, a distributed primal–dual algorithm with partial-decision information is proposed by introducing a local estimation to approximate the decision information of other players. It is proved that both algorithms converge to an SGNE provided that the uncoordinated fixed step sizes are less than the given upper bounds. Compared with existing algorithms, the algorithm with partial-decision information does not need the global game information. Each player is only required to know its local cost function, local feasible set, and a local block of the affine constraint, and share information with its neighbors. Numerical simulations are given for the networked Cournot competition and autonomous energy-management system to show the algorithm efficiency and performance.},

However, safety during the learning and control process is difficult to guarantee due to the inherent uncertainties. In this work, we propose a barrier-function-based robust cooperative collision-avoidance control framework for heterogeneous multirobot systems with model learning. First, a new control barrier function (CBF) design is proposed for cooperative collision-avoidance, which leads to less conservativeness of the feasible control actions. Then, decentralized robust CBF conditions are derived, which incorporate the estimation of the individual model uncertainty using Gaussian process models such that each robot can guarantee safety with a high probability. Finally, a quadratic programming problem is formulated to obtain a controller that is minimally invasive to the nominal controller and satisfies the CBF and velocity constraints simultaneously. The decentralized implementation of the robust collision-avoidance control strategy is explicitly shown and proven. Two simulation examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control framework.},

The input matrices are different and locally possessed by the corresponding agents, respectively, which can be regarded as different ways for agents to control the multi-input system. By embedding a fully distributed information fusion strategy, a novel cooperative LQR-based controller is proposed. Each agent only needs to communicate with its neighbors, rather than sharing information globally in a network. Moreover, only joint controllability is required, which allows the multi-input system to be uncontrollable for every single agent. In particular, only one-time information exchange is necessary at every control step, which significantly reduces the communication consumption. It is proved that the boundedness (convergence) of the controller gains is guaranteed for time-varying (time-invariant) systems. Furthermore, the performance of the entire system is ensured. Generally, the proposed controller achieves a better tradeoff between the control performance and the communication overhead compared with existing distributed LQR-based controllers.

Therefore, based on the distributed consensus algorithm of multiagent systems, this article studies the distributed voltage recovery consensus optimal control problem for the MGs with a nonlinear item and external disturbances. First, the distributed secondary voltage restoration consensus control problem can be transformed into a distributed zero-sum (ZS) differential game problem of the voltage restoration consensus tracking error dynamics via applying the adaptive command-filtered backstepping technique, in which the auxiliary system and neural networks are introduced to solve the unknown nonlinearities and external disturbances. Subsequently, the distributed voltage restoration consensus optimal control protocol is constructed via the ZS differential game algorithm to achieve the voltage recovery of island MGs, in which a critic network is proposed to estimate the associated cooperative cost function online with a designed weight update law. Further, the consensus optimal control protocol proposed not only ensures the cooperative cost function to be minimized, but also ensures in the closed-loop systems all signals to be cooperatively uniformly ultimately bounded. In addition, based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that the voltage recovery synchronization error can converge to an arbitrarily small range near the origin. Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller in island MG.},

  abstract     = {Online optimization problems are well understood in the convex case, where algorithmic performance is typically measured relative to the best fixed decision. In this article, we shed light on online nonconvex optimization problems in which algorithms are evaluated against the optimal decision at each time using the more useful notion of dynamic regret. The focus is on loss functions that are arbitrarily nonconvex but have global solutions that are slowly time-varying. We address this problem by first analyzing the region around the global solution at each time to define time-varying target sets, which contain the global solution and exhibit desirable properties under the projected gradient descent algorithm. All points in a target set satisfy the proximal Polyak–Łojasiewicz inequality, among other conditions. Then, we introduce two algorithms and prove that the dynamic regret for each algorithm is bounded by a function of the temporal variation in the optimal decision. The first algorithm assumes that the decision maker has some prior knowledge about the initial objective function and may query the gradient repeatedly at each time. This algorithm ensures that decisions are within the target set at every time. The second algorithm makes no assumption about prior knowledge. It instead relies on random sampling and memory to find and then track the target sets over time. In this case, the landscape of the loss functions determines the likelihood that the dynamic regret will be small. Numerical experiments validate these theoretical results and highlight the impact of a single low-complexity problem early in the sequence.},

  abstract     = {Distributed model predictive control (DMPC) has recently attracted extensive research attention due to its high flexibility and outstanding performance. However, most of those studies focus only on optimizing some subsystems with sets of local constraints, or on designing some schemes over time-invariant communication networks, by ignoring the cooperation of multiple subsystems with global constraints and also the privacy preservation of the subsystems in complex communication networks. Current research on DMPC is incapable to address all these challenges. Therefore, a novel distributed and privacy preserving MPC algorithm with global constraints over time-varying communication networks is proposed in this article. Firstly, we transform the MPC optimization problem that includes all the subsystems into its dual problem. Then, a fully distributed dual gradient algorithm with row-stochastic matrix is developed for solving that problem. For further reduction of the computational cost, an event-triggered communication protocol is designed, which is realized through a distributed trigger criterion. Under reasonable assumptions, we prove that the algorithm can converge to the optimal solution while assuring the recursive feasibility and exponential stability of a closed-loop system. In addition, considering that the sensitive information may be leaked or eavesdropped during the subsystem interaction, a distributed encryption algorithm with privacy preservation is presented in an updated version. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is secure and can effectively protect the privacy of the subsystems. Finally, the effectiveness and performance of the proposed approaches are substantiated through numerical simulations.},

A nonlinear distributed containment control algorithm is presented. The main difficulty is how to decouple the nonlinearities caused by the three kinds of constraints. To prove the convergence of the containment control problem, the distances from the followers to the convex hull spanned by the leaders are analyzed by removing the errors caused by the projection operators and the stochasticities of the equivalent system matrices are explored to show nonincreasing property of the maximum distance. It is shown that containment control can be achieved as long as the convex hull is contained in each position constraint set. Numerical simulations are given to illustrate the obtained theoretical results.},

The designed cooperative scheme is comprised of the 3-D mapping guidance and adaptive fuzzy control algorithm. The 3-D mapping guidance is developed to provide the reference signals of the yaw degree of freedom for the USV and UAV by utilizing the equivalent mapping technique. To control the USV–UAV converge to the desired path, the adaptive fuzzy control algorithm is designed for the position and attitude loops by fusing the dynamic surface control (DSC) and the backstepping techniques. The position loop can generate the thrust inputs for the USV–UAV and provide the desired rolling and pitching angles for the UAV by using the nonlinear decoupling method. In the proposed algorithm, the model uncertainties are approximated by the fuzzy logic system and only eight norm-based adaptive parameters are required to be updated online. Based on the Lyapunov theorem, the stability of the position loop and the attitude loop for the USV–UAV systems is achieved and all signals in the cooperative systems are the semiglobal uniform ultimate bounded (SGUUB). The superiorities and the effectiveness of the proposed strategy are verified through the numerical experiment on the MATLAB platform under the external disturbances.},

In this article, we propose a sufficient condition for the occurrence of superdiffusion on duplex networks by applying the generating functionology from combinatorial mathematics. Our result indicates that, with fixed values of intralayer diffusion constants, superdiffusion emerges from a certain combination of different network topologies, which provides a topological mechanism to regulate the whole diffusion process. On a more general ground, we provide two interlayer linking strategies to expand the applicability of the aforementioned topological mechanism on real-world networks, and construct a class of specific duplex networks on which superdiffusion occurs. We further verify that diffusion with negative interlayer correlation is faster than that with positive correlation from a typical duplex structure. Given the ubiquity of diffusion in the real world, our results constitute a significant step toward a better understanding of superdiffusion processes on multiplex networks.},

While an individual&#39;s new private opinion is shaped by his or her private opinion, the expressed opinions of his or her neighbors, and attachment to an existing prejudice, his or her expressed opinion is instead a tradeoff between his or her true private opinion and a “public opinion,” representing the current norm or standard opinion from the perspective of the individual. We show that the expressed and private opinions of all individuals converge to the same value exponentially fast when no individual holds an existing prejudice, with the lower bound on the convergence speed based on a general assumption on the network topology. If there are individuals who hold an existing prejudice, then the final opinions of every individual lie between the minimum and maximum values of those constant prejudices.

By introducing the second-order differential inequality, we first show that this model exhibits frequency synchronization for any initial data if the amplitude of force is large and the inertia is small. In case that the amplitude of force is not large, we prove that this model still can drive frequency synchronization provided that the coupling strength is large and the initial configuration is confined to a sector. Comparison studies with existing synchronization conditions are made to indicate that these proposed criteria seem to be less conservative.

It is noted that the adaptive control is adopted to avoid the use of the global information, i.e., the number of agents in the MAS, the eigenvalues of Laplace matrix, etc. Since the signed digraph is considered, the Laplace matrix is asymmetric, which greatly increases the design difficulty of adaptive event-triggered strategy and is challenging. To solve this problem, innovative compound triggering conditions are designed, under which neighbors not only communicate intermittently, but also control protocols are updated discontinuously only at their own triggering instants.

Instead of sophisticatedly tuning the cost parameters and other hyperparameters for safe and reliable behavior in the optimal control framework, the safety of each single-task solution is guaranteed using the control barrier functions (CBFs) for high relative degree stochastic systems, which constrains the system state within a known safe operation region where it originates from. Linearity of CBF constraints in control ensures the feasibility of safe control action composition.

Benefiting from the brand-new comprehending of a classical distributed unconstrained optimization algorithm, the novel implicit tracking approach is proposed to track the violation distributedly, which leads to the birth of the i mplicit tracking-based d istribut e d a ugmented primal-dual gradient dynamics (IDEA). A projected variant of IDEA, i.e., Proj-IDEA, is further designed to deal with the general case where local constrained sets exist. With the aid of the Lyapunov stability theory, the convergences of IDEA and Pro-IDEA over undigraphs and digraphs are analyzed respectively. As far as we know, Proj-IDEA is the first constant step-size distributed algorithm which can solve the studied problem without the need of the strict convexity of local cost functions. Besides, if local cost functions are strongly convex and smooth, IDEA can achieve exponential convergence with a weaker condition about the coupled constraint.

First, a threshold attack detection scheme based on the difference between predicted and transmission data is proposed. Then, an attack compensation module is designed, which can be changed according to different attack strategies of the attacker, and can realize resilient control of FDI attacks on systems with different complexity and different attack intensities. Subsequently, a model-free adaptive controller based on partial form dynamic linearization is designed for the reconstructed system after attack compensation, which can indirectly realize the tracking control task of the original system. Theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm shows that the tracking error is ultimately bounded.

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a parallelized primal-dual algorithm for solving constrained convex optimization problems. The algorithm is “block-based,” in which vectors of primal and dual variables are partitioned into blocks, each of which is updated only by a single processor. We consider four behaviors that could be asynchronous: 1) updates to primal variables; 2) updates to dual variables; 3) communications of primal variables; and 4) communications of dual variables. We show that any amount of asynchrony in the communications of dual variables can preclude convergence, though the other forms of asynchrony are permitted. A first-order primal-dual update law is then developed and shown to be robust to these other forms of asynchrony. We next derive convergence rates to an approximate Lagrangian saddle point in terms of the operations agents execute, without specifying any timing or pattern with which they must be executed. The distance between the approximate solution we obtain and the exact solution is explicitly bounded. Convergence rates include an “asynchrony penalty” that we quantify and present ways to mitigate. Numerical results illustrate these developments.},

  abstract     = {We consider reinforcement learning (RL) in Markov decision processes in which an agent repeatedly interacts with an environment that is modeled by a controlled Markov process. At each time step &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$t$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , it earns a reward and also incurs a cost vector consisting of &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$M$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; costs. We design model-based RL algorithms that maximize the cumulative reward earned over a time horizon of &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$T$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; time steps while simultaneously ensuring that the average values of the &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$M$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; cost expenditures are bounded by agent-specified thresholds &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$c^{\text{ub}}_{i},i=1,2,\ldots,M$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; . The consideration of the cumulative cost expenditures departs from the existing literature, in that the agent now additionally needs to balance the cost expenses in an online manner while simultaneously performing the exploration–exploitation tradeoff that is typically encountered in RL tasks. This is challenging since the dual objectives of exploration and exploitation necessarily require the agent to expend resources. In order to measure the performance of an RL algorithm that satisfies the average cost constraints, we define an &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$M+1$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; dimensional regret vector that is composed of its reward regret, and &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$M$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; cost regrets. The reward regret measures the suboptimality in the cumulative reward while the &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$i$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; th component of the cost regret vector is the difference between its &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$i$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; th cumulative cost expense and the expected cost expenditures &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$Tc^{\text{ub}}_{i}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; . We prove that the expected value of the regret vector is upper-bounded as &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\tilde{O}(T^{2\slash 3})$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , where &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$T$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is the time horizon, and &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\tilde{O}(\cdot)$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; hides factors that are logarithmic in &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$T$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; . We further show how to reduce the regret of a desired subset of the &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$M$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; costs, at the expense of increasing the regrets of rewards and the remaining costs. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the only work that considers nonepisodic RL under average cost constraints and derives algorithms that can tune the regret vector according to the agent&#39;s requirements on its cost regrets.},

We first characterize the condition on agents dynamics such that agents states can be uniquely solved from the attacked measurements of agents outputs. This condition implies that the conclusion in [1] that the attack signal and agents states can be uniquely reconstructed by adding longer time-windowed measurements is incomplete. Based on this condition, when the communication graph of agents is undirected, we propose two different distributed secure state estimators by reformulating the state reconstruction as optimization problems. The first estimator does not need agents to exchange with others their dynamics information, which is used by the second, but requires updating and exchanging more variables. Both estimators are much simpler and easier to understand than that proposed in [1]. Moreover, when the communication graph is directed and strongly connected, we also proposed two distributed state estimators, adjusted from the estimators for undirected graphs. Both of them require no global information of communication graphs but the network size. At last, we verify all the theoretical results with simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose a compositional data-driven approach for the formal estimation of collision risks for autonomous vehicles (AVs) with black-box dynamics while acting in a stochastic multi-agent framework. The proposed approach is based on the construction of sub-barrier certificates for each stochastic agent via a set of data collected from its trajectories while providing an a priori guaranteed confidence on the data-driven estimation. In our proposed setting, we first cast the original collision risk problem for each agent as a robust optimization program (ROP). Solving the acquired ROP is not tractable due to an unknown model that appears in one of its constraints. To tackle this difficulty, we collect finite numbers of data from trajectories of each agent and provide a scenario optimization program (SOP) corresponding to the original ROP. We then establish a probabilistic bridge between the optimal value of SOP and that of ROP, and accordingly, we formally construct a sub-barrier certificate for each unknown agent based on the number of data and a required level of confidence. We then propose a compositional technique based on small-gain reasoning to quantify the collision risk for multi-agent AVs with some desirable confidence based on sub-barrier certificates of individual agents constructed from data. For the case that the proposed compositionality conditions are not satisfied, we provide a relaxed version of compositional results without requiring any compositionality conditions but at the cost of providing a potentially conservative collision risk. Eventually, we also present our approaches for non-stochastic multi-agent AVs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed results by applying them to a vehicle platooning consisting of 100 vehicles with 1 leader and 99 followers. We formally estimate the collision risk for the whole network by collecting sampled data from trajectories of each agent.},

The presented framework utilizes the properties of positive systems and exponential cone programming to provide scalable algorithms for combined surveillance and intervention problems. We demonstrate via epidemic and wildfire examples how the method can incorporate practically relevant parameters and scenarios such as a vaccination strategy for epidemics and the effect of vegetation and outbreak rate on a wildfire.

  abstract     = {This article studies the resilient distributed state estimation over the sensor networks under measurement attacks, which make the measurements of variant subsets of sensors aberrant at different time instants. For this problem, while most of the existing works focus on the static target states that do not change over time, we investigate the estimation for the dynamic ones, which evolve according to general linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. To achieve the resilient distributed state estimation for the general LTI systems under the measurement attacks, we propose a dynamic-target regulative gain estimation (DTRGE) algorithm, in which an attack detector, a regulative gain matrix, and an adaptive gain are designed. The detector helps agents monitor the measurement anomalies, and once the attacks are detected, the adaptive gain can counteract the deviation of the estimates induced by them. The regulative gain matrix restrains the negative effects on the convergence of the estimates caused by the system matrix of the target LTI system, especially the unstable one. We demonstrate that all the sensors can recover the target state by running the DTRGE algorithm, if the topology and the observability of the sensor network satisfy certain conditions. Moreover, we further apply the DTRGE algorithm to the sensor networks with switching topologies, and demonstrate that the estimation task can also be completed by these sensors. Finally, simulation and experiment results are given to illustrate the performance of the DTRGE algorithm.},

In this work, we propose an adaptive control strategy that offers strong guarantees in both the mitigation and localization of line failures. Specifically, we leverage the properties of network bridge-block decomposition and a frequency regulation method called the unified control . If the balancing areas over which the unified control operates coincide with the bridge-blocks of the network, the proposed strategy drives the postcontingency system to a steady state where the impact of initial line outages is localized within the areas where they occurred whenever possible, stopping the cascading process. When the initial line outages cannot be localized, the proposed control strategy provides a configurable design that progressively involves and coordinates more balancing areas. We compare the proposed control strategy with the classical automatic generation control (AGC) on the IEEE 118-bus and 2736-bus test networks. Simulation results show that our strategy greatly improves overall reliability in terms of the &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$N-k$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; security standard, and localizes the impact of initial failures in the majority of the simulated contingencies.

  abstract     = {In this article, we study a target–attacker–defender (TAD) differential game involving one attacker, one target, and multiple defenders. We consider two variations where (a) the attacker and the target have unlimited observation range and the defenders are visibility constrained (b) only the attacker has unlimited observation range and the remaining players are visibility constrained. We model the players&#39; interactions as a dynamic game with asymmetric information. Here, the visibility constraints of the players induce a visibility network, which encapsulates the visibility information during the evolution of the game. Based on this observation, we introduce network adapted feedback or implementable strategies for visibility constrained players. Using the inverse game theory approach, we obtain network adapted feedback Nash equilibrium strategies. We introduce a consistency criterion for selecting a subset (or refinement) of network adapted feedback Nash strategies, and provide an optimization-based approach for computing them. Finally, we illustrate our results with numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the stabilization problem is investigated for a class of networked control systems with random clock offsets and consecutive packet dropouts. Different from the existing literature, the consecutive packet dropouts occurring in communication networks are subject to clock offsets, and the clock offsets between the sensor and the controller are described by a random variable with a certain probability distribution. First, we construct a closed-loop discrete-time stochastic system by considering the random clock offsets and the consecutive packet dropouts in a unified framework. To render the discrete-time system suitable for analysis, an equivalent yet tractable stochastic augmented model is then established, where the system matrix is characterized by high nonlinearity and dual randomness, which poses substantial difficulties for the expectation operation in the controller design process. In order to deal with the difficulties, the law of total expectation, confluent Vandermonde matrix, and Kronecker product operation are introduced and then a stability condition in the form of linear matrix inequality is obtained. Based on this, a desired controller is designed, such that the closed-loop stochastic system is stochastically stable. Finally, a numerical example with two cases and an example using batch reactor are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design approach.},

Most certification methods in literature are designed for adversarial or worst-case inputs, but researchers have recently shown a need for methods that consider random input noise. In this article, we examine the setting where inputs are subject to random noise coming from an arbitrary probability distribution. We propose a robustness certification method that lower-bounds the probability that network outputs are safe. This bound is cast as a chance-constrained optimization problem, which is then reformulated using input–output samples to make the optimization constraints tractable. We develop sufficient conditions for the resulting optimization to be convex, as well as on the number of samples needed to make the robustness bound hold with overwhelming probability. Case studies on synthetic, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 networks experimentally demonstrate that this method is able to certify robustness against various input noise regimes over larger uncertainty regions than prior state-of-the-art techniques.},

In the literature, pinning control has often emerged as the tool of choice to achieve this task. Only recently, though, has the problem of controlling only a fraction of the network nodes been tackled. Here, we consider the case in which, due to the disturbing influence of an external node, which we identify as an opponent , the network nodes cannot asymptotically converge to the pinner&#39;s trajectory, and only a bounded convergence can be achieved. We derive analytic conditions guaranteeing that all the nodes in a given strongly connected component of the network achieve bounded convergence to the trajectory of the pinner, and provide an estimate of the convergence bound. Finally, we apply our results to an opinion dynamics scenario, showing that a pinned node selection strategy grounded on our theoretical results is effective in steering the opinions of the majority of the network nodes toward that of the pinner.},

  abstract     = {Fractional-order dynamical networks are increasingly being used to model and describe processes demonstrating long-term memory or complex interlaced dependencies among the spatial and temporal components of a wide variety of dynamical networks. Notable examples include networked control systems or neurophysiological networks which are created using electroencephalographic (EEG) or blood-oxygen-level-dependent data. As a result, the estimation of the states of fractional-order dynamical networks poses an important problem. To this effect, this article addresses the problem of minimum-energy state estimation for discrete-time fractional-order dynamical networks, where the state and output equations are affected by an additive noise that is considered to be deterministic, bounded, and unknown. Specifically, we derive the corresponding estimator and show that the resulting estimation error is exponentially input-to-state stable with respect to the disturbances and to a signal that is decreasing with the increase of the accuracy of the adopted approximation model. An illustrative example shows the effectiveness of the proposed method on real-world neurophysiological networks. Our results may significantly contribute to the development of novel neurotechnologies, particularly in the development of state estimation paradigms for neural signals such as EEG, which are often noisy signals known to be affected by artifacts not having any particular stochastic characterization.},

We propose a new family of parametric functions to model the pairwise interactions, which allows for the mean-field macroscopic system of integro-differential equations to be efficiently solved as an augmented system of partial differential equations. Finally, we incorporate the augmented system in an iterative optimization scheme to learn the dynamics of the interacting agents from observations of the swarm&#39;s density evolution over time.

In this article, we introduce a communication-aware, computation task-scheduling problem for multirobot systems and propose an integer linear program (ILP) that optimizes the allocation of computational tasks across a network of heterogeneous robots, accounting for the networked robots&#39; computational capabilities and for available (and possibly time-varying) communication links. We consider scheduling of a set of interdependent required and optional tasks modeled by a dependency graph. We present a consensus-backed scheduling architecture for shared-world, distributed systems. We validate the ILP formulation and the distributed implementation in different computation platforms and in simulated scenarios with a bias toward lunar or planetary exploration scenarios. Our results show that the proposed implementation can optimize schedules to allow a three-fold increase in the amount of rewarding tasks performed (e.g., science measurements) compared to an analogous system with no computational load sharing.},

We show that only for some specific affine combination of the immediate and outdated feedback, the control effort of the agents does not go beyond that of the delay-free algorithm. In addition, we demonstrate that using outdated feedback does not increase the steady-state tracking error of the average consensus algorithm.

A set of necessary and sufficient conditions can be directly obtained by extending the Kalman rank test for output controllability. However, the verification of these conditions is computationally heavy due to their combinatorial nature. Therefore, we derive noncombinatorial conditions for output sparse controllability that can be verified with polynomial time complexity. Our results also provide bounds on the minimum sparsity level required to ensure output controllability of the system. This additional insight is useful for designing sparse control input that drives the system to any desired output.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the recursion corresponding to the measurement outcomes for open quantum networks under sequential measurements. Open quantum networks are networked quantum subsystems (e.g., qubits) with the state evolutions described by a continuous Lindblad master equation. When measurements are performed sequentially along such continuous dynamics, the quantum network states undergo probabilistic jumps and the corresponding measurement outcomes can be described by a vector of probabilistic Boolean variables. The induced recursion of the Boolean vectors forms a probabilistic Boolean network. First of all, we show that the state transition of the induced Boolean network can be explicitly represented through a real version of the master equation. Next, when the open quantum dynamics are relaxing in the sense that they possess a unique equilibrium as a global attractor, structural properties including absorbing states, reducibility, and periodicity for the induced Boolean network are direct consequences of this relaxing property. Particularly, we show that generically, relaxing quantum dynamics leads to irreducible and aperiodic chains for the measurement outcomes. Finally, we show that for quantum consensus networks, which are a type of nonrelaxing open quantum network dynamics, the communication classes of the measurement-induced Boolean networks are encoded in the quantum Laplacian of the underlying interaction graph},

A new form of the Laplacian matrix involving the connection between agents is constructed that contains three parts, the weights between the agents from the oscillatory virtual leaders to the robot followers and the weights from the same subgroup and from different subgroups. The elements of each part have their own unique definition according to their characteristics. Moreover, a coordinate transformation is conducted based on such Laplacian matrix for stability analysis of controlled systems.

The sensors’ goal is to send the most informative set of measurements so that the estimate is as accurate as possible. This problem is formulated as a submodular maximization problem, for which there exists a well-studied greedy algorithm, where each sensor sequentially chooses a set of measurements from its own local set and communicates its decision to the future sensors in the sequence. In this work, sensors can additionally share measurements with one another, in order to augment the decision set of each sensor. We explore how this increase in communication can be exploited to improve the results of the nominal greedy algorithm.

DoS attacks launched by network layer attackers will affect the performance of switched systems in the physical layer, so it is necessary to deploy a defender to deal with it. Taking account of the properties of each switched subsystem and the characteristics of the attacker group composed of &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; DoS attackers, cost functions of the defender and &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; attackers are first constructed. Next, the Stackelberg game is used to analyze the game between the defender and attacker group, and the strategy sets of both sides are given by Stackelberg Equilibrium. In addition, for switched systems of the physical layer, the switching times and performance index are modeled as two objectives to be optimized. Based on the equilibrium condition of the network layer, the control input of switched systems is designed. Then, an encoding and decoding strategy of the switching signal is proposed to ensure that the multiobjective artificial bee colony (MOABC) algorithm can be applied to the multiobjective optimization problem of switched systems. Furthermore, the Pareto optimal solution set of switching signals is obtained by using the MOABC algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness of the strategy proposed in this article is verified through the networked continuous stirred tank reactor and a numerical simulation.},

Given an estimator, we utilize a discretization-free approach to synthesize controllers ensuring safety specifications over finite-time horizons. The proposed framework is based on a notion of so-called local control barrier functions computed for subsystems in two different ways. In the first scheme, no prior knowledge of estimation accuracy is needed. The second framework utilizes a probability bound on the estimation accuracy using a notion of so-called stochastic simulation functions . In both proposed schemes, we derive sufficient small-gain-type conditions in order to compositionally construct control barrier functions for interconnected POMDPs using local barrier functions computed for subsystems. The constructed control barrier functions for the overall networks enable us to compute lower bounds on the probabilities that the interconnected POMDPs avoid certain unsafe regions in finite-time horizons. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches by applying them to an adaptive cruise control problem.},

We then propose a distributed linearized ADMM (L-ADMM) algorithm, derived from the modified ADMM algorithm, by linearizing the local cost function at each iteration. We show that the L-ADMM algorithm has the same convergence properties as the modified ADMM algorithm under the same conditions.

  abstract     = {The problem of localizing a set of nodes from relative pairwise measurements appears in different fields, such as computer vision, sensor networks, and robotics. In practice, the measurements might be contaminated by noise and outliers that lead to erroneous localization. Previous work has empirically shown that robust algorithms can, in some situations, almost completely cancel the effect of outliers. However, there is a theoretical gap in answering the following question: Under what conditions on the number, magnitude, and arrangement of the outlier measurements can we guarantee that a robust algorithm will recover the ground truth locations from the relative measurements alone? We denote this concept as verifiability , and answer the question for the case of an &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\ell _{1}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -norm robust optimization formulation, with translation measurements that are affected only by large-magnitude outliers and no small-magnitude noise. We prove that verifiability depends only on the topology of the graph, the location of the edges affected by the outliers, and the sign of the outliers, while it is independent of the ( a priori unknown) true location of the nodes, and the magnitude of the outliers. We present an algorithm based on the dual simplex algorithm that checks the verifiability of a problem, and, if not verifiable, completely characterizes the space of equivalent solutions that are consistent with the given pairwise measurements. Our theory and algorithms can be used to compute the a priori probability of recovering a solution congruent or equivalent to the ground truth, without having access to the true locations.},

More specifically, we consider a setting where nodes in the network can be curious, while certain nodes in the network want to ensure that their initial states cannot be inferred exactly by these curious nodes. Curious nodes are not malicious, i.e., they try to identify the initial states of other nodes based on the data they receive during their operation (and some of them might even collude) but do not interfere in the computation in any other way. Each node in the network (including curious nodes) can opt to execute a privacy-preserving algorithm (so as not to reveal the initial state it contributes to the average calculation) or its underlying (plain) average consensus algorithm (if privacy is not a concern). We propose two privacy-preserving event-triggered quantized average consensus algorithms. Under certain topological conditions, both the proposed algorithms allow the nodes that adopt privacy-preserving protocols to preserve their privacy and at the same time to obtain, after a finite number of steps, the exact average of the initial states while processing and transmitting quantized information. We also present illustrative examples and comparisons of our algorithms against other algorithms in the existing literature and discuss a motivating application in which smart meters in a smart grid collect real-time demands in a privacy-preserving manner.},

The sensor network deployed to the periodic system is taken into account for the actual needs of monitoring or estimation. A dynamic event-triggering mechanism is designed to reduce the unnecessary data transmission over the wireless network from the sensor to the filter as well as between each filter. Distributed peak-to-peak filters with periodic time-varying parameters are designed under the event-triggering mechanism to estimate the networked continuous-time periodic systems with the bounded and local differentiable disturbance. Then, a periodic piecewise filtering error system is modeled as an impulsive periodic piecewise system, for which sufficient conditions of a guaranteed peak-to-peak performance are proposed. The gains of the filters are obtained by the method of convex linearization. The validity of the proposed results is demonstrated by a pendulum tracking system.},

Thus, the regret scales linearly with the number of subsystems. We present numerical experiments to illustrate the salient features of the proposed algorithm.},
